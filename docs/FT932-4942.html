			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Management: Seduced by the customer cult The cult of the customer has become the mantra of today's business gurus. Their chant and their cant is: 'If we don't look after our customers, then someone else will.' The faithful respond antiphonally: 'We must always remember that our customers pay our salaries.' Unfortunately, in common with all mantras, this one's strength lies more in its repetition than in its inherent truth. While it is usually true that successful businesses look after their customers, it is not true that all businesses which look after their customers are successful. Laker Airways looked after its customers with enthusiasm, but went the way of all flesh nonetheless. A decade ago, the chant was of profit and profitability. Cost centres became profit centres. The high priests were the grey men of the bottom line - the auditors who devoted themselves to beating their rewards into profit shares and their careers into catching crooks. A decade earlier the gospel was of job enrichment and job satisfaction. The belief was that the contented worker would become the affluent worker. All of these gospels had a kernel of truth but, to correct what they thought were earlier imbalances, the business gurus successively created new imbalances. Gurus and consultants often maintain that what has gone before is fashion, but what they bring is truth. They usually succeed in creating little more than a new fashion. All businesses will fail in the long term unless they pay adequate attention to the legitimate requirements of their three principal stakeholders - their shareholders, staff and customers. The shareholders own the business, have invested in it and are concerned that it should be profitable. In this way, the business will produce for them an adequate return on investment, by monitoring and managing their costs and their revenues. The staff serve the customers and are stewards of the company's resources. The quality of a company's employees is a critical factor in creating business success. Their morale is the indicator of their commitment. But morale is a delicate plant which dies in some climates, thrives in others and needs constant attention. Its condition needs to be monitored constantly but it is unclear who should carry out the monitoring and how it should be done. Personnel departments in most businesses need to be involved but they usually fail to provide adequate data to support decision-making about personnel matters. They frequently fail to provide insight into the factors which need to be monitored such as the staff's perception of how they are treated and how that treatment is changing over time. Ultimately, customers provide profits for the shareholders and salaries for the staff. For too long customers were neglected, abused or forgotten. Their place in determining the success of businesses has now been restored but it would be inappropriate to concentrate on their needs at the expense of others. Regular monitoring of customers' feelings about the company's products or services can be carried out by market researchers but it is vital to ensure that the data are directed towards decisions which need to be taken, rather than meandering into empty description. For 2000 years, the Christian church has been teaching the difficult concept that God is a trinity - three in one. If there is a God of business, he or she also has three manifestations: the shareholders, the customers and the staff. They are different but equal and all demand similar attention. Those who emphasise the worship of any one over the others are today's false prophets. Adrian Furnham is head of the business psychology unit at University College London.

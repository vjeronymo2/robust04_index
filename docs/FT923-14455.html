			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (14) - A hectic sporting calendar / The emirate hosts many international events Dubai is probably the only place in the Gulf where the Sporting Life and the Racing Post are widely available, writes Anne Counsell. Jostling for shelf space alongside a wide range of sports magazines, the extent of interest in the subject is evident. Sport pervades almost all aspects of life in the emirate; many apartments come with swimming pools, squash or tennis courts while watersports and other facilities abound. There are now so many tennis courts and pools that even the semi-government agency which monitors sports facilities is unable to give precise numbers or keep track of all the new developments. A lack of fitness does not exclude anyone from the sporting scene - a satellite television channel broadcasts all international sports events and many pubs and restaurants show live sports coverage. The sporting calender is jam-packed: at almost any time of the year, Dubai is likely to be hosting an international sports event, drawing the world's top players. Even at the height of the Gulf crisis in November 1990, snooker stars nudged Saddam Hussein out of the headlines when they contested the Pounds 200,000 Dubai Duty-Free Snooker Classic. Shortly after came the Dubai Sevens, claimed to be the biggest international rugby sevens tournament in the world. Each December, the desert dust rises as the Dubai International Rally gets underway, while the waters of the Gulf swirl to the Dubai Offshore Powerboat Race and the Emirates Powerboat Race. Sea and watersports are important to the maritime emirate which has recently revived the traditional dhow sailing race, now held each May. Each entrant builds a boat - a replica of those once used for coastal trading, pearling and fishing - at a cost of up to Dh90,000. Equestrian events also feature prominently; hardly suprising considering the Maktoum's keen and extensive racing interests. The new racing track and the Dubai Horse Show and polo events regularly draw top international riders. Every imaginable sport is catered for and catalogued on the sporting calendar. From ice skating and sand ski-ing to karate and chess, there is a venue and a coveted trophy. The competitive spirit is embodied in Dubai which fiercely defends its crown as sports capital of the Middle East. Where else but Dubai would host the annual Highland Games with sporrans, the skirl of bagpipes and cabers being tossed in the desert.</p>

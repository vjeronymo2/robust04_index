			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: York Waterworks achieves Pounds 2.09m York Waterworks announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.09m for the year to March 31 compared with Pounds 2.11m for the previous 15 months. Turnover amounted to Pounds 6.88m (Pounds 7.59m) and the pre-tax result was after net interest payable of Pounds 433,000 (Pounds 642,000). A final dividend of 5.7p is recommended for an 8.5p total (8.75p for 15 months) payable from earnings per share of 20.7p (19.8p). The company agreed to the director general's request late last year to voluntarily reduce the K factor it would apply to its charges in 1992-93. Accordingly the increase for the year is 15 per cent less than the maximum permitted.</p>

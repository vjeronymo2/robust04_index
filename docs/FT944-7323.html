			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Nadir 'strikes deal to regain seized hotels' Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former chairman of Polly Peck International, was yesterday reported to have struck a deal with the government of northern Cyprus to regain control of two hotels seized this week. However, administrators to PPI, which collapsed in 1990, said that the government-appointed sequestrators were still in the hotels and that the deal had divided the coalition government of Mr Hakki Atun, the prime minister. Sources in northern Cyprus indicated that the agreement had prompted one government official to resign in protest and that the first instalment in an agreed tax repayment scheme had been in the form of a post-dated cheque. A finance ministry official in Nicosia said: 'Nadir made a first payment of his tax arrears yesterday. The amount is not disclosed. The government has agreed to a payment plan he proposed.' The official added: 'The cabinet discussed the situation at a meeting on Wednesday. Asil Nadir was later summoned by prime minister Hakki Atun.' The prime minister was quoted by the Turkish Cypriot news agency TAK as saying: 'We have been given assurances that remaining instalments will be duly paid and we are happy to have solved this problem.' Mr Chris Barlow, a partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand and lead administrator for PPI, yesterday said: 'According to our information obtained this afternoon the sequestrators are still in the hotels and we have heard that other government ministers are not agreeing with this proposal. 'We are always keen to meet the government and we have made it clear that if they assist us in getting possession of the hotels we will deal with the issue of outstanding tax.' Mr Nadir's UK lawyer Mr Peter Krivinskas said that his client had been two months in arrears on a repayment scheme agreed last year. 'He is back in control.' He added: 'I assume the payment was in cash. It could have been a post-dated cheque.' Since October 1990 the administrators have been denied access to Polly Peck assets in north Cyprus because of a series of injunctions and court orders obtained by Mr Nadir. Government tax officers had seized the revenues of Mr Nadir's Jasmine Court and Palm Beach hotels on Tuesday, to recover Dollars 1.5m in back taxes and social security payments owed by a PPI subsidiary. Total tax debts for companies under his control are thought to be in excess of Dollars 10m. Mr Nadir fled from Britain to northern Cyprus in May last year while facing charges of false accounting and theft involving Pounds 34m.</p>

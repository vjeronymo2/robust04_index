			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Murdoch plans Dollars 1bn debt offering NEWS CORPORATION plans to raise about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) in long-term public debt in the next few months, write Ray Snoddy in London and Kevin Brown in Sydney. The decision, a further step in the rehabilitation of the world's third largest media company, is designed to replace short-term bank loans. Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive, told the Financial Times during an interview in Los Angeles that he planned to sell in the medium term its 50 per cent holdings in Ansett Transport Industries (Ansett) which operates one of Australia's two domestic airlines and Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services (AWAS), an aircraft leasing company. He said the shares 'have been a source of profit when we needed it, but they do not fit a media company'. That is the first confirmation of speculation that News Corp's long-term strategy excludes continued investment in the troubled Australian aviation businesses. News Corp said last month Mr Murdoch would step down as joint chairman of Ansett. However, News Corp has previously denied it planned to sell its stakes in Ansett or AWAS. Both companies are co-owned with TNT, the Australian transport group. Mr Murdoch said three major merchant banks had asked to raise the new long-term debt. 'We'd have to negotiate the rate, but they say Dollars 1bn to replace bank debt is no problem,' said Mr Murdoch. Mr Murdoch said the long-term finance plan was part of a strategy to escape restrictions by a consortium of banks in return for rolling over debt of more than Dollars 7bn. 'Right now, anything over Dollars 50m, I have to go and get permission from the banks. We certainly plan to be out of that box in the next several months,' Mr Murdoch said. He said he hoped to win investment rating from the financial community for the first time. Mr Murdoch stressed that he intended to see the company through the strains of airline de-regulation in Australia. 'This may take two or three years. I would see eventually a third partner, a major international airline coming in at some stage and then we might go out,' Mr Murdoch said. He added that the same applied to Ansett Worldwide, the airline leasing business. Ansett has been in financial difficulties since the deregulation of Australian domestic aviation in October 1990.

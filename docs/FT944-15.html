			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Sport: The best of both worlds - Skiing And now . . . the 'Low Fat' ski. For the last three days I have enjoyed some of the best powder skiing in my life without a helicopter in sight. We have been hurtling down Jackson Hole's legendary Hobacks with such control that the casual observer might think we had become expert powder skiers. Yet on-piste our skis have performed equally well. But it is not us who are improving. It is our skis. We were trying out the latest skiing fad - the Volkl 'Snow Ranger' a compromise between a 'fat' ski - designed for use off-piste - and a conventional ski. Sometimes, when manufacturers try to achieve the best of both worlds they end up with the the worst of both. But these skis really work both on and off piste, and in Jackson Hole, where the powder skier reigns supreme, they are selling as fast. The Snow Rangers are the latest in a bewildering assortment of skis on the market this winter which have been spawned by the development of the 'fat' ski. First there was a rush by ski manufacturers to build their own version of the Atomic Powder Plus - good in powder but cumbersome on piste. Now Atomic itself has helped pioneer the compromise between 'fat' and 'thin' with its Heli Guide model. But in Jackson it is the Snow Ranger which has captured the hearts and feet of skiers. These skis give you supreme control and confidence both on and off piste, changing your concept about your own abilities and neutralising mistakes which on ordinary skis would lead to a fall. But as Dave Wheeler, our guide in Jackson, pointed out, you may have to be a reasonably good skier in the first place to get the best out of them. Beginners are not necessarily going to find 'low fat' skis are the answer to their prayers: you need to feed some degree of skill into them to bring out their best qualities. Meanwhile, another new shape of ski - wide shovel and a narrow waist - is at the centre of a separate 'revolution' in skiing. And again, the development of the 'fat' ski was responsible. Says Chris Stagg, a vice president at Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico, said: 'What's really happened is that when Atomic came up with the Powder Plus Fat ski, it broke the mould of what the traditional ski should look like and the ski designers said: 'If we can have skis this shape, what other shapes can we come up with?'' Elan came up with the 'S' ski. Stagg and others are very excited about its potential. Alberto Tomba had already revolutionised skiing wisdom with his two-footed race technique - and now here are the skis to take this into the recreational skiers' domain. 'With these skis you can forget about putting most of your weight on the outside ski,' enthuses Stagg. 'You just set the S ski on its edge and it will turn by itself. It wants to turn. 'This ski could change the way we think shout skiing. But you have to ski it with your legs even further apart than normal and keep both skis in contact with the snow. Skiing with your legs bolted together will be a no-no]' Oh well, time to learn to ski yet again. What happened to all those days of practising racing step turns, jet turns, counter-rotation, bending the knees rather than the ankles, riding the outside ski, and leaning forward instead of 'skiing tall'?</p>

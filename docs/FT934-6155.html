			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Hosokawa in bid to settle coalition rifts Japan's prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa yesterday met leaders of the seven parties in his fragile coalition, in an attempt to make progress on the most divisive tasks facing the government. The meeting follows a warning from senior members of the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, that they will walk out if the government drops the ban on rice imports. The SDP has threatened to defect on other issues before, risking the collapse of the coalition, but has each time compromised. This time, it will be harder for the rest of the coalition to satisfy the SDP on rice, because it is holding to an agreement between coalition members in July, when the government was formed, to oppose rice market liberalisation. Mr Hosokawa told the SDP at a meeting earlier this week that he cannot negotiate on rice 'if my hands are tied,' SDP officials said. Pressure on the coalition to settle its internal difference on rice is increasing with the approach of the December 15 deadline for concluding the Gatt world trade liberalisation talks. An agriculture ministry draft, leaked to the Japanese press, is said to propose a period of limited market opening until 1991, to be followed by negotiations to allow imports subject to tariffs. The SDP remains out of line with the rest of the coalition on most of the main issues. On rice and on political reform, it is in curious company with the right wing of the opposition LDP. The LDP was yesterday delaying the start of a debate on four political reform bills in the upper house, on which many Socialists also have reservations. This increases the likelihood that Mr Hosokawa will have to prolong the current parliamentary session beyond its normal closure on December 15, to meet his deadline of passing the bills by the end of the year. Coalition leaders appear to be making progress, however, towards settling the main difference over tax reform with the SDP. The socialists opposed initial plans for an income tax cut, to be automatically followed by a consumption tax rise, on the grounds this would hit the less well-off. The coalition is understood to be in the final phase of preparing plans for a tax cut to be financed by the issue of treasury bonds, to be followed by a possible rise in consumption tax at an unspecified later date. Department store sales fell 6.5 per cent year-on-year in October, for the 20th month running, according to the Japan Department Stores' Association. This is slightly better than the previous month's 6.7 per cent fall, but November sales are expected to be poor.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Raising its glass to a new niche - Holsten has spent three years on a new beer Holsten, the German brewer, has launched its first new beer for 40 years in the UK premium-packaged lager market - a market it helped to create and now leads. The Hamburg-based brewer, with UK sales of 160m bottles and cans of Holsten Pils a year, aims to consolidate a position it has been building since the 1950s when its beer was marketed as a drink suitable for diabetics. Competition has been growing rapidly. Imported lager brands were entering the market at a rate of one every 19 days during the peak period 18 months ago, and consumers have about 400 to choose from, says Carol Fisher, UK marketing director. Consumer familiarity with Holsten's established product made it vulnerable to newcomers in the more fashionable bars and restaurants. Holsten Bier, the new brand, is brewed in Germany and is targeted at this niche in the market. Three years of research have gone into preparing the product, from its taste to the acid-etched logo on the bottle. Holsten's move reflects an immediate concern to secure its place in a market that offers profit margins five times greater than those available in Germany. It also marks another tactical advance in a long-running export drive that has enabled the brewer to double sales to 7.85m hectolitres (172.68m gallons) and turnover to DM989m (Pounds 394m) in the past five years. The German beer market is a difficult place in which to grow. Its consumers have the biggest thirst in Europe, but over the past few years they have reached their limit at a yearly 144 litres a head. That demand is being met by 1,300 brewers catering for mainly localised tastes with more than 5,000 brands. Holsten's response has been to mount a three-pronged attack on its domestic market. It is promoting its pilsener as a national brand, supporting it with television advertising, and sponsorship of soccer teams, tennis tournaments, horse-racing, cultural events and environmental projects. The Holsten brand has been extended to alcohol-free and light beers; and the national portfolio has also been enlarged to include Foster's lager, brewed under licence, and specialities such as Duckstein ale and Franziskaner white beer, which is distributed for a Munich brewer. At the same time, the company is strengthening its base in northern Germany and pushing out the market boundaries of its regional brands. This process was given a fillip by the razing of the Berlin Wall and reunification. In 1991 Holsten bought the Lubz brewery in Mecklenburg, and with it a brand of pils that dominates a sales territory stretching from the Baltic to Berlin. Last year, Holsten acquired a brewery in Dresden that, like the company's plant in Brunswick, produced a brand named Feldschlossen. Brewed to one recipe, the brand is now one of the country's largest with sales of 1.1m hectolitres across Saxony. But until these successes took Holsten's share of the German market to about 5 per cent, expansion at home was difficult and slow. Paul von Ostman, Holsten's international director, says the brewer's early decision to seek growth in overseas markets - it shipped its first beer to the UK from Hamburg in the late 1890s - was one of its shrewdest moves. Of Holsten's total German production of 7m hectolitres last year, 18 per cent was exported - roughly 3 1/2 times the percentage for the industry as a whole - to more than 70 countries. Another 900,000 hectolitres are brewed under licence in the UK, Hungary, Nigeria, Namibia and China, which supplies the Hong Kong market. That means that 25 per cent of the company's beer - and 40 per cent of the Holsten brand - is sold outside Germany. The company continues to push strongly for further international growth. In Europe, Italy was targeted last year, and production will be licensed in Poland this year. A barter agreement has even gained entry to Vietnam. The importer is paying for the beer with sisal matting.</p>

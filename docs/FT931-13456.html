			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Europe's hairshirt ON THURSDAY this week, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister of Europe's most powerful country, went as a supplicant to Frankfurt. His purpose was to plead with the high priests of monetary stability in their temple. There, he offered his 'solidarity pact' and begged in return for lower interest rates. But the priests of monetary stability respond to such questions as cryptically as those who once served at Delphi. The millions who also want what Mr Waigel sought can only wait and pray. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's vice-president, has insisted that the Bundesbank will cut interest rates to the extent it thinks this justifiable. Who can doubt him? The Bundesbank is powerful, but it is not arbitrary. The question is when it will believe further interest rates cuts are justified. Will this be as soon and will they then go as far as the German government hopes, not to mention the French, the Irish, the Danish and all the rest? The questions are urgent, notwithstanding the insistence of European finance ministers at their meeting this week that the crisis in the ERM is past. Immediate pressure for realignment of the currencies that have been most under pressure - the Irish punt, the Danish krone and the French franc - did dwindle, as the D-Mark weakened against the dollar. But ministers are declaring the battle over too soon. They are over-optimistic because they forget the ever gloomier prospects for EC economic growth. Only this week the European Commission cut its forecast for EC economic growth from 1992 to 1993 to 0.8 per cent. Notwithstanding this reduction in the forecast, which is not likely to be the last, Mr Henning Christopherson, the commissioner in charge of economics, insisted that recent speculation against the ERM had been unwarranted. He was wrong. It is the EC's poor growth prospects which makes the speculation not merely warranted, but inevitable. Inevitable The UK has been expected to be among the better performing EC economies this year. So indeed it should be. But none of the news released this week shows it will be. Seasonally adjusted unemployment was up 61,000 in the month to December 1992; manufacturing output was down  1/2 per cent in the three months to November as against the previous three months; and seasonally adjusted retail sales fell in December. Fortunately, since what is now known as White Wednesday, the government is no longer nailed to the Bundesbank's cross. Lower interest rates are inevitable. The government should bow to that reality sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, the EC's so-called fast lane countries are going into reverse. Even the French economy, the most virtuous of all, is widely forecast to achieve little growth this year. Unless the Bundesbank lowers interest rates not only soon, which seems possible, but by at least 2 percentage points, which seems much less likely, France may experience a fifth successive year of sub- potential economic growth in 1994. Uncomfortable French inflation is down to a 36-year annual low of 2 per cent. If policy persists, it could fall below zero, but unemployment would also continue to rise. Fortunately for the French government, both the actual one and the one likely to be in office after the general election, 72 per cent of the French people appears to favour the franc fort policy. That would seem to make continued wearing of the monetary hair shirt conceivable, however uncomfortable. It is Germany, battling with the aftermath of unification, that is the source of Europe's problems. The German economics ministry now forecasts that the west German economy will shrink 1 per cent this year. It is almost certainly too optimistic, largely because Bundesbank economists do not share the government's concerns. The answer to all the government's problems is supposed to be the solidarity pact, whose fiscal component has been offered by Mr Waigel on the Bundesbank's altar. Yet economists at the DIW in Berlin argued only this week that the pact would fail to pull the east German economy out of recession. They must be right, when engineering workers are expecting, like lemmings, to rush over the cliff of a 26 per cent wage increase this March. That Germany is so far failing to cope with the huge challenge of unification is obvious. What is not so obvious is why most of the rest of the EC thinks it wise to be overwhelmed too. Unification is, it turns out, precisely the kind of real economic shock that requires substantial changes in real exchange rates. Since the EC refused - and, for the most part, continues to refuse - to make those changes through the nominal exchange rate, it has had to accept inflation in Germany and deflation everywhere else instead. Germany may yet make a big success of unification. Most of the EC may yet move smoothly to economic and monetary union. Neither now looks very likely. The EC is paying a high price for its attachment to exchange rate rigidity.</p>

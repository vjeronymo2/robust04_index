			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'SINATRA DOCTRINE' AT WORK IN WARSAW PACT, SOVIET SAYS  </P> <P> Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi I. Gerasimov today said the Soviet  Union has adopted the "Sinatra Doctrine" in its policy toward Warsaw Pact  nations -- they can do things their way.  </P> <P> Gerasimov appeared on ABC's "Good Morning America" to discuss the speech  delivered Monday by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in which he  said that the Soviets now recognize the absolute freedom of choice of all  countries, specifically the Warsaw Pact nations.  </P> <P> That marks a huge departure from the past, in which Eastern European countries  that strayed too far from Communist orthodoxy found Soviet armies on their  doorsteps.  </P> <P> "We now have the Frank Sinatra doctrine," said Gerasimov. "He has a song, 'I  (Did) It My Way.' So every country decides on its own which road to take."  </P> <P> Asked if that includes an absolute rejection of any military force against any  Eastern nation, Gerasimov replied:  </P> <P> "That's for sure . . . political structures must be decided by the people who  live there."  </P> <P> But what, he was asked, if the Communist Party were to be rejected in a  country?  </P> <P> "Take Poland," replied Gerasimov. "There are new faces there."  </P></p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Boots and Fisons active THE DRUGS sector was alight with talk that Boots and Fisons are considering merging their ethical drugs divisions. However, Fisons later denied the story and drugs analysts were also dismissive. Speculation over both businesses has been rife after they suffered unrelated setbacks over the past year. Fisons has been hit by regulatory problems in the US, while Boots was forced to abandon its heart drug Manoplax in July at a cost of Pounds 35m. Boots, under pressure from anxious analysts and institutional investors over the losses, said then that all options would be considered in reviewing the future of its drugs business. There has been regular speculation since over the company's likely course of action, ranging from an outright sale to a restructuring. Any announcement on its future is unlikely to come before Boots results on November 4. The company is also widely expected to announce the rationalisation of its Do It All home improvement venture. Boots shares gained 6 to 489p, Fisons 2 1/2 to 165 1/2 p.</p>

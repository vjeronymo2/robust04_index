			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Southern Electric up at Pounds 222m - Advance bolstered by strong performance from non-core businesses A sharp improvement in the performance of non-core businesses helped Southern Electric, the power distributor in the south-east of England, to increase annual pre-tax profits by 18.5 per cent to Pounds 222m, a figure at the top end of City expectations. Turnover for the 12 months to March 31 fell slightly to Pounds 1.78bn (Pounds 1.8bn). Earnings per share were ahead 17 per cent at 64p and the recommended 16p final dividend makes a total of 22.7p, an increase of 15.8 per cent. While operating profits of the distribution business were up 2 per cent at Pounds 182m, the supply business achieved a 49 per cent improvement to Pounds 32.4m, including Pounds 15m of profits from previous years recovered under regulatory adjustments. Non-core businesses chipped in Pounds 18m (Pounds 2.4m). The sharpest improvement was shown by MP Burke, the utility contractor, which lifted profits from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 4.3m. Southern's contracting arm also impressed with a Pounds 3m contribution, against Pounds 600,000 in 1992-93. Losses from Powerhouse, Southern's retailing joint venture, were reduced to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 7.2m). The improved core performance was helped by the company's cost-cutting efforts. In the main business, manpower was 497 down at 4,771. Southern charged Pounds 21.6m against profits for future restructuring and Pounds 12m for information technology costs already incurred. COMMENT Southern's shares have taken a bigger hit than most of its rec counterparts in recent weeks, but this probably owes more to the institutions targeting bigger companies when offloading stock than to any disenchantment with the group. There was certainly nothing to complain about in yesterday's results. The core job cuts mean that Southern should easily be able to exceed its target of 1,000 within three years from March 1993. Simplifying management structures will also help to reduce costs, which Southern expects by the mid-1990s to be Pounds 25m lower than 1992-93 levels. Meanwhile, the non-core business are performing well enough to suggest that the target of producing 15 per cent of profits from them by the end of the century may be over-cautious. Generation activities alone could be contributing Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m within a couple of years. The potential downside, as for all the recs, is the regulator's distribution review due for completion this summer. However, Southern seems as well placed as any to cope; last year's profits were depressed by a cautious approach to provisioning. And if things get really tough, Southern could perhaps think about releasing some of the Pounds 24m it has previously provided for adverse European rulings on pensions; other power companies have already done so. On a prospective yield of about 5.7 per cent, assuming a 25.8p dividend this year, the shares are not overpriced compared with other recs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Hongwei (2621 1347 0251) and </F> XINHUA reporter Huang Wei (7806 1218)]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chen Xitong, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the  Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, and  leaders of some municipal departments today visited some hilly  townships in Pinggu County in Beijing's suburb to inspect  construction there. This was their seventh trip to hilly areas  this year to study their ways to become affluent.    Hills in Beijing, which account for 62 percent of the city's  area, have a population of 1.5 million, and the 60 relatively  poor townships in these hills have a population of 400,000. The  Beijing leaders maintained that hilly areas' prosperity is  essential for Beijing to achieve a comparatively comfortable  life faster, and Beijing must consider hilly areas' construction  as an important goal to achieve. So far this year, Chen Xitong  and Li Qiyan have visited the hilly Miyun, Yanqing, Changping,  Fangshan, Mentougou, Huairou, and Pinggu Counties in Beijing's  suburbs. While there, they talked to villagers to familiarize  themselves with these counties' agriculture, forestry, breeding  business, water conservancy projects, and processing industries;  helped the local people solve problems; and discussed with local  cadres and people on how to achieve prosperity. Chen Xitong  noted in Liubinbao township in Yanqing County and again in  Heishanzai township in Changping County that, to expedite  construction, authorities in hilly areas must emancipate their  minds, relax policies, and promote market-oriented businesses.  To expedite development, hilly areas must proceed from  practical needs; count primarily on tapping their rich natural  resources; and actively produce marketable agricultural,  forestry, livestock, and mineral goods. Chen Xitong repeatedly  stressed that all trades and professions in Beijing should come  to hilly areas to take a look and actively support hilly areas'  construction so that people in hilly areas can also lead a  comparatively comfortable life, and so that the idea of  "exploiting mountain resources and achieving prosperity through  the market" can be realized. He said people in Beijing should  consider it an honor to support hilly areas and be able to  answer the question what they have done in supporting hilly area  development.    Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan also stressed in Pinggu County that  active support should be given to those cadres who have  foresight and the courage to start businesses. They said: We  must encourage the peasants to count on science and technology  and produce market-oriented goods, and to work hard to expand  production so that hilly areas will see the prospects for  achieving a comparatively comfortable life.</p>

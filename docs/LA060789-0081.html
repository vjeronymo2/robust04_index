Police said he was unarmed at the  time of the arrest.  </P> <P> Washington was committed to Patton after being found incompetent to stand trial  for the January, 1989, attempted murder of a Pasadena police officer and a  public housing complex security guard.  </P> <P> The security guard and policeman were reportedly serving Washington with an  eviction notice when he opened fire on them with a shotgun. Both officers were  seriously wounded in the attack.  </P> <P> He escaped from the mental hospital May 23 after using wire cutters to open a  chain-link fence surrounding the institution's outer perimeter.  </P> <P> A plainclothes SWAT team watched the apartment where Washington was reportedly  staying with his girlfriend.  </P> <P> Officers moved in on him as he drove away from the complex in a borrowed car.  They arrested him several blocks away.  </P></p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spurs forced to issue statement on profits TOTTENHAM Hotspur, the north London football club, was forced to put out a profit statement yesterday after Mr Terry Venables, who is fighting to keep his job as chief executive, broadcast a profit forecast on BBC Grandstand on Saturday. Mr Venables made the unauthorised forecast of a Pounds 5m profit during the BBC's coverage of the FA Cup final at Wembley. The drama of his sacking and reinstatement on Friday has provoked as much excitement as the 1 - 1 clash between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday. With Tottenham's share price rising from 89p to 103p yesterday, the board headed by Mr Alan Sugar, who wants Mr Venables out, announced that pre-tax profits amounted to about Pounds 4m for the 10 months to March 31. It made clear that Mr Venables' statement was 'without the board's approval'. Mr Venables' method of giving out price - sensitive information jars with stock exchange rules about making such announcements to the market as a whole. The Pounds 5m figure for Spurs' financial year to May 31 was in line with a forecast by its broker, Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. The other factor driving up the share price yesterday was speculation about the amount Mr Sugar, who owns 48 per cent of the shares, was prepared to pay Mr Venables for his 22 per cent stake. Mr Sugar has offered to match what Mr Venables paid for the shares. Confusing reports on this led to some market speculation that the figure might be as high as 125p a share. Mr Venables, who described the offer as derisory, paid 75p for about 2.9m shares when he and Mr Sugar took control of the club in mid-1991. He later converted an Pounds 800,000 loan to the club into about 640,000 shares as part of a Pounds 7m rescue rights issue, at 125p a share, which was underwritten by Mr Sugar. . According to these figures, the average price Mr Venables paid was 85p, which is less than Friday's closing price. Mr Venables also borrowed most of the Pounds 3m he has invested, leaving him with a loss on his financing costs. In broadcasting the Pounds 5m forecast, he also drew attention to the low p/e ratio on which Tottenham was trading - little more than three times at 89p. This rises to more than 8 times if about Pounds 3m gains from player sales, notably Paul Gascoigne, are deducted from the forecast.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Moscow Narodny back in black with Pounds 43.6m Moscow Narodny, the London- based trade and project finance bank, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 43.6m (Dollars 63.65m) in 1993 after two years of significant pre-tax losses, culminating in losses of Pounds 316.1m in 1992. The bank said the turnround came from two sources. Its operating income rose 11 per cent to Pounds 30.9m from Pounds 27.9m, and it was also able to release some Pounds 26m in provisions, as a result of selling debt - mainly sovereign debt - at above net book value. It had not, however, altered its provisioning for former Soviet Union debt. The bank still has an accumulated deficit of Pounds 347.3m and is not proposing to pay a dividend. It last paid a dividend in 1988. Moscow Narodny is owned by Russian institutions, principally the Central Bank of Russia, but is licensed and supervised by the Bank of England. Its annual meeting is today. Last year also saw the first significant growth in total assets - to Pounds 952.4m from Pounds 884.9m - after a period in which MNB had had to be prudent and reduce its exposure to the former Soviet Union.</p>

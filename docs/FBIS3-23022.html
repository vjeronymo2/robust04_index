			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Part one of a three-part interview with Abdullah Ocalan, </F> leader of the Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, by Huseyin Gul; place  and date not given]    [Excerpt] KURD-A/Botan--[passage omitted] [Gul] I want to  ask a question that interests everybody. What is your  assessment of the murder of Mehmet Nabi Inciler and Behcet  Canturk, who were Kurds known as godfathers in Turkey?    [Ocalan] We could easily state that starting with the murder  of DEP [Democracy Party] parliamentarian Mehmet Sincar, these  murders of those we could describe as patriotic Kurdish  businessmen were done under the direct orders from the highest  authority. Nabi Inciler, nicknamed "Inci Baba," and Behcet  Canturk were disposed of because of the role they could have  played in the Kurdish problem, as they had done in the past.    These are intimidation murders aimed at silencing this  [patriotic] segment and at encouraging the emergence of a  collaborationist segment, such as volunteer village guards, some  clan leaders drawn to Ankara, and many such agents.    [Gul] The 27 March local elections are approaching. It is  expected that the state will conduct large-scale detentions on  the eve of the elections. What will be your stance on the  elections?    [Ocalan] The state is engaged in an "all or nothing" game.  It is trying to hold the elections on the principle of the  complete destruction of our movement. It is trying to  completely disregard the legal foundations. It is trying to  reverse a possible referendum situation in Kurdistan. It  appears that the state will intensify its activities in this  direction.    [Gul] What is your assessment of the attack on Zhalah camp  and the position of the southern forces [Iraqi Kurdish parties]  on this attack?    [Ocalan] The Zhalah operation was designed to use the  federal  government in the south against us or, failing this, to warn  that government that Turkey could bomb it out. With the Zhalah  operation, the Turkish state is also indicating its "political  decisiveness" to resort to bombings if its policy toward the PKK  fails. They are resorting to military, political, and  diplomatic initiatives. They already did all that was possible  in the diplomatic arena. All these initiatives are various  aspects of their policy, and indications are that they will  further escalate their violence by the spring.    The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that we must  look at the situation from a wider perspective, assign duties,  and prepare our guerrilla force, war effort, introduction of new  ideas, enhancement of efforts, and cognizance of defects and  assessment of advantages accordingly.    It is imperative that we make preparations quickly and move  toward implementation. Time is vital for us, too. It is  possible to pack the efforts of the past years into these few  months. It is possible to achieve as much within the coming  months as was achieved during the previous years. At such  fast-moving historic times, it is easy to make maximum gains in  a lifetime if a proper response is made.</p>

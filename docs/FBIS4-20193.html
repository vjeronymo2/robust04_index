			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that a  firm goal of Greek foreign policy is to improve Greek-Turkish  relations. However, this improvement inevitably depends on the  Cyprus issue, he stressed.    If [Turkish Prime Minister] Mrs. Ciller wants to assume  initiatives regarding the Cyprus issue, she should realize that  the issue is a problem of invasion and occupation of a large  part of the island by Turkish forces. The Turkish and Turkish  Cypriot sides should therefore show good intentions, he said.  These intentions, the spokesman concluded, should be associated  with both the confidence-building measures and the substance of  the Cyprus issue.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A public hearing that considered proposed amendments to all Federal milk orders was held in September, October, and November 1990, pursuant to notice thereof issued July 11, 1990 (55 FR 29034). Following the issuance of a recommended decision and the opportunity for filing exceptions, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspection Services on February 5, 1993, issued a final decision on the issues considered at the hearing. In a referendum held following the issuance of the final decision, the proposed amended Nashville order was not approved by at least two-thirds of the order's producers who voted. The Act requires that an order, as amended, be approved by at least two-thirds of the producers who voted in the referendum or by producers who, during the representative period, produced at least two-thirds of the volume of milk marketed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the basis of the record of the public hearing, the comment received in response to the proposed termination of Order 98, and the results of the producer referendum, the Department issued a termination order, effective midnight July 31, 1993. The order terminated the monthly operating provisions of the Nashville, Tennessee, order, but left intact certain administrative provisions that were embodied, by reference, in &sect;1098.1 of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The market administrator, in his capacity as the order's liquidating agent, has completed the disbursement of all of the money remaining in the administrative, producer-settlement, and marketing service funds established under the order. Hence, the remaining provisions of the order should be terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Notice of proposed rulemaking and public procedure thereon, and 30 days notice of the effective date are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest because all of the business related to the operation of the order has been concluded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> That the remaining provisions of Part 1098 represented by &sect;1098.1, which incorporates the General Provisions, are hereby terminated, and Part 1098 is vacated effective upon publication of this order in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

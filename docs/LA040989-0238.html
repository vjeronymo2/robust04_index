			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOFTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> WESTERN FALLS TO LA MIRADA IN CANYON FINAL  </P> <P> Western High School got a lot of mileage out of three hits, but not enough to  take the team to an extra-inning victory against the Southern Section 3-A's  top-ranked team, La Mirada, in the 4-A final of the Canyon High School  Tournament of Champions.  </P> <P> La Mirada displayed outstanding pitching, superior quickness and near-flawless  defense to capture the tournament title with a 2-1, 10-inning decision  Saturday.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 1-1, third baseman Amy Allingham hit a single up the  middle to score catcher Rose Garces from second. It was the 10th hit of the  game for La Mirada (14-1).  </P> <P> "Defensively, we stayed with them all the way," said Western Coach Debbie  Harless. "We just didn't have the hitting."  </P> <P> Part of the reason for that was La Mirada pitcher Dena Mullin, who gave up  three hits and struck out 12. She didn't walk a batter.  </P> <P> Only the Pinkerton sisters, senior shortstop Ivy, and junior third baseman  Misty, managed any offense for the Pioneers (14-3), the second-ranked team in  the Southern Section 4-A.  </P> <P> Ivy, who went two for three, ripped a single past second with two outs in the  top of the seventh. She then stole second. On a two-and-one count, Misty  singled over the second baseman's head. Ivy slid home safely when catcher Rose  Garces dropped the throw from center field, tying the score, 1-1.  </P> <P> The Matadores had scored in the third inning. Designated hitter Kim Kirkley  beat out a bunt. Shortstop Jenny Hambly bunted and Western catcher Lisa  Sciarrino fielded the ball cleanly, but threw it in the dirt past first base.  Kirkley scored on the error, the first of three for Western.  </P> <P> "They were nervous going in," Harless said of her players. "They had too many  errors because of that nervousness, and they didn't hit like they could." But  Harless said she and her team had no excuses. "I think La Mirada is the fastest  team we've seen and they put the ball in play and run," she said. "You get a  lot done that way."  </P> <P> Ivy Pinkerton, who had nine assists and three putouts, was named the  tournament's most valuable defensive player. Misty also was named to the  all-tournament team. Mullin (14-1) was the most valuable pitcher.  </P> <P> In other 4-A games:  </P> <P> Sunny Hills 2, Diamond Bar 1 -- Senior pitcher Amy Huett (3-2) struck out nine  and allowed only three hits to lead Sunny Hills (11-4) to a third-place finish.  Sunny Hills scored its runs in the fourth inning on doubles by center fielder  Kelly Ward and catcher Erin McKenney, and a two-out single by left fielder  Shannon Brown.  </P> <P> Kennedy 4, Canyon 1 -- The Fighting Irish (10-3) finished seventh, scoring all  their runs in the seventh inning as Cheryl Longeway (8-2) struck out eight and  walked none.  </P> <P> Valencia 2, Garden Grove 0 -- Junior right-hander Natasha Dumoski had six  strikeouts in a complete-game performance to give Valencia (5-9) ninth place.  Garden Grove dropped to 11-7 overall.  </P> <P> In 5-A games:  </P> <P> Simi Valley 1, Huntington Beach 0 -- Carrie Tofte singled in Tiffany Sanchez in  the second inning for the only run of the game as Simi Valley finished seventh.  Chrissy Oliver (7-4) held Huntington Beach (7-8) to three hits and struck out  10. Simi Valley improved to 14-5.  </P> <P> In nonleague play:  </P> <P> El Toro 4-3, Trabuco Hills 2-5 -- Paige Lauby (7-4) pitched a four-hitter with  10 strikeouts, and T.J. Stoewsand hit a two-run home run in the third inning  for El Toro (12-7). Linda Lunceford pitched a complete game and had three hits  to lead Trabuco Hills (6-10) in the second game.  </P></p>

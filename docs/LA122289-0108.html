			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA'S GATHERS WILL RETURN TO PRACTICE NEXT WEEK  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers will sit out Saturday night's game against  Oklahoma but has been given medical clearance to return to practice next week.  </P> <P> Gathers missed Tuesday night's 117-113 victory at Oregon State while undergoing  a second battery of medical tests to determine why he blacked out during a game  on Dec. 9. He has registered normal on all of the tests, but doctors want him  to rest this week after undergoing two more days of examinations.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-7, 210-pound Gathers, who led the nation in scoring and rebounding  last season, had played 96 consecutive games in his college career -- including  69 in a row at Loyola after transferring from USC -- before having to sit out  this week's pair of games.  </P> <P> "All the tests they did indicate that I am in great physical condition. I feel  fine and I'm still the strongest man in the country," Gathers said after being  released from Daniel Freeman Hospital Wednesday. "I'm still sore from all the  testing . . . I guess what happened to me was just one of those things."  </P> <P> Doctors found no apparent reason for Gathers' fainting and assume it was an  "isolated insidious incident." He had no history of blackouts and had never  been hospitalized before the brief spell, which occurred in against UC Santa  Barbara. ALAN DROOZ  </P></p>

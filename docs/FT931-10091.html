			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Holding the line on farm reform  -Tough challenges facing the new EC commissioner MR RENE Steichen of Luxembourg, the European Community's new farm commissioner, has taken over the most powerful job in European agriculture at a peculiarly difficult time. Farmers across Europe are blaming their declining incomes and the continuing exodus from the land on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, as well as agreements with the US within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's Uruguay Round world trade negotiations, to cut food export subsidies. Mr Steichen's predicament is easily summed up. Farmers are up in arms about measures - CAP reform and the Gatt settlement - which have not yet been applied. His predecessor, Mr Ray MacSharry of Ireland, won plaudits for the most radical overhaul of the CAP in its 30-year history and for averting a trade war with the US within an overall farm trade settlement which was arguably beyond the best the EC could have hoped for. The new commissioner has none of the glory for these achievements; he merely has to implement them. He can look forward to brickbats from the farmers for so doing, and sniping from agriculture economists and pundits if he appears to cede any ground to farmers under either the reform or the Gatt trade talks. As one agriculture official at the European Commission puts it: 'After last year things are as tight as they ever could be, and anything that happens under Steichen will only loosen them.' Mr Steichen is alive to this danger. 'They say I'm a Trojan Horse for France,' he remarks with certain amusement. It is France's militant farmers and its unpopular Socialist government, which is desperate to placate them, who have proved most determined to block a Gatt deal and pick away at the CAP reform. Certainly France, the EC's agricultural superpower, was uncomfortable with the abrasive Mr MacSharry. The Irishman took a firm hold on Directorate-General VI - the powerful Brussels agriculture department previously considered an outpost of the Paris farm ministry - and ruthlessly faced down a succession of French agriculture ministers who were convinced they would get their way until the moment of defeat. 'It's not clear,' one senior commission official says, 'whether Steichen can make his own views DG VI's views.' He adds that despite the new commissioner's own agricultural policy background, his personal staff is top-heavy with generalists - although headed as chef de cabinet by Mr Jim Cloos, the highly-regarded former Luxembourg ambassador to the EC. Mr Steichen, a 50-year old French-educated solicitor and Christian Democrat, looks as though he will be more emollient. He joined the Luxembourg cabinet in 1984 as state secretary for agriculture, taking over as minister from 1989. He comes across as relaxed, with a light touch, and quick to smile. He chaired the farm council with ease during the stormy first half of 1991, when Mr MacSharry presented his reform to universal vituperation. From France's point of view, it is a welcome change that he speaks French. One of his top aides says that if Mr MacSharry was the man needed to bludgeon reform through, Mr Steichen is more the sort of man needed to put reform to work. The commissioner insists he will be in regular contact with all EC national farm organisations; last Friday he left officials from Britain's National Farmers' Union with the impression he was more accessible and receptive than Mr MacSharry. But in presenting this year's farm price package, Mr Steichen has already signalled that he is no soft touch. His underlining that there would be no extra money to buy off national farm interests could almost have been designed for France, which is still pushing for bigger off-sets to the price, output and export cuts in the CAP and Gatt packages. A running sore for months to come will be the commission's efforts to demonstrate, over protestations led by France and Ireland, that the cuts required under the Gatt deal are compatible with the CAP reform. Mr Steichen nailed his colours to the mast in a keynote speech last month. 'The figures I have show that, overall, the concessions made by the EC (within the Gatt) - and the ones made to us as well, which we too often forget - are within the framework of the reform and guarantee the security of the CAP.' Like Mr MacSharry, he believes the EC-US deal on farm trade means international recognition of the CAP. He is anxious to wrap up the oilseeds agreement with the US quickly, and for an early conclusion to the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations, in order to shore up these agreements. For without that recognition, all the community's main commodity regimes would be vulnerable to challenge through the Gatt. And that, in the longer run, could mean curtains for the CAP, reformed or unreformed.</p>

This remark, made by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin when he met with his U.S. counterpart  Bill Clinton at the head of a larger delegation, became the  theme of the second hour-long meeting of the two presidents in  the Kremlin Thursday.    Following the end of this round of talks Oleg Lobov,  secretary of the National Security Council, told Interfax that  the meeting had demonstrated "America's willingness to provide  effective support for the Russian reform by paying some of its  social costs."    In particular, Clinton assured the Russian president that he  had succeeded in having Congress appropriate $900 Mn [Million]  for aid to Russia in 1995.    Furthermore, numerous funds, especially one supporting small  business, would be launched. The U.S.A. is prepared to allocate  $300 Mn for that purpose. The Clinton Administration is making  $100 Mn available for a recently established American-Russian  reconstruction of large factories fund.    "Solid support" has also been pledged for Russia's joining  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Duties will be  lifted from 4400 Russian products in the U.S. market. The U.S.  secretary of commerce will arrive in Russia in March with a team  of experts to study the possibility of closer contacts between  U.S. businessmen and Russian state and privately owned  businesses, Lobov said. In his words, Clinton asked Yeltsin to  help in finding partners for U.S. businesses.</p>

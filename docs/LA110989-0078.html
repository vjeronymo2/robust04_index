			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY CITED IN 'RAPE' OF MONTEREY PARK  </P> <P> Monterey Park Mayor Patricia Reichenberger hit the nail on the head when she  said developers "who are complaining about the standards are the ones who want  to rape the city." (Times, Nov. 5.) There is no question that developers have  been raping Monterey Park for the past 15 to 20 years, but the city should be  held as an accessory to the crime. Loose development standards attract  developers who, like anyone else, are interested in making the maximum profit  possible. Very few builders will, out of the goodness of their hearts, provide  more open space or off-street parking than is required. Proposition K was  approved in 1982 because residents of the community had become fed up with  wall-to-wall condominiums and unbearable traffic.  </P> <P> An all-out moratorium is not the answer to Monterey Park's problems. Strict  development standards, including lower densities, together with a Planning  Commission and planning staff that are not willing to grant variances at the  drop of a hat, would be a great starting point for a "get-tough" policy.  </P> <P> I have no sympathy for the developers who claim that they are disillusioned,  can't make a profit, or are losing money in Monterey Park. That's too bad,  because it's safe to say the millions of dollars in profit were made in the  last two decades at the expense of the city's residents, who now have to deal  with the results. City Planner Margo Wheeler should not let the complaining of  a few developers concern her. The overriding fact of Monterey Park's excellent,  close-in location will attract other builders, hopefully some who are concerned  with something other than making obscene profits.  </P> <P> STEVE LUSTRO, Pomona  </P></p>

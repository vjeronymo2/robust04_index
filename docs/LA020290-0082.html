			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY  </P> <P> I take exception to the continuing use of the phrase, "The death penalty is no  deterrent."  </P> <P> Can you name another crime other than murder where the sentence -- justice --  is not carried out because it is not a deterrent to further crime?  </P> <P> The death penalty is not supposed to be a deterrent. It has two purposes:  punishment and the removal from society of a dangerous criminal.  </P> <P> We talk of the Constitution and our obligation to act by its rules, yet we call  the death penalty "cruel and unusual punishment." When the Constitution was  written, that penalty was not considered cruel and unusual. There were far more  inhumane kinds of punishment in those days.  </P> <P> There are two phrases that come to mind: an eye for an eye and let the  punishment fit the crime. If that latter phrase were adopted, that beast who  cut off a young girl's arms after raping her would have the same thing done to  him.  </P> <P> One of the arguments against the death penalty is that sometimes innocent  people are put to death. Why not give those accused who maintain their  innocence an important option: the right to permit the use of truth serum,  polygraph tests and/or hypnotism. These tests would almost perfectly establish  their innocence -- or guilt.  </P> <P> SAM FISCHER  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

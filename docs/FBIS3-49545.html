			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by (km): "Minister Baudys Is Concerned About the </F> Russian Military Doctrine"]    [Excerpt] Prague--Defense Minister Antonin Baudys yesterday  expressed concern about the possible consequences of the Russian  Federation's military doctrine, which, in the event of a threat  to the country's security interests, allows for the  possibility--maybe--of deploying Russian troops outside the  territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States.    "Some of the passages in this military doctrine, which refer  to strategic territories and to the possibility of deploying  Russian troops outside the Russian Federation and perhaps even  the CIS states, cause me considerable concern, because these are  not pronouncements made by Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who changes his  views very rapidly, but are contained in the state military  doctrine," declared Baudys.    In reply to a question on whether Russia is continuing to  take the Czech Republic's territory into consideration in the  interests of its security, Minister Baudys said: "I do not know,  but the formulation of this issue in the doctrine disturbs me."    Minister Baudys considers the stance adopted by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin on the possible expansion of NATO to  include certain East European states to be schizophrenic. "On  the one hand, President Yeltsin is saying that he does not want  Russia to be outmaneuvered and not taken into consideration in  the expansion processes, while, on the other hand, he is afraid  of NATO's expansion. This is a schizophrenic situation, and I  simply do not understand it," said Baudys.    The statement made by the Russian president on Wednesday [5  January], in which he again emphatically rejected the attempts  to expand the North Atlantic Alliance, has, according to Baudys,  two aspects. "Boris Yeltsin says that the countries of Central  and East Europe must make their own decisions regarding their  possible incorporation into NATO. The other face of President  Yeltsin says, however, that it is necessary to respect certain  of Russia's strategic interests. This other face rather disturbs  me," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER MISTAKE, PALMER IS TEED OFF AT PGA;  </P> <P> HE USES WRONG MARKERS IN SENIOR TOURNAMENT, IS PENALIZED 2 STROKES  </P> <P> An angry Arnold Palmer lashed out at the PGA Friday at La Costa after being  penalized 2 strokes for teeing off from the wrong markers on the second hole in  the second round of the MONY Tournament of Champions' senior division.  </P> <P> Palmer, professional golf's most popular figure, said he was so angry that he  almost walked off the course.  </P> <P> "The only reason I didn't take a hike was because it was my mistake," Palmer  said. "But I'm still upset.  </P> <P> "It is the same thing I have fought since the seniors first played in this  tournament."  </P> <P> This is the only tournament in which the regular and senior touring pros play  together. On about half the holes -- the longer ones -- the age 50-and-over  group plays from markers closer to the green. Sometimes it's only a couple of  club lengths, but, on occasion, it is 20 yards or more.  </P> <P> On Friday, Palmer's playing partner, Harold Henning, birdied the first hole and  had the honors at No. 2. He stepped up to the tee and hit his drive on the  526-yard par 5 from the regular PGA markers, about 10 yards behind the senior  markers. Palmer did the same.  </P> <P> "The first year, I said I wouldn't play if the tees weren't the same," Palmer  said later. "I wasn't here the next year, and they moved the seniors up a few  yards. When they do that, it takes away from us. Dale Douglass shot the lights  out yesterday, and people say, 'But he was hitting from the front tees,' and  they dismiss it. It's not fair.  </P> <P> "Maybe we should have a separate T of C."  </P> <P> Douglass, who retained a 1-stroke lead in the senior division with a 72 for a  36-hole total of 139, 5 under par, agreed with Palmer.  </P> <P> "In this tournament, we have the top players in our group," Douglass said. "We  can play the same tees as the boys. But on our regular tour, we have so many  older guys that we need to shorten the holes or they have no chance. Here, we  have the best.  </P> <P> "The mistake on the tees could happen to anyone. Once each day my caddy has  gone to the wrong markers. I told him, 'That's 2 strikes.' "  </P> <P> Yet it is rather surprising that golfers could make a mistake such as Palmer  and Henning made. The markers for the regular PGA Tour are white blocks with  the T of C emblem on them. For the seniors, the markers are oversized blue golf  balls.  </P> <P> According to the rules, if Palmer and Henning had played out the second hole  and teed off on No. 3, they would have been disqualified. But Henning's younger  brother, Brian, tournament director of the Senior Tour, saved them. A spectator  had informed him of the error, and Brian Henning arrived after Palmer's third  shot on No. 2.  </P> <P> He told them about the error, and they went back to the tee to start over, with  the 2-stroke penalties. Henning took an 8 on the hole and Palmer needed only 4  shots to get a 6, 1 over par.  </P> <P> The rule states that a player may tee off as much as 2 club lengths behind the  markers. Because they teed off farther than that behind them, they were guilty.  "I guess I'm just stupid," Harold Henning said, after finishing with a 78 and a  153 total. "But the markers are close together."  </P> <P> Despite his anger, Palmer, who 3-putted 18, had a 74. At 149, 10 strokes behind  Douglass, he is probably out of contention.  </P> <P> "I really felt I was ready to make a move," Palmer said. "My anger is over an  average of 10 yards. I think it's bull."  </P> <P> "Brian Henning told us about the mistake. He said we would have been  disqualified if we had finished the hole and teed off on 3.  </P> <P> "It's the only tournament in my career in which men tee off from different  markers. The only exception is when we play with the women, and then the tees  are separate.  </P> <P> "I have complained from Day 1. Maybe we shouldn't be here -- or should play at  a different time. I don't think that's exactly first-class treatment. I'm still  upset."  </P> <P> Chi Chi Rodriguez said he nearly made the same mistake.  </P> <P> "I heard some players teed off from the wrong tees yesterday," he said. "If  they did, they signed the wrong cards and should be disqualified."  </P> <P> Brian Henning said he had been told by a spectator that some players hit from  the wrong markers Thursday. But, he said, he personally asked every player --  and none admitted it.  </P> <P> "Notes were placed in lockers and on the first tee," Henning said. "There  couldn't have been a misunderstanding."  </P> <P> The excitement all but obliterated the feats of Miller Barber and Bruce  Crampton as they closed in on Douglass. Barber shot a 5-under-par 67, tying Jay  Haas of the regular tour for the best round of the day. Crampton, also at 140,  had his second straight 70.  </P> <P> It was a bad day all around for Harold Henning. He wound up tied for last place  with Lee Elder in the field of 14 seniors and broke a New Year's resolution.  </P> <P> Although he was No. 5 on the seniors' money list last season with a career-high  $366,230 using a long-handled putter and a pendulum stroke, he "vowed to get  rid of my crutch (the unorthodox putter)," he had said Thursday.  </P> <P> The resolution lasted 1 round. He was back to the 50-inch handle Friday.  </P></p>

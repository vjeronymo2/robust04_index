A relevant person disclosed here that about 123 Chinese  illegal immigrants will be repatriated, among them most are  peasants from Fujian Province's Fuzhou City and Changle County,  and one of them may be a Cantonese.    U.S. immigration authorities have hired a special plane this  time and appointed three officials to escort the illegal  immigrants to China to handle repatriation formalities. There  will also be 130 security personnel on board the plane.    Last year, the U.S. side repatriated a group of Chinese  illegal immigrants, and the destination was Xiamen. However,  unlike the repatriation last time, the plane will fly directly  to China after taking off from the United States, without making  a detour.    Originally, the repatriation work had been scheduled for 15  January, but was changed to 18 January for some reason. This  afternoon, the relevant authorities of Fujian Province and  Xiamen city convened a meeting again to make arrangements for  the concrete matters of repatriation and reception tomorrow.</p>

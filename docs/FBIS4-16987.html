			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Court Throws Out A. Rutskoy's Suit </F> Against IZVESTIYA"]    [Text] The capital's Tverskoy Intermunicipal People's  Court has considered the latest defamation suit brought by  former Vice President A. Rutskoy against IZVESTIYA.    This time it was Aleksey Chelnokov's article "Young Nazi  Drinks Toast and Reads `Mein Kampf'" (IZVESTIYA, 15 January  1994) that was selected as the cause of the suit -- specifically  the following fragment: "By his `presidential' edict Rutskoy  made a Russian National Unity subunit equivalent to a military  organization. The Barkashov people gained the right to bear  arms -- within the Khasbulatov citadel, of course." The  plaintiff was seeking 100 million rubles [R] for this "dishonor"  and the moral damage done to him.    He himself preferred not to attend the hearing, predicting  which questions he would have to answer. In particular, the  respondents were interested in whether he seriously considered  himself Russian president and, correspondingly, commander in  chief, during those tragic days, and whether he deliberately  violated the Russian Federation laws "On Weapons," "On Defense,"  "On the Military Draft and Military Service," and "On the Status  of Servicemen" in randomly issuing weapons to people with very  dubious political beliefs and by no means irreproachable moral  qualities. By failing to appear, A. Rutskoy also avoided having  to answer the question of whether he had invited Barkashov's  followers to provide his own security -- which A. Barkashov  himself recently revealed in an interview with SOVETSKAYA  ROSSIYA.    The respondent A. Chelnokov submitted photographs to the  court clearly recording the Barkashov followers with their  assault rifles and stylized swastikas on their sleeves. This  could not have happened without the clearly expressed consent of  A. Rutskoy. The court was also presented with his "edicts": on  his own accession as acting president, on the appointment of the  "defense minister," and so forth. The very fact that these  so-called documents were published meant that their author  assumed full responsibility for the possible consequences of the  uncontrolled distribution of weapons -- consequences which were  soon to be felt.... Consequently, talk of some kind of  defamation, much less of R100-million damages is just more  blasphemy.    Carefully weighing all the circumstances and the case file  considered during the hearing, Judge Olga Sergeyeva threw out A.  Rutskoy's suit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening News Panorama" newscast] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, Mexican presidential  candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], has  reacted to Interior Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor's letter of  resignation. Zedillo reacted in a written statement issued  through the National Executive Committee of his party. Zedillo  noted that Carpizo's resignation from his post as interior  secretary is not acceptable under any circumstance considering  his political and moral attributes and his contribution to  democracy, the protection of human rights, and the country's  domestic policy of tolerance and concerted effort. There is an  interesting paragraph in the Zedillo letter which reads: The PRI  confirms its commitment to contributing to the efforts being  made by Dr. Carpizo. The PRI supports Dr. Jorge Carpizo and  cordially asks the government of the republic not to accept his  resignation and to provide its fullest support for the work done  by Dr. Carpizo.    The PRI also called on the Party of the Democratic  Revolution  [PRD] to immediately respond with conviction to the dialogue  initiatives made by Carpizo in his roles as interior secretary  and president of the General Council of the Federal Electoral  Institute [IFE] to achieve the goals of the political forces and  of all citizens. The PRI also asked the PRD and its supporters  to respond to the proposals made by Dr. Carpizo at the sessions  held at the General Council of the IFE on 18 June, in which he  appealed for no more attitudes of confrontation.    It is also important to note that Ernesto Zedillo learned  about Dr. Carpizo's letter in Toluca, Mexico State during a  political event held with students at the technological  institute, but the meeting was not very successful for Dr.  Zedillo.    There was much emotion and joy, but that was because of the  Mexican soccer team's victory. Dr. Zedillo said the following:    [Begin Zedillo recording] [Words indistinct] is for the  national soccer team. [Students cheer] The rally has ended. Let  us win on 21 August! [end recording]    When the political rally ended, Dr. Ernesto Zedillo said he  would issue a statement on the resignation of the interior  secretary at the PRI. He eventually did issue his statement  through an information bulletin. At the rally, he said: Please  let me learn more about the matter.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / US trade deficit rises to Dollars 6.3bn The US trade deficit in goods and services rose sharply to Dollars 6.3bn in January against Dollars 4.1bn in December, the Commerce Department said yesterday, Michael Prowse reports. The monthly figures were the first to include data on trade in services. Until yesterday, the US published monthly data only on merchandise trade - or trade in goods. By excluding a large surplus on services these gave a misleading impression of the US's overall trade performance. The increase in the overall trade deficit mainly reflected a sharp fall in exports from Dollars 57.3bn to Dollars 54.5bn, partly offset by a smaller drop in imports from Dollars 61.4bn to Dollars 60.8bn. The larger-than-expected fall in exports - reflecting weakness of demand in overseas markets - indicates that trade may act as a drag on US economic growth in the first quarter, partly offsetting the strength of domestic US demand. Yesterday's figures highlighted the sharp divergence in US trade performance in the goods and services sectors. The deficit in trade in goods rose to Dollars 11bn from Dollars 8.7bn in December. The surplus on services rose to Dollars 4.7bn against Dollars 4.6bn in December. The merchandise trade deficit on the old basis rose to Dollars 9.8bn in January against Dollars 7.4bn in December. This differs from the reported Dollars 11bn deficit in trade in goods because the latter is calculated on a 'balance of payments' rather than 'census' basis. The census figures are based on physical movements of goods whereas the balance of payments figures also reflect changes in the ownership of goods. The two reporting methods also differ in the way they treat gold and military contracts. Generally figures on the balance of payments correspond more closely to international definitions. The revised and expanded monthly trade figures were 'important for raising our awareness of how our economy works and how our nation competes in global markets,' said Mr Dave Barram, deputy commerce secretary. 'We live and work in an economy in which the software is as important as the hardware ..our service and manufacturing sectors grow increasingly interwoven,' he said. Since the late 1980s the US surplus on services has increased steadily - from Dollars 12.1bn in 1988 to Dollars 55.7bn last year. The deficit on goods fell from Dollars 127bn in 1988 to a trough of Dollars 73.8bn in 1991 during the recession but then begin rising as the US economy recovered, reaching Dollars 132.5bn last year. The rise in the surplus on services has thus offset to a considerable degree the deterioration on goods. The services surplus last year was nearly 60 per cent as large as the deficit on goods. The deficit on goods and services combined, at Dollars 76.8bn last year, is thus sharply lower than the Dollars 114.9bn registered in 1988. The main components of the services account are: business services (surplus of Dollars 22.8bn last year); tourism and travel (surplus of Dollars 20.8bn); royalties and licence fees (surplus of Dollars 15.7bn); and government transactions including military (deficit of Dollars 2.6bn). The sharpest improvement in the US services account since the mid-1980s has been in travel and tourism. Exports of business services have grown roughly in line with exports and goods and less rapidly than imports of business services. Many analysts thus expect the services surplus to stabilise rather than continue growing rapidly.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Arts: Try the taste, for starters - Television The trouble with television these days is the sheer quantity. Take a break and when you come back there is so much to catch up on that the benefit of the holiday rapidly evaporates. You can expect no sympathy, of course, if you complain about being paid to watch television, yet a sense of panic can set in when you sit down with the Radio Times at the beginning of a week and realise just how much has to be watched. Even with three video recorders for evenings when there is a four-way clash at 9.30, you still find yourself hunched, red eyed on the old green sofa, zapping from one channel to another, forever convinced that you are missing a masterpiece somewhere. The danger is that in trying to get a taste of everything you do not get the true flavour of anything. Still, in Week 1 of the return there was really no choice: widespread sampling was a necessity. MONDAY. BBC1's Watchdog under its new presenter Anne Robinson looks as though it may be turning into yet another example of a 'people show' instead of the consumer series it used to be, but we shall need to see more to be sure. BBC2's The Incredible Shrinking Politicians is presented, of course, by Martin Jacques. 'Of course' because nothing is so slavishly trendy as television and left winger Jacques has taken over from left winger Peter Kellner as flavour of the moment for political programmes. He is personable enough but currently ridiculously over exposed. Moreover his thesis here, that politics is in long-term decline, seems doubtful. More likely a blip on the historical graph. TUESDAY. Anyone who thought that the Beadle shows reached the limits of cringe-TV ought to glance at The Hypnotic World Of Paul McKenna on ITV. It is difficult in a free society to defend the now defunct IBA rule banning hypnosis programmes; if the victims are willing and paid who are we to act as nanny? Yet I would no more watch this voluntarily than pelt a victim in the stocks. Without Walls on C4 has become just about the best culture series on television. The item 'Reith To The Nation' seems unsure whether to tackle the condition of the BBC or the weirdness of Lord Reith as revealed by Ian McIntyre's recent book, but it succeeds moderately in both. Tony Parsons' blast at Kubrick for banning A Clockwork Orange from British screens is an excellent example of the arts polemic we have come to expect from this series. It looks as though the second batch of Between The Lines will confirm this BBC1 production as much the best current police series . . . even if the idea of a cabinet minister removing his secretary's bra in front of a brightly lit un-curtained window is laughable. You might have thought it difficult to make a character as odd as Houdini vaguely boring yet Omnibus manages it. Pirates And Emperors - Who Is The Terrorist? on C4 has a single unoriginal point to make but makes it well: that today's vilified terrorist is tomorrow's respected government minister. WEDNESDAY. The best comment about Margaret Hilda's appearance in Thatcher: The Downing Street Years is made by Kenneth Clarke during an engrossing Late Show on BBC2 which discusses history as print and as television. She is like a jet turbine, he says: while an internal combustion engine can work at various speeds, she is only capable of operating at 30,000 lb thrust. No book will ever achieve what BBC1's Thatcher series is managing in conveying the attitude, tone and presence of the former prime minister. On the other hand it is hard to see the value of The Almost Complete History Of The 20th Century on C4 which dubs 'funny' lines on to archive newsreel. THURSDAY. The producers of The Music Game on C4 seem to have noticed that My Music was hugely popular for many years even though the participants were not great musical experts. Unfortunately they appear to have missed the fact that Muir, Norden and the others were charming, funny and unusually inventive. BBC2's Red Dwarf has always contained the sort of jokes which delight first year undergraduates after they have drunk 12 Budweisers and, judging from today's episode, this sixth series is not even up to that standard . . . yet who would miss it? Gags in deep space make such a refreshing change from Ding Dong Honey I'm Home. How splendid to discover that I did miss today's episode of Absolutely Fabulous on its first transmission: with Jennifer Saunders being so clever and Joanna Lumley proving not just outrageously fanciable but such a natural comedian it is a superbly entertaining series. Lumley's dismount from the motorcycle was the highpoint of the week. In World Chess why does C4 not tell us the score to date? Could it be such a disaster for Short that they do not dare? Having been away perhaps I shall never know. FRIDAY. ITV's drama series Demob, starring Griff Rhys Jones and Martin Clunes as a couple of inept comedians in the postwar music hall, is workmanlike and contains a straight (well, semi straight) performance from the late, great Les Dawson. Yet the time drags and I cannot see myself watching next week's episode. Eurotrash on C4 with Antoine de Caunes and Jean-Paul Gaultier competing in zer farnee aggzents competition and items concentrating on sexual trivia (the pubic hair stylist, a new show at the Folies Bergere) is the sort of zany time-passing programme which you watch late in the evening when there is nothing worthwhile elsewhere. Late Night With Conan O'Brien on BBC2 proves that, with Johnny Carson gone and David Letterman switching networks, the American chat show is in deep trouble. O'Brien is awful and the show, because it seeks nothing from its guests, even worse. Pessimistic reports about Danny Baker's new show filtered back as far as Umbria, but surely his series must be better than this. SATURDAY. It is. In fact, Danny Baker After All (BBC1) is very good Saturday night entertainment, and if they manage to find one guest in six who is as good a raconteur as Rik Wakeman today, this could become as big a draw as the early Parkinson. Earlier in the evening Harry looks like a too-carefully contrived vehicle in which Michael Elphick can merely carry on from his Boon character, this time as a rough diamond journalist; formula drama which may sustain the ratings but will never tell us anything we did not know about the human condition. DA Pennebaker's documentary on BBC2 about the Clinton election staff, The War Room, is good but not great. We have seen much of this sort of material and you have to do something more unusual to stand out nowadays. SUNDAY. In the early evening there are three documentary series which could keep me hooked for weeks. Theatre School on BBC2 may be at its most fascinating in this opening episode with the auditions and some pretty brutal interviews, but it is very nicely edited and promises much. If, like me, you have bought and driven old German motorbikes then you will devour every minute of C4's Classic Motorcycles and if not you will probably be bored to tears; it seems to be dictated entirely by the availability of archive footage. Locomotion on BBC2, however, is not solely for steam train freaks since it seems far more concerned with the social implications of the development of the railways, which makes a change. With Scarlet And Black (what happened to the definite articles?) BBC1 faces a tough job: proving that it really is best when it comes to the classic literary adaptation. Stephen Lowe's decision to insert Napoleon into his dramatisation as a sort of Tinkerbell, flying around offering our hero terse advice, scarcely makes matters easy. But Stendhal was a good storyteller, the casting of Alice Krige as the beautiful young wife, ripe for a love affair, is spot on, and, apart from some nasty background music, all the ingredients are in place: carriages, outsize top hats, sylvan idylls straight out of a margarine commercial, and plenty of upstairs-downstairs jiggery pokery. A hit.</p>

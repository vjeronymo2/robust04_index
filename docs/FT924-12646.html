			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE derivatives reported a dull session with little in the way of strong market features on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the FT-SE futures contract for December delivery was struck at 2,590 which was viewed as a strong opening. But this initial strength quickly faded as the early weakness in sterling led to nervousness in the futures which sent December into retreat falling to 2,567 by 9am. The rally in sterling also led to a similar move in the futures, sending December moving gently forward. A flurry of activity was seen around lunchtime when a leading house went shopping for 400 contracts which appeared to put a floor under December. A squeeze as dealers covered short positions during the afternoon caused another sharp move upwards to the day's high point of 2,609. Profit-taking just ahead of the official close saw December finish the session at 2,595, down 12 on Friday's close and around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash which fell to around 23 points in this account. Turnover at 6,772 was uninspiring. There was little excitement in the traded options either and total volume was a poor 24,574 contracts, of which the FT-SE 100 option accounted for 7,305 lots and the Euro-FT-SE option 4,130 contracts. Asda was the busiest stock option with a day's total of 1,547 contracts.</p>

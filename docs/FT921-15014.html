			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Letter: Headhunting, the delusion Sir, I found your report on Timothy Clark's study on headhunters and recruitment consultants misleading ('Money spent on headhunters is 'wasted', January 7). We are told that 'psychological tests' are good at predicting job performance and that interviews and references are bad; also that recruiters are finding the wrong candidates for top jobs. Why then do recruiting consultants gain repeat business and why are the executives they introduce not fired or transferred? Perhaps because the recruiters do a good and necessary job. The assessment of suitability is just one link in a chain which stretches from assessing and advising on client needs and defining the job and model candidate to checking on the progress of the candidate after appointment. Psychological testing may have a part to play but this is more likely to be in ascertaining aptitude or skills for junior and middle-ranked positions. For a successful senior executive an aptitude test will be insulting, an assessment centre group procedure destructive of confidentiality, and a personality inventory, while yielding points on style, will not help in determining whether the person will perform well in the job. This key question is the one that the recruiter will seek to answer by looking at the candidate's achievements in positions making comparable demands. The curriculum vitae and the interview story must be checked (by telephone) with the former employer(s). The reference is also needed to reveal 'showstoppers' such as alcoholism, which tests and interviews typically do not. Talks with former colleagues and subordinates should add other useful information. The time and skills needed to do a thorough recruiting job justify the headhunter's fee and to pretend there is a short cut is to foster a delusion.

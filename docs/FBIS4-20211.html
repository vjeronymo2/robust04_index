			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Rethinking UK Defence"] </F>   [Text] Yesterday's white paper on defence is pure  politics. It is a holding operation, designed to get the  government through the forthcoming round of local elections,  by-elections, and contests for seats in the European Parliament.  The camouflage is transparent.    The paper intimates, as might be expected, that defence is  important. At the same time it affirms that cost savings are  being sought in response to the budget cuts announced in  November. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has put on  record his understanding that, if economies greater than those  asked for are found, the cash released may be diverted to the  front line forces. Savings in excess of the 2.3 billion pounds  agreed with the Treasury may therefore be anticipated.    Much of what may be expected is already evident. Civilians,  who are cheaper to employ, may be used for back-room tasks.  Stock holding, and the storage of spares, may be almost  entirely privatised. Overall levels of support staff may be  cut. There may be fewer senior officers, following a management  downsizing equivalent to that undertaken in non-military  enterprises. Expensive institutions, such as Royal Navy and RAF  [Royal Air Force] staff colleges, may be closed. The courses  could be transferred to an army facility. The Royal Navy have  recommended that the base at Rosyth in Fife be shut.    Most of the items in the above list are of the sort that  governments prefer to avoid when the are about to face the  electorate. Job losses and redundancies are never popular.  Defenders of Rosyth are already much agitated. The Labour  leader, Mr John Smith, has begun to taunt the government for its  "piecemeal cuts." He is hitting home. There is little stomach  in the Conservative part for further reductions in defence  spending. In consequence, nothing specific will be announced  until July, when the voting is over.  <H5>  Overriding Fault </H5>   The white paper's overriding fault, however, is that it is  more likely to set off a debate about candle-ends than a  fundamental reappraisal of Britain's defence policy.  Accountancy has its place. Yet it is deep thinking that is  required. Mr Smith has called for a full defence review. Serb  expansionism has engendered a less dovish mood than is  traditional on the Labour benches. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader  of the Liberal Democrats, confessed on Monday that he had been  wrong to advocate sweeping defence cuts after the Berlin wall  came down. "It is now clear that we shall see not peace in  Europe, but vicious conflicts of a type which we thought we had  banished half a century ago," he said.  <H5>  Confusion Reigns </H5>   Whether or not Mr Ashdown is right, Europe should certainly  prepare itself against the day when it must maintain its own  stability. In its present mood the United States can no longer  be regarded as the Atlantic community's policeman. President  Bush saw the conflict in former Yugoslavia as primarily Europe's  business, which it is. President Clinton, a reluctant ally, has  resolutely refused to commit U.S. ground forces while the  fighting continues. The United States remains attached to NATO,  but the depth of its commitment may not remain constant.    On the eastern side of the Atlantic, confusion reigns.  Britain plans to reduce defence spending to around 3 per cent  of gross national product in the late 1990s, as against 5.3 per  cent a decade ago. Most European countries, France excepted,  plan to spend below Britain's projected level. In the absence  of a clear pan-European foreign policy framework no one can tell  whether these amounts are sufficient. The necessary framework  cannot be constructed while Germany remains uncertain about its  future defence role, or while France deludes itself that it can  behave as a great power, or while Britain distances itself from  the continent.    In short, there is no cohesion of European thought or  action,  and little underlying agreement on the future presence in Europe  of U.S. forces. A proper white paper would set out the foreign  policy options and the defence decisions that flow from them.  The starting point would be to focus British eyes on both NATO  and the European Union. That is more important than the defence  of Tory seats in a borough council or two.</p>

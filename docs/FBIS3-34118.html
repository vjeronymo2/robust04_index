			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 4 Feb (MENA)--Ambassador Nabil Fahmi,  adviser to the foreign minister and chairman of the Egyptian  delegation to the meetings of the Working Group on Arms Control  and Regional Security stemming from the multilateral Middle East  peace talks, stated that Egypt has expressed its willingness to  host the proposed Middle East Regional Communications Center  once the parties to the multilaterals agree to set it up. He  explained that the center will serve the cause of arms control  and regional security.    At a news conference last night following the working  group's  five-day meetings, Fahmi said the meetings addressed several  issues in an in-depth discussion to define the long-term goals  involving all the parties concerned in the region. He noted  that discussions will resume at subsequent meetings.    He pointed out that the discussion touched on an attempt to  launch a project concerning "a declaration on regional security  and arms control in the Middle East," outlining the general  principles that should govern security ties among regional  states in time of peace.    Fahmi added that the talks discussed specific principles  concerning regional security arrangements, the rules that should  govern arms control, and the objectives the parties concerned  seek to achieve in the field of arms control.    He added that the Cairo meetings achieved an initial success  beyond that which the proposed working paper sought to achieve.  But, he remarked, particular points need to be given form and  the delegations need time to submit the working paper to their  governments before the working group can publicize it.    The chairman of the Egyptian delegation pointed out that the  talks also discussed the necessary measures to verify military  activities in their various aspects, since this verification is  fundamental to build confidence and to reach an agreement on  arms control. It is a means of ensuring that all the parties  are honoring their commitments, he said.    Fahmi said the working group discussed a Russian proposal to  establish a data bank on regional security and arms control as  well as another proposal to establish a regional crisis  management center and a regional communications center. [passage  omitted]    Fahmi was asked about particular delegations' objections to  the joint Russian-U.S. paper that was submitted during the  meetings. He explained that the proposed paper was neither  American nor Russian but a compilation of the views expressed by  regional states at previous meetings. Naturally, some states  suggested some amendments, he remarked, adding: Tangible  progress was made on many aspects of the items included in the  working paper. The United States and Russia put forward a joint  working paper on arms control at the beginning of the meetings  but the Palestinians objected to it, noting that it was an  attempt to give new interpretations to established political  principles.    Ambassador Fahmi was asked about the Israeli concentration  on  the issue of regional security and its overlooking the arms  control aspect. Fahmi replied that it is natural for each party  to have its own priorities. What we saw at these meetings was a  wide and exhaustive discussion of the various issues, including  regional security arrangements and arms control arrangements, he  said. He remarked that several delegations took part in the  discussion in accordance with their stances.    At the news conference, Fahmi pointed out that Israel took  part in discussing every subject. We can say that the Israeli  delegation demonstrated its readiness to discuss issues. We  hope the coming meetings will procure a working paper that helps  take real steps to curb armament, he said.    Fahmi stated that the next working group meeting will be  held  in Turkey in March. But he added that it will be exclusive to  regional states and that an expanded meeting will be held in the  Qatari capital for both regional and nonregional states.</p>

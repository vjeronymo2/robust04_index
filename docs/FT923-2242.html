			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage and speculative buying lifts Nikkei FUTURES-LINKED arbitrage buying and speculative short-term purchases lifted share prices yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 171.82 at 18,116.52. It fell briefly to set a day's low of 17,804.60 in the morning on light profit-taking, before arbitrage and dealer buying took it to a high for the session of 18,204.74 in the afternoon. Institutional investors, however, stayed on the sidelines and volume remained low, at 270m shares against the previous day's 263m. Declines still outnumbered rises at the close by 554 to 445, with 144 issues unchanged, but the Topix index of all first section stocks was 3.03 firmer at 1,355.63. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.29 to 1,085.79. A lack of news prompted speculative traders to focus on mining and non-ferrous metal companies. Reports of a gold discovery in the Oita prefecture, in southern Japan, triggered heavy buying orders. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting rose by its daily limit of Y80 to Y453 and Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced Y51 to Y782. Banks were mixed, some investors regarding the sector as a potential beneficiary of lower interest rates, while others were concerned about mounting problem loans. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y10 at Y2,690 but Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y30 to Y1,620. Bank of Tokyo added Y50 at Y1,350 on overseas rumours that it would merge with Mitsubishi Bank, down Y10 at Y2,220. Pharmaceutical and food issues advanced on the Aids theme. Green Cross, the most active stock of the day, moved up Y50 to Y1,720 and Meiji Milk Products Y20 to Y1,080. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 17.90 to 19,501.41 in volume of 26.5m shares. The Hanshin group advanced on the recent winning streak of Hanshin Tigers, the Osaka-based professional baseball group, Hanshin Department Store climbing Y85 to Y725 and Hanshin Real Estate appreciating Y41 to Y600. Roundup TURBULENCE in European currency markets affected trading in the Pacific Rim region yesterday, although a number of markets showed gains in late dealings. HONG KONG rebounded in the afternoon and the Hang Seng Index ended 4.77 up at 5,637.90 after touching 5,543.25. Turnover rose from HKDollars 1.18bn to HKDollars 1.94bn. HSBC fell HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 53.50 on worries that Midland Bank, of the UK, would show lower earnings because of sterling's weakness. TAIWAN's weighted index fell 222.83, or 6.1 per cent, to a 20-month low of 3,441.69 on news that a number of investors had failed to make TDollars 1.7bn in payments to broking houses for stock purchases. SINGAPORE saw heavy selling of blue chips late in the day. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 15.97 at 1,351.80 in volume of 27.8m shares.

BANGKOK was optimistic about attempts by pro-democracy parties to form a new governing coalition and the SET index added 10.93 at 824.26. Turnover was Bt12.5bn. NEW ZEALAND ended higher on large volume. The NZSE-40 index gained 14.08 at 1,483.95. Turnover was 18.2m shares, worth NZDollars 39.5m.

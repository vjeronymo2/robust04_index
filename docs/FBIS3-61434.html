			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.A. Glukhikh, St. Petersburg; UDC 621.039.6.02] </F>   [Abstract] The design and operating principles of Tokamak  fusion reactors, their principal parameters, and recent advances  in controlled nuclear fusion (UTC) research are outlined, and  the performance indicators of T-15, TFTR (US), JT-60 (Japan),  JET (Euratom), and ITER (joint development by Euratom  member-countries together with the United States, Russia, and  Japan) are compared. The specific requirements imposed upon the  reactor's electromagnetic system--the most complicated and  expensive component reaching more than 20% of the entire  structure's price tag--and the three key problems which must be  solved in developing the electromagnetic system, i.e.,  developing a superconducting cable, electric insulation, and  structural cryogenic materials, are discussed in detail. The  three principal stages of the research program aimed at solving  these problems--examining short samples and determining the  current carrying ability in magnetic fields of up to 12 T or  more, developing production practices for making 500 m long  conductors and examining model coils made from this conductor,  and examining model toroidal and poloidal field coils under the  conditions which simulate actual windings operation--are  presented. A schematic diagram of the ITER fusion reactor and  conductor and test bench design drawings are cited. Two winding  and conductor fabrication methods developed by the Inorganic  Materials Institute imeni A.A. Bochvar are summarized, and the  outcome of the early R&amp;D efforts is analyzed. Two brands of  steel have been selected for the electromagnetic system:  03Kh20N16AG6 and 03Kh13N9G19AM2. The conclusion is drawn that  the findings obtained thus far attest to the possibility of  developing an electromagnetic system for an ITER reactor with a  22 MA plasma current and a fusion power on the order of 1 GW.  Large-scale research at the second and third stage must address  the scientific and engineering issues related to developing  these unique structures.

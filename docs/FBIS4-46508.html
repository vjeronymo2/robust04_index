			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Military Sciences Oleksandr </F> Manachynskyy under the rubric "Point of View": "There Are Small  Armies, but There Are No Cheap Ones..."]    [Text] Regardless of the fact that the ideas of  cutbacks in the army and weaponry, shutting down bases and  withdrawing troops from foreign territories have moved to the  practical plane, no one anywhere is talking about the complete  elimination of armies. The discussion, on the contrary, concerns  improving and optimizing them, and trying to make the armed  forces effective and, at the same time, cheap.    So how are matters proceeding in Ukraine? No one has any  doubts that the army costs a lot and needs to be cut back. But  what are the realities? Defense appropriations under the  approved budget are 14,741,870 karbovantsi (1.17 billion dollars  at the exchange rate of 12,600 karbovantsi to the dollar used by  the National Bank, or 387,945,000 dollars at the market  settlement rate of 38,000 karbovantsi to the dollar). Is that a  lot or a little? Let us compare. The 1993 defense budget for  Slovakia was equal to 284,340,000 dollars, Poland 2.25 billion,  Hungary 1.16 billion and neutral Sweden, which maintains an army  of 65,000 people, 5.24 billion dollars. The planned U.S.  military budget for the 1994 fiscal year is 263.7 billion  dollars, with overall military spending as a percentage of GNP  in 1992, according to the data of SIPRI, 5.4 percent in the  United States, 4.0 percent in Great Britain, 3.9 percent in  Turkey, 3.4 percent in France and 2.2. percent in Germany.    Military spending per capita will reach 1,100 dollars this  year in the United States, 730 in Great Britain, 810 in France,  815 in Norway and 500 dollars in Greece and the FRG. They are  283,500 karbovantsi (at the different exchange rates, from 7 to  21 dollars) in Ukraine.    The following circumstances should also be taken into  account  when evaluating the military budget of Ukraine:    First, the increase in inflation in Ukraine in 1993 was  approximately 47 percent a month, so it is being cut back  substantially every year even without any formal reduction in  military spending.    Second, it must be kept in mind that the cost of military  hardware and weaponry, as well as some types of operations, has  increased substantially with the transition to economic  accountability and self-financing.    Third, the cutbacks in the size of the armed forces and the  realization of the START-1 treaty, as well as the conversion of  the military-industrial complex, will require additional  appropriations rather than cutbacks in the first few years.    Fourth, it should be taken into account that the military  inventories are filled to overflowing with obsolete hardware,  and the weaponry and hardware needed to replace them are  expensive. All of this in the aggregate is not fostering an  augmentation of military might and reserve capacity and, most  likely, gives rise to the question of whether it will be very  easy to provide for defensive sufficiency under such conditions.  The answer suggests itself.    It is not just a matter of the military budget, however, but  also its structure. The distribution of overall appropriations  of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine by dedicated purposes is  not precisely known, but one can already state today that the  funds that are being allotted for the procurement of weaponry  and military hardware are insufficient, since the rate of aging  of that material is quite high. The military budget for 1994,  with a regard for the current social and economic situation, is  naturally quite large. The funds that are being allocated for  the country's defense, however, do not seem all that large  against the background of the overall non-productive  expenditures and losses in the national economy, as well as the  presence of criminal capital in the country (which includes the  "shadow" economy), which are measured in the hundreds of  millions of karbovantsi. And the fulfillment of the requirements  of the Military Doctrine and the implementation of the armaments  program, the realization of which has been approved, does not  withstand any criticism at this time. The picture is similar  with the financing of military scientific projects aimed at the  development of modern types of weapons. Here is an example:  Science is an average of about 15 percent of military spending  for the Americans. The U.S. government spends 76 billion dollars  on all science today. Sixty percent of that is for purely  military programs.    The breakdown of budgetary appropriations for defense in  Ukraine gives no precise answer as to how much of the budgetary  funding is going to science. The amount of that spending, in the  estimation of specialists, is less than ten percent, and that  naturally provides no opportunity to conduct basic and  investigative research.    This situation is leading to entirely foreseeable  consequences in the near future--we will not be able to create  advanced weapons systems. We will not be able to if the  state--and there is still no other customer or other source of  financing aside from the state budget in Ukrainian military  science--does not direct the necessary quantity of funds to  basic and investigative research, the development of  dual-purpose high technologies and the creation of scientific  and technical potential.    It should be borne in mind that equipping the troops with  weaponry and military hardware depends substantially on the  state of the economy. Moreover, the influence of scientific and  technical progress on the quality of those weapons and military  hardware is being manifested in more and more pronounced fashion  of late. There is rapid growth in the cost of weaponry and other  mat&eacute;riel, first and foremost owing to the large  concentration of efforts in scientific research and development  connected with the creation and production of new arms systems.    The sharp rise in the cost of weapons is restricting ever  more the capabilities of the economy with regard to their mass  production. A trend toward compensating for quantitative  indicators through qualitative characteristics--an increase in  destructive power, accuracy etc.--is thus being noted even today  in foreign armies. This inevitably leads to further complexity,  and hence, to increases in the cost of the weapons.    Spending has increased considerably on the operation of the  weaponry, which is now approximately half of the funds that are  spend for the technical equipping and upkeep of the armed  forces. The cost of operating some of the most complex combat  systems is sometimes even higher than the cost of production.    Military-economic spending is also increasing as a result of  the increased speed of the obsolescence of weaponry. The  upgrading of the armaments of the NATO armies thus occurred  every 15 years in the 1950's, every 10 years in the middle of  the 1960's and is now approximately every 6-7 years. The  replacement periods of weaponry have been shortened so much that  some models are removed before the start of series production.  That is the fate that befell the Sergeant York self-propelled  anti-aircraft gun mount in the United States in the 1980's.    The funds for the procurement of weaponry and military  hardware for Ukraine, in the estimation of specialists, do not  exceed 20 percent--they are, that is, not all that much. This  could have a negative effect on the condition of enterprises in  the defense sectors of industry, and cause an increase in the  ranks of the unemployed. The defense complex, aside from the  social consequences, could also lose its basic scientific and  industrial potential, in which advanced technologies are  concentrated. The outflow of highly skilled specialists is even  today leading to a weakening of the position of Ukraine in the  creation of high-technology models of weapons and military  hardware. All of this will ultimately cause the appearance of a  threat to the national security of Ukraine.</p>

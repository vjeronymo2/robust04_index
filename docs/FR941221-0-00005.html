			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an SES member who had received a lump-sum payment for annual leave upon separation or retirement is reemployed in the Federal Government before the expiration of the period covered by the lump-sum payment, he or she must refund to the employing agency an amount equal to the pay covering the period between the date of reemployment and the expiration of the lump-sum payment. The individual's annual leave account will be credited with an amount of leave equal to the leave represented by the refund. (See 5 U.S.C. 6311.) If the individual is reemployed in a non-SES position, he or she will be subject to the maximum annual leave ceiling for the new position_i.e., the 30-day or 45-day maximum annual leave ceiling under 5 U.S.C. 6304 (a) or (b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Example:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An SES member separated and received a lump-sum annual leave payment for 1,040 hours (130 days). Three months (i.e., 60 workdays) later, the individual is reemployed in a GS&hyph;15 position. The employee must refund an amount of pay equal to 560 hours (70 days). The employee's annual leave account is credited with 560 hours of annual leave. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Since 560 hours is more than maximum annual leave ceiling of 240 hours for the GS&hyph;15 position, the employee acquires a leave ceiling of 560 hours (70 days). The leave ceiling will be reduced under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 6304(c), if more annual leave is used than earned in any leave year, until it reaches 240 hours. In addition, annual leave earned in a leave year must be used or be subject to forfeiture at the end of the leave year.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, we are adding paragraph (e) to require agencies to maintain records of the amount of annual leave credited and reduced when an SES member has a personal leave ceiling and to inform affected members of their initial ceiling and any subsequent reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Delay in Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 201 of Public Law 103&hyph;356 became effective at the beginning of the first applicable pay period after October 13, 1994, the date of enactment. In order to give practical effect to this legislation, I find that good cause exists to waive the general notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Also, I find that good cause exists for making this rule effective on October 14, 1994. The delay in the effective date of this rule is being waived to cover employees as of the date required by the statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E.O. 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it will affect only Federal agencies and employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

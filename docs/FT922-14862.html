			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Allianz rejects cartel claims ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurance company, yesterday declared its determination to resist attempts by Germany's federal cartel office to force it to cut its shareholding in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank. The Munich-based insurer said the Berlin authorities' objections to the shareholding in the bank - and to its business relations with the bank  - were without foundation. The cartel office delivered its detailed objections to Allianz and Dresdner  -two of Germany's most powerful institutions - on Tuesday night. These were the conclusions of a study started last summer when it emerged that Allianz had taken its stake in the bank to more than 22 per cent, up from a hitherto disclosed 10 per cent. The authorities have made two specific objections to Allianz's relations with Dresdner. They want Allianz to cut its direct holding in the bank from 22.3 to 19.1 per cent, and they do not want it to proceed with plans to establish a joint marketing strategy in Germany's new Bundeslander. Ideally the authorities would like the agreement in the west to be unscrambled as well. Berlin wants the stake cut to 19.1 per cent as it believes that only at this level will Allianz stop having considerable influence over the bank's commercial strategy.</p>

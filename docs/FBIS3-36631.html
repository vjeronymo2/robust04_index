"That  is not the way things happen," Vladimir Lukin, head of the Duma  International Relations Committee, told your IZVESTIYA  correspondent.    There is a firm opinion that America won the cold war and  that Russia lost and now America has to treat Russia as the  vanquished side and dictate its terms. Even though the U.S  Administration is trying to act tactfully this does not always  come off and does not always succeed, he said.    "What price, for example, the present discussion about who  should be a minister in Russia and who should not? Just imagine  a situation in which official representatives of Moscow began  saying that we will not be friends with you if Lloyd Bentsen  remains Treasury Secretary and if he is not replaced by Jeffrey  Sachs because we think that Sachs is better suited to your  interests and your reforms. Of if Warren Christopher remains  secretary of state whereas we would like him to be replaced by  Gus Hall, for instance. If the United States does not  relinquish this tendency of trying to teach us what we should be  doing in the government no good will come of it."    Answering your correspondent's rejoinder that the United  States is stating its terms not for the sake of "friendship" but  for assistance and the payment of money which the administration  is going to raise from its taxpayers, he remarked ironically:  "They are giving us assistance equivalent to half a deputy  minister but they are demanding the replacement of a whole  government."    Can America make a substantial contribution to the success  of  the Russian reforms? It can, Lukin believes. For that it needs  to "make it possible to export to America the little that we can  export right now."    "Look at what is happening with uranium. During the summit  meeting in Moscow we seemed to have concluded an agreement. But  the U.S. Commerce Department is putting forward around 20 new  conditions and is effectively trying to backtrack on this deal."    Lukin is convinced that the best way that the Americans can  help to ensure that "we have a more or less decent budget and a  more or less decent ruble" is by not creating obstacles to  Russian exports.    "That is what we need, not talk about who is going to be our  finance minister. Remember all that talk: If we have Gaydar we  will have reforms, without Gaydar there will virtually be  communism and totalitarianism. Gaydar was no more [Gaydara ne  stalo] when Chernomyrdin came and the distribution of money did  not increase. Then superman Fedorov appeared and the same  refrain began again: Fedorov is the reforms, without Fedorov  there will be no reforms. Instead of that, Lukin said as though  addressing the Americans, do a number of practical things which  will make our life easier. But let the sovereign country known  as Russia make the choice of whom to appoint and where and how."    When asked about the reliability of the persistent rumors  about differences of opinion with the Russian foreign minister,  Lukin replied by quoting Griboyedov: "I would be glad to serve  but I loathe grovelling." He developed this idea in the  following way: "I have done the job which the president gave me  -- representing Russia -- and I did this as I thought necessary.  As to whether anyone finds me convenient or inconvenient, that  hardly bothers me." Although Lukin said that he prefers to talk  about concrete problems rather than concrete people, the thrust  of his criticism leaves no doubt about the active dislike of a  number of principles embodied by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.    "I am not sure that a diplomat's main task is to be  constantly on the move, shaking hands, smiling, and sending  telegrams from one country to another about how our leadership  is respected in that country," Lukin said, terming this style of  work the "ostentatious airport style of diplomacy" and the  "legacy of Brezhnevite diplomacy."    However, the former diplomat's most serious objections were  reserved for the childish disorder of America-worship, which he  calls "infantile pro-Americanism, which has been stubbornly  practised by a number of our politicians."    "The politicians of the era of infantile pro-Americanism  were  about 50 percent responsible for what happened in the recent  elections," Lukin claimed. "I warned that in our country with  its lack of political culture and its often black and white view  of the world there would sooner or later be a situation marked  not by an attitude of enlightenment but of chauvinism.    "Today, when a number of our officials are hopping like  fleas  from Sakharov to Zhirinovskiy and back, all this does not create  a sense of the worthiness of our policy. I, fortunately, have  not hopped in that manner and I am not going to."</p>

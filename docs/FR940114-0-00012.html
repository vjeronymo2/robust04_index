			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (o) establishes an expedited procedure for changes in strike price listing procedures. Such changes are deemed approved 10 days after the Commission receives written notification of the proposal, provided certain conditions are satisfied. The amendment to paragraph (o) would clarify that this paragraph applies to exchange proposals to amend strike price listing procedures for listed options without open interest, as well as for options not listed, at the time the rule goes into effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (p) establishes an expedited procedure for changes in the last trading day of an option contract. Such changes are deemed approved 10 days after the Commission receives written notification of the proposal, provided certain conditions are satisfied. One amendment to paragraph (p) would clarify that this paragraph applies to listed options without open interest, as well as to options not listed, at the time the rule goes into effect. Another amendment is non-substantive and would correct a typographical error in section (3) of that paragraph. Specifically, the amendment would clarify that the Commission will, within 10 days after receipt of a submission regarding a change in option last trading day specifications, notify the contract market if the change appears to not be consistent with the provisions of this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (q) of Regulation 1.41 provides that changes related to ``cabinet trade'' provisions for options may be approved under expedited procedures. A cabinet trade currently is defined as an option trade that represents a closing transaction for both parties to the trade and which is specifically identified as such in the contract market's rules. The amendments to paragraph (q) revise the expedited approval standard to remove the requirement that option cabinet trade rules eligible for treatment under this paragraph must involve closing transactions exclusively. This revision in the expedited approval standard reflects recent innovations by the exchanges with respect to cabinet trade provisions. An amendment to section (3) of that paragraph is non-substantive and corrects a typographical error. Specifically, the amendment clarifies that the Commission will, within 10 days after receipt of a submission regarding a change in the cabinet trade provisions of an option contract, notify the contract market if the change appears to not be consistent with the provisions of this paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Amendments to Regulation 1.41a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In connection with the foregoing amendments to Regulation 1.41, the Commission is adopting amendments to paragraph (a)(5) of Regulation 1.41a. Currently, as noted above, this regulation delegates to the Director of the Division of Trading and Markets and to the Director of the Division of Economic Analysis, or their respective delegees, authority to determine whether changes submitted under paragraphs (h)&hyph;(t) of Regulation 1.41 are inconsistent with the relevant provisions of those paragraphs and to notify contract markets if such submissions are to be subject to the usual review procedures under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and Regulation 1.41(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One amendment to Regulation 1.41a provides that the Director of the Division of Trading and Markets and the Director of the Division of Economic Analysis, or their respective delegees, have the delegated authority to give notice that rules submitted pursuant to &sect;&sect;1.41(k)&hyph;(t) comply with the provisions of &sect;&sect;1.41(k)&hyph;(t), as applicable, and therefore shall be deemed approved prior to the end of the period specified in the applicable rule. Such period commences on the day the rule is received by the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters. The Commission has received requests from exchanges for notice that rules submitted under the expedited procedures of &sect;&sect;1.41(k)&hyph;(t) are deemed approved prior to the end of the specified period in order to provide for timely implementation of rules to respond to rapidly changing market conditions or to avoid a market problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another amendment to Regulation 1.41a would expand the delegated authority of the Director of the Division of Trading and Markets and the Director of the Division of Economic Analysis, or their respective delegees, to notify a contract market that a rule submitted under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and &sect;1.41(b) will be treated as if submitted pursuant to &sect;&sect;1.41(h)&hyph;(t), as applicable, if the rule submitted pursuant to the provisions of &sect;1.41(b) complies with any of the provisions of &sect;&sect;1.41(h)&hyph;(t). Current procedures can delay processing of the proposal and impede timely implementation of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

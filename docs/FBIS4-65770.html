			<p>BFN     [Text] This is the first week which sees the government  taking control of the full powers invested in it. At the same  time the dispute between the government and the opposition is  growing over the chairmanships of the parliamentary committees,  and campaigning is already in full swing for the European  elections, which are 20 days away. Mauro Mazza reports:    [Mazza, over video of Forza Italia election rally] We can  hear his amplified voice: Silvio Berlusconi chose to take part  in the rally at Cagliari over the telephone. He told the Forza  Italia rally of his dream of an Italy which was prevented from  falling into the clutches of the Left when he joined the  election. He explained that 80 percent of his party's  objectives have already been met, only 20 percent are left, and  these consist of giving Italy a good government.    Berlusconi, citing a number of opinion polls, maintains that  only one out of 10 Italian Popular Party voters support the  opposition line chosen by the current leadership and he forecast  that many Popular Party parliamentarians will support his  government. In other words, Forza Italia has the wind in its  sails even if Berlusconi, for the first time, puts his troops on  the alert: Be careful and pay close attention to the many  people, the recycled ones -- as he called them -- who want to  change their spots and who want to join the movement.    The leaders of the Christian Democrat Center have also  commented on the presence of the fascist ministers in the  government. Clemente Mastella, Pierferdinando Casini, and  Francesco D'Onofrio say that Italian democracy has nothing to  fear from the National Alliance.    Even the opposition are now choosing other ways in which to  attack the government: Mino Martinazzoli, the former secretary  of the Italian Popular Party, said at a meeting in Iseo that the  party must remain at the center of Italian politics and warned  that it should lean neither to left or the right. However, not  everybody agrees, and (Veltroni) has said that the left and the  center must find a way of coming together as an opposition force  and also as a future ruling coalition.    Achille Occhetto cuts short any questions on the arguments  involving the party leadership. He said that the party congress  will put an end to speculation, but at present it must be united  in order to fight in the European elections on 12 June.    Massimo Cacciari [mayor of Venice] seems to be giving  Occhetto a hand. Cacciari is being wooed as the next possible  secretary of the Party of the Democratic Left. He said that  even if he wants to become leader of the party, he could not  because he is not a party member. The argument goes on.</p>

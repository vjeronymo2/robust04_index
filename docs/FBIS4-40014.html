			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" program] </F>   [Text] Today we have a link-up with Minsk and Kiev. The  leaders of the two republics have agreed to comment in the  "Novosti- Plyus" program on the statement made by chairman of  the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, who suggested that in  all probability a confederation state will appear on the  one-sixth of the dry land [former Soviet Union], which in future  can easily change into a federation.    [Myacheslaw Gryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the  Republic of Belarus] This is at present a rather difficult  question. In principle, I do not reject a confederative  structure in any state or group of states. But at present a  somewhat different principle triumphs in the world. At present,  it is difficult to find a federative state or group of states  that would merge on purely federative terms, or confederative  terms. There are elements of one and the other, and even  something new is emerging, like in the proposals put forward by  Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev. These contain a new  proposal on the establishment of a new union. All this deserves  attention, discussion, and careful examination. But in my view  the first thing we should do is achieve economic union. This, I  think, is the most important thing.    And meanwhile it is a holiday in Russia. We rejoice in this  holiday and we send our heart-felt greetings. I convey  greetings on my own behalf, on behalf of the presidium of the  Supreme Soviet, and the people of Belarus to the people of  Russia, the Russian Government, and the President of the Russian  Federation, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, on the occasion of this  holiday, and wish them all the best on their road of  independence.    [Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk] First of all I would  like  to convey greetings to the peoples of the Russian Federation on  their national holiday. I would like to take this opportunity  to wish success, happiness, well-being, and prosperity to all  the peoples of the multi-ethnic Russia, to our closest neighbor  and, shall I say, kinsman.    Another important aspect for all of us is that the  proclamation of Russia's independence became a starting point  for the proclamation of independence of other states. I recall  that as soon as the Russian parliament adopted the declaration  of independence, Ukraine, and later other states of the former  Soviet Union, adopted their own declarations of independence.  Therefore both in time and in geographical terms, and in any  other imaginable way, this Russian independence holiday is  related to the independence of other peoples and states.    For me, independence is the right to resolve independently  those issues that every people, every state has to resolve for  itself.    At present we and Russia are at a very crucial stage. I  would describe it as a singularly important stage. We have  begun drawing up a treaty of friendship, cooperation and  partnership. A basis for this treaty is already in existence.  We ought to resolve those issues that can, shall I say,  complicate the signing and adoption of this most important  document between the two peoples and state. One such is the  problem of the Black Sea Fleet. We are making very difficult  step, but they are still steps forward. That's what I would  like to say.</p>

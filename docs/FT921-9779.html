			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Management: Keeping bosses up to the mark - The introduction of schemes in which staff assess managers From time to time, John Ainley would turn and gaze out of his office window when listening to a colleague who had called in for a talk. He had no idea why he did it. Similarly, he had no idea of the adverse impact his window-gazing was having. Until, that is, one of his colleagues told him. The opportunity to make the small, but by no means insignificant, point arose as part of a radical scheme of upward appraisal - in which staff assess their managers - launched by W H Smith, the retailer, in late 1990. It was, in fact, Ainley, who was responsible - as the company's personnel manager - for suggesting and implementing the programme. It now seems blindingly obvious to Ainley that this is an untapped source of information. Who knows the quality of a manager better than those who are managed? Bottom-up assessment, upward feedback, upward appraisal - call it what you will - is not uncommon in the US; IBM has been applying it worldwide since the 1960s. But it is still largely untried in Britain. W H Smith and BP Exploration have so far taken the plunge and a number of blue chip companies are actively considering similar schemes. The prevailing attitude in many hierarchical British companies is that only bosses are entitled to assess the performance of staff. That the staff should also have informed opinions about managers seems daring. That they should be asked to make formal assessments of their bosses might appear revolutionary. Ainley has been approached by some 500 companies about upward appraisal. 'They share the fear that we had. If you're asking the staff what they think of your managers, you're asking them what they think of your company. And I think you need to be a brave company to take that decision,' he said. For Ainley, the assessments presented an obvious solution to a problem. In the light of demographic change and the need to retain experienced employees, the company wanted to reduce staff turnover. It also wanted to attract new people. A survey of employees established that the attitude of individual managers was the most important factor determining whether staff felt W H Smith was a good place to work. 'We felt that the best way to obtain views about how a manager was performing was to ask the staff,' says Ainley. Upward assessment was initially introduced on a voluntary basis but it was soon extended to a full survey of all 400 senior managers. From the outset, managers were keenly aware that their jobs involved making tough decisions - not calculated to make them popular. And yet they were being judged by those who felt the effects of the decisions. What is more, coming under scrutiny in a survey which was conducted anonymously presented a golden opportunity to the disaffected to air their grievances. W H Smith devised its own survey, internally. It asked members of staff to rate 32 characteristics of their boss on the attributes of a good manager. They were also invited to place in order their choice of the top six qualities of a good manager. 'We found that the staff were very understanding of the fact that a manager's job is not just to be a nice guy all the time,' said Ainley. The survey revealed positive messages about the managers' skills in decision-making and running an efficient ship. More question marks were raised over their abilities to deal with personal relations and to motivate individuals. 'It certainly has made managers consider very carefully the way in which they relate to their staff.' The company, in turn, has identified a basic need for what Ainley defines as inter-personal skills training: the ability to discuss personal difficulties, to talk openly and honestly at an early stage when performance problems arise; to make the most of individuals who might otherwise be written off - but who might instead be 'turned around'. The findings of the W H Smith survey were relayed to the managers themselves, their immediate bosses and to the managing director - but not automatically to the staff who had taken part. It was left up to each manager to decide whether to follow through the survey with his or her own team, with between 40 and 50 per cent opting to do so. Ainley reckons many more will do so when the next study is carried out. Many of those who chose to discuss the findings apparently found it a valuable, barrier-breaking exercise. How else do you thrash out questions like the tricky business of window-gazing? It can be a cleansing experience, says Joyce Willard, senior consultant at Forum Europe, which advises companies introducing upward appraisal schemes. Further, it could also be a hurtful one, unless well handled. The type of exercise conducted at BP Exploration, advised by Forum, is devised to overcome that risk with a neutral 'facilitator' on hand at such after-the-event meetings of the team with the manager to ensure that there is a constructive debate which does not descend into petty personal point-scoring. In BP Exploration's upward- feedback scheme, employees were asked to complete a confidential questionnaire seeking their views on management practices - first in general terms and then in relation to their own manager. They were asked to rate, on a scale of one to five, the importance of attributes like 'being effective at initiating change' or 'agreeing challenging and achievable performance goals and standards with employees'. They were then asked to rate their own boss in terms of each of these aims. The manager then received a written report, summarizing the team's responses but not making any individual identifiable. Forum recommends that the manager concerned should, in the first instance, be guided through the findings in order to gain the maximum from the information provided. The report can bring surprises of both sorts, pleasing and upsetting. 'The follow-up team meetings can become quite personal,' said Willard. 'For example, one of the management practice questions is 'To what extent does your manager meet regularly with staff to discuss their career objectives?' The response comes back that it's very infrequent. 'The boss will say 'My god, we do it all the time. Tell me, where am I failing?' And they all start coughing up examples: 'Well, you haven't met with me for 12 months.' Or 'You asked me in the corridor the other day how I was doing with regard to such and such a plan - and I said fine, but that's not a career discussion.' 'They can become very personal because the examples will get closer and closer to reality. But that's the interesting thing. When a manager begins to hear those examples, usually they don't take it personally. Rather it's 'Oh, is that how you understood that? I didn't mean it that way'.' Willard maintains that upward assessment providing this sort of feedback brings proven benefits to companies undertaking such exercises. And to the individual manager, being assessed? 'Overwhelmingly,' she says.</p>

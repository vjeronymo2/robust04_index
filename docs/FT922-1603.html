			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Management: Checking up on the supervisors Bad supervision has long been a problem for UK companies. Yet improving the performance of supervisors can cause unwanted side-effects. One company taking part in a pilot scheme was appalled when its supervisors began to criticise their own managers. It panicked and threw out the government-backed researchers conducting the trials. This was an extreme response from just one of 200 companies which took part in mainly successful trials of the UK's first standards designed to assess and improve the quality of supervisors. The standards were published last week by the Management Charter Initiative, the UK industry and government-backed body which is struggling to improve the performance of managers. The MCI found that middle managers tended to make the life of supervisors a misery, sabotaging them while at the same time branding them as the Achilles' heel of UK business. The companies found that flawed management structures and practices were often a more important cause of poor supervision than the supervisors themselves. Indeed, few organisations have a clear idea of what supervisors do, let alone what they should do. This confusion is a central obstacle to effective supervision. The problem has been made worse by radical reforms of management structures and inadequate training. The MCI believes its standards offer a mechanism for defining, assessing and improving the competence of supervisors. The UK's 1.2m supervisors are a disparate group - ranging from leaders in a Belfast missile factory to British Rail station managers - so that not all standards apply to all supervisors. Employers should look at the company's objectives, identify the contribution of supervisors and then pick the standards which apply. The standards are made up of seven units of competence. Each describes what is expected of a competent supervisor in particular aspects of the job. The actual outcomes can then be measured against what is desired and differences addressed where necessary.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the proposed regulation would also define  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``System banks and associations'' to include Farm Credit Banks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FCBs), Agricultural Credit Banks (ACBs), banks for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperatives (BCs), production credit associations (PCAs),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agricultural credit associations (ACAs), Federal land bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations (FLBAs), and Federal land credit associations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FLCAs). The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included because these and other similar Farm Credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions are not authorized to provide related services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although service corporations are not included within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term ``System banks and associations,'' these entities would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be authorized to offer related services, except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance, based on section 4.25 of the Act. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4.25 of the Act states that service corporations may perform all the functions and services of the banks, with the exception of extending credit and providing insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 618.8005_Eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the provisions of sections 1.12, 2.5, 2.12(15)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 3.7 of the Act, proposed &sect;618.8005 requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  be offered by an institution to persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or entities eligible to borrow from the System. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulation would determine eligible recipients for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services by reference to persons eligible to borrow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as defined in the lending regulations at part 613 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chapter. Proposed &sect;618.8005(a) would authorize FCBs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations to offer related services to the persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible to borrow as defined in &sect;&sect;613.3010;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 613.3020(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b); and 613.3045. For BCs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;618.8005(b) would authorize related services to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be provided to eligible borrowers as defined in &sect;&sect;613.3110  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 613.3120. Proposed &sect;618.8005(c) would authorize ACBs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to offer related services appropriate to on-farm and aquatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations to persons eligible to borrow as specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (a) of this section and to offer related services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to cooperative operations to entities eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to borrow as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Although insurance is included within the definition of related services, more specific eligibility requirements are provided in revised &sect;618.8040; those requirements govern eligibility for receipt of insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA is currently developing proposed amendments to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lending eligibility regulations. Once any lending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility amendments become final, &sect;618.8005 would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified as necessary to conform to lending eligibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA believes that marketers and processors that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the eligibility requirements of &sect;613.3045 would also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included within the recipients that Congress considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible to receive related services. For any processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and marketing unit to be eligible to borrow, there must be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the operation's throughput that is produced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-farm by the entity or its owners. The FCA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services provided to marketing and processing units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be appropriate to the on-farm or aquatic operations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the unit or its owners. Therefore, these entities would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included within the eligible recipients specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;618.8005(a). Because rural home residents and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> farm-related businesses do not have farming or aquatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations, services provided to them would not meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory ``on-farm'' requirement and, therefore, they would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be excluded from the eligible recipients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in proposed &sect;618.8005.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation would approach the eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions for related services offered by ACBs in the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner as eligibility is treated for FCBs and BCs. An ACB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be authorized under proposed &sect;618.8005(c) to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services to persons eligible to borrow from FCBs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such related services would have to be appropriate to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-farm and aquatic operations of the recipients. Further,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an ACB could provide related services to its cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customers, as long as the service is appropriate to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperative operations. Therefore, although an FCB and BC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be combined into an ACB, the services that can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided to each type of borrower under titles I, II, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III of the Act would not change under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent requests from System institutions have led the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA to consider whether there are situations in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons eligible to borrow may be denied the ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive the benefit of related services merely because an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary or other person or entity involved would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the eligibility requirements of the Act. The FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that all farmers, ranchers, and other eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons and entities should be able to receive the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit of the related services authorized in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar requests have been received asking the FCA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider allowing the System to provide fee appraisals for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agricultural real estate to entities such as the Farmers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Administration (FmHA), commercial banks, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders in connection with loan applications from persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible to borrow, and loan servicing actions (including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bankruptcies and foreclosures) involving agricultural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets. The FCA also received a letter from the FmHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting that System institutions be authorized to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the appraisals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FmHA and certain System institutions have stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there is a shortage of qualified agricultural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appraisers in certain areas of the country, especially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enforcement Act. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  System personnel, who have developed an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expertise in agricultural appraisals, could help meet this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need. The availability of qualified appraisers would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit farmers and ranchers in that their property would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fairly valued in situations such as loan applications and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan servicing. Under current regulations, System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions have not been able to provide the appraisals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when they are provided directly to the FmHA or a commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bank, entities not eligible to borrow from a System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. Also, the FmHA procedures provide that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FmHA will contract for appraisals rather than having each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower obtain an appraisal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pub.

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Paris to consider Renault sale timetable THE FRENCH Government could give a clearer timetable for the privatisation of a merged Renault-Volvo group as part of its attempts to reassure Volvo shareholders opposed to the deal, government sources said yesterday. This could involve the issue of a letter or a public statement about the timing of the privatisation, or the placing of Renault on the next list of companies to be sold off as part of the French government's plans for 21 publicly-owned groups. The four companies on the current list - Banque Nationale de Paris, Rhone Poulenc, Elf-Aquitaine and Banque Hervet - are expected to be sold by early next year. BNP has already been successfully privatised and Rhone Poulenc is due to be sold within the next few weeks. Greater certainty about the timing of the privatisation of a combined Renault-Volvo group is one of the principal demands of Volvo shareholders opposed to the deal. Increased opposition to the merger from some Volvo investors has forced the company to postpone until next month a vote to approve the deal. The French government has said it plans to privatise the combined group as quickly as possible, with a target date during the second half of next year. It still maintains it is impossible to give a precise date for the privatisation because conditions in the automotive and financial markets must be taken into account. However, Renault's inclusion on the next list of privatisation candidates could help assuage shareholder fears. The second principal concern of rebel Volvo shareholders - the golden share to be retained by the French government after privatisation - is still described as non-negotiable by French officials and Renault.

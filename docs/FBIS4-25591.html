			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- A circular published by  the State Council General Office today said that without the  approval of the Chinese central bank, any region, department and  individual should not produce, process, purchase gold or conduct  wholesale and retail sales businesses of gold.    The circular said that recently illegal gold markets cropped  up in some regions and some enterprises and individuals  produced, purchased and sold gold without authorization.    It said that these led to the disorder of state supervision  over gold and silver, and severely disturbed the smooth  operation of state purchasing and selling of gold.    Because of that, the circular said, the amount of gold  purchased by the state decreased by a big margin in recent  months.    According to the gold and silver administration regulations,  gold should all be purchased and sold by the People's Bank of  China.    However, Cui Dewen, vice-director of the State Gold  Administration under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry,  said that since last year, big-numbered illegal gold markets  appeared around almost all China's major gold mines in Liaoning,  Shaanxi, Henan and Shandong Provinces.    The circular ordered that all the gold markets in operation  or in preparation to set up must be closed down before the end  of this month.    If illegal gold markets are found in some regions after July  1, concerned staffs and major local officials will be punished  according to law.    The circular also asked the Ministry of Metallurgical  Industry and gold industry administrative departments at all  levels to strengthen supervision over gold production and sales.    It reiterated that gold production enterprises must sell all  the gold they produce to the People's Bank of China.    The circular said individuals will still be strictly banned  to mine, process gold and resell gold ore.    The circular asked the public security, procuratorial,  industry and commerce departments and also the customs to  intensify investigation and handling of cases concerning illegal  purchasing, reselling and smuggling of gold.    It said that any cases seizing a total of more than 50 grams  of gold, will be dealt with as big cases.    The circular said that the duty-free shops conducting retail  sales of gold or silver ornaments with approval should only sell  the ornaments to the customers with foreign passports,  home-returning permits for compatriots living in Hong Kong and  Macao, and residence permits for overseas employees, with the  payment of foreign exchange.    The circular also said that the gold and silver products  produced in bonded zones should be exported. When they need to  sell the products outside the bonded zones, the operation should  be dealt with as imports.    The circular also prohibited gold futures trading, and the  setting up of all kinds of gold futures trading centers.    Branches of the People's Bank of China were asked to  strengthen gold-purchasing work. They were asked to readjust  gold purchasing and selling prices according to the changes on  international gold market.</p>

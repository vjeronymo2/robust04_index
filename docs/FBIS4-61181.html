			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] During the Easter holidays Estonian President  Lennart Meri received in the Tallinn Kadriorg Castle a group of  Russian journalists visiting Estonia at the invitation of the  Estonian Foreign Ministry. During the conversation Meri  answered questions by special correspondents of Interfax  Aleksandr Budris and Boris Grishenko.    Interfax: Mr. President, how do you see a way towards the  improvement of relations between Estonia and Russia?    Meri: I cannot say that I am satisfied with the present  status of relations between the countries. 18 rounds of  Estonian-Russian talks prove the opposite: it is necessary to  move faster toward normalization of relations between the  neighboring countries.    I think that all existing problems in relations between  Estonia and Russia can be resolved in a civilized way.  Although, frankly speaking, two years ago I was more optimistic  on this issue. It seemed to me that all problems can be  considered calmly and friendly. Including those which remained  as a criminal heritage of the treaties between Stalin and  Hitler. Taking this opportunity, I would like to note that  although Estonia and Russia had conflicts sometimes, but  historically they maintained normal relations. Extremism was not  characteristic for any of the sides.    We, Estonians, are realists by nature and we know that  Russia  will always be our closest neighbor. And we would like to take  a positive experience from our common past, not a negative one.  We have enough of it.    Interfax: How can Russian-Estonian talks be intensified by  putting them on the path of concrete decisions?    Meri: First of all, I would like to stress the use of these  talks, because there are people in both countries who doubt  their expediency. The Estonian-Russian dialogue is now rather  active. It cannot be interrupted.    If delegations of both countries have been meeting regularly  for two years, these are not instant contacts, but serious  bilateral cooperation.    But there is a dangerous tendency in this dialogue: talking  to each other for long, specialists can go deep into details and  lose important strategic targets.    It seems to me that a meeting between the Estonian and  Russian presidents could help break this vicious circle. I am  sure that our meeting with Boris Yeltsin would enable us to  conceptually resolve the most important problems in relations  between the two countries, from economic to cultural ones.    We do not break off contacts with the Russian president. We  conduct correspondence with Boris Yeltsin by official channels.  But unfortunately I cannot indicate a possible date of such a  meeting. Let me add that I am its supporter.    IF Note: On April 30 during an official visit of Latvian  president Guntis Ulmanis to Moscow, IF's correspondent asked  Yeltsin the following question: "When will the Russian-Estonian  treaty on the withdrawal of troops be signed?" "We would very  much like to sign such a document," the Russian president said.  "We do not have special goals in Estonia, especially military  ones. We also intend to pull our all troops from Estonia.  However, Russia would like to do it in the same way as it was  done with Lithuania and Latvia -- on the legal basis, so that a  treaty with a clear timetable of control over its implementation  is signed. We work so with Germany, from where all Russian  troops will be pulled out this year. Therefore, in case of  Estonia, they need to show goodwill, and from our side there is  already full agreement."    Interfax: Lately the Estonian political circles have been  talking about the need to attract Finland as a mediator in the  Russian-Estonian talks. What is your opinion on this issue?    Meri: I welcome any step which would lead to improvement of  Estonian-Russian relations. I think that mediation by the  experienced politician -- the Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari  would ease the tense atmosphere created at the Estonian-Russian  talks. Let me repeat that after two years of meetings the  delegations did not make any progress.    I would like to note that the withdrawal of Russian troops  from Estonia and Latvia meets the interests of Russia itself.  With full certainty I can say that the withdrawal will be  followed by activization of economic relations between our  countries. And this means that in this case we are talking  about mutual benefit, not about the victory of one side and  failure of another.    Estonia is a small country, but it is also capable of being  useful for such continent as Russia. Take our geopolitical  position, our convenient harbors. Is it possible to say that  Rotterdam port, for example, belongs to some separate country?  It belongs to the whole Europe.    Interfax: What do you think about the border dispute between  Estonia and Russia?    Meri: Any border dispute, including ours, is similar to  "Pandora box": nobody knows how it can be closed or who can do  that. However, we have to find a clear answer to this question  too.    I think there is a possibility to simply delay resolution of  this problem for 5-10 years, by finding some proper solution of  border disputes. Of course, we are not talking about a new iron  curtain, bu I am sure that such border should equally defend  both Estonia and Russia from criminals, smugglers, drug dealers.  This border should gain a European character.    Interfax: How do you see the role of NATO in contemporary  world?    Meri: I think this organization has not obtained more  enemies and it transformed from the military union into a kind  of fire team. The power of NATO is aimed not against someone,  but at safeguarding stability in the world. Like firemen, NATO  is organized and disciplines, that is why we trust NATO.    Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania altogether can set up a  peacekeeping battalion. The tragedy of Yugoslavia proves once  again that a calm Europe is being born painfully.    Interfax: How do you see the resolution of the problem of  non-native residents of Estonia, those who are not citizens of  the republic?    Meri: I think politicians should answer this question. The  attitude to citizenship is the right and the duty of every human  being, it is a very intimate feeling. Let everybody decide  which country he likes more in his heart. There have been  mistakes on both sides concerning this issue. Some Russian  politicians are trying to speak on behalf of Russians,  Ukrainians, Georgians living in Estonia and to speak in their  defense. Let me remind that such position caused contradictory  attitude of these very people, many of who are descendants of  Estonian citizens.    When people say that non-Estonians should defend their  rights  in Estonia, I ask: which rights in particular? This question  is hard to answer for our opponents and for us. It is good that  our northern phlegmatic character allowed us to put this dispute  into a calm and civilized path.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Arts: Glyndebourne goes ahead with rebuilding Glyndebourne announced yesterday that it was going ahead with its plan to build a new theatre. It has already secured three quarters of the Pounds 33m needed, mainly in pledges from the corporate sector, and it will now concentrate on selling itself to overseas businessmen. Preparatory work has started on constructing access to the new auditorium, which will increase the seating capacity from 830 to 1150 and thus help to ensure the financial future of Glyndebourne. There will be no Festival in 1993 and the 1992 Glyndebourne will be slightly curtailed to enable the re-building, involving a completely new theatre, to proceed speedily. Companies donating money will be members of the Glyndebourne Festival Society from 1994-2013, which confers priority booking for tickets. A contribution of Pounds 90,000 ensures the maximum of 120 seats in a season, although never more than eight on one night. Any existing corporate member unwilling to finance the new building loses automatic access to Glyndebourne. The share of the house allocated to the business sector will rise to 35 per cent of capacity. In the past it has never exceeded 34 per cent. But there will also be tickets set aside at each performance for members of the general public who are not members of the Society as well as forty standing places. There will be a wider range of price levels, although the cost of the most expensive seats will increase in line with inflation. The new theatre, with a much improved acoustic, will rise on a 180 degree axis from the existing structure. The autumn season by Glyndebourne Touring Opera will be unaffected by the rebuilding.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ingush refugees will not be able to return to North  Ossetia unless Ingushetia meets certain conditions, North  Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov told Interfax in  Vladikavkaz before flying to Moscow.    Galazov said that Ingushetia had to forego its claim on the  Prigorodnyy District of North Ossetia and that the Ingush  refugees had to understand they were North Ossetian citizens and  were not allowed to sabotage the decisions of the local  authorities.    He said it was important that the provisional administration  let the local authorities organize the life of the North  Ossetian population.    He believed that the use of force to return the refugees  would result in an out-and-out civil war in the Caucusus which  would spread to Russia proper.</p>

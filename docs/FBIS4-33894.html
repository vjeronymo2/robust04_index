Shortly before concluding his brief visit to the Cuban  capital, Salinas de Gortari told the local and foreign media  that, in his talks with his counterpart Fidel Castro, he  discussed political and economic issues, including trade and  investments by private Mexican citizens in the island.    In this regard, he confirmed an important investment by a  Mexican company in the Cuban telephone industry as well as the  preference that will be granted to the import of Cuban products  such as textile products, tiles, and prefabricated houses.

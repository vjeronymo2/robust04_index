			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls to 2-month low on arbitrage selling Share prices fell on arbitrage selling prompted by lower futures prices and profit-taking by overseas investors, and the Nikkei average closed at a two-month low, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 issue index closed down 165.23 at 20,297.66 after a high of 20,427.39 and a low of 20,224.04. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 16.07 to 1,621.79 while the Nikkei 300 lost 2.77 to 293.76. Declines led advances by 839 to 167, with 170 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was down 1.65 at 1,307.88. The dollar's fall against the yen following last week's brief recovery, discouraged dealers. Overseas investors also placed sell orders to lock in profits from the high yen. Volume was low at 226m shares against 278m. Fears that the dollar will remain under the Y100 level against the Japanese currency bought about prospects of falling profits at the leading exporters. 'Worries over the yen are weighing on the thin market,' said a Japanese broker. High-technology blue chips were hit by selling. NEC fell Y30 to Y1,170 and Mitsubishi Electric lost Y22 to Y677. Consumer electronics companies were also weaker with Sony down Y160 to Y5,790 and Pioneer Electronic declining Y150 to Y2,760. Brokers were down on profit concerns due to the recent decline in stock market activity. Nomura Securities fell Y80 to Y2,240 while smaller brokers, which are more vulnerable to falls in stock trading commissions, declined. Marusan Securities sank Y80 to Y1,140 and New Japan Securities retreated Y55 to Y840. Nissan Motor fell Y57 to Y750. Aside from the higher yen, investors were also discouraged by reports that the company will need to recheck 700,000 vehicles following a government guidance to curb suspected carbon monoxide leakages. Meanwhile, some individual investors dabbled in speculative favourites. Sugar refiners rose in the morning session on a cancer drug developed by Ensuiko Sugar Refining on the second section. However, later profit-taking eroded the gains and the stock closed down Y110 at Y1,900 while Mitsui Sugar dropped Y17 to Y595. Some retailers were higher on the rebound in consumption. Mitsukoshi rose Y10 to Y1,030 and Tokyu Department Store gained Y16 to Y806. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 233.14 to 22,686.74 in volume of 56m shares. Roundup Market activity was mixed yesterday.

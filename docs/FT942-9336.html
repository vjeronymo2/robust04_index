			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Poll choice may split Brazil party Mr Orestes Quercia, one of Brazil's most controversial politicians, will run as presidential candidate of the country's largest party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), following his victory in a party vote at the weekend. Mr Quercia was earlier this month indicted on fraud charges relating to Sao Paulo state government purchasing policies while he was governor. His candidature has divided the PMDB and threatens the stability of President Itamar Franco's government, based on a shaky PMDB-backed coalition in Congress. Mr Quercia wants the PMDB to break with the government because it will be easier for him to campaign for president as an opponent rather than a supporter of the already weak and ineffectual Franco administration. If the PMDB withdraws support - and a decision is likely in the next few days - the government will face more problems co-ordinating congressional business. Congress has already almost stopped because of October's general elections. Legislators are spending more time in their home states than in the capital. A long-awaited constitutional revision, due to be completed this month, has so far made almost no progress and would also be further in doubt without PMDB backing. Some analysts say Mr Quercia's nomination will lead to a serious and perhaps irreparable split in the party, which evolved from groups opposed to the 1964-85 military rule.</p>

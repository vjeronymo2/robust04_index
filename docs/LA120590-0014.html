			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Among those benefiting from the Kings' fast start is General Manager Rogie  Vachon, who has been rewarded with a new three-year contract. . . .  </P> <P> What vindication for the former all-star goaltender who was blamed every time  the Kings made a bad trade and then had to hear how the good deals were really  made by Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky. . . .  </P> <P> It was Vachon who pulled off the heist that has helped to lift Los Angeles to  the top of the Smythe Division standings -- forward Craig Duncanson to  Minnesota for goaltender Daniel Berthiaume. . . .  </P> <P> Those exhibitions between NHL and Soviet Union teams should be dumped. The  crowds have been dwindling, and both sides are taking unnecessary risks in the  middle of the season. . . .  </P> <P> If that was great defense Monday night at Candlestick, then I'd much rather  watch great offense. . . .  </P> <P> New York took Jerry Rice and Rodney Hampton out of the game. . . .  </P> <P> O.J. Anderson's best runs were off Phil Simms' fumbles, but Bill Parcells stuck  with the veteran over the talented rookie Hampton. . . .  </P> <P> The bottom line was that Joe Montana made the big pass play and Phil Simms  didn't. . . .  </P> <P> Although they are in different divisions, the Giants and 49ers have played each  other at least once every season since 1984 in the regular season and/or  playoffs. San Francisco has won six of the nine games. . . .  </P> <P> I don't think Ronnie Lott and Simms were discussing the delightful San  Francisco weather after the game. . . .  </P> <P> Highlight of my evening was watching a tape of Philadelphia quarterback Randall  Cunningham's incredible touchdown pass against Buffalo Sunday. . . .  </P> <P> Something ought to be done about the loose interpretation of the intentional  grounding rule. . . .  </P> <P> The Bills might be the best team in the NFL right now. . . .  </P> <P> Cleveland and Tampa Bay chose off-weeks to change coaches, as though that would  make a difference. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Steve Spurrier and Pat Sajak. . . .  </P> <P> If college football season lasted much longer, Miami would keep winning and  fall out of the top 10. . . .  </P> <P> It's a wonder more quarterbacks don't wear shields to keep them from tipping  off pass plays with their eyes. . . .  </P> <P> The battle for control of Hollywood Park is getting nasty. . . .  </P> <P> Jose Santos, who hasn't been landing good mounts, showed prospective clients  that he's sincere about making Southern California his base when he signed a  lease on a house in the San Gabriel Valley. . . .  </P> <P> Three Kentucky Derby winners and seven Breeders' Cup winners have competed in  the Futurity at Hollywood Park, which will be run Sunday, but none has won the  $1-million race that decides the meeting's 2-year-old championship. . . .  </P> <P> The Clippers are advertising "guaranteed seats for all playoff games" to those  who buy rest-of-the-season tickets.  </P> <P> But can they guarantee the playoffs? . . .  </P> <P> Bill Musselman, coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, is partial to  overachievers who follow his orders. He has five former Continental Basketball  Assn. players on the roster. . . .  </P> <P> The New York Knicks must have wanted to hide their coaching change, making it  on the day of the Giant-49er game. . . .  </P> <P> It will be surprising if weary John Thompson remains at Georgetown longer than  two more years. . . .  </P> <P> Notre Dame might have the fourth-best basketball team in Indiana behind  Indiana, Purdue and Butler. . . .  </P> <P> My college hoops guru, Sonny Vaccaro, says to watch out for Georgia. . . .  </P> <P> UCLA could start all M's -- Tracy Murray, Don MacLean and Zan Mason up front  and Darrick Martin and Gerald Madkins in the backcourt. . . .  </P> <P> The Bruin-Arizona game Jan. 12 in Tucson probably will be a matchup of  unbeatens. . . .  </P> <P> Dick Enberg and Keith Jackson used to do sports on the Channel 5 news programs.  . . .  </P> <P> You mean to tell me that the United States doesn't begin Davis Cup zone play  until February? . . .  </P> <P> Myrella Moses, wife of Edwin, phoned Angela Worthy, wife of James, with words  of encouragement. . . .  </P> <P> When Brett Butler becomes eligible for new-look free agency in January, the  Dodgers should run, not walk, to his door. He would fill two needs -- center  fielder and leadoff hitter. . . .  </P> <P> The Ken Griffeys, Jr. and Sr., will be typecast as Seattle Mariner ballplayers  on an episode of the Fox television network series, "Harry and the Hendersons."  . . .  </P> <P> Don't confuse Junior Felix with Felix Jose. . . .  </P> <P> Remember when $2 million a year wasn't a standard wage in baseball?  </P></p>

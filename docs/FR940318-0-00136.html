			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the acceptable list;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the SNAP program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the unacceptable list;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Petitions to delete a substitute from the acceptable list and add it to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable list or to delete a substitute from the unacceptable list and add it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the acceptable list;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Petitions to add or delete use restrictions on an acceptability listing, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Petitions to grandfather general use of an unacceptable or acceptable subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narrowed use limits in specified applications substitute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners should note that the first type of petition is comparable to completing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNAP submission, except that the latter is submitted by substitute producers prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction into interstate commerce of the substitute for a significant new use as a class I or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II substitute. The first type of petition, by contrast, would generally be initiated by entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other than the company responsible for producing the substitute. Companies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture, formulate, or use a substitute themselves and want to have their substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added to the acceptable list should submit information on the substitute under the 90-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance notification review program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Basis for Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A petitioner may submit a petition for several reasons, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Availability of new information on substitutes or applications not covered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing SNAP determinations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Requests to extend effective date for existing prohibitions on uses of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable substitute;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;New technologies or practices that reduce exposures to a substitute previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable under SNAP due to toxicity concerns; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Requests for acceptability subject to narrowed use limits listing for specialized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications within a sector end-use for an unacceptable substitute where no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other technologically viable substitute can be found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the above are examples of valid justifications for submitting a petition. Other bases for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitioning the Agency may exist as well, and all petitions with adequate supporting data will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive consideration under the SNAP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Nature of Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency will only review and grant or deny petitions based on the sector and end-use application identified in the petition. For example, simply because the Agency ultimately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deletes a substitute from the list of acceptable substitutes for a particular end-use in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvents cleaning sector does not mean the substitute is unacceptable for any specific end-use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a refrigerant. A similar caveat applies for petitions on applications within a sector. If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute, for instance, is found acceptable for a specific end-use within an application, it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not automatically be deemed acceptable for any other end-use in that sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Content of the Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency requires the following information: A brief statement describing the type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of petition, substitute, sector and end-uses to which it applies; and a brief summary of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for the petition and the data that support the petition. As with SNAP submissions, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency will issue a determination letter on the completeness of the petition to the petitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 15 calendar days of its receipt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petition types (1) and (2) must contain the information described in section V.B. of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this notice, which lists the items to be submitted in a 90-day notification. Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for such petitions and 90-day notifications are the same, since the Agency will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be applying the same level of analysis to petitions submitted by outside parties as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifications received from the producing companies themselves. For petition types (3) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4), which request a reexamination of a substitute previously reviewed under the SNAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, the submitter may reference the prior submission rather than submit duplicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. In this case, the petitioner should provide and submit as appropriate any new or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional data. Petitions to grandfather use of an unacceptable substitute must describe the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability of the four-part test to judge the appropriateness of Agency grandfathering as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in section VI.B. of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Sufficiency of Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners should be aware that insufficient data may prevent the Agency from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaching a timely decision on whether to grant or deny a petition. EPA will conclude a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completeness review of each petition received within fifteen days of receipt of the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within the 15-day period, EPA will inform the petitioner of any additional information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed. If EPA makes no such request, then after the 15-day period is completed, the 90-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review period will automatically commence. If EPA does request any additional data, the 90-day period shall not commence until the additional data are received and themselves reviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for completeness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

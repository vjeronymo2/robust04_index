			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview given by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali </F> to IZVESTIYA; date and place not given: "Butrus-Ghali: UN Does  Not Exist To Punish People. UN Secretary General Answers  IZVESTIYA's Questions"]    [Text] [IZVESTIYA] In what way does the United Nations  hope to reconcile the principle of noninterference in other  states' internal affairs with its efforts aimed at asserting  human rights and democracy worldwide?    [Butrus-Ghali] The definition of human rights is contained  in international treaties to which states accede on a voluntary  basis. After the treaties are ratified, states assume  international pledges to respect the spirit and letter of these  agreements. As a result, the international community of nations  acquires the powers to monitor and observe how states observe  the pledges they have entered into. Moreover, existing  international law sees major human rights violations as  legitimate grounds for alarm.    [IZVESTIYA] How do you plan to combine the right of  self-determination and the principle of the inviolability of  state borders?    [Butrus-Ghali] Although the term "self-determination" has  not yet been clearly defined, the international community  recognizes that all peoples have the right of self-determination  and are free on that basis to choose their political status and  to implement their economic, social, and cultural development.  Implementation of the right of self-determination should not  infringe the territorial inviolability or political independence  of any state.    [IZVESTIYA] What methods of punishing states which violate  UN principles are currently under consideration?    [Butrus-Ghali] The United Nations does not strive to  "punish" states which violate its principles.    But if the Security Council considers it necessary, it can  call on parties to a dispute whose continuation could pose a  threat to the maintenance of international peace and security to  resolve that dispute through negotiation, investigation,  mediation, reconciliation, arbitration, judicial examination, or  an appeal to regional organs.    The Security Council can also call on UN members to break  off  economic relations or rail, maritime, air, postal, telegraph,  radio, and other forms of communication with the state violating  international norms, as well as breaking off diplomatic  relations with it.    [IZVESTIYA] How does the United Nations rate the prospects  for the use of armed forces for peacekeeping purposes? Practice  has shown that even the operations in Cambodia failed to produce  the expected results.    [Butrus-Ghali] The establishment of peace is primarily tied  in with the utilization of armed forces against those who use  force to violate a peace agreement. This approach is laid down  in the rules governing peacekeeping operations. But the main  question is different -- will the United Nations have enough  military resources to carry out such measures, and will it have  enough political will to see them through? If the answer to  both questions is in the affirmative, then it may be possible to  establish peace. [Butrus-Ghali ends]    UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived on a  five-day official visit to the Russian capital Friday. The VIP  guest's first statement to journalists on Russian soil was  brief: "I am very glad to have the opportunity to visit Moscow  again."</p>

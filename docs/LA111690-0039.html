			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Van Gogh Breaks Record: A Van Gogh still life failed to sell at a Christie's  auction Wednesday night, but a drawing by the artist fetched a world-record  price. Vincent Van Gogh's "Garden of Flowers," a detailed rendering of a  vegetable and flower garden in brown and black ink, sold to an anonymous buyer  for $8.36 million, a world record for a drawing. But his "Vase With Poppies and  Cornflowers," estimated to go for up to $16 million, could muster a high of  only $9.5 million. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

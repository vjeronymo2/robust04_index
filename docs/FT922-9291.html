			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Vienna airport in Sch1.8bn flotation VIENNA International Airport (VIA) will join the British Airports Authority and become the second airport group to seek a public flotation when it launches an issue early next month. The timing of the issue coincides with the rapid expansion of traffic at Vienna airport following the collapse of the Berlin wall in 1989, the opening-up of eastern Europe and the completion of a new terminal in 1991. Since 1987, passenger volume has increased more than 10 per cent each year, with the exception of 1991, when the Gulf war and the civil war in neighbouring Yugoslavia slowed growth. VIA is now handling about 6m passengers a year. The two runways have an annual capacity for 20m passengers. The offering of between 5.3m and 5.5m shares - representing about 28 per cent of VIA's enlarged capital - is part of a long-term strategy aimed at making the airport a key transit point for passengers and freight between eastern and western Europe. VIA is owned by three shareholders: the republic of Austria (50 per cent), the province of Lower Austria (25 per cent) and the city of Vienna (25 per cent). It ranks 24th in Europe in overall passenger numbers. The issue is expected to raise Sch1.8bn (Pounds 90m). The bearer shares will have a nominal value of Sch100 each, and are expected to be priced between Sch320 and Sch360. They will be traded on the Vienna stock exchange after the subscription period closes on June 5. The aggregate nominal value will total between Sch530m and Sch550m. A third of the shares will be placed on the international market, and two-thirds of the shares will be earmarked for the domestic market, of which about 10 per cent will be sold to VIA's employees at a discount. Bank Austria and SG Warburg Securities are leading the issue.</p>

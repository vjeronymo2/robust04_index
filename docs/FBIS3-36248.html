Etr." report: "Serbian Secret Weapon, According to </F> Zhirinovskiy"]    [Text] The "secret weapon" given to the Bosnian Serbs is  apparently called Elipton and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the Russian  extreme nationalist leader, on a visit to the former Yugoslavia  until yesterday, states that it is not a joke: "Russian  counterespionage officers used it on Wednesday against a Muslim  military unit, killing 12 enemy soldiers. Their bodies bore no  trace of firearm injury and the neighboring buildings were not  damaged."    The Elipton apparently kills by some kind of ultrasound. The  story may seem crazy and some close aides of Zhirinovskiy are  playing down these remarks. But the latter insists and  denounces skeptics and "all those who are afraid of the strength  of his party and the new Russia." A section of the Serb press  goes further, citing academicians with very grand-sounding  titles who maintain that the principle behind this revolutionary  weapon, capable of reversing the balance of forces with the  West, is based on the work of Eugene Mathieu, a French  mathematician of the last century.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] Jakarta (KOMPAS)--The leadership structure of  the Central Executive Council (DPP) of the Indonesian Democratic  Party [PDI] was finally formed Thursday night, 23 December,  after a difficult and tiring process. Alex Lithay was elected  PDI DPP secretary general to assist Megawati Sukarnoputri, who  Wednesday night had been confirmed as general director of the  PDI DPP. Mega [Megawati Sukarnoputri] formed a group that she  called a renewal, in which most of the faces are new and in  which the individuals reportedly have no conflicts.    In the end, Megawati Sukarnoputri's expectation that the  formation of PDI DPP leadership would not be easy became a  reality. The nominating team, which she led directly, worked  with difficulty Thursday because of the tug of war between  Mega's faction and a "potential" group that turned out to have a  candidate. In addition, the nominating team also had to face  external groups with aspirations who wanted their candidates  accommodated in the PDI DPP structure.    As a result, the formation of DPP leadership, which was  scheduled for completion by 1000 hours, was again delayed, thus  producing an atmosphere of near hopelessness among MUNAS  [National Conference] participants, who waited without any  clarification at Hotel Garden, South Jakarta. [passage omitted]    Mega said she hoped the DPP leadership structure would be  warmly received, with a view to PDI's future "after our long  journey, which has been full of pain and apprehension."  <H5>  Tiring Discussions </H5>   Although she said the day had been full of struggle and  apprehension, Megawati was ready with lengthy "lobbying" that  was tiring and sapped one's strength. The daughter of the late  President Sukarno met yesterday, Thursday, with eight other  nominating team members at Hotel Atlet Century Park to form the  PDI DPP.    Meanwhile, the other participants waited at the conference  site at Hotel Garden. They apparently did not guess that the  nomination meeting would be difficult, and fatigue was visible  among all the participants.    Becoming impatient, DPD [regional executive council]  delegates held a meeting at 1415 hours in room 403 of Hotel  Garden. Their discussion included the possible position of all  the DPD's if the MUNAS should fail or if the nominating team  working at Century Park Hotel should be unable to finish its  task on the designated day.    The delegates told reporters that the DPD's agreed to ask  the  nominating team to report the results of their work and gave  them a deadline of 1700 hours. If the nominating team did not  report on the results of their work by that hour, the MUNAS  would take further action.    "We would decide whether the nominating team should be given  time to complete its task this week, or what, because we are the  ones who gave the team its mandate," said a delegate.    In the end, however, the nominating team was able to  complete  its task before 1700 hours. According to a KOMPAS source, an  official was present while the team discussed the PDI DPP  structure. The meeting lasted until about 1500 hours.    According to the source, the difficulty in the team's  discussion lay in the designation of a PDI DPP secretary  general. Reportedly, most of the team members, and particularly  the chairperson, wanted Wiyanjono as secretary general.    Agreement on that was not easy, however, because some wanted  Ismunandar to be secretary general. The problem became even more  complex because of demands of team members from a "potential"  element, which wanted Edwin Sukowati to be included in DPP  leadership. The meeting then arrived at an impasse.    The source said that Megawati nominated Wiyanjono because  she  wanted the general director and the secretary general to be able  to work well together. "If the PDI really wants unity and  integrity, I want a secretary general who can cooperate," the  source quoted Mega as saying.    With regard to her objection to the candidate nominated by  the "potential" element, Mega reportedly cited a similar reason.  She asked that for the sake of unity and integrity the people  involved not press their wishes too far. Because none of the  parties was willing to withdraw its nomination, Alex Lithay was  brought up as an alternative. In the end, his name was approved  by the nominating team.    Alex Lithay was born in Ambon on 1 October 1948 and is a DPR  [Parliament] member elected through nomination by Maluku  Province. According to sources close to Mega, she selected Alex  because Mega has always received much support from branches in  Eastern Indonesia. "Thus, it was a must for a person from  Eastern Indonesia to sit in DPP leadership," the source said.  <H5>  Edwin Renominated </H5>   After the DPP was formed, Megawati, Antoni Rahael, and  Slamet  Mulyadi met with Director General for Sociopolitical Affairs  Sutoyo N.K. for about 15 minutes and then returned to Hotel  Garden at about 1700 hours. Upon her arrival at Hotel Garden,  Mega was guarded closely by security guards and was guided  directly to room 417, where she was to rest.    It turned out that the work of the nominating team was still  not final, however, because lobbying went on in Megawati's room  and almost undid the results that had been achieved. The  Megawati faction had to accommodate a request from the  "potential" group, which was again determined to put Edwin  Sunawar Sukowati in DPP management.    This happened despite the fact that Mega had rejected the  presence of Edwin in DPP ranks because the DPP in the future  would help her to run the organization's activities. Megawati's  position in rejecting Edwin was so firm that she had threatened  in the meeting that "either I or he (Edwin) will withdraw." It  was because of this rejection that the name of Edwin H. Sukowati  was deleted from the document containing the PDI DPP leadership  structure for 1993-1998.    It was this failure to include Edwin that prompted Alex to  gather the DPD's at about 1950 hours to lobby them again, with  the result that, in the end, Megawati consented to accept Edwin  as a DPP deputy treasurer. According to the source, she accepted  him because the "potential" group threatened to form a shadow  DPP in opposition if Edwin was not put in the PDI DPP structure.  <H5>  Composition of DPP </H5>   The structure of PDI DPP leadership for the period 1993-1998  with, as expected, Megawati Sukarnoputri as general director  tries to picture oneness and integrity in the PDI organization  by including various factions that have always been sources of  conflict. The 14 directors are Soetardjo Soerjoguritno,  Ismunandar, Fitmah Achmad, Kwik Kian Gie, Gerri Mbatemooy,  Panangian Siregar, Subagyo, K.H. Kholiq, Slamet Mulyadi, Yahya  Theo, Abdulgani, I Gusti Ngurah Sara, Mangara Siahaan, and  Suparlan. Secretary General Alexander Lithay has as deputies  Syafei Ali Gumay, Andi Chaerul M.M., Haryanto Taslam, Mrs. Ratna  Purnami, Edi Junaedy, and Titik Juliasih. Treasurer Laksamana  Sukardi has as deputies Mulyono Soetarmo, Untung Sutomo, Neneng  A.D. Asmasoebrata, Novianti Nasution, F.X. Urip Sujud, and Edwin  H. Sukowati.    The emergence of Alexander Lithay as secretary eneral  surprised some of the delegates, because the director of the  Central Executive Council of the Indonesian Christian Youth  Movement (GAMKI) had never previously been mentioned as a  candidate for secretary eneral. It is conjectured that his name  emerged because no common ground was found among the nominating  team members to select any of the four people nominated for  secretary general: Ismunandar, J.B. Wiyanjono, Supardan, and  Sudaryanto.    Although he had been a member of the Indonesian Christian  College Student Movement (GMKI), Lithay can be called a "new  person" in PDI DPP leadership. Although he has not personally  worked with Megawati, he said that as director/coordinator of  the PDI's Banteng [the wild ox, symbol of the PDI] Campus  Campaign Team at Salatiga, Central Java, (1987) he had  opportunity for "interaction" with Mega when she was on the  F-PDI [PDI Faction] Assistance Team of the MPR [People's  Consultative Council] Working Committee (1993) [year as  published].    As a "new person," Lithay immediately received messages in  room 206 from his seniors in the PDI, who included DPR F-PDI  member Sukowaluyo, who even had a personal talk with Lithay in  Lithay's room.    When asked for his comments on Megawati, Lithay said, "She  is  a determined person. The PDI needs someone like her, and she is  the most suitable person at this time. When a reporter asked  what steps he and Mega will take to respond to future challenges  to the PDI, including the never-ending conflicts and the  "fusion" issues, Lithay was not yet able to make much comment.  "I think that is a job for the team. We will deal with those  things together with other DPP members," he asserted. "What  about internal and external pressures on the PDI?" the press  asked. "I have no comment on that," Lithay answered.  <H5>  Speaking Without Notes </H5>   At exactly 2255 hours, Megawati Sukarnoputri left room 417  closely guarded and in the company of Ismunandar and Soetardjo  Soerjoguritno and proceeded to the meeting hall. Meeting  chairman Alex Asmasoebrata then opened the session.    MUNAS participants immediately applauded as each name was  pronounced by Megawati as director of the PDI DPP. When Mega  mentioned the names of Neneng Amalia D. Asmasoebrata and Edwin  H. Sukowati as deputy treasurers, however, many participants  immediately shouted, "Boo!"    After the installation and confirmation of the new PDI DPP  directors for the 1993-1998 term, which was led by meeting  chairman Alex Asmasoebrata, Megawati made her first speech to  her organization and in the presence of Department of Home  Affairs Secretary General Suryatna Subrata, who was present also  to close the MUNAS.    "The result is that the PDI will be able to do good work for  all its members, following its long journey from the congress in  Medan, the special congress in Surabaya, and this MUNAS in  Jakarta," Mega said.    Therefore, she said, let us welcome PDI's future. "Each day,  we have experienced extraordinary spiritual and physical  struggles. If PDI members cannot practice internal unity, our  desire to advance the PDI will not be achieved. Therefore, we  must all be united," she added.    "Forget the past, and look to the future with a sense of  unity. Practice that, and encourage each other. Let us together  achieve unity and integrity for the sake of the image of the PDI  and our beloved nation and republic," she urged.    Mega did not forget to salute and sincerely thank the press.  "The press has disclosed the dynamics of the PDI as they are.  For that, I say many, many thanks," Mega said at the end of the  speech, her first.  <H5>  Policy Statement </H5>   Meanwhile, spokesman Antoni Rahael issued a PDI policy  statement, which expressed determination to improve the general  welfare and national capabilities. The PDI also rejected isms  such as "marhaenism," Marxism, and Leninism, because the PDI  reached a consensus that Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian  state] is its only basis.

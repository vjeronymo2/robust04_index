			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Sport: Low-scoring trend reversed - World Cup '94 More goals, more chances, and more attempts to score. That is a snapshot of the World Cup finals so far. Helped by regulations to punish defensive and foul play, the tournament has reversed the trend to low-scoring games. This time, 36 first-round games produced 93 goals, compared to 80 four years ago. Fifa, soccer's governing body, decided to act after the 1990 World Cup produced a record low goals-per-game average of 2.2. The problems, Fifa believed, were frequent back-passing to goalkeepers, negative play to achieve a draw, and repetitive fouling to stop opponents shooting at goal. So Fifa stopped goalies collecting kicked-back passes with their hands; made the off-side rule kinder to attackers; and told referees to expel defenders who hauled down strikers when they were going for goal. It also awarded three points for a first-round win instead of two. The result, says Brazilian soccer ace Pele, is a better game to watch and good news for attackers. 'My opinion is (that) we have to applaud and congratulate Fifa because these changes have worked very well so far,' he said. 'These rule changes are the reason why we see so many goals and open games and beautiful games. I think it is perfect for the public.' Although seven first-round matches were drawn, only two failed to produce a goal. Last time, 11 first-round games saw only one goal. This time it was eight. Goalkeepers have become far busier. There has been much more goal-mouth action. 'There is more spectacle,' says Fifa's Sepp Blatter, attributing this to better match control and better behaviour by players. Russia's Salenko (six goals), Germany's Klinsmann (four), and Argentina'a Batistuta, Sweden's Dahlin and Brazil's Romario (all three) lead the list of goal-scorers. Salenko, after setting a finals goal record with five against Cameroon, will not have the opportunity to add to his tally. Bulgaria's victory over Argentina and Nigeria's win over Greece meant Russia were eliminated. 'I had hoped Russia would continue playing and maybe finish as the tournament's best scorer,' Salenko said. 'If there is any satisfaction, I'm still holding the other record.'</p>

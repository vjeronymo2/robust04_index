			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Wm Low responds to request from Sainsbury Wm Low, the Scottish supermarket group which is the target of an agreed takeover bid by Tesco, the UK's second-largest supermarket chain, confirmed yesterday it had responded to a request for information from Tesco's bigger rival, J Sainsbury. Tesco, which in a deal worth Pounds 200m is offering 225p in cash for each Wm Low ordinary share and 105 1/2 p for each convertible preference share, is expected to issue its offer document this morning. However, speculation continued to mount yesterday that Sainsbury was preparing to make a counter-bid for the retailer, which has 57 stores and 7 per cent of the Scottish grocery market. Wm Low said it had responded to a list of questions from Sainsbury - and agreed the terms of a confidentiality letter - giving it the same information it had supplied to Tesco. Sainsbury does not have a history of making hostile bids, but analysts believe Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, may be prepared to break with the past.</p>

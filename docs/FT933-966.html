			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Major found alive in far East: Even if he seems grey in public, there is plenty of vigour in private SOMETHING IS wrong here. John Major is a weak leader who is incapable of offering the leadership that Britain so badly needs. I know this because I read the Tory tabloids, whose antipathy to the Prime Minister varies only in degree. But I have just spent six days following Major on a 17,500 mile trip to Japan, Malaysia and Monaco. I got back feeling like a piece of used Sellotape. Major looked like a man without a care in the world. What is wrong with him? Doesn't he know he is in the middle of a leadership crisis? It was, admittedly, a successful trip. Major struck up a good relationship with Morihiro Hosokawa, the new Japanese Prime Minister, and tied up Pounds 1bn of business for British companies in Malaysia. And his prompt support of president Yeltsin during this week's dramatic events in Moscow showed him in a far more decisive light than poor dilatory Bill Clinton, who was still 'examining' the situation while Major was 'acting'. But none of that really matters much, does it? Major's problem is that much of the tabloid press, the institution which did so much to help him win the 1992 election, has decided that he has to go. It is not clear why. He is a bit grey; someone has to carry the can for the recession; he is not Margaret Thatcher. In itself, the media campaign is not enough to dislodge the prime minister. But it guarantees almost unlimited publicity to the right-wing backbenchers whose vitriol poured every day into journalists' notebooks. During the first four days of Major's overseas trip, the campaign was unrelenting. Comments made in London were relayed to his accompanying party of political journalists, who then demanded a response. Parts of the exchanges were seen by millions on Monday when most television news bulletins showed a clip of the Prime Minister's press conference in Tokyo. The impression given is that the Prime Minister is being hounded by tabloid journalists. He is not. Access to him is too infrequent and too closely controlled by aides for that. This is why Major is so closely questioned on the rare occasions when he does appear. But the conventions of parliamentary language have not entirely broken down. The questions may be awkward or embarrassing (sometimes to both parties), but they are always courteous. Even Gordon Greig, political editor of the rabidly anti-Major Daily Mail, has done nothing more than politely seek the prime minister's views. Major does not seem to mind much. Some of his party were very angry about the way the leadership issue dominated media coverage of his trip. Gus O'Donnell, the Prime Minister's normally equable press secretary, went so far as to call John Sergeant, a BBC reporter, a 'jerk' for raising it in Tokyo. Major kept his temper, and even made a few jokes to his Japanese hosts about the 'irrepressible' British press. Later, he appeared for a chat in the journalists' quarters in the back of the Prime Ministerial plane. It was not, colleagues tell me, a patch on his courting of the press in the first year after he replaced Margaret Thatcher. Then, they sometimes had to ask him to leave so they could eat. But what of that? I would not spend much time with them either, if it was me they were writing off every day. Nevertheless, a prime minister in this position faces an interesting question which Major seems uncerain how to answer. Should he 'hit out' at the rebels, or pretend they do not exist? He moved into the attack early in his visit to Tokyo, when he warned the rebels publicly to stop the 'stupid internecine squabbling'. Privately, his strategy has been to belittle the rebels, casting doubt on their judgment. Perhaps because he was frustrated by his inability to get this message across through his officials, Major delivered it in person to a group of journalists at a barbecue in the British embassy garden in Tokyo. His remarks were supposed to be off the record, but they were attributed to him by one newspaper, and hinted at by others - a breach of convention which would have been inconceivable if the prime minister were not perceived to be in deep trouble. Later, it emerged that one of the journalists travelling with the prime minister is in possession of a tape recording of a private conversation in which Major refers to his critics as 'barmy.' The recording was made accidentally; like the barbecue comments, it would probably have remained private but for the smell of blood in the air. This bending of the rules is more serious for Major than it may seem. Unattributable conversations with journalists are one of the principal means by which ministers communicate their views. If the prime minister can no longer make his views plain without being identified as the source - though his critics often remain anonymous - he will have lost a powerful weapon. No wonder that he is angry and frustrated. Even if he seems grey in public, there is plenty of vigour in his language in private. For example he said of one of his most voluble critics: 'Every time I hear his name I hear the flapping of white coats.' If the tabloids are right, there ought to have been a palpable atmosphere of crisis surrounding the trip. There wasn't. Major knows he has to exert his authority, but he seems to think that all that is required is a bit of plain speaking and a more engaging style. Who is to say he is wrong. The tabloids are not all powerful. Most of his critics are an unimpressive bunch. But the grey image will die hard. Touring a car plant in Malaysia, Major looked at green cars, red cars, white cars and blue cars. When it was time to pose for photographs, he sat in a grey one.</p>

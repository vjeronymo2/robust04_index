			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Germany Germany's public sector pay round has been such a humiliation for the government that it is easy to overdo its implications for the markets. The actual settlement will prove more expensive for the employers than the arbitration deal they originally rejected, so they could have saved themselves the trouble of a strike. Yet the final percentage is still within the range of expectations pencilled in by most economists. It should not of itself upset the Bundesbank. A more pressing problem remains the explosion in German money supply. If April's figure, due in a couple of weeks, does show an annual growth of over 10 per cent, as many economists fear, the central bank may come under strong pressure to raise rates again. Though interest rates are a blunt weapon, there are not many alternatives: rationing Lombard facility advances to the banking system would raise money market rates anyway. The bond market looks likely to suffer whatever happens. Premature easing by the Bundesbank would add to market worries about a government which, in the aftermath of the strike, appears to have lost its grip. If interest rates are maintained or increased, the steep inversion of the yield curve will continue to push investor funds towards short-term deposits. The fact that this is not the case in the UK and France is one more reason to expect spreads between government bonds in these countries and Germany to narrow further. But despite sterling's astonishing performance against the D-Mark since Tuesday's UK rate cut, it would not do to anticipate gilt yields actually falling below those on German bunds.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Eurotunnel to seek waiver for banking covenants EUROTUNNEL will disclose today that it is in breach of its banking covenants, or is in technical default, which means it is being forced to ask its 206 banks for permission to continue work on the Channel tunnel. Although bankers said yesterday they were hopeful that the banks would give this permission - in the form of a waiver to the covenant - they said they viewed Eurotunnel's technical default as serious. Eurotunnel's agent banks, which include National Westminster and Midland, were yesterday in Paris to discuss the issue. The company, which has Pounds 8bn of credit facilities, is in technical default because it has increased its forecast of cash outflow over the next year. It has become more pessimistic in this respect because the tunnel's opening has been delayed from June 1993 until autumn next year and a full railway service will not operate until summer 1994. As a result, Eurotunnel's revenues in the opening months of operation will be less than it had expected. But the company hopes demand for its services over the longer term will be greater than its earlier expectations. However, the contractor working on the project, Transmanche Link, has warned Eurotunnel that the tunnel may not be ready to open until the end of next year. Eurotunnel's chief executive, Sir Alastair Morton, is expected to refute speculation that the company needs to raise new funds, either from a rights issue or extra bank facilities, over the short term. Eurotunnel is expected to have around Pounds 1bn of unused bank facilities by the time the tunnel opens. However, the company may launch a rights issue after the tunnel has opened. Bankers said the process of obtaining waivers would be more difficult in the light of Eurotunnel's setback last month in its long-running dispute over building costs with TML. An independent disputes panel ruled that Eurotunnel should triple its monthly progress payments to the contractors to more than Pounds 70m. The first payment is due next Thursday. Eurotunnel is likely to challenge the ruling. Bankers said these additional payments to TML have not yet been built into Eurotunnel's financial projections.</p>

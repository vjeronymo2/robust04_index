			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (6): Search for new alliances - Japan's component suppliers feel the strain TIMES are getting tough for Japan's automotive components makers. A three-year downturn in domestic demand has hit hard at the finances of Japan's leading automobile assemblers. The slump from the very high rates of growth of the late 1980s is expected to be followed by only very weak growth in the next few years as Japanese manufacturers face protectionist limits on their exports and largely replacement demand at home. As a result, car assemblers are embarking upon restructuring plans. These moves pale in comparison with the sweeping job cuts announced by the German car makers such as Daimler Benz and Volkswagen. But in the Japanese context they are quite radical. Nissan's decision to close its Zama production plant in 1995 and transfer production to a more modern, under-utilised plant in Kyushu, the southern-most island is the most radical step yet taken by a car maker to cut costs. Nissan plans to shed 5,000 of its 53,000 staff in the next three years. Meanwhile all car makers are re-assessing the marketing and manufacturing strategies which made them successful in the 1980s, but only at a cost. The Japanese car makers added fixed costs in the 1980s as they expanded their share of the world market. These costs were mainly due to the high costs of making a wide range of very different models, with many variations. The downturn has exposed these high fixed costs. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, the president of Toyota said recently the company would reduce the number of styles on individual models and standardise components to cut costs. More models will share common components. Most car companies have announced plans to cut the number of components they use by about 30 per cent over the next few years. The main casualties of this rationalisation are unlikely to be the direct, lifetime employees of the car companies. Toyota for instance plans to cut costs without reducing its workforce of 74,000. The main burden will be born by sub-contractors which make components. Nissan estimates that sub-contracted components account for about 70 per cent of its manufacturing costs, compared with the 60 per cent share claimed by leading European manufacturers. With such a high proportion of costs outside the boundaries of the company, Nissan will target component makers as a significant area for costs-saving. Japanese component makers are used to bearing the strain of responding to down-turns in demand with cuts in the prices of the components they supply. But this time it could be different. Car makers are likely to embark on a more far-reaching rationalisation of sub-contracting which will bring winners and losers. According to Mr Kenneth Courtiss, chief Asian economist at the Tokyo branch of Deutsche Bank, leading Japanese car makers are planning to cut overall production costs by 30 to 40 per cent in the next few years, compared with a target of up to 20 per cent in the European industry - 'the Japanese car makers are preparing a new productivity miracle,' he says. THE source of this productivity improvement is likely to come from shifting even further to modular production, with entire sub-systems made off-line and inserted into the model. Large subcontractors who make sophisticated systems will probably benefit. They are likely to form ever-closer relationships with the final assemblers. The people likely to suffer are the thousands of smaller, commodity components makers which cluster around plants like Zama. Often no more than back street workshops run by family companies, these suppliers are likely to feel the pinch of the car assemblers' move towards more standardised components. The pressures are already prompting car manufacturers and components makers to consider new relationships and alliances. The trade pressure which Japan is under, combined with the rising cost of developing technologically advanced sub-systems for cars, means that foreign suppliers may figure slightly more in the Japanese supply system in future. Nissan, for instance, is strengthening its alliance with the German car components maker Robert Bosch, which has bought a stake of almost 10 per cent in a leading Nissan supplier, Unisia. The company is expected to become a leading Nissan supplier by combining Unisia's existing brake technology and Bosch's engine control electronics. The size of the deal, which is worth about Y5.14bn is not the best measure of its significance. More important is the way it changes Bosch's role: it is shifting from being a mere supplier of alternators to Nissan to become deeply involved in the development of electronics systems for Nissan cars. Toyota will soon start design development with Ford, which could lead the Japanese group to use Ford components in its car for the first time. Toyota will study whether to use Ford's cruise-control technology. Toyota already buys components such as shock absorbers and radiators from General Motors. Its current supplier of cruise-controls is Nippon Denso, its affiliated supplier. Mitsubishi Motors is planning to use engines and transmissions manufactured by Chrysler, the US vehicle group. MEANWHILE, the downturn is also forcing the Japanese suppliers to search out new alliances. Vehicle assemblers are increasingly considering larger components and sharing some model production: Nissan and Mazda will swap light vehicles and trucks, for instance. These alliances among vehicle makers are in turn forcing components makers to consider alliances, too. Japanese car manufacturers maintain dedicated chains of suppliers. The lack of overlap among suppliers constrains their volume and makes their costs higher than they would be. The walls between suppliers for different car makers may be starting to crumble, ever so slightly. Nissan in May took the unprecedented step of agreeing to buy parts from a supplier affiliated to Toyota, its arch rival. Nissan will buy about Y1bn of parts from Aisan Industry an affiliated supplier in which Toyota has a large minority shareholding. The deal is small and it does not come into force until 1995 but it could pave they way for other car manufacturers to break through the strict demarcation lines between suppliers. Nissan said it made the move because the vacuum pumps made by Aisan are more reliable than the pumps it currently uses.</p>

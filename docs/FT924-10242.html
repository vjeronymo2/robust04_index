			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / France and Italy plan protection for sea THE FRENCH and Italian governments are planning to create two protection zones for the natural life in the Mediterranean Sea, in an attempt to shield fish and other endangered species. Ms Segolene Royal, the French minister for the environment, and Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, her Italian counterpart, agreed yesterday, during their meeting at Aosta in Italy, to set up two special zones. One would be in an area between Corsica and Sardinia, the other by the Hyeres islands off the French port of Toulon, where naval traffic and fishing would be severely restricted. The two ministers are forming a working party to finalise proposals for special nature zones in the Mediterranean. They are also joining Mr Flavio Cotti, their opposite number in Switzerland, to try to impose environmental protective measures on the rail network through the Alps.</p>

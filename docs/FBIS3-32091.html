			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nassau, Bahamas, 1 Feb, CANA -- Opposition leader  Sir Lynden Pindling and his Progressive Liberal Party [PLP]  Monday night tabled a motion of no confidence against Prime  Minister Hubert Ingraham, over the recent resignation of Justice  Ira Rowe from the Bahamas Court of Appeals.    He also tabled a resolution condemning the justice minister  and the attorney general. Pindling claimed that new evidence had  surfaced in the abrupt resignation of the Jamaican judge.  Additional information, he claimed, has convinced the opposition  that the 17-month-old government, through Justice Minister Janet  Bostwick, interfered with the judicial process.    Pindling, former prime minister of 25 years, also claimed  that Attorney General Orville Turnquest presented a misleading  position in a television interview, and that Ingraham misled  parliament in a communication on the matter.    Ingraham branded Pindling's allegation an "outright lie." He  said he had no problem with such a debate and offered to change  the House of Assembly's agenda on Wednesday and Thursday to  accommodate the PLP.    "It is dead wrong for Sir Lynden Pindling to seek to mislead  the Bahamian public and bring into contempt the judicial  system," Ingraham said. The government, he continued, was  completely satisfied that it acted in the best interest of the  people and consistent with its oath of office to uphold the laws  of The Bahamas.    Rowe resigned in December after the Ministry of Justice,  through the registrar of the supreme court, told him that it was  not prepared to facilitate his presence in Nassau to hear an  appeal challenging the lawfulness of a commission of inquiry  appointed to investigate allegations of misuse of public funds  under the former Pindlng regime. The appeal was lodged by  Maurice Glinton, lawyer for Phillip Herman Bethel. The inquiry  was told that Bethel indirectly received a substantial amount of  maoney that had been paid by Boeing of Canada as commission on  the sale of Dehavilland aircraft to the state-owned Bahamasair.  Bethel is the son of Philip Bethel, a former Bahamasair chairman  and PLP minister. During the recent hearing, Justice Vincent  Melville, chairman of The Bahamas Court of Appeals, stated that  he was telephoned by Justice Rowe last December 4. Justice Rowe  informed the president that he had an application for Glinton.    Justice Melville said he informed Justice Rowe not to deal  with the matter as there was someone in The Bahamas who could  deal with it. Glinton had flown to Jamaica to get Justice Rowe  to entertain his application. Ingraham said that the chief  justice of The Bahamas has always dealt with applications of  appeal since the court of appeal was established in The Bahamas  28 years ago.    Ingraham said that his government was sworn to uphold the  laws of The Bahamas and not to allow anyone "under any cloak" to  subvert the laws of the country.</p>

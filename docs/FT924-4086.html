			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Clinton's backing sought MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is expected to ask US president-elect Bill Clinton to see Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, as soon as possible after his January 20 inauguration. Britain hopes to persuade the US not to place conditions on its renewal of China's most favoured nation trading status, partly because of the adverse effect it would have on the Hong Kong economy, in which US business has a large stake. At the same time, Mr Patten hopes to win Mr Clinton's endorsement for his plans for more democracy in the colony. It is hoped that the US could, behind the scenes, support the governor's proposals. 'The US is the only country in the world that has any influence on the Chinese leadership,' said one British official. The manoeuvre will have to be conducted carefully. China is already incensed by what it sees as the 'internationalisation' of the Hong Kong issue. Canada, Australia and the US have been criticised by Beijing for supporting Mr Patten's proposals. Mr Clinton will be required by June 3 next year to approve China's MFN renewal. During Mr George Bush's presidency, Democrats in both houses of the US Congress have favoured placing conditions on MFN renewal because of China's poor human rights record. Mr Patten's planned mission to the US has been given added urgency by the sharp deterioration in Sino-British relations. Officials in Hong Kong fear that Congress may seek to link the colony's political development to the renewal of MFN rights. Congress and the new administration are expected to begin in the spring to draw up their policy about MFN renewal. This will be at the same time as Hong Kong's local legislature is debating Mr Patten's proposals to extend democracy in the territory.</p>

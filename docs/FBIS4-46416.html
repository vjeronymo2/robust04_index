			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah </F> by Dr. Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad in Beirut--date not given]    [Excerpts] Ahmad: Hizballah's name has been  associated with martyrdom. How would you describe Hizballah's  experiment in the past decade through its resistance operations  in the south and its association with the notion of martyrdom?    Nasrallah: From the start, Hizballah was  established as a jihad movement, and it operated on this basis.  [passage omitted on difficult circumstances during Hizballah's  inception] We believe that this jihad movement, which is still  continuing, could develop further and could be generalized, and  this is what we are looking forward to. We want to see this  resistance in all the cordon states around the Zionist enemy.    Ahmad: With the liberation of all the Lebanese  soil, will the suicidal performance of the Islamic movement in  the south be affected or will it continue in various forms until  Palestine and Jerusalem are liberated?    Nasrallah: In fact this question has been the  focus of interest in many circles. One thing is clear in all  cases. When the Israeli enemy withdraws from the Lebanese  territories, the resistance will stop at that level. As for the  rest of the question and the types of action, this is premature;  the matter will be subject to developments and the situations  that might arise. As far as principles are concerned, we  believe that Palestine is an occupied land, that Israel is a  usurper entity, and that the Palestinians are primarily  responsible for liberating this land. They are entitled to  support from all Arab and Muslim nations until all the land is  liberated. As for how and through which methods, this will be  determined in time. [passage omitted on condemnation of regional  peace talks with Israel and domestic situation in Lebanon]    Ahmad: This takes us to the parliamentary  experience and your assessment of it. Some Islamic movements in  other countries reject the idea of the parliamentary experience  for several reasons, including reasons that have to do with  jurisprudence. What is your assessment of this experience in  terms of jurisprudence, as well as actually and politically in  Lebanon, particularly after Hizballah's entry into the  parliament and its becoming the biggest partisan power in the  parliament?    Nasrallah: [passage omitted on unique conditions  in each Islamic country] We now come to the parliamentary  experience. When we entered the parliamentary battle, we had a  set of objectives and goals. We wanted to have a voice in the  parliament to call for resistance. Our priorities in Lebanon  are different from other Islamic movements elsewhere. Some  Islamic movements give priority to overthrowing the regime and  establishing an Islamic state. Accordingly, they move in that  direction. We believe that our top and dominant priority is to  fight Israel, expel the Israeli occupier, and arouse the nation  to establish a major popular, Islamic resistance that restores  Jerusalem and rids the nation of that cancerous growth. Hence,  we are primarily concerned with enhancing efforts in the  direction of that priority at all the political and legal  levels. This requires being within an institution that is  capable of providing some kind of support to the resistance  movement. Therefore, we endeavored to support the resistance  after entering the parliament. In that context, we developed  other objectives, like defending the victims of injustice from  within the parliament and providing better conditions for our  people through submitting bills and discussing government plans  and budget.

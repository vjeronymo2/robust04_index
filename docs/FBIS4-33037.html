			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Peruvian Economy Minister Jorge Camet; place </F> and date not given]    [Text] [EXPRESO] We still do not know what to do with the  money obtained from the privatization process and now you have  an extra $1.1 billion from the Support Group. What will we do  with so much money?    [Camet] Aside from the money, these meetings are very  positive because very high-level experts of the Support Group  member countries and organization participate in them. They  assess us and voice their concern over Peru. We listen and  learn from their suggestions but we also inform them about what  we are doing and what is happening in Peru. Last year we  obtained $900 million...    [EXPRESO] What did you do with that $900 million?    [Camet] Some $450 million of it was loans from multilateral  enterprises and the CAF [Andean Development Corporation]. This  includes $200 million from the World Bank and the IDB  [International Development Bank] for the Foncodes [National  Compensation and Social Development Fund]. There is $98 million  from the IDB for the health sector. Then there is between $50  and $100 million from the PNUD [UN Development Program] and some  $400 million in condoned debts. A total $300 million of  condoned debts has materialized. Switzerland, for example,  condoned $130 million.    [EXPRESO] What about this year?    [Camet] We are waiting for the World Bank, which arranges  the  Support Group meetings, to itemize the $1.1 billion. Some $250  million is earmarked for donations and technical assistance.  The remaining $850 million are soft and normal loans from  multilateral enterprises and countries represented at the  meeting.    [EXPRESO] Does it include all the loans from the  multilateral  organizations?    [Camet] Not all of them. Only those for the sectors for  which we have asked the Support Group for help. Last year we  asked for financial aid for Foncodes, for the health and  education fields. This year we have asked for assistance to  solve the poverty problem and for a very ambitious long-term  program to eradicate poverty. The World Bank, for example, has  financed the construction of rural neighborhood roads in the  poorest zones. That sort of thing.    [EXPRESO] As for the letter of intent, we were surprised to  see that the government intends to implement additional taxes if  it does not attain the 12.1 percent goal.    [Camet] Some interpretations are incorrect. There are  rumors, for example, that there will be no more stability  contracts [contratos de estabilidad] or that they will be  eliminated. This is not true. There might be a translation  problem. We have agreed that the government will respect the  stability contracts. We will not generate new stability  contracts with special clauses compared to other stability  contracts already approved. Nobody will get more than others,  or more than what is established by law. This is the agreement  we have reached. We have also agreed to allow enterprises on  the border or in jungle areas -- with which we have signed  stability contracts -- to cancel them, but by negotiation. If  an enterprise in a given zone enjoys certain privileges, then no  other enterprise can settle in the same zone and compete. That  would not be right.    [EXPRESO] Well, what about additional taxes?    [Camet] We agreed to a 12.1 percent tax revenue and we want  Sunat [National Tax Administration Superintendency] to attain  this goal. The entire program is based on the 12.1 percent tax  revenue, and it must be attained.    [EXPRESO] Do you think the 12.1 percent tax revenue is  feasible?    [Camet] Of course. Last year we concentrated on curbing  inflation. This year we will concentrate on increasing our tax  revenue. The money obtained through the privatization program  cannot be used because we do not have a primary tax revenue  surplus. The Sunat has done a good supervision job within the  organization, cross-checking computer data, but now greater  supervision outside the institution is necessary. The internal  IGV [General Sales Tax] must grow. A few months ago we hired  two foreign experts: a Chilean expert supervisor and another  expert in pinpointing sectors where the tax evasion is worse.  He will determine where we must start work. Internal IGV  evasion amounts to 7 percent of the GDP. With these efforts and  determination, and with some psychological actions like jailing  some people, we will reduce tax evasion by at least one point  this year. We will thus be able to use idle money obtained from  privatizations without affecting the program.    [EXPRESO] We thought the IGV revenue amounted to around 4  percent of the GDP. If it should have amounted to 9 percent  (half of the tax), how can evasion amount to 7 percent?    [Camet] Yes, but from that 4 percent you must subtract what  is collected at the customs (external IGV) and you have the  internal IGV. The level of taxes collected by customs is good  but they have a ceiling which is established by the  importations. It is very close to this ceiling. The internal  IGV has great potential but it does not increase enough.    [EXPRESO] But 18 percent is very high.    [Camet] We are talking about increasing our tax revenue by  one point this year. That is all. Late last year -- by forcing  taxpayers -- we reached 11.4 percent of the GDP. This means we  could reach 12.1 percent. This year we must make a great effort  in two critical areas: tax revenue and generating job  opportunities.    [EXPRESO] What do you mean by generating job opportunities?  Are you talking about Foncodes?    [Camet] No, not only Foncodes. Foncodes is a temporary and  urgent relief at this moment for the extreme poverty problem.  It is a matter of generating job opportunities.    [EXPRESO] The exchange rate does not seem to be a matter of  concern in the letter of intent.    [Camet] It is a matter of concern. Experts are exhaustively  studying this problem.    [EXPRESO] At the Economy Ministry or at the BCR [Central  Reserve Bank]?    [Camet] Foreign experts are studying the problem at the  Economy Ministry. They are also studying the problem at the  BCR, of course. Right now there are plenty of dollars and we are  investigating, and that is the reason why there are so many  dollars because the deposits in the banks have ceased to  increase and drug traffickers could not have increased the  amount of dollars in the past few months.    [EXPRESO] Has the government being using Treasury funds to  maintain the exchange rate...    [Camet] We have been helping. We purchased dollars to make  an early payment on the foreign debt, for example. Somehow or  another we have to help the BCR with Treasury funds, cautiously,  because the emission capacity is limited. We cannot go issuing  a great quantity of money for this purpose.    [EXPRESO] Another issue is the monetization or emission  level. In March we issued money above the target we had  established. It is also true that there is a greater demand for  soles, which would justify a somewhat greater emission.    [Camet] This is another issue we are assessing: How long can  we continue monetizing. The more substantial emission in March  (3.5 percent instead of 1.9 percent) was not significant in  absolute terms: it only amounted to 40 million soles, which is  not very much. That amount will by no means generate inflation.  It is true that the demand for soles is increasing. I once  told [Foreign Relations Committee member] Manuel Moreyra that  dedollarization is a mental process. It will take years for  Peruvians to regain confidence in our currency. This is  beginning to happen gradually. We have already surpassed  inflationary expectations. The greater the demand for soles,  the more currency we can issue without causing inflation.    [EXPRESO] The letter of intent talks of about 20 percent  emission for the entire year.    [Camet] That is what we believe. We will see if a little  more can be issued without affecting our anti-inflationary goal.  The letter of intent is not inflexible. If someone comes up  with a survey showing it is technically feasible to issue -- let  us say -- 25 percent instead of 20 percent, we can do so. The  IMF is an auditor. The letter of intent describes what the  government intends to do. We draft the letter and discuss it  with the IMF, but we are the ones who draft it.</p>

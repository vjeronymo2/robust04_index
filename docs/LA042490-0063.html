			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LENINGRAD BALLET PERFORMANCE IN S.D. CANCELED  </P> <P> The May 12 performance by the Leningrad State Ballet has been canceled by its  sponsor, the California Ballet, because of a continuing dispute over the  ownership of works created by the Soviet company's late founder Leonid  Jakobson.  </P> <P> The company, under the direction of former Kirov Ballet dancer Askold Makarov  since Jakobson's death in 1975, is battling with Jakobson's widow and son over  copyrights to more than 100 Jakobson works, including the "Choreographic  Miniatures," which were to have been performed in San Diego.  </P> <P> The dispute involves international copyright laws, but also Irina Jakobson's  displeasure with her husband's successor.  </P> <P> "It's a question of copyrights," said California Ballet director Maxine Mahon.  "The Leningrad Ballet owns the rights, according to Soviet law. But Jakobson's  widow filed copyright papers with the American copyright office March 30, and  we don't want to put the California Ballet in jeopardy by going ahead with the  concert."  </P> <P> Mahon said she received a fax message from a Soviet agency Friday, advising her  not to present the Jakobson works by the Leningrad company.  </P> <P> M. J. Bogatin, a San Francisco attorney representing the Jakobson family,  discounted Mahon's claim.  </P> <P> "She's wrong. The copyrights are absolutely the property of the widow, and the  Leningrad State Ballet has no claim of rights whatsoever of ownership to these  copyrights," he said. "They are entitled to perform them in the Soviet Union  under compulsory rights, but not in the United States.  </P> <P> The local performance would have been the company's U. S. debut. A six-city  East Coast tour is still scheduled for late May, although the company will not  perform any Jakobson works, according to producer Lev Eynisfeld. Mahon said  California Ballet would not present the Leningrad company in a program without  works by Jakobson, "because that's what we've been promoting for a year and a  half. We had made a commitment and felt we would take it in the chops if we  delivered something else."  </P> <P> Paul Epstein, a lawyer with the New York firm of Proskauer, Rose Goetz &amp;  Mendelsohn, has also been retained by the Jakobson family. He confirmed that  American copyrights were filed "recently" and said the choreographer's widow,  Irina Jakobson, who is now a teacher at the San Francisco Ballet, has  "presumptive ownership in this country."  </P> <P> Bogatin added that Jakobson's widow "has always been amenable to the licensing  of the choreography to the California Ballet, but through her own sanctioned  instructors and performers. She would welcome the opportunity for more  exposure, but can't sit idly by while unsanctioned performances take place."  </P> <P> In March, Jakobson told The Times that Makarov is not maintaining her husband's  work properly. She cited this as the reason that she and her son don't want  California Ballet learning the works from Makarov and his dancers.  </P> <P> Makarov has been in residency at the San Diego-based company to set the  Jakobson pieces on the local dancers.  </P> <P> "He'll stay on for several weeks," said Mahon, "and he'll be teaching the  dancers other (non-Jakobson) works. Fortunately, the dancers haven't (left)  Leningrad yet, so we just decided to cancel before they had to leave."  </P> <P> Mahon estimates that about 50% of the tickets had been sold to the performance  in the 3,000-seat Civic Theatre and said cash refunds will be available to all  ticket holders.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fionnuala Halligan] </F>   [Text] China has moved to limit film co-productions and  completely stamp out movie-making joint ventures in a set of new  rules which are alarming Hong Kong filmmakers.    Furthermore, the Ministry of Culture wants to have all films  shot on the mainland processed and censored in China--even if it  is not going to be released domestically.    This is despite the existing rule that all scripts be  approved by the authorities before permission is given to film.    The moves come as part of a crackdown on Western  infiltration  in China, which saw laws recently passed banning the private  ownership of satellite dishes. They are also connected to  China's embarrassment over two "anti-government" productions  shown internationally last year, Beijing Bastards and The Blue  Kite.    Under the new regulations, only 26 co-productions will be  allowed annually on the mainland. Last year more than 30 Hong  Kong productions were shot in China. It is not clear whether  all these will in future be classified as co-productions.    At present, a producer wishing to film in China must either  pay one of the 16 officially sanctioned Chinese studios for  co-operation and use of the studio (a production "in association  with"), or the Chinese studio can invest in the film making it a  co-production.    "We don't really know where we stand now," said the head of  the Hong Kong Motion Picture Association Peter Tsi.    "We still haven't received any confirmed reports. We will be  taking this up with the New China News Agency [XINHUA] at our  next meeting for clarification.    "This is not a beneficial thing for the Chinese film  industry  and we wonder do they know this." The new rules come as Chinese  movies--largely backed by Hong Kong and Taiwanese production  companies--are gaining wide international recognition.    Last week, Chen Kaige's Farewell to My Concubine won the  Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. If joint ventures are  banned, such productions may not be possible in future. "If  their objective is to stop film-makers seeking finance from  abroad, then they may well succeed," said Hong Kong producer Shu  Kei. "I know I would not agree to these conditions."  "Definitely, the Hong Kong and Taiwanese film industries will  be hit the hardest."    "It's hard to know how this will pan out," said Barbara  Robinson of ERA, which produced award-winning director Zhang  Yimou's Huozhe (To Live), currently in post-production.    "It's obvious China is trying to control this thing a little  bit better. But we are still very comfortable in our  relationship with the authorities. Pronouncements are one  thing; how the policy gets worked out is another."</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> TALK WITH THE BRUTE, OR IT'S WAR UNKNOWN;  </P> <P> DIRECT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAQ ARE THE ONLY HOPE FOR A BLOODLESS  SOLUTION.  </P> <P> "If World War III ever starts," Robert F. Kennedy once told me, "it won't start  suddenly. Each side will take an action to which the other side will feel  compelled to respond as a matter of prestige and credibility. Finally we will  reach the point where it seems the only choice is who shall strike first. And  that will be the end of the world."  </P> <P> Although the stakes are smaller, we seem to have painted ourselves into just  this kind of a corner in the uninhabitable sands of the Middle East. And in a  travesty of democracy, a violation of the Constitution, the decision -- whether  or not to go to war -- seems to reside solely within the modestly intelligent  but very stubborn mind of George Bush. Congress has once again abdicated its  responsibility to decide and debate questions of war and peace, preferring to  leave the issues to the secret councils of an enigmatic executive power.  </P> <P> Of course Saddam Hussein is a nasty, brutal and even dangerous leader. His  conquest of Kuwait was a totally unjustified aggression. But it is done. We  failed to take immediate action, and preferred to assemble massive forces  giving Iraq time to expand and entrench its defenses. Now we must decide  whether to attack Iraq, a course which will almost certainly -- although  nothing is certain in war -- result in tens of thousands of casualties and  whose outcome cannot be foreseen.  </P> <P> Writing about the Civil War, Bruce Catton stated, "A singular fact about modern  war is that it takes charge. Once it has begun it has to be carried to its  conclusion, and carrying it there sets in motion events that may be beyond  men's control."  </P> <P> This truth was brutally reconfirmed for the United States in North Korea and in  Vietnam. There is no foreseeable end to a war in Iraq. Even should Kuwait be  retaken we will have to continue the fighting across the Iraqi border until we  conquer that country also, or at least destroy its leadership. That conflict  will almost certainly involve Israeli entry into the battle, and the  participation of other countries -- a melange of combatants with widely  different interests. There is no way to predict the final outcome, except that  it will be bloody, destructive and costly enough to weaken severely an already  declining American economy.  </P> <P> Is there, then, no way out from so conjectural and potentially disastrous a  course? There can be no certainty about the answer. But one thing is certain,  we are failing -- abysmally, unconscionably -- to pursue alternatives.  </P> <P> It seems self-evident that direct talks between the United States and Hussein  offer the only hope for a peaceful solution. One recalls our unwillingness to  negotiate with Hanoi because "it would constitute a recognition of their  importance as a belligerent." Of course talks with Hanoi might not have  affected the course of the war. And discussion with Hussein might be futile.  But to accept military action as the only possibility almost guarantees a  bloody and uncertain conflagration.  </P> <P> Along with negotiations, we should make it clear that we intend to defend Saudi  Arabia. As for Kuwait, some kind of compromise is inevitable. It is not in the  national interest of the United States to begin a large-scale military conflict  in order to return every inch of Kuwaiti soil to the small, affluent oligarchy  that ruled that country. At the same time we should continue and strengthen  sanctions as part of the effort to persuade Hussein that his interest, too,  lies in a peaceful resolution.  </P> <P> If George Bush launches a war without having exhausted every possibility of a  peaceful accommodation, he will have the blood of thousands on his hands.  Moreover, he will have accelerated the now obvious decline of the American  economy and of American ability to help maintain world order. No American  interest -- whether it is the protection of our allies or the free flow of oil  -- is jeopardized by a patient and perhaps long-sustained effort to arrive at a  non-military resolution. Unless, of course, our hidden purpose is to destroy  Hussein and his war machine. But to embark on a deliberate effort to obliterate  them will cause enormous damage to the United States -- in lives, in money and  in a further diminution of the ideals that are the bonds of the Republic.  </P> <P> For the half century since World War II, we confronted a far more dangerous foe  than Iraq. We did not go to war. Instead our policy was containment. And it  worked. The same type of policy in the Middle East is certainly worth a try. Of  course, that calls for patient endurance. The boys won't be home by Christmas.  But if it does succeed, they will be home alive.  </P></p>

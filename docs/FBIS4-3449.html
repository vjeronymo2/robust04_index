			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yue Shan (1471 1472): "The Liberation Army's </F> Communications Center Gets Into Trouble"]    [Text] The Communications Center Suddenly Stopped  Operating At a few minutes to 1800 on the afternoon of 8  February, the military communications of the General Staff and  Logistics Departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army  suddenly stopped operating, and this lasted for more than 20  minutes. At 1815 on the same day, the Central Military  Commission ordered the Beijing Military Region and the Beijing  Garrison to take precautions; Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the  Central Military Commission, hurried to the Central Military  Commission Office to call a meeting and wait for a report on the  incident.    The communications center of the General Staff and Logistics  Departments, located in Beijing's Nanyuan, is responsible for  carrying out regular contacts with the headquarters of the major  military regions throughout the country, group armies, and all  of the arms and services, as well as military bases. In  emergencies, this center issues orders and instructions. Here,  the General Staff Department has 92 special communications lines  and the General Logistics Department has more than 70 special  communications lines. These communications lines link directly  to the headquarters of major military regions and the arms and  services, as well as military bases. The military power supply  system is solely responsible for supplying electricity to the  communications center and is governed by rules and regulations,  with weekly checks and maintenance provided as well as a general  check at the beginning of each month and during holidays. It is  said that equipment for the center was imported from northern  Europe in 1990 and is the most advanced in the world.  <H5>  Six Military Personnel Sent to Military Court for </H5> Dereliction of Duty The first outage occurred at 1755 on 8  February, just before a shift change, during which more than 20  communications lines went down in the fourth zone, which  includes the Shenyang Military Region, the Lanzhou Military  Region, the group armies stationed in North China, the North Sea  Fleet, all the Air Force bases in North China, and the No. 801  missile base under the 2d Artillery Corps. Communications  returned to normal at 1820. When the outage occurred, Zhang  Zhen, Zhang Wannian, Chi Haotian, and Fu Quanyou hurried to  Nanyuan, where they ordered an investigation. Liu Huaqing, who  was on an inspection tour of Fujian, also sent an emergency  telegram to find out about the situation and was at one point  ready to return to Beijing to handle the matter. It was  verified that the accident occurred in this way: Four of the  six personnel in charge of the communications with the fourth  zone went out to buy wine when it was almost time for shift  change, with only two staying at their post. In violation of  discipline, the two turned off some of the equipment, left the  room, and locked it. When the four returned, they could not open  the door and communications were down for 20 minutes. After the  accident, the six military personnel (including a major, who was  the group leader) were sent to a military court for questioning.  It is said that if convicted of this dereliction of duty, the  main offender could be sentenced to death or at least 15 years'  imprisonment.  <H5>  The Communications Center Went Down Twice </H5>   A communications outage occurred again at the center on 19  February, which lasted for almost eight minutes. This was  caused by a fire in the office of the communications center's  duty officer. At about 2200, the duty officer and a security  guard were drinking wine in the office and were soon drunk.  Their lighted cigarettes set some newspapers ablaze and a fire  broke out. Fortunately, a patrolling guard saw it and sounded  the alarm. Some soldiers stationed in the center put out the  fire and gave the order to turn off the equipment. They also  reported the incident to the General Staff Department and the  Central Military Commission. Subsequently, Zhang Wannian and Li  Jijun went to the scene for an inspection. The duty officer and  the security guard were arrested immediately.  <H5>  All Communications Personnel of the General Staff and </H5> Logistics Departments Were Transferred    After these two fires, all of the working personnel at the  communications center of the General Staff and Logistics  Departments were transferred in March and replaced by personnel  from Air Force Headquarters and a department directly under the  Central Military Commission. Subsequently, the Central Military  Commission gave the following orders: These two communications  outages should be explained internally as routine equipment  checks; no meetings will be held, nor circulars issued.    Now, high-level CPC leaders are facing many knotty problems  and have taken a high degree of precautions. If these  "accidents," which are neither too big nor too small, happen  again, their already taut nerves will become even more keyed up.</p>

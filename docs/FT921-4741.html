			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The tangy scent of hand-made success - A company which works hard to preserve its image A BOUQUET of interesting niffs assaults the nostrils of anyone venturing deep into the countryside. The smell of newly-mown crops, the tang of silage, the pong of manure generated by Britain's 190m farm animals. At the back of the high street in the Wiltshire village of Sherston the whiffs are of something different. Garlic, fresh onion, fenugreek. 'If I'm not mistaken, that's barbecue sauce,' says William Tullberg. Since messing about in his kitchen making a home-brew mustard 21 years ago, Tullberg has built one those tiny family-owned food companies that dot the British employment landscape. It has not scaled the heights of Baxters, the much older Scottish soup and condiment maker, but Wiltshire Tracklements cooked up turnover last year of Pounds 503,000, supporting four members of the family and a 14 full and part-time staff. Wiltshire Tracklements offers that ideal combination of whirring machinery and the Good Life. A door leads straight from the factory to the Tullbergs' own kitchen, at the other end of which is a vista of the river Avon and the rolling edges of the Cotswolds. Since 1988 yearly sales have leapt 125 per cent. 'The jump has been caused by being fashionable,' says Jennifer Tullberg, company secretary and William's wife. 'A lot of other companies went quite big last year and then went under, so we picked up part of their business too.' The 'tracklements' (a regional word for a food accompaniment) includes 14 types of mustard, Cumberland sauce (port, oranges, redcurrant juice), mince meat with calvados and apple and sage jelly. They all come in small jars with highly distinctive labelling, retailing at up to Pounds 1.50 each and selling in around 300 delis, greengrocers and butchers as well as in Harrods and at the Royal Horticultural Society at Wisley. Mustards still make up 45 per cent of sales. The Tullbergs purchased the one acre site in Sherston seven years ago for Pounds 70,000, spending a further Pounds 100,000 on it. The site includes a shop which adds Pounds 12,000 a year to sales, a house and the tiny factory that was once a bakery. Apart from horseradish whose cream requires a preservative, the company's products are additive-free. Unlike many condiment makers the company feeds spices like black peppercorns and chillies into the mustard seed grinding process (rather than later) to preserve oils and flavour, uses cider and wine vinegar rather than cheaper malt vinegar, buys whole, frozen herbs and not powdered, and does not add water to gain bulk. The production unit incorporates some dinky equipment. A grinding machine pulverises the locally-grown yellow mustard seed and the black seed from Canada. A whirling apparatus shreds onions while another tool mixes pectin, an apple derivative used to set jellies. Four waist-high boiling vats produce the final mixtures, concoctions stirred by plastic paddles. A jar-filling apparatus, a vacuumpacker bought for Pounds 35,000 and a Pounds 6,000 second-hand labelling machine rub shoulders with plastic tubs holding turmeric, juniper berries and almonds. Some 60 per cent of Wiltshire Tracklements' sales are from own-label products, most of the rest sold under other labels like elderberry wine jelly for the National Trust and grapefruit marmalade sold by Stonham. A small element of sales derive from chutneys imported from India. Tullberg, a food industry manager before going it alone, says exports account for almost a fifth of sales. The company has got this without trying much. A Spanish agent approached the Tullbergs at a food show in London and an Australian, on the look out for unusual products for her homeland, spotted the Wiltshire Tracklements label in Harrods. Tullberg has just visited the US on a sales trip. The company makes a net return of about 10 per cent though its pre-tax profits are only Pounds 5,000. 'We are loading up our pensions and that sort of thing,' says Tullberg. William and Jennifer take out yearly salaries of Pounds 18,000 between them and their son, Guy, who runs the factory Pounds 14,000. Many small food companies eventually ponder the problem of whether to supply supermarket chains when they come knocking. Waitrose, Fine Fare and Tesco all approached Wiltshire Tracklements though Tesco's price requirements were so tough the Tullbergs could not match them and still make their present rate of profit. Tullberg says flogging his own brand products to supermarkets could cripple Wiltshire Tracklements' product image. 'That does not debar us from producing for a supermarket's own label. I would not like to do that though unless it was a manageable percentage of what we could cope with if we suddenly lost that business. I would put that manageable percentage at ten per cent.' The company is moving soon to a larger site which will triple potential production capacity. With so many relatively small outlets, transport takes some organising, swallowing up ten per cent of business costs. The company has a 1.5 tonne van for deliveries which makes at least one trip a month to London, Tullberg and managing director John Wilkins do some of the driving. The Tullbergs say they are determined not to compromise their 'hand-made' production system even if output grows. Expansion raises the issue of financing. Tullberg says the company's biggest headache is cash flow. The delay between buying raw materials to receiving payments for deliveries ranges between two and three and a half months. The company taps into a Pounds 40,000 overdraft to fund this. 'We are confident that if we grow at no more than 20 per cent a year we won't have to change our habits drastically nor need much outside finance,' Tullberg says. 'We also believe there is enough in the market to allow us to do that without too much recourse to direct selling to supermarkets.'

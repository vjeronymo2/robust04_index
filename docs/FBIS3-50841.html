At a public rally in  St. John's this week, the party presented its 16 candidates for  the poll, constitutionally due by March.    Political leader Baldwin Spencer said: "The people of  Antigua  and Barbuda .... Are ready to take our country back." He added:  "We cannot claim to be a nation when we have not developed a  nation economy. We cannot claim to be a nation when we are not  in charge of our own affairs. We cannot claim to be a nation  when we are dominated by foreign interests."    The parliamentary opposition leader admitted that "the  challenge before (the party) is not easy." Spencer charged that  the ruling Antigua Labour Party (ALP) "has failed miserably ....  to do great things for the country."    The UPP's deputy political leader, Tim Hector, said the  party  was planning a national demonstration against the governor  general's decision to pardon a government minister who was given  a prison sentence after the court found he was involved in  illegal mining of sand.    "We call the demonstration in support of justice against the  pardon, against the governor general, against Hilroy Humphreys.  I expect you to be there in great numbers," Hector told the  meeting The party's campaign theme is "time for a change --  people first".</p>

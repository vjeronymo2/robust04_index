			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED STATES AND CENTRAL AMERICA  </P> <P> Having just returned from Managua, Nicaragua, I was very interested in your  editorial "Managua's Failing Economy" (June 28).  </P> <P> I think it should better be entitled "failed" economy. Inflation is soaring so  fast that the cordoba (paper currency) is being overstamped with new value,  that is, the 20 cordoba note is rubber-stamped to 20,000 cordoba.  </P> <P> For two years I have worked with the Nicaraguan refugees, the freedom fighters  and their families. I have seen a lot, but I was ill-prepared for the sights of  the "workers paradise." Upon arriving at Sandino Airport, the first thing one  sees is squadrons and squadrons of Soviet Hind helicopters (equipped with  humanitarian Gatling guns). Driving into town one sees Soviet tanks, so newly  arrived that they are still wrapped in burlap from shipping.  </P> <P> If there were a little less military spending, perhaps I would not have seen  (and fed) the first generation of families living in the dump! Perhaps I would  not have had the unpleasant opportunity to feed and clothe two boys -- 9 and 12  years old -- now living in the desecrated Jewish synagogue.  </P> <P> The Soviets continue to provide $40 million per month into Nicaragua in  military aid; the freedom fighters were allocated $40 million in humanitarian  aid for the year! Maybe if the $17 million that was pulled out of the Contra  aid for distribution to children's aid inside Nicaragua were distributed, I  would not see the dead babies that I see on our frequent missions.  </P> <P> It is sobering to see the first generation of poverty. Displaced people, once  relatively prosperous, learning how to live in absolute poverty -- in the  shadow of obscene opulence of the Sandinista rulers who truly redistributed the  wealth . . . they took from everyone and gave to themselves.  </P> <P> GARY D. BECKS  </P> <P> President, Rescue Task Force  </P> <P> San Bernardino  </P></p>

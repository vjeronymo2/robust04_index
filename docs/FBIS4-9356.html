			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edmond Laci: "`Omonia,' the Shadow of Suspicion"] </F>   [Text] Tirana -- There are suspicions that many of  Omonia's activists in the south of Albania have been involved in  anticonstitutional activities. On Wednesday [20 April]  afternoon, a Public Order Ministry statement confirmed reports  that, following several surprise raids in different districts of  Albania, "a large amount of anticonstitutional literature has  been found, proving Greek expansionist aims toward Albania and  Albanian territory," as well as "brazen Greek attempts to  Hellenize the area of southern Albania." These confiscated  documents include publications such as "Greece's Northern  Epirus," by Sebastianos, the metropolitan of Dropull; many maps  showing more than four-fifths of the present territory of  Albania as "Northern Epirus," and other secret material. Also  on Wednesday, Omonia's main leaders, while not unambiguously  speaking out about the reasons behind the detention of many of  their leading activists, demanded in a letter to President  Berisha "the immediate release of all the detainees," who  belong, they claim, to the Greek ethnic minority in Albania.    The lightning strikes organized by the Public Order  Ministry,  according to its statement, were carried out following reports  of the unlicensed possession of weapons and of criminal  anticonstitutional activities. The 11 detainees confirmed by  the Public Order Ministry include many persons from other  districts of the Omonia branch in Gjirokaster, and other  activists of the association. On Tuesday alone, five more  people, whom preliminary investigations accuse of  anticonstitutional activity, were detained in Delvine. These  are Kosta Miculi, Pirro Kondi, Panajot Mato, Pandeli Gazeli, and  Kostaq Cavo. An unlicensed firearm was found on one of them.    Thoma Sharra, deputy general chairman of Omonia, told GAZETA  SHQIPTARE that "As far as we know, four people have been  detained in Sarande alone, including one woman activist. The  detainees include Vangjel Papakristo, chairman of the Omonia  branch in Sarande."    [words indistinct] three more Omonia activists in  Gjirokaster  have been detained, while two people remained in detention in  Korce on Wednesday. The first was Ermioni Andrea, chairwoman of  Omonia in Korce, and the second the chairman of the  Albania-Greek Friendship Association. According to Sharra, the  deputy chairman of the Omonia branch in Tirana was detained for  18 hours. Omonia Chairman Sotiraq Qiriazati wrote in his letter  to President Berisha that, "in recent days, the ShlK [National  Intelligence Service] and the police have been subjecting us to  a wave of psychological repression, with detentions, raids on  homes, and searches of Omonia offices." The day before the  delivery of this letter, which attempts to connect the recent  detentions to the criminal incident in the barracks at Peshkepi,  the Public Order Ministry's spokesman had explained that "all  Albanian citizens, regardless of their ethnicity, are obliged to  obey the law of the Albanian state."</p>

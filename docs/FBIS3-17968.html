			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 30 March, Syarhey Navumchyk, member of the  Belarusian Popular Front opposition in the Supreme Soviet, held  a news conference at which he briefed journalists on the course  of today's session held behind closed doors. In particular, he  told them of a speech delivered by Belarusian National Bank  Chairman Stanislav Bahdankevich, who told deputies that "we have  almost matured to the point of taking new steps to reform the  economy." Syarhey Navumchyk speculated that the majority in  parliament is ready to "fire" Bahdankevich, because the latter  has recently begun to show a more and more skeptical attitude  toward Belarus' joining the common ruble zone.    According to Syarhey Navumchyk, at the behind-closed-doors  session, also discussed was the issue of appointing Anatol  Butevich chief of the recently established Ministry of Culture  and Press, and Alyaksandr Stalyarov as chairman of the Committee  for Radio and Television Broadcasting, which will be established  in place of the State Broadcasting Company. Although both  candidacies have been put forward by Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Kebich, they are subject to approval by the Supreme Soviet  Presidium and appropriate committees. Syarhey Navumchyk, as a  member of the Committee for Glasnost, Mass Media, and Human  Rights, stated that it is very unlikely that his committee will  support the candidacy of Alyaksandr Stalyarov. According to  Syarhey Navumchyk, Alyaksandr Stalyarov has warned him in a  private conversation that if members of the committee do not  vote for him, he will "cut off the oxygen to the opposition and  all democrats," because he is convinced that the Supreme Soviet  Presidium will support him. Nevertheless, Syarhey Navumchyk  said, even if Stalyarov is appointed by the Supreme Soviet, the  Committee for Glasnost, Mass Media, and Human Rights will have  the right to veto this decision, and it is going to do so.    Syarhey Navumchyk also pointed out that the presidential  campaign has already begun, and that the mass media are being  concentrated in the hands of the Cabinet of Ministers, the  leader of which is gathering "faithful people" around himself.</p>

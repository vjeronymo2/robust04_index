			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (10): Airlines get a flying start - The advantages of using Manchester THE international scheduled airlines which use Manchester airport say the principal attraction is the population of about 20m people within two hours' travelling time of the airport, many of whom are business travellers. American Airlines, which claims to be the world's biggest airline with 86m passengers carried in 1992, was the first US carrier to fly direct into Manchester in 1986 and is very happy to be there. It had been flying to Gatwick for four years. Route viability studies showed there was a large potential market in the north of England. Mr Iain Burns, spokesman for American Airlines, says: 'We realised there was a huge untapped market of business travellers in the north of England. There was, and still is, a pronounced feeling among businessmen in the north that they should not have to travel to the US by way of London.' American has one return flight a day to New York and one a day to Chicago. It will be gaining some extra flights in the summer. Mr Burns adds: 'The good communications around the airport are important. One in four of our travellers come from Yorkshire to the east of Manchester. The road network is good but business should grow further once the rail link starts.' American now flies to five destinations within the UK but Manchester to Chicago is one of its most profitable routes. Mr Burns says: 'The attraction of Chicago for the business traveller is that it is an important hub. New York is essentially a point-to-point airport. From Chicago it is possible to fly to 114 other destinations. Only 30 per cent of our passengers finish their journeys in Chicago. The other 70 per cent fly on somewhere else.' Delta Airlines, the world's third largest, is also happy with Manchester, but for a different reason. It has managed to tap the UK leisure market. Delta applied for and won a licence to fly into Manchester in June 1991. It flies daily to Atlanta. Ms Jennifer Smith, spokesperson for Delta, says: 'We were examining possible routes into the UK. Research was carried out in London and Manchester. We knew that American had done very well out of their Chicago flight and decided to apply for a licence.' Unlike American, however, Delta's passengers are not predominantly business travellers. Ms Smith says: 'About 75 per cent of our traffic is leisure and only 25 per cent business. Atlanta is a main hub. We estimate that 44 per cent of passengers on the Manchester flight fly on to Florida.' Delta is pleased with the Manchester operation. Ms Smith says: 'I have to say we have done very well with this flight. It is very profitable. We carried 136,000 passengers last year which means pretty full payloads. It did not start quietly, then limp along and finally pick up. We have done well from day one.' At Cathay Pacific there is another perspective. It has three flights a week to Hongkong. The key is, again, the catchment area. Mr John Paterson, manager, Britain and Ireland, says: 'There is a huge business catchment in the north of England. Many do not want the aggravation of flying down to Heathrow and then on to Hongkong.' He explains that the connections between Manchester and Gatwick are not good and says: 'The problem of going via Heathrow is that you have to change terminals and flights. From Manchester you can fly direct, with one stop in Frankfurt.' This means the minimum of disruption for travellers but also enables Cathay to top up with passengers in Frankfurt. The full payloads mean the flights are profitable. Cathay is stepping up its service to five flights a week in July. It is hoping to run daily flights when it is allowed. Mr Paterson says: 'Regular frequency is vital to gain business traffic. Once the the businessman knows there is a daily flight he becomes seriously interested.' Aer Lingus says Manchester is a vital destination for its short-haul operations. The Irish airline flies to a number of UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Cardiff, Bristol and Birmingham. The company believes Manchester is important because it is at the centre of a large population Mr Tony White, spokesman for Aer Lingus, says: 'There is a large concentration of business travellers in the north of England. There is also a large concentration of Irish people and Irish related people in the north-west who want to travel to Ireland. Aer Lingus runs eight flights a day from Dublin to Manchester. He adds that Manchester is a good pick-up point for daily flights from Dublin to Copenhagen and Zurich, the two European destinations to which Aer Lingus flies. BA Regional was set up last year to service flights from Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. It serves, or will serve, after March, 18 international destinations as well as the full range of domestic routes. Mr Douglas Jackson, a spokesman for BA Regional, says: 'Manchester is a significant airport simply because there is the population to support it. There are more people within 20 minutes of the airport than there are from any other city with the possible exception of London.' One offbeat service handled by BA Regional is a twice weekly run to Islamabad. This starts life at Gatwick but picks up most of its passengers at Manchester. It draws on the large Asian communities in the north of England. Mr Jackson says: 'These flights are usually full and very profitable.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 26 SAPA -- Six thousand members of the  Pan Africanist Congress' [PAC] armed wing, the Azanian People's  Liberation Army [APLA], would be included in the South African  National Defence Force [SANDF], PAC President Clarence Makwetu  said after meeting President Nelson Mandela on Thursday. The  number could rise to 10,000, he said. Speaking on the steps of  Tuynhuys after their meeting, Mr Mandela said he had asked the  PAC leader for a list of PAC members who could be included in  the new government's civil service and diplomatic corps. Mr  Mandela said APLA members had fought and suffered. They should  be included even though they applied for membership after the  cutoff date for inclusion of non-statutory forces in the SANDF.    Mr Mandela said his discussions with Mr Makwetu were part of  an ongoing attempt to forge unity. "As long as I am president,  I think this dialogue should continue," Mr Mandela said. "We  are busy on an initiative intended to bring about a unified  approach in dealing with questions which are of concern to the  people of South Africa." He was encouraged by the co-operation  he was receiving from other political parties.    On Wednesday, Mr Mandela met Conservative Party leader Ferdi  Hartzenberg and next week he will meet Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene  Terreblanche.    Before meeting Mr Makwetu, Mr Mandela held an hour-long  meeting with acting democratic party leader Tony Leon. Mr  Mandela said he welcomed a loyal parliamentary opposition. "The  fact that people differ with us is no reason why we should not  give attention to their ideas. The role of the opposition is to  draw attention to those things we may not be alive to."</p>

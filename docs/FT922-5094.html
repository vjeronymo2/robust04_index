			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (16): Technology alone is not enough - An issue underlying the labyrinthine discussions at Rio is technology transfer EVERYONE is aware that, if practical progress is to be made on any of the specific problems, from global warming to the extinction of wildlife species, scientific knowledge and technical skills will have to be transferred on a huge scale from industrialised to developing countries. Yet 'technology transfer', a frequent incantation in the preparatory work for the Earth Summit, is poorly defined - and understood differently by people on opposite sides of the North-South divide. Politicians from developing countries tend to imagine that the industrialised world contains a treasure trove of advanced technology, locked up by greedy companies and insensitive governments. They see the system of protecting intellectual property through patents as a particular barrier to setting poorer nations on the path to clean growth. The western point of view - shared on the whole by governments, companies and environmental groups - is that the Third World's pre-occupation with hi-tech is misguided. Indeed, as Mr Chris Rose, programmes director of Greenpeace, notes, 'the South has become particularly obsessed with biotechnology. The United Nations preparatory committee for the Earth Summit pointed out that 'a large body of useful technological knowledge lies in the public domain and is unaffected by the international patent system. Also, most proprietary technology is available through commercial channels.' The barriers which developing countries have to overcome before they can tap this pool of knowledge are, in order of increasing size: finding out about the appropriate techniques; establishing the infrastructure to introduce them; and, above all, paying for them. Several regional and international clearing houses already exist to exchange information about environmental technology. A fairly wide-ranging example is the UN Environment Programme's Industry and the Environment Office in Paris. Others organisations transfer information in more specialised fields. One new example is the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications, which is being set up at Cornell University, New York. It aims to tell farmers in developing countries how to increase yields while using less pesticide; ISAAA will concentrate on passing on biotechnology which has been tried and tested in the west and which can be introduced without disrupting traditional agriculture. But the Earth Summit organisers are looking for a great expansion in the network of technology information exchanges. They estimate that the international community would have to contribute Dollars 150m to Dollars 200m a year to their running costs. The UK government commissioned two studies of technology transfer by the consultants Touche Ross, to help prepare for the Earth Summit. One looked at climate change and the other at biodiversity. Both concluded that aid agencies have concentrated too much so far on transferring 'hard' technologies and have seriously neglected maintenance programmes and 'soft' technologies such as training and developing local skills. 'People tend to regard technology transfer as handing over the blueprints for a process,' says Mr John Coleman, environmental affairs manager for ICI, the UK-based chemicals group. 'But it's much more complex than that. Handing over the blueprints is only about a third of the story.' As Mr Coleman points out, if you build a chemical plant in a developing country without training the operators properly, 'people could do immense environmental damage by operating the plant wrongly.' The international chemical companies no longer build cheap and dirty plants in the Third World. They now try actively to transfer the best environmental technology to their subsidiaries. The ICI policy, in the somewhat cumbersome phrasing of Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, is that the company will 'build new plants anywhere in the world to the (environmental) standards which we can reasonably foresee will be required in the most demanding country in which we operate the particular process.' But even if western companies build the cleanest and most advanced plants in developing countries, their governments may be faced with immense costs in providing the necessary infrastructure - for example, water and waste treatment facilities. 'It may become increasingly difficult for developing countries, with little industrial base, to obtain the technology and related experience that will be needed to overcome global environmental issues,' Sir Denys says. 'It is surely here that the role of governments and international organisations will be crucial in developing the right financial and political climate to allow technology to be transferred as widely and quickly as possible.' In other words, there is no point in considering technology transfer on its own. It must be part of an all-round development programme. In the end, however, there is something slightly paradoxical about the view that technology can save the planet, when it is clear that technology enabled mankind to make such a mess of the earth in the first place. As the UK-based Intermediate Technology group puts it, 'technological advancement driven by greed has led to rapacious stripping of the earth's resources and has fuelled unsustainable lifestyles in the north.' The IT group believes the Small is Beautiful approach, first expounded 20 years ago by its founder, the late Fritz Schumacher, is more appropriate today than ever. It argues that the widespread application of small-scale technical solutions, combining western know-how with local skills and resources, can make more impact on the Third World environment than grandiose projects such as large 'clean coal' power stations. Examples of intermediate technology introduced successfully include fuel-efficient wood burning stoves in Kenya and Sri Lanka; cleaner metal extraction equipment for small-scale goldminers in Zimbabwe and roofing tiles reinforced with local vegetable fibres in many African countries.</p>

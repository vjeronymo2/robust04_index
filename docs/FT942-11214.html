			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Co-op societies in merger proposal Co-operative Retail Services, the second largest co-operative retailer in the UK, yesterday launched a new proposal for a merger with the largest, Co-operative Wholesale Society, to create a significant retailing force. The combined societies would have annual turnover of more than Pounds 3bn - about 75 per cent from grocery sales - making them the UK's seventh largest retail group. The latest of three attempts to merge the groups foundered in 1990 when they failed to agree on the structure of the board. But as the CRS published a new merger manifesto, 'The Time is Right', both groups said they were hopeful. 'There is a tangible will within both societies to make it happen,' said Mr Harry Moore, CRS chief executive. The CWS responded that it was on the record as supporting a merger. 'If the CRS and its members are enthusiastic and convinced of the case, we welcome that.' The CRS move came as it revealed a small increase in its pre-tax surplus for the year to January 29 to Pounds 26.7m, against Pounds 25.9m which excluded a Pounds 22m exceptional gain from the sale of its dairy business. Turnover fell 6 per cent from Pounds 1.36bn to Pounds 1.27bn, but adjusting for the dairy disposal, sales fell 0.7 per cent. Mr Moore said this was a 'resilient performance' amid tough competition in the grocery market and given that the previous year was 53 weeks. He added that the CRS, which includes the Pioneer, Leo's and Stop &amp; Shop formats, had held market share and increased gross margin - in contrast to many grocery groups - through better buying and adjusting the product mix. However, Mr Moore warned that co-operative retailers faced the threat of being squeezed between discounters and 'premium chains'. A merger was vital if they were to fight back. Failure to achieve that 'could signal the end of the Co-op as a serious national retail force'. The benefits included cost savings, increased financial strength for investment and development, doubled purchasing power, and the ability to compete nationally with cohesive marketing campaigns. The main issue, as in 1990, will be achieving the correct balance on the board between individual members and the CWS's corporate members, which include CRS itself and regional co-operative societies which have joined the CWS in recent years. Mr Moore said changes in the structure of both groups since 1990 increased the chances of agreement.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS BALLOT PROPOSITIONS;  </P> <P> INSURERS' MOTIVES ON PROP. 115 QUESTIONED  </P> <P> Insurance companies have contributed more than $300,000 to the campaign for  Proposition 115 -- an anti-crime initiative on the June ballot -- and  suspicious foes charged on Thursday that insurers may have hidden motives for  their generous support of the measure.  </P> <P> The initiative's opponents contend that insurers may be backing the measure  because, under it, the courts could be so busy with criminal cases it would be  increasingly difficult to bring civil suits to trial. That could enable  insurers to stall or obtain more favorable settlements in cases where they are  being sued, the foes said.  </P> <P> The accusations were heatedly denied by insurance officials, who said they  support the initiative as an effective device to curb crime and thus trim  insurance losses. And backers of the proposition said the opponents' claims  reflected a resort to desperation tactics in the face of a losing battle to  defeat it.  </P> <P> Bob Wickers, campaign director for the main group backing the initiative, also  said that the $322,000 insurance companies have donated represents a relatively  small proportion of the $2.2 million raised in behalf of the initiative.  </P> <P> Most suits involving insurance are civil cases. The initiative, sponsored by  prosecutors and victims' groups, aims to reduce delay in the criminal justice  system and curb the constitutional rights of criminal defendants.  </P> <P> Among other things, the measure eases requirements that witnesses testify  personally at preliminary hearings, requires that court-appointed defense  attorneys be ready for trial by certain dates and imposes deadlines on courts  to bring felony cases to trial.  </P> <P> "Experts tell us that if 115 passes, it will all but consume every judge in the  county in order to try criminal cases," said Ian Herzog of Los Angeles,  president-elect of the California Trial Lawyers Assn. and an initiative  opponent. "It means innocent civil victims won't have a place to have their  cases tried."  </P> <P> Another spokesman for initiative opponents, Sacramento defense attorney Michael  Rothschild, said: "The insurers are giving a lot of money to 115 because they  know it will shut down the civil courts. . . . Insurance companies only do  things because they can make money from it; they don't do things for benevolent  purposes."  </P> <P> Jack Nickell, campaign director for Californians for Privacy, a coalition of  groups opposing the measure, said that insurers may stand to gain better access  to personal medical records if, as opponents claim, the measure weakens state  privacy protections.  </P> <P> Another motive for the big contributions, Nickell said, could be to provide  indirect support for the gubernatorial candidacy of Republican U.S. Sen. Pete  Wilson, who is honorary chairman of the initiative campaign.  </P> <P> While some industry officials remained tight-lipped or unavailable for comment,  others reacted vehemently to the charges, calling them "silly" and a "big lie."  </P> <P> James Snyder, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, an  industry association, said the initiative could result in faster and more  effective prosecution in insurance-fraud cases. At a "bare minimum," he said,  fraud against insurers costs consumers over $100 million annually in Southern  California alone.  </P> <P> "We all pay the cost of crime -- and we're all frustrated with the inefficiency  and what appears to be the lack of effectiveness in the criminal justice  system," Snyder said.  </P> <P> "Crime is a major contributor to insurance costs," said Curt Olsen, a spokesman  for TransAmerica Insurance Co., which contributed $25,000 in support of 115.  "The less crime there is, the less our losses will be. Crime is expensive to  insurance companies and their policyholders."  </P> <P> Top officials of Mercury General Corp. and Surety Co. of the Pacific, which  each contributed $100,000, were not available for comment. George Joseph, chief  executive officer of Mercury General, and Bill Erwin, chief executive officer  of Surety, are known in political circles as strong Republican Party  supporters.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Wilson joined in blasting the the opponents' claims.  </P> <P> "The opponents are trying again to create the big lie," said Bill Livingston,  press secretary of Wilson's campaign for governor. "The initiative will do the  very opposite of what they say. . . . It sounds like they are desperate."  </P> <P> Livingston said that, in fact, the initiative will relieve congestion in the  courts -- speeding both criminal and civil cases -- and that it does not  threaten the confidentiality of medical records or any other rights to privacy.  "There is no hidden agenda," he said.  </P> <P> Nickell released a list showing that 14 insurance companies had donated  $322,000 to the "Yes on 115" campaign, in amounts ranging from $500 to  $100,000. The larger contributions are unusual, he said, because the industry  traditionally has not made major donations in campaigns that do not appear to  involve it directly.  </P> <P> While conceding there was no way to determine the motives for the  contributions, Nickell contended that the prospect of a "logjam of criminal  cases" in the courts and more readily available medical records seemed the most  likely explanations.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Kenneth Reich contributed to this story  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report from Kuwait: "Kuwaiti Government Unaware of the </F> Magnitude of General Fiscal Crisis in the Country"]   &lt;{txt&gt; [Text] The al-Shall economic office in Kuwait noted in its  weekly report that nearly 63 percent of all debtors secured  their debt balances with amounts totalling some 5.375 billion  dinars [KD]. The report also pointed to joint responsibility for  Kuwait's foreign investment scandals and emphasized that, those  calamities notwithstanding, certain principals are still  occupying leadership positions in the management of foreign  investments.    The report underscored the "lack of government awareness of  the magnitude of the general fiscal crisis" and noted that some  90 percent of oil revenues anticipated in the new budget will be  expended on salaries whereas about 59 percent is earmarked for  military outlays, foretelling of substantial future deficits.  Following is the text of the report:  <H5>  Underperforming Debt </H5>   A majority of deputies does not wish to amend Law 41/93,  which governs underperforming debts, according to the secretary  of the Public Funds Guardian Committee. We also believe this to  be the assembly's sentiment. Several ministers have expressed  the government's desire to amend the underperforming debt law  but have not made it clear whether the desired amendments would  cover fiscal matters or procedural aspects. We believe that the  government would face a serious conflict with the assembly  should it propose to postpone the instantaneous settlement  deadline, extend the rescheduling period from 12 to 20 years, or  even merely indicate that it would consider payment in kind.    The governor of the Central Bank of Kuwait was quoted as  saying that 3,174 clients, or 33 percent of the original 9,523  or so, have already secured their settlements. We assume that  some 2,783 others have settled instantaneously in response to  the law and there was no reason to secure their settlements.  This means that some 5,957 clients, or about 63 percent of total  debtors, have responded to the law. They accounted for about  KD5.375 billion in accumulated debt, or 96 percent of the  KD5.591 billion in combined original debt. Those figures  generally agree with a previous finance minister's statement  that about 6,000 clients have responded to the law. The finance  minister added, however, that those who did not respond have  combined balances of some KD900 million, leaving a difference of  about KD216 million in the balances of those who responded to  the law and whose who did not. This difference is explained by  the fact that the acquired debt balance is higher than the  balance of debt instruments because of bank discounting and the  possible inclusion of other types of debt.    It would have been incumbent upon the Central Bank of Kuwait  and the Ministry of Finance to divulge the balance of acquired  debt and to reveal its components.  <H5>  Oil Investments </H5>   Reports by the Audit Bureau, a public oversight agency, on  correcting the investments of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation  are being published in a local newspaper. Those reports have  been overdue for 10 years during which the public treasury  incurred huge losses. Nevertheless, they are a healthy outcome  of the separation of the branches of governance and indicate the  restoration of a degree of respect for the law and for oversight  agencies. The oil investments case is almost an exact duplicate  of Kuwait's foreign direct investments case, both of which are  currently under investigation by the general prosecutor's office  as well as by the British and Spanish court systems. They are  also quite similar to the oil tanker case, which is also before  the courts in Kuwait. A single team seems to be fully or  partially responsible for all cases from the Santa Fe case to  the Spanish incident to the British Petroleum deal to the  remittances made during the occupation period and its aftermath.    The Audit Bureau's reports underscore the pattern of  misconduct itself--i.e., purchases made without the benefit of  serious prior studies; purchases at above going prices; direct  funding support of projects in which they got themselves  entangled; disregard for the constitution and other laws when  providing guarantees and loans, the creation of phantom  companies and tampering with financial books, and the founding  of certain firms at the expense of others.    The same team remains in positions of management in spite of  poor financial performance and the lack of periodic due  diligence by the parent organization, which failed to take  meaningful corrective steps either because of hurried meetings  of because of buck passing. Those policies and decisions went  unchallenged by the Supreme Petroleum Council and the cabinet  either because they were not deemed important or because of  over-confidence and of allowing personal considerations to  outweigh the fundamentals of public administration.    The Audit Bureau's reports are not all out yet but they  indicate losses in the billions of dollars on top of foreign  investment losses. This is something that should be given  attention and adequate consideration, as a profound lesson if  nothing else. Those reports, which are no doubt being  scrutinized by government, should be studied by relevant  National Assembly committees as well.    Politics aside, it must be emphasized once again that all of  us without exception have been victimized by such misconduct.  <H5>  The General Budget </H5>   We reported two weeks ago that new 1994/95 budget figures  released by the government show expenditures of KD4.390 billion  against revenues of KD2.537 billion, of which oil revenues  account for KD2.235 billion or 88 percent.    The new budget figures therefore indicate a budget deficit  of  KD1.853 billion, compared with a deficit of KD1.223 billion  estimated for the current 1993/94 fiscal year. The deficits for  the current and upcoming years are comparable when the impact of  added defense expenditures is excluded.    We also previously noted that the proposed budget was no  accomplishment and that it is antithetical to last January's  recommendations by the Ministry of Finance. We further noted  that the budget did not reflect a true picture of the country's  fiscal position next year because it was not comprehensive and  its forecast of the country's fiscal position did not go beyond  one fiscal year.    Preliminary figures indicate that new budget allocations for  wages and salaries may be as high as KD2.011 billion, as opposed  to published estimates of KD1.144 billion, after adding salary  allocations for subsidiaries (KD211 million), autonomous  agencies (about KD338 million) and salaries for the military  (KD318 million). The figure accounts for about 90 percent of  estimated oil revenues and for about 79 percent of total  anticipated revenues. The government employs about 97 percent of  the Kuwaiti labor force outside the military sector.    Defense outlays are estimated at about KD980 million or  approximately 44 percent of total oil revenues forecast.  Allotments for the Interior Ministry and the National Guard  would raise anticipated defense outlays to about KD1.325  billion, or 59 percent of total estimated oil revenues. It is to  be noted, however, that military salaries are included in the  general allocations for both defense and wages and salaries and  the duplication should be corrected.    There is little chance of directly containing wages and  salaries expenditures in the short-term but this is not the case  with defense outlays if alternatives were considered without  sensitivities or pressure.    The new budget allows only KD220 million to cover interest  due on Treasury notes and bonds with no provision for interest  due on underperforming loans or on foreign debt. The Kuwaiti  prime minister is said to have requested expeditious  ratification of outlays for state acquisition of private real  estate. If true, this would be another indication of the lack of  government recognition of the magnitude of the general fiscal  crisis.    As to revenues, the government adjusted its oil revenue  forecasts in the new budget downward from $15 to $12 per barrel.  It had proposed a downward adjustment last January to $10.5 per  barrel but no change was made in the dollar exchange rate, which  remained at 299 Kuwaiti fils. Expected oil revenues consequently  declined by some $185 million, about 7.6 percent, even though  production was estimated to expand by about 11 percent or  200,000 barrels per day.</p>

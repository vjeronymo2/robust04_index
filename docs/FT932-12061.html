			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / WHO vote unlikely to end blizzard of criticism NEXT WEEK the 184 members of the World Health Organisation are expected to confirm by a big majority the reappointment of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima for a second five-year term as director-general of the United Nations agency. The decision, however overwhelming, is unlikely to calm the blizzard of criticism levelled at Dr Nakajima, a Japanese pharmacologist, whose reign at WHO since 1988 has been dogged by scandal, mounting opposition of leading western donors, and disaffection to the point of open revolt by many WHO staff. Dr Nakajima's critics say his re-election will seriously weaken the ability of the Geneva-based agency, which has an annual budget of Dollars 850m and employs 4,700 people worldwide, to tackle global health challenges including Aids, child health and the spread of infectious disease. They draw parallels with the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in the mid-1980s under Mr Amadou Mahtar M'Bow, a Senegalese, who was finally forced out after rampant waste and mismanagement had destroyed Unesco's credibility. In February, a senior Japanese staff member in WHO's regional office in Manila, where Dr Nakajima was previously director, wrote to a top foreign ministry official in Tokyo that 'another five years of Nakajima will be a nightmare for the Japanese government and a catastrophe for the WHO'. Dr Nakajima had barely arrived in Geneva before the rumblings of discontent began. Staff were upset by his autocratic management style, the appointment of Manila cronies to key positions, and the demotion or transfer of staff who had close links with his Danish predecessor, Dr Halfdan Mahler. US and European donors say Dr Nakajima, has failed to give the organisation vision and leadership. WHO staff also question the role of Mr Ryoichi Sasakawa, the controversial Japanese billionaire philanthropist and rumoured aspirant for the Nobel Peace Prize, who is a generous contributor to WHO. Dr Yugi Kawaguchi, who acted as the WHO's linkman with Mr Sasakawa in the mid-1980s, was promoted by Dr Nakajima to the important post of director of planning, co-ordination and co-operation. More recently, US officials have accused Japan of buying the votes of developing country members of the 31-strong executive board, which in January voted 18 to 13 to renominate the incumbent. The US, the EC and the Arab League backed Dr Mohammed Abdelmoumene, an Algerian neurologist, who was Dr Nakajima's deputy until suspended last year after declaring his candidacy. Dr Abdelmoumene remains on special leave with full pay. A special audit conducted by Sir John Bourn, Britain's comptroller and auditor general, found that the value of WHO contracts to executive board members had more than doubled in the second half of 1992 compared with a year earlier, and identified five contracts involving financial irregularities. While Dr Nakajima was not personally involved, all five contracts were signed by Dr Kawaguchi using Japanese funds. By far the biggest, a research contract of Dollars 150,000 given to a foundation run by the Philippines executive board member, Dr Alfredo Bengzon, was paid for by the Sasakawa Health Trust Fund. Even without the various threats or inducements allegedly made by the Japanese government (charges which it strongly denies), many poor countries see Japan as a more promising potential donor, bilaterally and through WHO, than the US or Europe which have other preoccupations and more severe budget constraints. Dr Nakajima has made some attempt to defuse the row before the ballot. Last week it was disclosed that Dr Kawaguchi would be shunted aside to handle 'inter-agency affairs'. Dr Nakajima plans to announce next week a more radical reorganisation which will include creation of two new divisions for nutrition and vaccines and effectively curb the powers of two Manila buddies, Dr Edward Uhde, the budget and finance director, and Dr H S Dhillan, director of health education, who were implicitly criticised by the special audit.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the period Santa Teresa has been operating as a temporary Customs station, Customs has achieved notable results in obtaining commitments from the trade community regarding their use of electronic data input for the processing of entries. Currently, most of the brokers or importers filing entries are automated. No current importer dominates the scene, and, as the surrounding infrastructure continues to improve, additional entities have expressed their intentions to utilize the port.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the only port of entry along the New Mexico-Mexico border is located in the far western portion of the state. Diplomatic negotiations have been held with the Government of Mexico concerning the creation of a port of entry at Santa Teresa, and both governments are in agreement with such an action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Port of Entry Boundaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The boundaries of the port of entry of Santa Teresa are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning at the junction of the boundary between Texas and New Mexico with the U.S.-Mexico border, west, along the Mexico-U.S. border until it intersects the range line between Range 1 East and Range 2 East, New Mexico Principal Meridian; at that point, north along that range line until it reaches the line between Township 27 South and Township 28 South; then east along the Township line until it reaches the Texas-New Mexico border; then south-east along the Texas-New Mexico border to the beginning point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Santa Teresa Airport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, Customs is also amending &sect;122.24(b) by adding the Santa Teresa Airport, which is within the boundaries of the port of entry, to the list of airports designated as airports at which private aircraft arriving in the Continental U.S. must report intended arrival pursuant to &sect;122.23(b) and land for Customs processing in accordance with &sect;122.24(b). Section 122.23(b) provides, essentially, that all private aircraft arriving in the Continental U.S. via the U.S.-Mexican border, from a foreign place in the Western Hemisphere south of 33 degrees north latitude, or from any place in Mexico, shall furnish notice of intended arrival to Customs at the nearest designated airport to the point of crossing for the first landing in the U.S. &sect;122.24 provides that such aircraft shall land for Customs processing at the nearest designated airport to the border or coastline crossing point. At present, there is no designated airport in the State of New Mexico. The identification of the Santa Teresa Airport as a designated airport by Customs will benefit the flying public by increasing the options available for reporting arrival and obtaining Customs processing. The addition of this airport will also reduce delays at existing designated airports by permitting a better distribution of the inspection burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Customs routinely establishes, expands, and consolidates Customs ports of entry throughout the United States to accommodate the volume of Customs-related activity in various parts of the country.

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: AlliedSignal buys Ford spark plug unit AlliedSignal, the US automotive components and aerospace multinational, is to challenge Robert Bosch, Champion, Japan's NGK and other rivals in the European market for vehicle spark plugs. It has reached an agreement in principle to acquire, for an undisclosed sum, Ford's only remaining spark plug manufacturing operations worldwide, at Treforest in Wales. Initially the plant, which employs 330 people, will continue to be the source of Ford's only spark plug supplies in Europe. However, it will quickly seek other European customers, Mr Ralph Reins, president of AlliedSignal Automotive, said yesterday. AlliedSignal, whose automotive operations include Bendix braking systems and Garrett, is already the sole supplier of spark plugs to Ford in North America.</p>

The meeting between the prime minister  and the UGT [General Workers Union] and Workers Commissions  leaders confirmed that the government will not be offering  compromises following the 27 January general strike. Felipe  Gonzalez told Nicolas Redondo and Antonio Gutierrez directly the  same thing that he had told them by letter: The negotiation on  the labor reform will not be reopened, and he again referred  them to an agreement with the CEOE [Spanish Confederation of  Employers Organizations], which the latter has rejected.    Antonio Gutierrez and Nicolas Redondo did not conceal their  tense faces following an hour and one-half meeting with the  prime minister, which they described as "extremely serious."  The Workers Commissions leader asserted that they went to the  Moncloa Palace "devoid of any arrogant tone," and left with a  "no" to their requests for negotiation. "There are several  incomprehensible things which the country must know," Gutierrez  asserted: "The prime minister is ignoring the strike: we came  to discuss the labor reform, and he came out with the incomes  agreement and does not wish to take part in the endeavor to  extricate this country from the conflict."    The two trade unionists forecast a future of considerable  tension in collective bargaining and in labor relations. They  also made this known in these terms to the prime minister, to  whom they also set out all their arguments for rejecting the  labor reform, including the argument that "only time will tell  whether these measures will create jobs." "We believe that they  will not, and that employers will dismiss many workers,"  according to Nicolas Redondo. They also informed him of their  refusal to be referred to a dialogue with the CEOE, when its  leaders have refused to negotiate these measures with the trade  unions.    The two trade union leaders met previously at midmorning in  Redondo's office in order to prepare the messages that they were  going to present to the prime minister. Their main aim was to  prevent the Moncloa Palace meeting from becoming a mere  "courtesy meeting," as it had been described by Marcos Pena,  secretary general for employment and coordinator of the 33  meetings held by the administration and the social agents  between last July and November, at which no agreement was  reached. The Workers Commissions and UGT top leaders asked  Felipe Gonzalez for "some gesture" in order to restore the  dialogue so that substantial changes can be made to the labor  reform -- the catalyst of the general strike.  <H5>  Method of Discussion </H5>   The method of or framework for discussion is not the basic  issue for the trade unions. They were seeking a direct dialogue  with the government, although the parliamentary procedure is  continuing its course, and in fact they will be holding contacts  with the political groups in order to propose amendments to them.    Gutierrez and Redondo reminded the head of government that  negotiation was possible on other laws which were passing  through parliament: The Workers' Statute, the Organic Law on  Trade Union Freedom, and the abortive Strike Law -- the first  under a Union of the Democratic Center government and the other  two in the Socialist period.    The prime minister's proposal for negotiating an incomes  agreement was not accepted by the trade unionists, since they  believed that it would be possible only if that agreement  applied to all incomes -- wages and business incomes -- and if  the government had provided some way to resolve the  disagreements over the labor reform.    Antonio Gutierrez stated that they told the prime minister  "what we have said so far, which is that the country is  certainly in no mood for compliments or courtesies, but rather  for becoming involved very seriously in resolving a grave social  problem. I believe that the prime minister should regard this  not only as a duty but also, if you press me, even as an honor.  A head of government cannot alter the fact that this country  has just experienced a general strike. He must consider how to  resolve matters."  <H5>  Difficult To Reconcile </H5>   These assertions by the Workers Commissions leader are  difficult to reconcile with the demand made by CEOE Chairman  Jose Maria Cuevas to the head of government at a later meeting  which had not ended when this issue went to press. Cuevas made  it clear that the government must not backtrack on the labor  reform. He also told him that the employers' confederation is  not prepared to reopen the dialogue with the trade unions  because it has already noted the enormous differences between  them over the changes which should take place in labor  relations.

In a statement to KUNA after the  meeting, Shaykh Sabah said "the meeting led to many positives we  have always looked for." He added: "We have invited the next  session of the ministerial council of the Damascus Declaration  States to meet in Kuwait. The declaration lays down that such a  meeting be held once every six months, and we in Kuwait are  looking forward to the timely convening of the session. The  foreign ministers will hold consultations on this issue."    He pointed out that Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud  al-Faysal spoke at the final session on our behalf -- as the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the chairman of the current session  of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- and expressed our pleasure  with the good results we arrived at, and with our profound  satisfaction with what has been achieved within the framework of  joint cooperation between the member-states of the Damascus  Declaration.    Shaykh Sabah will leave Damascus later today after  participating in the meeting of the foreign ministers of the  member-states of the Damascus Declaration.</p>

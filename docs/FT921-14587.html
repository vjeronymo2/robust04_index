			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / MCC chiefs signed cash transfers: Price Waterhouse suspects Pounds 339m from company was used to prop up shares SIGNATURES of three executives of Maxwell Communication Corporation, as well as those of Mr Robert Maxwell and his sons, were on documents authorising the transfer of Pounds 339m from MCC which investigators suspect was used for an illegal share support operation. Startling new evidence contained in a confidential report by accountants Price Waterhouse shows that between April and July last year transfers to Mr Maxwell's private companies stripped MCC of all liquid assets, giving its head office bank account a Pounds 105m overdraft, on top of its other debts of Pounds 1.6bn. Although there was nothing illegal in the transfer of these funds, Mr David Lee of Price Waterhouse said yesterday: 'It is a coincidence too great to be overlooked that MCC's money flowed out in mid-1991 at the same time as its shares rocketed - some of these large payments were probably used to support its own shares.' Between March and June 1991 the MCC share price surged from 150p to 240p. The report, codenamed Project Lucy, calculates that Mr Maxwell would have needed to spend about Pounds 300m to take his private shareholding in MCC from 51 per cent in mid-1990 to 79 per cent at his death on November 5. All the MCC shares owned by Mr Maxwell were eventually pledged to bank creditors of his private companies as security. These shares are now regarded as worthless by the banks, which face losses of many millions of pounds. The alleged share support scheme, which used secret foundations to buy MCC shares, is the subject of one of five investigations by the Serious Fraud Office. It is an offence under UK company law for a company to purchase its own shares without shareholders' approval. Mr Albert Fuller, head of MCC's treasury or funding operations, is a central figure in the transfer of funds, according to the Price Waterhouse report, delivered to the banks on December 18. His signature appears on Pounds 33m of payments between April 29 and July 22. There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Fuller and other MCC directors - apart from Mr Robert Maxwell - knew the reason for the transfers. Mr Robert Maxwell's signature is on Pounds 241m worth of them. The report also shows the powers that Mr Robert Maxwell won from the company in 1981 which gave him the right to make payments without other directors' assent. Authorisation of payments otherwise needed two signatures. On November 26 1981, after Mr Maxwell rescued the company, then called British Printing Corporation, from financial disaster, a resolution was passed 'that the chairman . . . is hereby appointed a committee of the board and that there be . . . delegated to the chairman as such commit-tee all the powers of the board'. The powers were never rescinded. According to the Price Waterhouse investigation, Mr Maxwell's youngest son, Kevin, MCC's chief executive, signed Pounds 52m of transfers and his brother Ian Pounds 8m. Mr Jean Pierre Anselmini, the former deputy chairman, signed only Pounds 2m and Mr Basil Brookes, finance director, only Pounds 1m, even though their positions suggested they had a central role in the company's finance. MCC directors have said they protested to Mr Robert Maxwell about the transfers and after they took independent legal advice in August money began flowing back to MCC. Price Waterhouse said yesterday that transfers were later authorised - Pounds 2.5m on September 13 by the signatures of Mr Brookes and Mr Fuller, and Pounds 14.7m on September 20 by the signatures of Mr Brookes and Mr Kevin Maxwell. They added that their report was based on documents at MCC, where they have been appointed administrators under UK insolvency law. They are now checking that the signatures authorising the transfers are authentic. Mr Kevin Maxwell was in court yesterday for the second day of his appeal against the high court's decision that he must answer questions from Bishopsgate Investment Management about missing pension funds.

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Boral raises bid to win Sagasco THE battle for control of South Australia's Sagasco Holdings came to an abrupt end yesterday when Boral, the Australian building materials and energy company, increased its offer and secured the support of the oil and gas company's largest shareholder. The new offer of ADollars 3.90 a share, raised from ADollars 3.50 a share, values Sagasco at ADollars 846m (USDollars 545.8m), which compares with ADollars 759m previously. The South Australian Government Financing Authority, which holds a 31.89 per cent interest in Sagasco, said it would accept the revised terms. At the outset of the bid, Boral had acquired a 19.9 per cent interest in its target - also from the financing authority - for A4146m, or ADollars 3.40 a share. As a result, Boral now owns or has acceptances in respect of more than 50.1 per cent of Sagasco's shares. This allowed the bidder to declare its offer unconditional yesterday morning. The revised bid will now be extended until October 28. The quick denouement left Santos, the Adelaide-based oil and gas company which holds a 19.9 per cent interest in Sagasco, pondering its position. 'Santos has not accepted the offer and is considering its position in the light of these developments,' it said in a brief statement. Santos opened the bidding for Sagasco a year ago, with an offer of ADollars 3.70 a share, but ran into opposition from the Trade Practices Commission. The TPC worried that a takeover of Sagasco - which has oil and gas interests in South Australia's Cooper Basin as well as interests in south-west Queensland, Western Australia's Beharra Springs and the Northern Territory's Amadeus gas projects - would give Santos a virtual monopoly in the South Australian gas industry.</p>

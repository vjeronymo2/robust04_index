			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance], the ruling  party, was unable to maintain the absolute majority it obtained  when the official vote tally for Sunday's elections started; and  the results indicate a runoff election will be needed. ARENA,  with a conservative ideology, continues to drop little by little  from the 51.22 percent it initially had when 50.31 percent of  the votes were counted and as the vote tally continues. The  Salvadoran electoral law stipulates a runoff election must be  held between the two leading candidates if none of the seven  candidates who participated in the elections obtain more than 50  percent of the votes.    Former San Salvador Mayor Armando Calderon Sol, 45, expected  to win the first round while his main opponent, leftist  coalition candidate Ruben Zamora, will regroup for the runoff  election and try to win it with the support of other opposition  groups. Zamora, a combative 52-year-old politician who has lived  in exile, has 27.85 percent of the votes in the presidential  elections, and it is likely his vote percentage will also drop.    His closest rival, Christian Democrat Fidel Chavez Mena, has  13.98 percent; and votes for the candidates of four minority  parties totals less than nine percent. There was 46.9 percent  abstentionism and this figure is considered high given the  expectations raised by the first elections to be held in El  Salvador following the 1992 Peace Accords. The leftist coalition  attributed the low voter turnout to critical mistakes in the  voter registration list, which prevented thousands of citizens  from exercising their right to vote. Specifically speaking, the  Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN, a former  guerrilla organization that disarmed and became a political  party a year ago, blamed ARENA for the irregularities and  accused it of fraud.    Referring to the elections for Legislative Assembly deputies  and municipal officials, the percentages are similarly  distributed to the presidential election votes, with an  overwhelming advantage for ARENA. In the deputy elections, the  Conservative Party obtained 45.35 percent; the left, 31.15  percent; and the Christian Democracy, 14.51 percent; while  municipal power is distributed in this manner: 44.65 percent for  the conservatives; 26.61 percent for the coalition; and 17.39  for the third group.    These results do not offer ARENA much of a difference  compared with the previous presidential elections held in 1989,  in which Alfredo Cristiani -- who will relinquish the presidency  on 1 June -- won the post in the first round with 53.8 percent  of the votes.    Calderon Sol avoided claiming a victory in his first  statements after the official tally began, waiting until the  results are confirmed, but he criticized the Zamora's  predictions concerning the certainty of a second round of  elections. "It is clear the people still prefer us," Calderon  Sol said and then he thanked the Cristiani Government, also of  ARENA, for its successful administration of the country.    Sunday's elections, watched by a contingent of 3,000 UN and  foreign government and organizations observers, were the first  electoral test for the FMLN, which obtained better results than  those predicted by polls.    Calderon Sol advocated a program that continued Cristiani's  liberal economic experience, while the FMLN and the two social  democratic parties that support Zamora want to implement a much  more social policy, aimed at solving the people's critical needs.    Aside from the criticism about irregularities voiced by the  left, the tranquillity which prevailed in Sunday's elections was  praised by most of the political groups and the UN Observers for  El Salvador (Onusal). Onusal issued a communique highlighting  the absence of critical incidents and the peace and freedom with  which 2.5 million Salvadorans summoned to the elections cast  their ballots.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Drug companies face lawsuits in US Twenty-nine of the world's largest drug companies are likely to face US federal lawsuits from pharmacy groups alleging price discrimination and anti-trust violation. The Georgia Pharmacy Association said yesterday it and other groups representing 1,346 independent pharmacies in 15 states would file separate federal lawsuits against 29 drug companies. Target companies include Merck-Medco of the US and the UK's Glaxo, the world's two biggest drug companies. The lawsuits are the latest moves in a campaign by pharmacies against drug makers. It includes lobbying Washington to staunch the flow of corporate and commercial drug company deals with healthcare intermediaries called health management organisations (HMOs) and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Pharmacists accuse drug makers of offering better deals to the intermediaries even if pharmacy chains are buying in greater bulk and should qualify for greater discounts. Pharmacists' groups have been pressing the Federal Trade Commission over the planned Dollars 4bn purchase by US drug company Eli Lilly of PCS, a pharmacy benefit manager.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions LAST WEEK, we commented on the volume of selling by directors, and the trend has continued. Much of this activity has been directors exercising and selling options. At Farnell Electronics, which makes and distributes electronics and electrical equipment and accessories, E. Hall is the second director to sell stock in the past month. His disposal of 150,000 shares at 240.5p reduces his total holding by more than two-thirds. AJ Thomas, the chairman of another electronics company, Diploma, sold 20,000 shares at 263.5p. This follows an announcement accompanying the final results that trading conditions were the worst for more than 20 years. Despite the sale, Thomas retains in excess of 1m shares in the company. Not every electronics company is having similar problems. Director confidence has been steady and constant at Astec (BSR) over the past three months. BH Christopher, the chairman and chief executive, bought 100,000 shares at 12.5p, which brings to 750,000 the number acquired by him and two other directors since last October. Buying has also been steady at Smith New Court. Two directors, M. Dritz and PD Roy, bought a total of 70,000 shares last week at prices from 85p to 90p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            No of Company                Shares    Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES BT                    290,365      955       3* BTR                   225,000      908       2* Diploma                20,000       53       1 Elect Data Processg     5,600       19       1 Farnell Electronics   150,000      361       1 Huntleigh Tech.        10,000       30       1* Invergordon Distill    22,000       59       2 Merrydown Wine          6,426       25       1 Morrison S'markets     45,800      116       2* Neotronics Tech        11,000       14       1 PCT                    78,000      104       2 Reed International     22,000      115       1 Scottish &amp; N'castle     6,500       29       1 Sidlaw                 71,250      163       1* Steel Burrill Jones     3,348       10       1 Tibbett &amp; Britten      40,000      214       1 Yorklyde               20,000       41       1 Young (H)              50,000       29       1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Carlton                 2,000       10       1 Clarke Foods           67,300       46       1 Clayhithe (CULS)       25,875       16       2 Devenish (JA)          14,000       30       1 First National Fin    110,000       44       2 Hardy Oil &amp; Gas         8,000       11       1 Lucas                  50,000       53       1 Monument Oil &amp; Gas    100,000       33       3 Nobo Group            100,000       65       3 Smith New Crt ccrp     20,000       13       1 Smith New Court        70,000       61       2 Steel Burrill Jones    13,465       38       4 Thames TV              10,000       18       1 Volex                   6,500       17       1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

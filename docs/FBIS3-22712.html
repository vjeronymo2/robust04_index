National disaster and emergency chief Leith Anderson said  hundreds more were reportedly seriously ill.    He said communications from Trobriand were poor, but  information reaching his office Tuesday said the epidemic had  killed more than 200 men, women and children in the past two  months -- with the old and very young hardest hit.    Anderson said the epidemic appeared to have hit Kiriwina --  the main island -- and the Kaileuna, Vakuta and Kitava island  groups.    The Trobriands are about 400 kilometers (240 miles)  northeast  of here.</p>

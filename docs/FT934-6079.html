			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: 'Quick fix' not in best interests Sir, It is widely accepted that the credit boom of the 1980s was due to financial deregulation and over-optimism about growth. It resulted in the private sector incurring a high level of debt and this led to the current recession. We believe the private sector's priority is still to reduce this debt burden because of less optimistic economic outlook and borrowing constraints by a more cautious banking sector. Consequently, cutting interest rates in the budget will not result in an immediate increase in investment or consumption but rather will at most bring closer the date when a desirable ratio of debt to income has been restored. Only then will we enjoy sustained non-inflationary growth. Therefore, we ought not be expecting a 'quick fix' solution but instead look to maintain a consistent long-term monetary policy.

			<p>BFN     [Text] In answering an AFP correspondent inquiring about  Vietnam's reaction on the IAEA's [International Atomic Energy  Agency] decision to pose punitive sanctions on the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, a spokesman of our Foreign Ministry  on 14 June said:    Vietnam follows with deep concern recent developments of the  nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula. We believe that all  members of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, have  similar obligations in the nuclear issue. We are always  persistent in our belief that the solution for this complicated  issue can only be reached through resolute and serious  negotiations between the parties concerned on the basis of  equality and respect to each other's independence and  sovereignty and to international laws.    All actions at variance with that direction will only worsen  the already complicated situation, and will harm the trend of  peace, stability, and cooperation for the Pacific region which  all countries in the region are striving to maintain.</p>

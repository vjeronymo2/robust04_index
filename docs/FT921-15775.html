			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK officials try to persuade Russians that beef is safe BRITISH and Russian officials in Moscow yesterday sought to settle an embarrassing row over Russia's reluctance to accept UK beef aid because of claims that it could bring 'mad cow' disease to Russia. Veterinary surgeons from the UK and the European Commission were also meeting their Russian counterparts in an attempt to persuade them that the beef is safe. Mrs Lynda Chalker, the minister for overseas development, is scheduled to fly to St Petersburg tomorrow, when she will seek to defuse the row. Her visit, to discuss the distribution of Pounds 20m of animal feed grain sent by the government, was planned before the beef dispute broke out. The announcement of her visit came as an exasperated British government said delivery of 2,000 tonnes of frozen beef had been suspended while steps were taken to persuade the Russian authorities that the beef was free of the 'mad cow' disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The beef rejected by Moscow officials at the weekend was the first tranche of the EC's food aid programme for Russia. It was finally accepted by the northern Russian city of Murmansk, which has different regulations from those of Moscow and where no cattle are reared. The rest of Britain's meat aid consignment - accumulated by the UK under the EC's Common Agricultural Policy - has been put back into cold storage pending the return from Moscow later this week of Mr Keith Meldrum, the UK's chief veterinary officer. Mr Meldrum, who flew to Moscow on Monday, will hold further talks with the Russian authorities today. The Ministry of Agriculture in London confirmed that the beef had come from UK herds which might have been infected by BSE. But under EC regulations, the infected parts - mainly bones and offal - could be removed and the meat safely consumed. The meat could not be certified in the normal way, however. Only meat from herds which had been free of the disease for two years could be certified as BSE-free. Sir Rodric Braithwaite, the British ambassador in Moscow, said Russian vets had sought assurances that none of the beef came from farms which had suffered outbreaks of the disease, but this was impossible to do. The Russian government was anxious to settle the row quickly, he said. 'They do want (the aid) and they need it.' BSE is a brain disorder which has devastated British herds for the past five years, and has soured trade relations.</p>

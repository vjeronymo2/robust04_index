			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READER DOESN'T GO EASY ON RACE WRITER  </P> <P> Why can't Bill Christine accept reality? Apparently, he still believes that  Easy Goer is the top 3-year-old, even though he has lost three of four to  Sunday Silence.  </P> <P> His comment that Sunday Silence is better, "but not by much," sounds like a  typical broken-down horseplayer explaining why he should have cashed his most  recent bet.  </P> <P> Isn't it just possible that Whittingham's horse wins because he is superior, by  quite a margin, and that the fluke in the series with Easy Goer was the  Belmont, run in the latter's back yard?  </P> <P> MARK BOYKIN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

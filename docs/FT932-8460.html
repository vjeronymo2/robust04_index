			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Move to win over Tory rail rebels MINISTERS WILL try to reassure potential Tory rebels about the fate of concessionary railcards after rail privatisation by emphasising that attitudes to concessionary fares would be taken into account in awarding franchises. Only the disabled person's railcard is guaranteed by the privatisation legislation. Ministers have argued that private-sector operators will want to provide railcards voluntarily under the new arrangements - as British Rail does now - because they are profitable. But the issue is one of a handful on which uneasy Tory backbenchers are seeking concessions from the government to make the proposals more workable and more politically popular. When the Commons debates the detail of the rail privatisation bill next week Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is expected to say that while ministers do not believe the railcards should be rigidly protected in the legislation, it would be reasonable for them to be a factor in the competition for franchises. The rebels are expecting to table their amendments to the legislation today, and Sir Keith Speed, a former minister and a leading rebel, is likely to meet Mr MacGregor before the end of the week. Mr MacGregor saw more than 20 backbenchers on Monday evening and remains confident that when the government's position on fares, line closures and BR's ability to compete for the franchises is fully explained MPs are broadly content with the plans. While ministers are determined not to give way on allowing BR itself to compete to run services they will seek to calm Tory fears about fare increases and line closures. They will emphasise that line-closure procedures will remain, and that fares will still be regulated on monopoly services, arguing that on others competition will prevent unreasonable rises.</p>

E.O. 12689 requires agencies to establish regulations for reciprocal governmentwide effect across procurement and nonprocurement for each agency's debarment and suspension actions, after technical differences between the procurement and nonprocurement regulations governing debarments and suspensions are resolved. Section 2455 provides that the debarment, suspension, or other exclusion of a participant in a procurement activity under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or in a nonprocurement activity under regulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 12549, shall be given reciprocal governmentwide effect. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before February 21, 1995 in order to be assured of consideration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Persons wishing to submit comments on this notice of proposed rulemaking should send them to Robert Meunier, Director, Suspension and Debarment Division, Office of Grants and Debarment, Mail Code 3902F, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 ``M'' Street S.W., Washington, DC 20460. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> See preambles of the individual agencies below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> As part of the Federal Government's initiatives to curb fraud, waste, and abuse, on February 18, 1986, President Reagan signed Executive Order (E.O.) 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' E.O. 12549 established governmentwide effect for an agency's nonprocurement debarment and suspension actions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6 of E.O. 12549 directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidelines governing implementation of the Order, and section 3 of the Order directed the departments and agencies to promulgate final rules, consistent with these guidelines. On May 26, 1988, 27 agencies issued a final common rule (53 FR 19161&hyph;19211), consistent with OMB guidelines. On January 30, 1989, six more agencies co-signed the final common rule (54 FR 4722&hyph;4735). On November 27, 1992 and May 17, 1993, two more agencies co-signed the final common rule (57 FR 56262 and 58 FR 28759). On April 4, 1994, the functions of ACTION were transferred to the Corporation for National and Community Service. Each agency's codification of the common rule appears in its volume of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which participated in the initial rulemaking, no longer exists. On June 30, 1992, the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution closed and thus will not participate in this proposed rulemaking. Section 4 of E.O. 12549 established the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension (the Interagency Committee). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  On August 16, 1989, President Bush signed E.O. 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' E.O. 12689 requires agencies to establish regulations providing for reciprocal governmentwide effect across procurement and nonprocurement for each agency's debarment and suspension actions, after technical differences between the procurement and nonprocurement regulations governing debarments and suspensions are resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  President Clinton signed Public Law 103&hyph;355, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 on October 13, 1994. Section 2455 of that Act provides that the debarment, suspension, or other exclusion of a participant in a procurement activity under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or in a nonprocurement activity under regulations issued pursuant to E.O. 12549, shall be given reciprocal governmentwide effect. Thus, these proposed regulations would implement both E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;355. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Interagency Committee established three subcommittees that identified issues and made recommendations for consideration by the full Interagency Committee. The matters addressed by the three subcommittees were technical differences between the procurement and nonprocurement rules, automation issues, and nonprocurement scope. In 1989, the Interagency Committee presented recommendations to the agencies participating in this rulemaking action. The agencies considered these proposed changes and concluded that the initial recommendations addressed more issues than necessary to implement the Executive Order. As a result, representatives of the participating agencies reconsidered their initial recommendations and determined that very few technical differences needed to be resolved to obtain reciprocity between the procurement and nonprocurement rules. The determinations of the agency representatives are incorporated in this notice of proposed rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Section 3 of E.O. 12689 directed the agencies to simultaneously publish proposed rules within six months after resolution of differences between the procurement and nonprocurement rules and to publish final regulations within 12 months after publication of the proposed rules. The Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions governing debarments and suspensions are also being published for comment today. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Labour 'finds Pounds 1bn' from Grid sale to plug finances The Labour party will argue today that there is no need for ministers to replace the Pounds 1bn gap in the Budget finances caused by the VAT defeat because the government has made no specific allowance for tax receipts due from the forthcoming flotation of the National Grid. Labour believes that the disclosure will embarrass Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, when he rises in the Commons this afternoon to announce a tax and spending package to plug a Pounds 1bn hole in the Budget caused by the defeat. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said: 'Instead of penalising middle and lower income Britain, these figures show that the government is able to raise the resources it needs by tackling the excesses its own policies have created.' The move will give a further boost to the morale of Labour backbenchers, some of whom were forecasting amid the euphoria on Tuesday night that the government was on its last legs. Labour's claims about the Grid sell-off were queried by the Treasury, which said the regional electricity companies had not yet finalised flotation plans. 'We do not know the tax consequences,' it said. The City estimates, however, that the government will receive between Pounds 750m and Pounds 1bn from the Pounds 4bn flotation of the Grid through capital gains tax. The regional companies plan to float the Grid in May or June. The tax bill arises because the regional companies were given the Grid by the government when they were floated four years ago. At that time the Grid was valued in the companies' balance sheets at just over Pounds 1bn. Last week Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, announced that the government would be appointing a financial adviser on the Grid. Although the regional companies are in the private sector, the government owns shares both in them and the Grid. The Treasury said that capital gains tax receipts from the flotation would be included in corporation tax estimates in its Red Book - the government's Budget statement published last week of public finances next year. The Red Book shows that estimates for corporation tax rise from Pounds 20.1bn this year to Pounds 26.4bn next year. It says this reflects increasing company profitability but makes no reference to the Grid sale. Labour MPs were still celebrating the VAT defeat yesterday but the government's plight looked less hopeless as MPs began a more considered assessment of the damage inflicted by it. Many saw the VAT vote as the herald of a period of rapid Conservative decline which would probably end by ushering in a Labour government. Mrs Margaret Hodge, elected MP for Barking in a by-election earlier this year, said: 'Some of us are going round smiling like Cheshire cats.' Those with long memories drew a parallel between the Conservatives' difficulties and Labour's years of strife in the early 1980s, when the party appeared ungovernable and unelectable. Older hands were less optimistic, greeting the vote as a morale booster, but urging colleagues not to raise their hopes of a rapid government collapse. Mr David Winnick, the leftwing MP for Wallsall North, said: 'This will go down tremendously well in the country and we will take the credit for it. But we are under no illusions. We recognise that as long as they maintain a majority in the Commons they can drag on somehow until 1997.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Dollar Falls"] </F>   [Text] The sharp drop of the dollar's foreign exchange rate  with other international currencies during the past two days has  been attributed to expectations of rising inflation in the  United States due to the high price of commodities. The U.S.  economic recovery has opened the way for possible new  inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve, or Fed, has been  anticipating those pressures and increasing its interest rates  during the year's first six months.    The price increase in raw materials is considered an  indication that interest rates are still not high enough and  will climb even more. The prospect was enough for the market to  start dropping capital marked in dollars, expecting to buy them  back later after an interest rate increase. That reluctance to  keep dollars produced the drop in the foreign exchange rate.    It seems clear that those movements will result in changes,  perhaps important changes, in the international financial  scenario. Obviously, it is still early to make any definitive  assessment, but everything indicates that after the turbulence  there will be still higher interest rates in the United States.    The Federal Reserve's refusal to approve higher interest  rates, despite the strong market pressure, produced the  additional speculation that the monetary authority might be  evaluating the possibility of a more permanent foreign exchange  rate adjustment. The speculation continued even after U.S.  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the United States was not  interested in a devaluation, although it is a fact that the drop  in the dollar price will benefit U.S. exports. If this is the  case, interest rate increases would be smaller or authorities  would, at least, take longer to implement them.    Brazil will not benefit from an increase in international  interest rates. Higher foreign interest rates would reduce the  margin making the national market attractive for foreign  investors. Besides, high interest rates mean higher costs to  renegotiate the foreign debt, that is, higher costs for the  Brazilian Government.    The effect of these eventual changes, however, will be slow  to appear. The record volume of the country's reserves will give  us a good margin for maneuvering, and the effect of a possible  increase in the cost of renegotiating the foreign debt will be  gradual. The impact on the Real Plan will be small, but we might  have to anticipate future narrower margins in our economic  policies.</p>

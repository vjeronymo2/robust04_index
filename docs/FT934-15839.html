			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Man in the News: Ford's new model man - Alex Trotman It was an occasion rich in symbolism. On Monday some 2,000 employees, dealers and suppliers of Ford Motor, the world's second largest car manufacturer, converged on the company's oldest assembly plant in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn. There Mr Harold Poling, chairman, drove a red convertible off the assembly line, marking the start of production of a redesigned Mustang - a sporty, moderately priced car which was wildly popular with young Americans when it first rolled out of the same factory 29 years ago. It even inspired the classic 1960s pop hit, 'Mustang Sally'. Mr Poling also announced he would retire at the end of the year, naming his successor as English-born Mr Alex Trotman, 60, head of Ford's worldwide car operations, who will be the first chairman of the company born outside the US. The pairing of the events is significant, for Mr Trotman played a key role in developing the new Mustang, and in the process displayed many of the qualities which have won him the chairmanship - even though he was considered a rank outsider a few years ago. In 1990, as head of Ford's North American car operations, he faced a tricky choice: should Ford allow the aged Mustang model to die quietly or spend heavily to update it? Many senior executives, concerned about costs, leant towards euthanasia. But Mr Trotman argued, successfully, that the car had become a 'US icon'. It was, he recalls, 'unthinkable to me not to have a Mustang'. Ford, often criticised for its relatively slow delivery of new products to market, went on to develop the new car in a record (for it) 36 months and a tight Dollars 700m budget. US consumers have yet to pass judgment on the vehicle, but its development highlights Trotman's strengths. His broad experience in a 38-year career with Ford has given him a keen understanding of what sells, together with the rigour to control costs and product timetables tightly. This practical experience must have weighed heavily with the board when it chose him over the previous front-runner - the urbane, witty Mr Allan Gilmour, a vice-chairman who had spent most of his career in finance or staff jobs and lacked Mr Trotman's scars from the production trenches. Another factor was Mr Trotman's international experience. He is the only Ford executive to have run all three of its geographical sectors of operation - Asia-Pacific (in 1983-84), Europe (in 1984-89), and North America from 1989, when he steered the business through recession. 'Trotman is a very seasoned international executive, which is vital in a top position today,' says Mr David Cole, a car industry expert at the University of Michigan. Detriot's other two big motor manufacturers, General Motors and Chrysler, have also appointed new chief executives in the past 12 months, both similar to Mr Trotman in their international and production background. This is a recent shift for Detroit, which used to be run (notably at General Motors) by men from the finance side who knew little of the world beyond the US. Each of the US Big Three faces carmakers the same basic challenges: a market that is increasingly global and where excess capacity means tight profit margins and success only for those staying close to the consumer, while maintaining the highest quality and tightest costs. Ford seems the best-placed of the trio, with a slim US workforce and sharply rising market share, thanks to vehicles such as the four-wheel drive Explorer, though it is losing money in Europe. But Mr Trotman is hardly complacent. 'We can do everything better than we do it today,' he said this week. With a closely clipped moustache, erect bearing and rather military air, he comes across as a very self-disciplined individual. 'I carry lots of data with me,' he says, pulling several sheets of figures from a suit jacket pocket. 'Very important data . . . I can tell you by item the make-up of the Dollars 67bn of costs we have in North America. I can tell you what all those items are, how it compares to '92, how we're doing against budget. And I have it in my head how much better are we going to do in 1994.' The son of a carpet layer/upholsterer, he was born in Middlesex, raised in Scotland (he still speaks with a gentle burr) and joined the Royal Air Force after school. After four years as a navigator, he answered a newspaper job advertisement at Ford's Dagenham, plant in Essex, and learnt about production as a 'progress chaser' - making sure parts got from suppliers to the assembly line in time. His big break came when he played a key role in developing a new car, code-named Archbishop, which became Ford's most successful British car of the 1960s - the Cortina. In 1969, anxious to get to the US, he persuaded a reluctant Ford to offer him a job in Detroit (international staff did not normally transfer to the US ) and rapidly moved up the hierarchy, taking US citizenship along the way. Colleagues describe him as a man of quiet self-confidence who pursues a goal with intense determination (sometime excessively so) and is willing to take unpopular positions. He is a strong opponent of elitism and emphasises the importance of communication and teamwork - useful qualities in an industry trying to devolve more responsibility to its workforce and raise quality. When he became head of US operations he scrapped separate executive dining rooms and a tradition whereby top executives wrote memos on blue paper, while lesser mortals used white. The University of Michigan's Mr Cole sees his appointment as part of a transition - also evident at Chrysler and GM - away from larger-than-life chief executives (such as Chrysler's recently retired Mr Lee Iacocca) to leaders who have more the qualities of a team coach. 'The top guy has to be someone who can keep a management team working together . . . that becomes almost the most important criterion,' he argues. It may be a less colourful way of running the industry, but in a complex global market it may well be more efficient.</p>

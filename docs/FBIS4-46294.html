			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Ausuyev] </F>   [Excerpt] Groznyy, 28 May -- Chechen President Dzhokhar  Dudayev described yesterday's terrorist act in the republic as  carefully organized sabotage directed against independent  Chechnya. He said on local television today that forces opposed  to the slight thaw in Russo-Chechen relations were behind this  act.    Some details about the terrorist act emerged today. There  was a powerful explosion at about 2000 local time on 27 May on  the road between the Chechen settlements of Zakan-Lirk and  Alkha-Kala just as the president's motorcade was driving past a  Zhiguli model nine parked at the edge of the road.

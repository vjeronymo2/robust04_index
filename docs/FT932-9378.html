			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Success of Yemeni elections prompts worries for Saudis: Riyadh sees dangers in possible rise of a democratic neighbour THE ARRIVAL in Sana'a this week of senior envoys from the US and Saudi Arabia has underscored the growing international significance attached to the successful outcome of Yemen's April 27 elections. As the first multi-party poll ever held in the Arabian peninsula, the Yemeni elections have been viewed as a potential harbinger of democratic change in the Arab world. But the US and Saudi envoys, while granting qualified praise to the Yemeni achievement, have nonetheless sought to limit it in the interests of regional stability. Mr David Mack, the US deputy secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs, affirmed US support for Yemen's transition to democracy, but Mr Mack warned Yemenis against thinking they could impose their political 'blueprint' on neighbouring countries. 'It is important to remember that no country has a blueprint for democracy in another country. . . So I don't think you should look on what you do here as a model for anyone else to follow,' he told Yemeni journalists. Mr Mack denied that Saudi Arabia or any other country in the region has expressed concern over the Yemeni elections and said that governments in the area were not 'surprised' at US support for democracy in Yemen. That view was apparently confirmed by a visit on Tuesday by Dr Abdulaziz al-Khuwaytir, Saudi Arabia's education minister. But diplomats in Sanaa suggest that Dr al-Khuwaytir's visit is an outward show of support which masks deeper Saudi concerns. 'The Saudi regime is very concerned about the Yemeni turn to democracy and, in particular, about the successful outcome of the elections. 'The last thing Saudi royalty wants on its doorstep is a successful little democracy in Yemen,' one western diplomat said. A Gulf diplomat suggests that the Saudis may also be concerned about a potential Yemeni threat to their hegemony in the region. 'The Saudis are taking a longer view of political development in the area and recognise that in 10-15 years Yemen could be an important political rival in the Arabian peninsula. Already other Gulf countries are looking upon Yemen with interest. So it is better for the Saudis to appear friendly at this point than to appear unfriendly and run into trouble down the road,' he said. Yemen's leaders, aware of the Saudi unease, have already stated their disinclination to impose their new political model elsewhere. 'Other people may have something to learn from their example, but we are not looking to teach them anything. We are not in the business of exporting democracy,' Vice President Ali Salem al-Beidh told the Financial Times before the elections. Yemen's voting resulted in no clear-cut majority for any party, but between them the current ruling coalition of the General People's Congress and the Yemeni Socialist party won enough of the 301 seats in parliament to form a government. In power since the unification of North and South Yemen nearly three years ago, the GPC and YSP on Monday signed a political charter renewing their alliance.</p>

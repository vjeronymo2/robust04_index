			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cong Gong: "Self-Financed Health Plan Replaces Old </F> Co-Operative"]    [Text] The medical co-operative system, predominant in  rural China, has come under increasing strain as a result of a  severe funding shortage.    And the situation is made worse by more and more  cash-strapped doctors leaving the service.    However, the system -- which still has the support of the  majority of farmers -- is now seeking to finance itself.    Rural authorities have been raising funds for the  co-operative health care system using various sources including  the State, institutions and individuals.    The practice is paying off in Shandong Province, according  to  a survey carried out by the Medical, Public Health and Sports  Sub- commission of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference (CPPCC).    The rural medical co-operative system was initiated in the  early 1950s. The service, staffed mainly by the "bare-foot  doctors" -- largely urban-educated youths sent for re-education  in the countryside during the "cultural revolution" (1966-76) --  helped to alleviate the shortage of medical workers in rural  areas.    More than 90 percent of the rural production brigades  adopted  the medical co-operative system in the late 1970s.    But at the same time, the household contract responsibility  system was being introduced to stimulate the rural economy --  and the reforms that accompanied that system have turned out to  be unexpectedly detrimental to the collectively run co-operative  medical care system.    The central government's ban on 37 sources of revenue last  March, aimed at reducing the financial burden on peasants, led  to medical funds being held back.    The rural medical service, which received 21 percent of the  nation's medical care budget in 1978, received only 10 percent  in 1991.    In Shandong Province, for instance, some rural authorities  have refused to fund their clinics.    Other parts of the country have found themselves in a  similar  predicament. Many of the collectively funded clinics in  Qinggang County in Heilongjiang Province are now penniless.    The shortage of funds has thrown many rural medical services  into crisis.    Only 5 percent of the nation's villages now are able to  afford the medical co-operative service, according to a report  in the Legal Daily.    The situation has been made worse by the exodus of rural  doctors. Two-thirds of the rural doctors in Qinggang County want  to leave the co-operatives and set up private clinics, the  survey found.    As a result of the disintegration of the co-operative  system,  the peasants are suffering. Once-rich farmers have become  impoverished when they have to pay by themselves for an  operation or medical treatment.    The Medical, Public Health and Sports Sub-commission has  recommended that the village-level clinics be funded by rural  collectives. And qualified doctors should be encouraged to sign  contracts with clinics, said the survey.    To help the peasants, some areas in Shandong Province --  such  as Weifang, Zhaoyuan, Changqing, and Anqiu -- are trying to set  up a new type of co-operative medical system.    More than 85 percent of the townships in the province are  raising funds from villages and individual farmers to set up and  run medical foundations.    Individuals are required to pay between 2 and 10 yuan to  join  the foundation. Those who join get a 30 to 50 percent discount  for their medical care.</p>

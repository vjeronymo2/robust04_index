			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn warning SHARES in Porter Chadburn fell 9p to 25p yesterday following a warning by Mr Patrick Barrett, chairman, that on a like-for-like basis first-half profits of the packaging, consumer products and specialist distribution group would 'be well down on last year'. He added that the operating performance for the whole year would also be below that of last year. In the consumer division, anticipated profits of the Seasons Christmas decoration and barbecue business have fallen sharply. Margins on Head footwear have been poor. Sales in Leeda have been below last year's levels. The disposal of surplus leasehold warehousing space has been slower than expected: with previous provisions exhausted, the carrying cost of the properties will be higher this year than expected. In packaging, margins were likely to be lower in the first half than previously, because of planned increases in overheads.</p>

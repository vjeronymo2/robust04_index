			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLAVKIN ATTACKS SCHOOL DISTRICT BUREAUCRACY  </P> <P> Saying the school district bureaucracy is "wholly dysfunctional," Westside's  new representative to the Los Angeles school board told a small, supportive  audience Tuesday that he would attack the district's "sacred cows" and its  stifling system.  </P> <P> Too often, "what started as a creative idea . . . just gets totally mucked up  by our system," Mark Slavkin said at a Tuesday night town meeting in Los  Angeles. The district, he said, is "on the verge of total collapse and  disaster."  </P> <P> The two-hour session at Hamilton High School drew 11 parents, teachers and  administrators. Many of them had voted for him; some had even posted his  campaign signs on their lawns or made phone calls for his election.  </P> <P> Slavkin, who took office July 1, said it was the first of monthly community  meetings he will hold throughout the Westside district, which includes about 80  schools from Topanga Canyon and West Hollywood to Los Angeles International  Airport.  </P> <P> Slavkin, 27, is on leave from his job as an aide to Los Angeles County  Supervisor Ed Edelman while he determines whether his school board position  will allow him time to do anything else, he said. "It's really become a  full-time job," he said.  </P> <P> Slavkin won 51% of the votes cast in a runoff election June 6 to defeat  incumbent Alan Gershman. During his campaign, he pledged to "shake up the  fat-cat administrators and bureaucrats" and was backed by United Teachers-Los  Angeles, which considers him a sympathetic fourth vote on the seven-member  board.  </P> <P> Slavkin this week proposed to the school board that the teachers, counselors,  nurses and others who are represented by UTLA vote on whether they should be  required to join the union or at least pay dues. They are now required to do  neither, but all 32,000 of them -- 22,000 of whom are union members and 10,000  are not -- will get the wage increase of 24% over three years won by the union.  </P> <P> The issue is one of fairness, he said, likening it to taxes. "It's really not  fair to say, 'I don't want to pay taxes, but I want police and fire  protection,' " Slavkin said.  </P> <P> However, Slavkin also said UTLA has to become more dedicated to education  reform and students and "less dedicated to a war machine fighting the district,  banging heads."  </P> <P> And when teachers at the meeting said they were "tired of covering up" for  incompetent colleagues, Slavkin urged that the processes for evaluating and  firing teachers be streamlined. If problem teachers are not improving after  they are given help, they should be dismissed, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Burned-Out Teachers'  </P> <P> "We've got a lot of excellent teachers, but we got a lot of burned out  teachers, and a lot of teachers who would do great if they felt supported," he  said. "It's one of the sacred cows in the district."  </P> <P> Parents said the Westside is getting a bum rap from people who live elsewhere  who think the Westside is home solely to affluent students and parents.  </P> <P> "The stereotype of what a Westside student is" is no longer true, said Merle  Strauss, chairwoman of Palisades Complex, a group of parents, teachers and  administrators. She and other parents noted that many students are being bused  to the Westside from poor schools that get federal funding, but that the  funding does not follow them.  </P> <P> Ken Sleeper, a director in the district's educational evaluation office, said  that a 20-year-old federal program grants funds to schools in low-income areas  that have students with below-average test scores. But, he confirmed, the money  does not follow the students.  </P> <P> "The way the law was initially intended, it was part of the war on poverty,  geared to these schools in poverty areas. . . . It doesn't have the flexibility  that people might have imagined."  </P> <P> Slavkin said that instead of shipping students from overcrowded schools,  schools should be built in those neighborhoods.  </P> <P> At the same time, Slavkin said, the district has "driven people away who can  afford to get away." After the meeting, he explained that many Westside parents  who feel the district has been unresponsive have sent their children to private  schools.  </P> <P> Slavkin said that in his 3 1/2 weeks in office, he was disturbed by the  "micromanagement" of the board, which has included approving such picayune  items as field trips that already happened and a $3.39 bill on a construction  project.  </P> <P> "The system is . . . set up to guard against disasters," he said, charging that  "you don't get the opposite -- innovation, exciting ideas, risk-takers,  creativity."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pink Memoes Abound  </P> <P> "If a plane landed on a school, the response at the top would be: Who is the  principal at that school? Don't we have a policy against this? Why were those  kids out on the playground? . . . And then a pink memo to every school site  saying, 'In the future, you must know the plane schedule in your area, and kids  must never be on the playground, and there'll be an in-service for teachers  next Saturday, because when the plane did crash, these teachers were not  equipped to deal with it,' " he said.  </P> <P> Slavkin added that he wanted to see the new "shared decision-making" councils  at schools take strong roles. The councils, provided for in the teachers'  contract, will be established at all schools this fall. Composed of teachers,  parents, administrators and community leaders, they will make decisions on  spending, scheduling, student discipline and use of equipment -- previously the  realms of principals.  </P> <P> As chairman of the board's intergovernmental relations committee, Slavkin said  he would work to resolve the district's "credibility problem" represented by  the district's initially claiming that $80 million in cuts were needed but  ultimately granting 8% wage increases over three years to teachers and  administrators with only $43 million in cuts.  </P> <P> He is also the chairman of the personnel and schools committee and a member of  the building committee.  </P> <P> Other duties include sitting on the business operations committee, which  oversees the district's spending. "It may not sound as glamorous, but . . . (it  involved) $20 million worth of milk last year, $8 million worth of burritos,"  he said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi, issued in Algiers </F> on 11 April]    [Text] How can I, as a responsible Algerian who has spent  all his life at the service of the homeland, run away from this  responsibility, with the certainty that my country can, with the  help of God Almighty, get rid of its crisis by mobilizing  everybody and achieving concord and understanding between all  its loyal sons, Algeria's sons who love Algeria.    Thus I have accepted this heavy and difficult responsibility  represented by taking in charge the burdens of the prime  minister while I have in my mind the following basic  preoccupations:    -Consolidating the state's institutions,    -Reviving the national economy,    -Promoting national solidarity.    I hope to find among Algerians--I believe this is  possible--men and women who have the necessary competence to  achieve the break up which the head of state called for. This  is the break up with the negative practices of the past. This  break up will enable to give to this people again confidence in  itself and in its government, state, and future.    The new government headed by Mokdad Sifi will work for the  respect of all the commitments which Algeria took at the  national and international levels.</p>

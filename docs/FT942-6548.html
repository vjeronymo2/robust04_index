			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Sport: Brian Lara - the dream machine So Brian Lara failed, last Friday at Lords, to score his sixth consecutive century and thus equal the achievement of Don Bradman, CB Fry and Mike Proctor. Perhaps this was just as well. Otherwise crowds might have started expecting him to give them a multiple hundred every time he played, and to break a record a week - not that record breaking is difficult in cricket. Any one of us could have our wicket smashed first ball as we fail to scrabble a single and be told, by some Wisden-crazed old buffer in the commentary box, that ours was the fastest run-out at Edgbaston since Bunny Legge-Braike was stumped by the Nawab of Pataudi in 1898. A batsman can play a bad stroke at any time and, for Lara, it was perhaps better played sooner than later. His development as a cricketer - for clearly he believes he will improve - should be a natural process, not forced upon him by the ever-greater expectations of observers. And yet one could not help imagining how it would have been if he had scored that sixth century, the happy sense of awe that would have united those chilly spectators who were scattered around Lords, waiting to be entranced. People 'want' Lara to do incredible things. His 'sudden' emergence has had a miraculous aspect: the best batsman of his generation appeared as if from nowhere, his name scarcely known, his past untrammelled by years of grind, his future free to be glamorous and great. To the English, whose own cricketers seem so shambolic, so wildly unpredictable - if only they'd be bad all the time, one sometimes finds oneself thinking, instead of merely 80 per cent of it - Brian Lara represents a glorious and simple certainty. There might be an inward throb of pique, in the heart concealed behind the MCC tie, that it is not an English player who is being gloriously and simply certain. Essentially, though, Lara is the type of sportsman that transcends nationalism. It was hard to admire the Pakistani bowlers who, for all their dazzle, seemed full of spite; but Lara smiles politely at each inept ball as he sweeps it towards the sun, and displays a demeanour as impeccable as his cricket. No superfluous aggression communicates itself. Winning seems more like the incidental reward of genius than the supreme intention. And so it is that, perhaps almost as much as West Indians, English cricket lovers see themselves in Lara. They see in him an understanding, as intrinsic as their own, of the game's inexplicable ethos; and they treasure this for its rarity. After all, cricket is antithetical to the late 20th century, which is impatient, restless, egotistical and attuned to the concept of immediate gratification. In cricket the willingness to wait, to plan, to endure, to take a wider view, is just as important as the ability to attack; but today our characters are not formed to win wars of attrition, merely to zap the enemy as hard and fast as possible. Hence the emergence of the one-day game, which has infused cricket with a vehemence that should only be part of the larger scheme. But Brian Lara is above, or beyond, all this hysterical modernity: for all his youth and cool, his conduct is of an age when batsman walked and bowlers did not try to knock your head off. His genius is such that it walks hand in hand with grace. He is, it would seem, that rare phenomenon: a sportsman who is totally at ease with his own talent. With most of them, even the very greatest, one infers the strains, the sacrifices, the knowledge of the gap that has to be overcome between what nature has given their bodies and what they want their bodies to do. These inferences are a large part of what makes sport fascinating to watch: in them one can read a human drama. Yet occasionally, very occasionally, there will be a sportsman with what is almost the unconscious facility of a racehorse. Jesse Owens was probably such a one; perhaps Pele; Don Bradman, certainly. This, though, is what Jack Hobbs - another great cricketer, but not in the racehorse class - said about Bradman: 'The Don was too good. He spoilt the game because he got hundreds every time he played. . . I don't think we want to see another one like him.' Is there then, perhaps, a perfection that annihilates, that almost frightens because it seems to leave no room for anything more? This is what one sometimes feels watching Pete Sampras, another racehorse sportsman. Yet at other times, one exults in the knowledge that the game could be played no better. The perfect sportsman negates the competitive element which is essential to sport; perhaps he also negates the human element. Yet he is a magical figure in the imaginations of those that watch him. Brian Lara is not, and perhaps never will be, the 'run-getting machine' that Hobbs called Bradman. But people have seen in him the image of the perfect sportsman; and, taken unawares by his smiling genius, by the irruption into the lives of a Boy's Own hero, the most jaded of observers has begun again to dream.</p>

UD General Secretary Andrzej Machowski said the unification  congress would be probably held at the end of April, 1994.    Asked to comment on the relations between the Polish Peasant  Party (PSL) and the church, Mazowiecki said: "If the church  supported the not very reformatory policy of the PSL, it would  give rise to concern, and this is everything I can say."    Mazowiecki said it was "astounding" he was being compared  with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak as far as changes in the  posts of governors were concerned. He stressed that people  forgot a few years ago he was working in completely different  socio-political conditions.    "I have a critical opinion on today's personnel policy  conducted by the PSL as it is not guided by competence but by  party interest," Mazowiecki added.</p>

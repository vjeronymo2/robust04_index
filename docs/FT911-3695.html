			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Germany falls 1.7 per cent on Kohl party's defeat THE WEAKNESS of the German government and its currency dragged other bourses lower yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT reacted to the crushing defeat for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party in Sunday's state election in the Rhineland Palatinate, Mr Kohl's home state, and yesterday's fall in the D-Mark to a 16-month low against the dollar. After an 8.18 or 1.2 per cent fall in the broadly based FAZ index at midsession, the DAX index closed 27.46, or 1.7 per cent down at 1,571.91, its intraday low. The heavier falls in the blue chips, said Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, indicated that dealers were anticipating foreign selling. However, the drop in German equity market turnover from DM5.5bn to DM5bn indicated that prices were marked down, rather than forced down by selling volume. By the end of the afternoon, too, the leaders were probably a shade higher than the close on aggregate, in spite of a fall of more than 1 per cent on Wall Street. Daimler, Siemens and Deutsche Bank, the main international stocks, fell DM10.50 to DM680.50, DM10.20 to DM583.30 and DM13 to DM628.50 respectively, Daimler after stating that 1990 group operating profit was about 10 per cent below the 1989 level and Siemens on higher net profit for the half year to March. PARIS slipped to a five-week low on the last day of the monthly account, depressed by the French franc's weakness against the dollar and by a finance scandal which threatened to endanger the government. The CAC-40 index lost 23.92 or 1.3 per cent to 1,767.20, its lowest close since March 20, in volume estimated at just below FFr2bn. Trading was dominated by arbitrageurs tidying up their positions at the end of the account. Among the day's big losers was Paribas, down FFr14 to FFr443, with most of the 123,025 shares traded attributed to arbitrage activity ahead of the close of the share swap with Ciments Francais. Alcatel Alsthom, which was weak last week, fell another that a consortium led by Alcatel had won a FFr10bn train order from the French state railway. Peugeot gave up some of last week's recovery, losing FFr10 to FFr543. In the retail sector, Galeries Lafayette rose FFr70 or 4.1 per cent to FFr1,800 in thin volume of 380 shares after the company said it would not make a full bid for Nouvelles Galeries, in which it has a 38 per cent stake. Nouvelles Galeries fell FFr40 or 5 per cent to FFr760 with 1,350 shares traded. MILAN fell across the board in moderate trading, reflecting declines on foreign markets. Insurance and banking shares, which were sought after last week, were particularly hard hit as speculative buying petered out. The Comit index fell 6.65 to 595.99 in volume estimated below Friday's L170bn. Trading is expected to quieten before the public holiday on Thursday. Fiat fell L69 to L5,460 and dropped further to L5,435 after hours. Among the insurers, Generali lost L400 to L38,100 but eased to L37,975 later in the day, while among banks, Mediobanca fell L415 to L16,215. Hopes that the protracted feud between Mr Carlo De Benedetti and Mr Silvio Berlusoni for control of the publisher Mondadori would soon be resolved lifted Cir, the holding company of Mr De Benedetti, to L2,680 after hours, after an early fixing at L2,610, down L20. Shares in L'Espresso, 80 per cent controlled by Mondadori, were suspended at L17,000 amid frantic buying before being fixed L920 or 5.9 per cent higher at L16,500. Olivetti eased L75 to L3,845 ahead of its 1990 results due tomorrow. AMSTERDAM slumped in low volume on fears that the ever-stronger dollar would do more harm than good to corporate earnings and force the Bundesbank to raise rates to protect the D-Mark. Bonds were easier. The CBS Tendency index fell 1.9 or 2 per cent to 94.1. Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, lost Fl 1.70 to Fl 31.30 on a weekend report in the Dutch press that the US airline AMR Corp might not convert 75 aircraft options into firm orders. STOCKHOLM continued to worry about interest rates and first quarter results. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 15.8 or 1.5 per cent to 1,058.1. Volume fell from SKr308m to SKr264m, with one-third generated by Trelleborg and Ericsson. Trelleborg free B shares fell SKr1 to SKr138 and Ericsson free B's fell SKr7 to Skr192. SKF free B's fell SKr2 ahead of its first quarter earnings report due today. MADRID was lower. A 21 per cent increase consolidated net profit failed to support Banco Santander, which fell Pta70 to Pta5,510. The general index closed 2.85 lower at 279.58 in low turnover of Pta15bn. BRUSSELS saw continued interest in Gechem, the polyurethane foam producer, on rumours that Societe Generale de Belgique would soon sell its stake. The ordinary shares jumped 5.9 per cent to BFr832. The Bel 20 index fell 7.54 to 1,203.29 in volume of BFr635m. ZURICH saw the Credit Suisse index fall 7.3 to 550.0 as a slight firming in domestic interest rates kept most investors on the sidelines.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - Apr 22                           Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10 am    11 am    Noon    1 pm   2 pm    3 pm      Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1115.69  1115.63  1113.37  1112.62  N/A    N/A    1113.62   1112.13          Day's High   1116.26         Day's Low   1111.97  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Apr 19        Apr 18         Apr 17         Apr 16         Apr 15   1122.00       1124.98        1126.20        1113.65        1125.46  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> MANDELA MEETS POPE AT VATICAN  </P> <P> Black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela, in an audience with Pope John Paul  II today, called on the Vatican to take a clear position supporting sanctions  against South Africa in order to persuade Pretoria to dismantle apartheid.  </P> <P> The Pope received the African National Congress deputy president in a cordial  private audience, but a spokesman said the pontiff was not taking a specific  stand on sanctions.  </P> <P> A Vatican statement issued afterward said the Holy See supported "peaceful  political evolution" in South Africa "with the progressive overcoming of the  system of apartheid."  </P> <P> The statement said this would lead to a society "based on pacification and  reconciliation among all . . . with the guarantee of respect for the  fundamental rights of each of its citizens."  </P></p>

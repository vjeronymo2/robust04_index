			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Motoring: Vauxhall looks for automatic success - The Corsa and V6 Calibra IN ROUNDING off its Corsa range with three automatics, Vauxhall has beaten the Japanese producers at their own game. Companies such as Daihatsu and Honda, Mitsubishi and Nissan realised several years ago there was a growing niche market for small cars with power steering and automatic transmission. Until now, they have had it all their own way. But their cars have grown in size and, thanks to the zooming value of the yen, in price. The cheapest two-pedal, power steered Japanese small car is now the Pounds 9,645 Daihatsu Charade 1.3GXi five-door. A similarly equipped three-door Honda Civic is Pounds 11,765, Mitsubishi Colt Pounds 12,059 and Nissan Micra five-door, Pounds 10,685. The only non-Japanese rival, a two-pedal Renault Clio three-door, costs Pounds 10,215 with optional power steering. Remarkably, even the most expensive Vauxhall automatic, power-steered Corsa, the 1.4i GLS 5-door, is only Pounds 9,585. And the cheapest, the Merit 3-door, just Pounds 7,962. But the Corsa's attraction goes far beyond price. It is a little cracker of a car, as solidly built as a baby Saab, nimble as a ballet dancer in town and effortlessly parkable. The five-door 1.4i GLS I drove last week rode country lanes and cruised on motorways as placidly as many a car one class up in size. Its electronically controlled four-speed automatic gearbox is essentially the same as that used in the Astra and Cavalier (Opel Vectra). If the Corsa is driven sensibly, the transmission shifts so smoothly the only indication is a change in the engine note. In third and top gears the transmission's hydraulic torque converter locks up, eliminating slippage and saving fuel. At least 40 miles per gallon (seven litres or less per 100km) should be possible on a journey. There are economy, sport and winter settings. I see little point is using the sport setting because all it does is increase change-up speeds. (If you were that kind of driver, you would go for a manual gearbox anyway). The change-up speeds in economy setting are perfectly adequate. In winter setting, the car moves off in third gear, which reduces the chance on wheelspin in snow. The two-pedal Corsas are on sale now. Vauxhall thinks it will sell 1,400 of them by the end of the year and 3,000 in 1994. As word gets round among city centre drivers and mature motorists, who ask little of a car except that it is well made, keenly priced and exceptionally easy to drive, this could be an under-estimate. Vauxhall, which took UK market leadership in July for the first time in its 90-year history, has also introduced V6-engined, manual or automatic transmission, versions of the Calibra, which looks like being Britain's most popular coupe this year. Sales are up 36 per cent compared with 1992 and a record 1,475 were registered last month. Under its elegantly curved body, the Calibra is mainly Cavalier - the car sold as an Opel Vectra on mainland Europe. The new Saab 900 also makes use of its chassis platform. Calibra manages to feel different from Cavalier or Saab 900, just as Peugeots and Citroens do, in spite of sharing most major components. So far, Calibras have been offered with two-litre, four-cylinder engines, including a rapid but well mannered 204 horsepower turbo version. This has four-wheel drive and remains easily manageable on wet and slippery roads. The V6 Calibras sit between the 16-valve 2.0-litre and the turbo 4x4 in price and performance. Though both are said to have the same potential top speed of 147 mph/237 kmh, the turbo is a half-second faster from 0-60 mph (0-96 kmh). They are quieter and, some might say, less sporting than either the 16-valve or turbo, but does it matter? Not, I suspect, to many Calibra buyers who have been seduced away from a cheaper Cavalier saloon by the coupe's ravishing good looks. The British-made 2.5-litre V6 engine, spinning silkily up to high revolutions, puts out 170 horsepower at 6,000 rpm. Its strong mid-range pulling power makes for quick, safe overtaking. The standard V6 Calibra has a five-speed manual gearbox and costs Pounds 19,870; the four-speed automatic is Pounds 20,624. Prices include airbags for both front seats, ABS brakes and black leather trim. One can pay a great deal more for a multi-cylinder coupe but for sheer driving pleasure I would back a Calibra V6 against any price-competitive rival.</p>

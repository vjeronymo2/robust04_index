			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: Dancing Dracula WITHOUT, uncharitably, naming names, I must note that the idea of a horror ballet suggests to me the work of one or other of those European choreographers who specialise in anguish and intellectual posturing. How good to report that the Royal Ballet of Flanders has brought an echt Bram Stoker-ish chiller to our shores, this week in Northampton. Dracula is the real thing. It was choreographed by the late Stuart Sebastian in 1990 for his Dayton Ballet, and entered the Flanders repertory a year later. It would be easy enough - and difficult enough - to send Dracula stratospherically up. Sebastian cleverly saw it as a narrative which, while it might encourage performances of extreme and scenery-chewing bravado, had dramatic energy and unabashed blood-chilling tensions. So his staging fillets Bram Stoker's tale, but keeps its curious erotic drive, and brings off some tingling theatrical coups to set our hackles rising. I would not make vast claims for Sebastian's choreography - his dances are unadventurous in classic language - or for his sensitivity as a story-teller, but this Dracula moves at a cracking pace, and has the properly uneasy atmosphere. There is effective design, by Chris Phillips, of skeletal arches and drapery that evoke locations well, with excellent lighting also by Mr Phillips, and good traditional costuming by Lowell Mathwich. For his score Sebastian made a collage of classical gems: we begin with the Dies irae from the Verdi Requiem, and pass by Verdi's Macbeth, the Rossini Stabat mater, Rakhmaninov's most famous piano prelude and a mad moment from a Vierne organ sonata with wolf-howl obbligato. There is also an intermittent accompaniment of bat squeaks, thunderstorms, a few ear-splitting screams from recipients of the Count's attentions, quantities of drifting mist and hellish red light. It is all huge fun in its desire to give us something horrid. Sebastian makes sound dance ensembles - there is a charming party scene to Lanner waltzes - and a couple of pas de deux in which the Count's irresistible charms are well displayed as he plays at transfusions with Lucy Westenra and Mina. The piece is danced with tremendous verve by the Flanders company. The ensemble is strong, classically stylish, and the leading roles, as I saw them on Thursday evening, are excellently taken. Dracula is played by Chris Roelandt with entire seriousness and a considerable and demonic allure: we believe in him. Lucy is beautifully drawn by Lorena Feijoo and Mina is no less well shown by Ninon Neyt. As the mad, fly-eating Renfield, Eric Frederic gives a fine display of neurosis and pirouettes, and I was impressed by Rinat Imaev (a Bulgarian danseur) who played and danced Jonathan Harker with real finesse. The entire cast give the piece a nice edge of hysteria to keep us all on the qui vive. It may not be the most serious ballet on view this year, but it must be among the most engaging. And for connoisseurs of theatrical tots, there is a female kiddie who scampers, with gorge-rising innocence, into the clutches of the vampires. But instead of being served up as an aperitif to the Count, the infant (in a white nightie and a mass of tousled curls) is led to safety. Curses] At the Derngate, Northampton, until May 23. Support from Ann Bonham and Sons. Grand Theatre, Blackpool from May 25-29</p>

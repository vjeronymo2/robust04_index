			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Ilyich Zorkaltsev, deputy chairman of </F> Central Executive Committee of Communist Party of Russian  Federation and State Duma deputy, by Valentina Nikiforova; date  and place not given: "Political Instructor Klochkov Would Spare  the People"]    [Text] We could see the lights of Moscow through the window  of the office on the 15th floor of the building occupied by the  Duma. It was a breath-taking sight and...a disturbing one:  Foreign words blazed audaciously in neon lights on Novyy Arbat.  Viktor Ilyich sighed with regret:    "It is like a foreign city...."    It had been a hard day: The Duma had been discussing the  draft budget, and during the breaks he had spoken with  representatives of different religions, given statements to  reporters, and worked on his speech for the upcoming party  conference. He did not refuse the interview, however, because  Viktor Ilyich had once seen a thick pile of letters from readers  on the editor's desk and made this request after reading some of  them:    "Give them to me, and I will answer them personally and  through PRAVDA."    This man, a structural engineer by profession and a party  worker by vocation, a people's deputy of the Supreme Soviet and  a deputy of the State Duma by civic duty--what did he see in  these letters?    "I wanted to communicate with the authors, to explain some  things, and to argue about others. In the past there was not  enough time to read letters, and this was not even part of our  routine--we only responded to official requests from superior  party and soviet organs regarding 'complaints filed by  workers,'" he said with an ironic grin.    [Nikiforova] Viktor Ilyich, what was it about the letters  that interested you?    [Zorkaltsev] In the letters and in conversations with  people,  I keep hearing the same question: "When you communists are back  in charge of the government, will you put everything back the  way it was?" I want to say frankly and sincerely that the  communists will not be back in charge of the government. This is  not our goal. The objective of the Communist Party is to put the  workers in charge--the segment of the laboring public that  shares the ideals of socialist construction. Furthermore, if we  do establish government by the people (and not government by the  party!), we will not put anything back the way it was. We will  move ahead.    [Nikiforova] Then the readers--or, more precisely, some  readers--want to know if it is true that the RF Communist Party  is in favor of reform.    [Zorkaltsev] Yes, it is. The need for reform is  self-evident.  Here is what Mikhail Ivanovich Kozhin from Krasnodar Kray says  in his letter: "Although I still support socialism and have  retained my communist convictions, I will refrain from rejoining  the RF Communist Party because I did not agree with the  socialism we had even in the 1950s." That is the opinion of a  man who does not deny the need for reform, but we cannot see any  kind of reform in our country today! What we see is an  artificial situation in which people are being forced to cross a  river and are being promised that life is better over there. But  the river is turbulent, the water is cold, the elderly are  drowning, the children are sick, and the women are crying.  Meanwhile, others are urging them on, forcing them to swim  faster, to their death.    If we are going to cross a river, we have to begin by  finding  out how deep it is and how swift the current is, collecting life  preservers, and then calmly starting the journey, all of us at  the same time. Have you heard what kind of budget we are  approving? It is the most anti-reform document possible! We have  heard that the reformers want to build capitalism (an absurd  idea in itself, because Russia was not destined to master it at  once), but why then does the budget allocate only 17.5 billion  rubles for the promotion of business and commercial enterprise,  249 billion for the development of family farms, and 3.78  trillion for the administrative bureaucracy?    [Nikiforova] It is probably no coincidence that the idea of  the agreement on civic accord came up, and with such a close  deadline--28 April. Anatoliy Ivanovich Shorokhov from  Krasnoyarsk Kray is extremely critical of this idea: "Before the  elections they tried to frighten us with the threat of civil war  if we did not approve the draft constitution. Now there is  suddenly a need for this agreement as well. Is the Constitution  no longer enough? Could this be another trick: to prevent the  opposition from voicing any objections and then calmly declare a  state of emergency?" What would you tell him?    [Zorkaltsev] The accord is actually necessary for the  avoidance of a state of emergency. It is true that this could be  achieved by constitutional means, but the government and the  president have to take some substantive steps now.    [Nikiforova] What kind of steps?    [Zorkaltsev] First they have to pay people their back wages.  What kind of accord can we have when people are not getting  enough money to cover their living expenses for four or five  months at a time? The second thing is to make cost-of-living  adjustments in pensions. The third is to return everything they  seized in January 1992. Then they can perfect the tax system and  leave it in place for the next 5 or 10 years.    After all of this has been done, we can begin to consider  signing the document. And there will be no deadline of 28 April!    [Nikiforova] Is that your personal opinion?    [Zorkaltsev] Yes. I expressed it at a faction meeting, but  the final decision on signing should be made by the  administrative bodies of political forces. We can only sign the  agreement after the decision has been made by the all-Russian  conference.    [Nikiforova] On your own terms?    [Zorkaltsev] If a two-year moratorium on political stability  is declared, the Mausoleum of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin will have to  be reopened, and the memorials by the Kremlin wall and Vladimir  Ilyich's office and home must be inviolate. The expenses of the  Lenin Museum must be included in the budget and financed  completely. The blacklist of deputies who defended the  Constitution in the Palace of Soviets must be voided.    The economic conditions are set forth in the Premises of the  Communist Party Program, "From Crisis to Stable Development,  Sovereignty of the People, and Socialism."    [Nikiforova] The general response to the document was  favorable. Here is what I. Gobozov from Moscow writes: "The  'Premises' advocate national accord, which offers indisputable  confirmation of the fact that the communists, contrary to the  common views of their opponents, are not calling for class  warfare. We must not forget, however, that 'people in palaces do  not have the same views as people in huts.'"    [Zorkaltsev] And that the "hut-dwellers" will want to cross  swords with the "palace-dwellers" at some point. That is why a  political party hoping to lead the "hut-dwellers" must not  forget Feuerbach's warning....    Incidentally, the "Premises" were drafted by party workers,  and not by elitist academicians from the party. I know that the  document is being criticized by the Right and the Left, and this  is a good thing: It means that we will be able to chart the  right course. One thing that is disturbing, however, is that  both sides are quoting V.I. Lenin! They criticized us for  agreeing to the elections, for example, saying that this was not  a Leninist move. Lenin, they say, would have been against this,  but they have not even read Lenin's works!    Obviously, our party can be criticized for some things. My  comrades in the leadership and I can see its flaws, but people  are still joining it. I recently attended the Khoroshevskiy  Rayon Conference in Moscow, where three people were issued  membership cards. One was 46 years old, joining in the prime of  his life, but the other two were quite young. This means they  put their trust in the Communist Party!    [Nikiforova] While we are on the subject, here is something  we were told by Arseniy Chanyshev, an instructor at Moscow State  University. Twenty years ago he was not allowed to go into  science because of some poems he had written against the  communists (saying he would rather go to hell than live among  them), but now he sees so many people who have "gone to hell."  He writes with concern about the "lost generation of  perestroyka." He is looking to the communists for solutions and  salvation: "Only the communists have an accurate view of  Russia's present tragic situation and can analyze it from the  standpoint of science and class (and ours is now a  class-antagonistic society), and only they can save Russia." But  the Communist Party still has to analyze its own policies more  thoroughly. Many communists feel that the tragic changes in the  party were the result of the betrayal of the upper echelon and  the leaders. Do you agree?    [Zorkaltsev] This is an obvious mistake, and when people say  that we will revive the CPSU and that this will guarantee the  restoration of the Soviet Union, this is an even bigger mistake.  The CPSU caused the Soviet Union to collapse and then destroyed  itself. The CPSU was unable to offer the society a new model of  development. Strong productive forces came into conflict with  production relations, and the party, which had already grown fat  and lazy on materialistic gratification, did not notice this. It  had lost its fighting strength and could not lead the society.    The CPSU got soft when there were no other parties competing  with it, but now there are only 600,000 of us and we won the  election. In 1989 there were 9 million communists in Russia and  we lost. We now hold 10 percent of the seats in the Duma, and we  can have the final say on some matters. We plan to implement the  economic part of our program there. In the Supreme Soviet, 85  percent of the deputies were communists, and what was the  result? When they say that Yeltsin suspended the activities of  the CPSU and banned the party, this is a lie. Deputies voted for  the suspension at the USSR Congress of People's Deputies,  attended by all of the former obkom first secretaries and  members of the Central Committee. Dissident Roy Medvedev walked  up to the microphone and was the only one to object. Why did the  170 obkom first secretaries and Central Committee members remain  silent? Why did the Central Committee itself remain silent?  Yeltsin did not sign his edicts until after all of this. They  were based on the decision of the USSR Congress of People's  Deputies!    Here is another fact. When the Belovizh bargain was being  concluded, the communists did not defend the results of the 17  March 1991 referendum. In the auditorium where the treaty was  ratified, a few of us felt as if we were sitting in a well.  Communists all around us stood and applauded. There was still  time to correct everything then. Just imagine this: Political  instructor Klochkov rises to lead the people in battle, and at  that time he is "suspended"! He is no longer a political  instructor....    [Nikiforova] The letters contain extremely vehement  criticism  of the bureaucratic party. Do you agree?    [Zorkaltsev] It hurts me when people say that about the  CPSU.  The party promoted and always will promote career personnel. It  could not exist without them, and the present fight with the  party bureaucracy is a carefully orchestrated performance. Few  of the readers were in the party with us. At one time the most  mature and politically knowledgeable promoters of the communist  ideal had to leave the party. The new people, although there  were many intelligent and outstanding organizers among them,  were confronted by an experienced and insidious political  opponent--and were defeated.    I have spent my whole adult life working for the party. I  never knew (or was it just luck?) any hoarders, money-grubbers,  or hypocrites. They were all people who were devoted to the  ideal and the cause and they did the work in response to their  conscience, and not for money.    [Nikiforova] Yes, but will you agree that the party has  aged?    [Zorkaltsev] I often hear that only old people come to party  meetings, and I reply that these are the most steadfast  supporters of the communist ideal. As long as they are still  here, there is a chance to prepare replacements for them. In  Khoroshevskiy Rayon I was fascinated by Doctor of Philosophical  Sciences Mikhail Pavlovich Shendrik. He is an elderly man with a  great mind and a colossal memory. He is the true ideologist of  that party organization.    [Nikiforova] Incidentally, I saw that organization's  campaign  leaflets. They were explicit, clear, and precise. Everyone  should have a chance to read them....    [Zorkaltsev] This is a vivid example of a job done by  professionals. This means that the party is safe and is coming  around the perilous bend. Each day it has to defend itself.  First it is criticized by PRAVDA, then by LEVAYA GAZETA, and  then even by the people attending a party conference. I once  gave a speech in the Taman Division Officers Club. I was asked  why I had never come before. Without thinking, I replied that  they had their own deputy. When the meeting was over, a  communist who had been in the party for 40 years came up to me  and reprimanded me:    "Why did you say that you are not our deputy? We voted for  the Communist Party ticket and I campaigned for you."    [Nikiforova] Do you have any complaints about PRAVDA?    [Zorkaltsev] I like PRAVDA, but there is something I have to  say. I was offended to read two articles in a row that were  essentially an indictment of the Russian Orthodox Church. One  was written by Rutskoy's assistant, and the other was written by  Rutskoy himself. The Orthodox Church and its hierarchy were  blamed directly or indirectly in one of them for the events of  3-4 October. I think this was a result of political  nearsightedness rather than malice.    I am an atheist, but there are certain times in politics  when  everything that is genuinely Russian has to be protected. Our  ancient traditional religions need support. In the years of  Soviet power many church leaders were awarded the highest honors  of their Motherland. Everyone knows how helpful the church was  during the Great Patriotic War and the postwar years.    As far as the tragic events are concerned, it seems to me  that Khasbulatov did not have enough staying power, and that a  cursory reading of Ilyin and Berdyayev could not make Rutskoy a  profound man....    [Nikiforova] Viktor Ilyich, many communists are disturbed by  the prospect of unification in the SCP-CPSU. The Moscow  organization was actually split by different views on this  matter. Some of the letters accuse the RF Communist Party  leadership of not joining the SCP-CPSU because they have  degenerated and are drifting toward social democracy.    [Zorkaltsev] I do not agree with the line of the SCP-CPSU  leadership. Think back on what they have accomplished in a year  and a half of existence. They held a congress of peoples of the  USSR, but they turned the grand and difficult task of uniting  the country into a slogan. What contributed to the quick  establishment of the Soviet Union in 1922? Russia was like a  beacon to the outlying regions. They were attracted by the  revolution that had triumphed and was defending itself, by the  grand-scale construction, by the progressive ideology, and by  the strong intelligentsia. The backward outlying regions were  drawn to Russia. Recently, however, when Russia relinquished all  of those same regions and was in a state of poverty, they all  turned away from it and the parade of sovereignties began. Can  they live alone for long? Time will tell, and it has already  told us in some cases.... But we cannot establish a new union  until Russia recovers its appeal. We have to build a powerful  Russia and build a strong Communist Party. Then it will be  joined by other communist parties in our Fatherland, and we will  all work together to build a single state. This is why the work  against the RF Communist Party, which split the party, is work  against the communist movement and the whole leftist movement. I  cannot bear this. That is why I feel that we should join the  SCP-CPSU soon. Then it will be easier to reach an agreement with  other parties. In the first place, communists are collectivists  and internationalists. In the second place, now that there are  several communist parties, they should unite, because this is  not the time for dissension.    The slow integration of the Fatherland is beginning.  Regrettably, it was not initiated by leftist forces. Oddly  enough, it is being promoted by the power structure. Everyone  criticizes V. Chernomyrdin, but his integration on the basis of  property exchanges has proved to be a sound process. Then there  is the creation of the ruble zone, which also, to our regret,  was initiated not by us, but by the premier.    You remember how the leaders of the six republics met in  Tashkent and had already reached an agreement on the ruble zone  when Christopher suddenly arrived, made his tour, and  annihilated the plan in its infancy. It was a good thing that  Belarus held out. If the communist parties had acted decisively  and boldly, the republics might have held out.    Yes, it is true that the Communist Party does not agree with  this government's reforms, and we do criticize it, but we do  support this particular government move. We do not like Yeltsin,  but we support his position on the creation of the ruble zone.  Our voters and the supporters and allies of the RF Communist  Party should know this.    [Nikiforova] Incidentally, how would political instructor  Klochkov respond today to these comments by R. Kosourov,  secretary of an RCWP [Russian Communist Workers' Party] rayon  organization from Ryazan Oblast?    "The team in charge today and the whole bourgeois upper  echelon will not give up their power to the workers without a  fight. That is why the working class, as capitalism's  grave-digger, and the peasantry, its loyal ally in the struggle  for class interests, need a party armed with Marxist-Leninist  theory and capable of leading them to victory, and not accord or  a government of national accord. The slogan 'Proletarians of all  nations, unite!' is not obsolete."    [Zorkaltsev] The working class.... It might be more accurate  to say the labor collective. Today it is impossible to  distinguish the worker from the engineer or the foreman. There  is no question that the slogan "Proletarians of all nations,  unite!" is right, but can we realize it today? Did the workers  on the Ford assembly line, for instance, support the workers of  the Lenin Vehicle Plant? I have not heard, but I know that this  would not be convenient for the Ford workers. After all, they  now earn a fairly high wage, and partly because of the low wages  workers earn in other countries. The attempt to move too far  ahead in ideology and the party's objectives led to the events  of 3-4 October. I think political instructor Klochkov would  spare the people for now. He would advise study and training. We  must remember that the Great October Socialist Revolution  triumphed because it was not a plot by a small group of people  or a coup by members of the upper echelon, but a great popular  movement.</p>

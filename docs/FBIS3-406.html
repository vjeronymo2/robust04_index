"There will be more efforts to convince people in the  AVF that we should keep our options open," Gen Groenewald said.    "There is little chance that the AVF as a front will  register. But I don't think the matter has been put on ice," he  said.    The AVF decided on Saturday not to register for the  elections  after its leader Constand Viljoen had registered a Freedom Front  for the poll. His decision was prompted by the move by the AVF's  Freedom Alliance partner, the Inkatha Freedom Party, to register.    Gen Groenewald said it was no secret that some AVF members  supported taking part in the election ane that they would  continue efforts to get the election boycotters round to their  point of view. He said Monday's meeting with the alliance  partners -- Bophuthatswana and the IFP -- would help determine  the AVF's course of action.    If the registration of the Freedom Front is allowed to  lapse,  the AVF may be the only alliance party staying out of the  election. In an indication that it was preparing to register,  Bophuthatswana has arranged for a late registration if the  homeland's cabinet decides on Monday to join the elections.    Gen Groenewald said the AVF would also be examining what  results international mediation may be able to deliver.    He said talks with the African National Congress on a  political accord on a volkstaat [homeland] would continue. He  said more successful talks on the issue on Friday might have  secured AVF registration by giving Gen Viljoen something with  which to convince his followers of the need to take part in the  poll.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by </F> unidentified correspondent in the TRT studio -- live]    [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, very important  developments have taken place in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the  early evening hours of today. First, the Serbs shot down a  British war plane belonging to NATO and later entered Gorazde  with tanks. It was reported moments ago that they opened mortar  fire on houses in Gorazde. The latest news is regarding the  NATO air operation. How do you assess these developments?    [Cetin] I would like to say first, that for a long time now,  the United Nations has been acting very hesitantly. It has been  15 days now that intense Serb attacks have been continuing  around Gorazde. The United Nations thought that the crisis  could be solved at the table and therefore tried to perpetuate  diplomatic contacts. There is only one language the assailant  can understand, and that is the language of determination from  the opposite side. The Serbs gained courage when hesitancy  started -- on whether NATO should intervene or not -- or when  the allies and the forces serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina  disagreed. As a result, the Serbs intensified their siege of  Gorazde since last night. Civilians live in Gorazde and  actually the situation this afternoon was the consequence of  mortar fire on a hospital. The air operation was started to  stop the Serbs and consequently the Serbs shot down a British  plane.    Since we had already foreseen these developments while we  were closely following the events last night, we conducted  intensive contacts in NATO and at the United Nations. We called  on the UN Security Council to hold an extraordinary meeting. It  is obvious that there is a difference of views between the  civilian and the military branch of the United Nations in  Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is obvious that there is a  lack of communication between General Rose and Yasushi Akashi.  Proof of this is when General Rose asked for intervention  yesterday but there was a belief that the situation would be  solved by negotiations. A meeting was held with the Bosnian  authorities in Sarajevo this afternoon but no results were  reached.    I held two to three telephone conversations with the Bosnian  Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and contacted the United Nations  and NATO once more. The important issue in this matter is as  follows: There are civilians living in Gorazde and the Bosnian  army is not mounting serious opposition. In view of this  situation, great responsibility falls on the United Nations and  NATO. It goes without saying that we do not want war but we  have to respond in a language that those that choose war  understand.    Gorazde is totally encircled right now. They can capture  Gorazde whenever they want. Actually Gorazde has been in such a  situation from the beginning. The interesting thing in this  situation is that the United Nations chose six safe areas. How  can the United Nations, which cannot secure the safe areas,  secure the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina? As a matter of fact, a  number of UN officials were abducted by Serbs yesterday and a  lot of effort went into freeing them, during which a soldier was  killed.    We are especially stressing the fact that we are taking  every  initiative necessary. Our president sent -- will send --  messages now. We are conducting the necessary contacts. What  is important is to act with determination. The minute we show  we are hesitant -- when NATO intervenes then asks whether it  should have done so or not or whether it was sufficient or not  -- then we are not talking the same language as our opponent.  There should be no hesitation. The opposite side gains courage  when there is hesitation. For this reason the UN authorities in  Bosnia-Herzegovina should use their power without waiting any  longer and with the power invested in them should call NATO to  duty. Only by these means can the situation be saved,  otherwise, the United Nations will be responsible for what  happens to the people of Gorazde.    We will follow the situation closely all through the night.  All our friends in the Ministry are on duty and I hope that the  Serbs will be deterred when they see this determination and in  case they are not, NATO should conduct a serious intervention in  the situation.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, don't you think the NATO air  operation is a favorable development?    [Cetin] Yes, the operation is very favorable. We reiterated  our appeal to NATO. We continued with our contacts all through  last night. NATO should not show hesitancy until a result is  achieved. What we wish, actually, is that the result be reached  by means of negotiations. That is, the Serbs should give up  their siege and surrender all their heavy weapons to the United  Nations and if not, the necessary response should be given  because it is obvious that the only language the Serb  administration understands is the language of force and  determination and this determination should be shown.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / US moves on protesters The US Supreme Court ruled yesterday that anti-abortion protesters who block clinics can be sued under the tough US racketeering law, Reuter reports from Washington. The decision by Chief Justice William Rehnquist overturned a lower court ruling that anti-abortion protesters were not covered by the federal racketeering law. Judge Rehnquist said the racketeering law does not require proof that the protesters' actions were motivated by an economic purpose. Anti-abortion groups argued they were motivated by moral and political reasons and thus were not covered by the law. The ruling was a major victory for the Clinton administration and for abortion rights activists, who have long sought to use the racketeering law to deter the blocking of entrances to clinics and the harassment of employees and women seeking abortions.</p>

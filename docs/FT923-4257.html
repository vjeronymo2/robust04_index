			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Letter: Appropriate index Sir, I was interested to read of the FT participation in the new indices ('New UK share indices to join existing benchmarks', September 2). They are bound to be known as the Footsie 250 and 350. It therefore seems appropriate that the index formed from the difference between the FT-All Share and the Footsie 350 (suitably weighted, of course]) will be called the Footrest. Let's hope it's not too long before recovery allows us to use it. B R Parks, 31 Earlswood Road, Dorridge, Solihull</p>

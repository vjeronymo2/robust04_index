			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A Palestinian teen-ager stabbed an Israeli soldier and then was shot and  wounded as troops chased him through a crowded market, the army said. In  clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded 10  Palestinians, Arab sources said. The violence came on the eve of municipal  elections, which the leadership of the nearly 15-month uprising has ordered  Arabs to boycott. The military commander of the West Bank town of El Bireh,  about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, said the Arab youth stabbed the last soldier  in a routine patrol. As the assailant fled, two soldiers fired, hitting him in  the head and neck. The soldier was reported to have suffered minor to moderate  wounds.  </P></p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Computing: Pegasus prepares to fly once more - Advances in accounting software MOMENTOUS events are taking place in the world of accounting software. The undisputed market leader in the early and mid-'80s, Pegasus, has in recent years been going nowhere. Pegasus produced a string of products, some good, some bad, all marginal, while its neglected core product Pegasus Senior came to look increasingly long in the tooth. Pegasus shares fell sharply recently when their chief executive departed after only six months in office. Contrast this with the performance of Sage which, starting from nothing in the mid-80s, has had a record of unbroken success. It now claims 80 per cent of the UK market for integrated accounts packages and the title of 'the world's number one in accounting software'. Last month a Pounds 400,000 advertising campaign heralded the release of its new product Sterling +2 - 'a revolution in accounting software'. But maybe things are not quite what they seem. The crucial decision determining Pegasus's future was made in October when the company announced that it had purchased the rights to Sequel, a package written by former Pegasus directors Johnie Johnson and Chris Leak. I tried Sequel earlier this year when only the ledgers and sales order processing modules were complete, but it was enough to see that this is a super product with a real 1990s look and an ideal successor to Senior. Pegasus are going through a torrid time, but I think it has found a winner. On the Sage front, I have been evaluating Sterling +2 over the last few weeks. Reluctantly, I have to say that I found this package a terrible disappointment. The sales and purchase order processing modules are totally inadequate. The invoicing module is one of the 'batch update' type that other companies stopped writing years ago. It will let you enter and print off sales invoices for an out-of-stock item all day long without a word of complaint, but when at the end of the day you try to update your batch of 20 or 30 invoices to the ledgers it refuses to accept them because you did not have any stock] Any modern-day invoicing package warns you that you are out of stock immediately you try to enter the invoice. And has no one at Sage ever heard of invoicing from a product price file? Unbelievable. Outside the accounting ledgers Sterling +2 is an antique. But, to be realistic, accounting ledgers (sales, purchase, nominal) is what most users want, so these wounds, though severe, need not be mortal. Sage seems to have made a good job on the ledgers. Invoices are fully analysed to the nominal; financial transactions can be retained live all year, and there is a particularly comprehensive analysis of VAT for the quarterly VAT return. However, where Sterling +2 really is revolutionary is in the 'user interface'. Sage believes that the future lies in the graphical user interface ('GUI', as in treacle) and they have implemented the WIMP (Windows, Icons, Mouse, Pointer) environment in both DOS and Windows versions of Sterling +2. In this they are taking a tremendous risk, since probably not one bookkeeper in a hundred is familiar with the GUI way of doing things. I think Sage would have been wiser to make it clear to prospective purchasers that Sterling +2, in either version, is really only suitable for experienced mouse users. I ran the DOS version through the keyboard alone, but found it heavy going. My guess is that, neither mouse-trained nor warned of what to expect, many bookkeepers will simply hate the new Sage. So, with Sage wandering into the bogs of GUI land, what is the alternative for the non-mouse user? Without doubt, the real shooting star in the accounts package market these days is TAS Books from Megatech. Launched late last year at the give-away price of Pounds 99 to the accompanyment of heavy advertising in the PC magazines, TAS Books now claims 17 per cent of the market. TAS books was endorsed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, 'editor's choice' in this's month's PC Magazine. It is currently on a roll and sales have shot up from zero to 700 units a month. Theo van Dort, the founder and designer, believes he has a mission to show PC users how easy double-entry accounting really is, so TAS Books comes with a comprehensive 242-page tutorial that takes you through worked examples of all the major postings. It is really excellent. Here at last is an entry-level accounts package of high technical quality which can be recommended unreservedly both to accountant and to non-accountant alike. TAS Books costs Pounds 99 single user, Pounds 199 multi-user. Megatech are on 081-874-6511. David Carter is a consultant in small business computer systems, tel 0727-812447.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / EC anti-trust fears over Nestle bid NATIONAL anti-trust authorities are concerned that European Commission approval of a FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.58bn) bid by Nestle, the world's largest food group, for Perrier, the French mineral water group, would set worrying new precedents in EC competition policy. European commissioners are likely to approve the deal, probably this Wednesday, on condition that Nestle sells off eight mineral water springs to a single buyer. Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, names four of the brands to be sold, including Saint Yorre, but Nestle/Perrier will be able to keep the best-known brand-names. The springs for sale have a capacity of about 3bn litres of still and sparkling water - 20 per cent of the French mineral water market. But some hardline national competition authorities believe Brussels should have based its decision on the existing market, rather than on future capacity. The hardliners - which include Britain's Office of Fair Trading and Germany's Bundeskartellamt - are also upset that Nestle will be allowed to proceed with its contract to sell the Volvic brand to BSN, the French food group. 'In public, (the Commission) will try to present the solution in competition terms, but if you look deeper into this you will find there are no real competition arguments,' one national official said. Some commissioners, and the Commission's legal service, have also found flaws in the radical proposal. For example, some of Sir Leon's colleagues believe that because it seems to dictate the shape of the French mineral water market, the proposal is really interventionism disguised as competition policy. Others point out the Commission is legally unable to prevent the third party which buys the Nestle/Perrier brands from selling them on to BSN. That would defeat the object - to prevent Nestle and BSN building a 'duopoly' of the French market. If the recommendation is approved, it could widen the scope of the Commission's merger authorities to examine potential duopolies and oligopolies - two or more large players carving up a market.</p>

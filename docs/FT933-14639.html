			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Price rise boosts Gold Fields AN increase of 9 per cent in the average gold price offset lower production and allowed the four gold mines in the Gold Fields group to improve after-tax profits by 15 per cent to R306.6m (Dollars 92.3m) in the three months ended June compared with the March quarter. Gold Fields does not sell production forward so its results are closely geared to movements in the gold price. The average price per kg received during the quarter was R35,672 compared with R32,716 in March. This was offset, however, by the 6 per cent fall in gold produced to 28,775kg following a fire at West Driefontein and a fall in the grade at the Kloof division of the Kloof mine. The net effect of these conflicting trends was that working profit rose marginally to R337.8m from R330.8m. A large jump in net sundry revenue - mainly payouts from insurance claims related to fires - to R41.2m from R13.9m helped bolster after-tax profit. Commenting on the individual mines, Mr Michael Fuller-Good, general manager, said Driefontein should be able to improve on its profits as the west part of the mine had recovered from its fire. He said the Kloof division was performing well, despite the recent fall in grade. He thought the Libanon division, which made a working loss in the June quarter, was probably back in profit at current gold prices.</p>

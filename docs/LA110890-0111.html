			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> ANNUAL REUNION ROMPS IN OPENER  </P> <P> Reversing a trend, on-track attendance was up when Hollywood Park began its  37-day fall meeting Wednesday.  </P> <P> The count, which wasn't released until 35 minutes after the ninth race, was  declared official at 13,931, compared to 11,729 on opening day in 1989. This  was the first time since 1985 that the opening-day crowd wasn't smaller than in  the previous year.  </P> <P> Fresh from their easy victory with Quiet American in Saturday's $638,000 NYRA  Mile at Aqueduct in New York, trainer Gary Jones and jockey Chris McCarron had  another laugher with Annual Reunion in the $65,000 Allez France Handicap.  </P> <P> Annual Reunion made 4-5 look like an overlay with a five-length victory in the  1 1/16-mile turf race, easily dispatching Mahaska and six other 3-year-old  fillies.  </P> <P> The Cresta Rider filly was confidently ridden by McCarron, and the only  question remaining to be answered at the top of the stretch was by how many  lengths she was going to win.  </P> <P> This was the first victory on turf for Annual Reunion, but she had run very  well over this course last summer. In her first start on the grass, she was  beaten by a head by Materco in the Honeymoon Handicap.  </P> <P> "She's kind of a frail little thing, and she came up to today's race real  fresh. And she's always run well fresh," Jones said. "She loves this course,  and we'll probably run her back in the Dahlia (on Nov. 17). We'll take a look  at it and see."  </P> <P> Riding Annual Reunion for the first time since early in her 16-race career,  McCarron noticed a big difference.  </P> <P> "She's matured a lot," he said. "She was green back when I rode her. I've never  ridden her on the turf before, and she used to climb when the dirt hit her in  the face.  </P> <P> "This grass course is in great shape. It's nice and green for this time of  year. It's got a lot of bounce, and I feel very comfortable on it. This filly  obviously loves it. (Around the turn,) I was confident. I had one filly  (Mahaska) in front of me, and I didn't know whether she'd be able to carry her  speed or not. I had a lot of horse sitting behind her, and I was able to go  ahead and get by her."  </P> <P> Making her first start on turf, Mahaska finished three lengths ahead of 14-1  shot Vaguely Charming. Then came Daughter of Wolf, She's a V.P., Classic Ice,  Invitation Waltz (the 7-2 second choice who broke very slowly) and Ali's Song.  </P> <P> Jose Santos didn't take long to make himself at home in California.  </P> <P> On his first day after moving from New York, the Eclipse Award-winning jockey  won with his first mount, riding Paula Revere to a $16.20 upset in Wednesday's  fourth race.  </P> <P> Julio Garcia was originally named on the 2-year-old Caveat filly, but he began  a five-day suspension Wednesday for being disqualified aboard Stylish Stud in  last Saturday's $300,000 California Cup Classic. So Santos was named by trainer  John Sadler.  </P> <P> "It's nice to start off on the right foot," Santos said. "I won with my first  horse here and I won the last race I rode in New York -- Sports View in last  Sunday's Discovery Handicap at Aqueduct.  </P> <P> "People have been helping me and everybody wants to give me business. Things  have started out real good, and it seems like people really respect me here."  </P> <P> A fourth place aboard Daughter of Wolf in the Allez France Handicap was the  best Santos could manage with his other three mounts.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> The stewards still haven't heard from jockey Pat Valenzuela, who called in sick  Saturday at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting and later refused to take a drug  test. If Valenzuela doesn't meet with stewards Pete Pedersen, Tom Ward and  David Samuel before Monday, he will be suspended. . . . Annual Reunion's final  time was 1:41 1/5 and her fourth victory was worth $38,000 to owner John Mabee.  . . . There's a Pick Six carryover of $48,481.47 for today.  </P> <P> Itsallgreektome, Septieme Ciel and Silver Ending are among the probable  starters in Sunday's $200,000 Hollywood Derby at 1 1/8 miles on the turf.  Itsallgreektome was second in the Breeders' Cup Mile; Septieme Ciel is a  multiple-stakes winner from France, who was a Breeders' Cup Mile also-eligible;  and Silver Ending won the Pegasus on Sept. 21 at the Meadowlands. Belmont  winner Go and Go is a possible entrant.  </P> <P> High Hook continued his love affair with Hollywood Park when he won the seventh  race. The 8-year-old gelding, who had three victories at Hollywood during the  summer meeting, has won nine of his 19 starts at the track. He completed a  double for the jockey-trainer combination of Alex Solis and Bill Spawr. Their  other victory was with Truly Naughty in the third race. Solis, who also won the  sixth on Van Beethovan, was celebrating the ninth anniversary of his first  victory as a jockey.  </P></p>

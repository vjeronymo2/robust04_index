			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Bank tells Lamont to do better 'MUST do better]' is the clear message of the Bank of England's first quarterly report on the government's efforts to meet its target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent for underlying inflation during the life of this parliament. The Bank believes that the government can meet its target for annual growth in the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments. The target was announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, last October. It says: 'The balance of probabilities is that inflation will be slightly lower in 1994 than it was at the end of 1992,' when underlying inflation was rising at an annual 3.7 per cent. Its central forecast is for this inflation measure to stay in a 3 per cent to 4 per cent range over the next two years with policies staying broadly unchanged. But the emphasis placed in the 45-page report on the up-side risks to the forecast gives added weight to the recent messages from Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor-designate, and Mr Lamont that there is very little scope for a further easing of monetary policy through lower interest rates. The Bank says the consistent message from a wide range of indices is that inflation has fallen sharply over the past two years. It expects underlying inflation will be about 3.5 per cent this month and in March. But for the purposes of monetary policy, the Bank must look at the inflation outlook two years into the future. The Bank believes that the authorities should pay close attention to the value of the pound. The main risks to underlying inflation bursting through the 4 per cent top of its target range come from 'the possibility of a sustained further depreciation of sterling' and a faster pass-through to prices of the depreciation that has taken place since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16. The Bank is also worried that the UK's high fiscal deficits (forecast by the government at Pounds 37bn in 1992-93 and expected to rise further) might create expectations of higher inflation in the future. The changing structure of anticipated interest rates since September, (illustrated by higher interest rates at the long end of the maturity range) also points to a rise in expected inflation while private sector forecasts of inflation in 1993 and 1994 suggest that the target range lacks credibility. Underlying inflation, the report says, should be nearer 1 per cent than the 4 per cent end of the target range at this stage of the business cycle. January's 3.2 per cent annual inflation rate ex-mortgage interest payments 'demonstrates that there is still some way to go before the underlying inflation rate is consistent with the objective of price stability.' The report says the easing of monetary policy since September through the depreciation of sterling and the cuts in bank base rates to 6 per cent from 10 per cent is consistent with the prospect of a slight reduction in inflation in the next two years, although the progress in reducing inflation will be slower than before September. Cost pressures from sterling's depreciation have become apparent in the past few months. The ability of the economy to absorb the increase in prices that was caused by sterling's 15 per cent devaluation since September will depend crucially on wage developments. Here some changes are needed. 'Expectations in financial markets, and of wage earners and firms, have some way to adjust, and a change of expectations is required,' the Bank says. Wage increases, although sharply lower over the past two years, will have to fall further if the UK is to keep within its inflation target while avoiding further sharp increases in the numbers of unemployed. The Bank warns that rising unemployment and a growing gap between output and potential output in the UK economy will cause nominal wage increases to decline further and profit margins to remain subdued. It says that the consistent pursuit of a counter-inflationary monetary policy will ensure that expectations do adjust and that price stability is attained. But its report concludes with a clear warning: 'Steady progress has been made towards achievement of the government's inflation objective but further progress is required.'

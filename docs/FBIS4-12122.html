			<p>BFN     [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Hayim Ramon is expected to  announce on 10 April whether he will run on an independent list  in the Histadrut elections. Our correspondent reports that Mr.  Ramon invited Likud MK Me'ir Shitrit to fill the second slot on  his list. MAPAM [United Workers Party] has agreed to join  Ramon's list, while Meretz is yet to decide its stand.    MK Me'ir Shetrit said he was still undecided whether to make  the move. The Likud candidate for Histadrut chief, MK Ya'aqov  Shamay, said Hayim Ramon's announcements might be designed to  pressure Yitzhaq Rabin to reinstate him as cabinet minister.    Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said it would be tragedy  for the Labor Party if Hayim Ramon left it to run independently  for the position of Histadrut chief. He believed the public  health issues over which Ramon had waged a struggle are valid,  but the thinking that these issues could be solved outside the  party was erroneous. Yosi Beilin leveled criticism at senior  Labor officials for showing Ramon the way out, as he put it. I  would do everything possible to prevent his secession from the  party, the deputy foreign minister told our correspondent this  morning.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Whitbread cuts stake in Brakspear WHITBREAD, the brewing and retailing group, has reduced its holding in Brakspear, the Henley-based brewer, from 27 per cent to 8.8 per cent. As a result, Whitbread will avoid provisions of the government's beer orders that would have forced it to free another 60 of its tied pubs. The orders require brewers owning more than 2,000 pubs to untie half of the excess. But any large brewery group with a stake of 15 per cent or more in another brewer must include that brewer's pubs in its total estate. Whitbread has avoided the addition of Brakspear's pubs to its total by selling 12.36 per cent of its original stake to the Whitbread Investment Company (WIC), and nearly 6 per cent to Brakspear. The group declined to give any financial details of the transactions. WIC's 31.4 per cent holding in Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, 21.9 per cent of Boddington, and 15.3 per cent stake in Devenish, have also to be reduced before November. Scottish &amp; Newcastle has arranged a reciprocal trading deal with Marston covering key brands. Marston will offer McEwan's lager, McEwan's Export and Beck's beer in some of its pubs and to its free trade customers; S&amp;N will distribute Marston's Pedigree bitter in Scotland and north-east England.</p>

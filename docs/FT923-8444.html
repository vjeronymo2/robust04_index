			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Arts: Rossini rarities in Siena THE Settimana musicale senese, the small-scale festival presented by the Accademia Chigiana in Siena, has just concluded its 49th edition. In its long history, it has been responsible for countless memorable and significant events. In its early, pre-World War II years, the Chigiana played a crucial role in the Vivaldi revival; in the post-war period it has set trends with performances of other long-neglected composers or works; and more recently, it has sponsored world premieres of living composers and has offered gifted young artists a chance to display their talents. This year's Settimana concentrated, understandably, on the bicentenarian Rossini. Over the years the Accademia has made valuable contributions to the deeper understanding of this composer, too: its Ermione, for example, in 1977, antedated by some years the grander production at the festival of Pesaro. In 1976, the festival gave a concert performance of Rossini's then unpublished and virtually unknown incidental music for Oedipus at Colonus, 14 mostly brief pieces composed around 1815 in Bologna on a commission from a presumably well-off hydraulic engineer named Giambattista Giusti, who was also an amateur translator and poet. In 1817 he had his Italian version of the Sophocles tragedy published by the great Parma printer Bodoni. Giusti apparently hoped that his work would be staged, but Rossini seems not to have shared his optimism, and when the impatient translator - who had imprudently paid the composer in advance - insisted on having the music, Rossini handed him the manuscript pages, some of them not completely orchestrated. For many years, the music was presumed lost, then the autograph surfaced in the early 1970's (it is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York), and a critical edition was subsequently published by the Rossini Foundation in Pesaro. The musical numbers are for chorus and/or basso, and have all the charm and power of the finest Rossini. Their efficacy is all the more surprising in that Italy had no real tradition of musique de scene; and Rossini's numbers for Oedipus are unique in the 19th century repertory. The beauty of the music, however, is not matched by any similar attractiveness in the Italian text. Giusti was not much of a poet, and his stilted, predictable verses sound like a poor libretto without accompaniment. The decision of Luciano Alberti, artistic director of the Chigiana, to stage the play seems unwise, for in the end it was the music that suffered. A respected scholar, Alberti as director was unable to impose any coherent style on his actors; they were all terrible, but in different ways. Only the Coro di Toscana, prepared by Roberto Gabbiani (who also conducted the performance, with the Symphony Orchestra of Sofia), made a positive, sensitive contribution - they also acted well, despite the troublesome set, which consisted chiefly of a steep flight of steps. More successful was the Chigiana week's closing event: a concert performance of an 1826 Rossini pastiche entitled Ivanho. This consists of a French text devised in Paris by the librettists Emile Deschamps and Gabriel-Gustave de Wailly from the Scott novel and music by the Italian musician and publisher Antonio Pacini, long a Paris resident. There is some evidence that Rossini himself contributed to the organisation of the music, which consists of numbers from perhaps a dozen of his operas, not all of them familiar or readily available in France at that time. The pastiche had its premiere at the Odeon in September 15 1826, with enviable success. Within the decade that followed, it was given in many foreign countries, reaching London on March 7 1829 as The Maid of Judah, or The Knights Templar. After all, why shouldn't it be a success? The music is all first-rate Rossini, and the libretto is based on a popular, dramatic story, even though the French authors cut it mercilessly and simplified the plot (Rowena and Rebecca are fused into a single character, the - Moslem] - Lila). It requires a better orchestra than the musicians from Sofia who gave it, and a more committed conductor than the slack Peter Maag. It does not require superstar singers, but they should be able to sing in tune, and the three basses were a severe handicap. Fortunately, the tenor Craig Estep, in the title role, gave a more than adequate idea of the music (some of his high notes were, however, ill-advised, pinched and unpleasing to hear). Tiziana Fabbricini - the Violetta of the Muti Traviata at La Scala a few seasons back - occasionally sounded strained, but she sang with confidence and style. The real winner of the evening was the California baritone LeRoy Villanueva, who offered a warm lyric sound, handled with sensitivity, enough to gain applause even for the villain Brian de Boisguilbert. Any criticism of these performances or these performers must be tempered by some mention of the Tuscan weather and, especially, of the intolerable heat inside the Teatro dei Rinnovati. Male members of the opening and closing night audience, who bravely wore jackets and ties were subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, but even removal of jacket and loosening of collar brought little relief. In the old days, the Chigiana used to hold its festival in the more appropriate month of September. If they will insist on mid-summer, they must seriously - and promptly - consider air-conditioning.</p>

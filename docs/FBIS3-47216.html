			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japan is to focus its  fiscal 1994 tax reforms on unfair levy systems in a bid to win  public support on a consumption tax hike, government sources  said Tuesday [11 January].    The government will consider such reforms as lowering the  tax  exemption ceiling for corporate entertainment expenses, raising  levy rates on profit-making operations at nonprofit  organizations and gradually abolishing the special treatment of  medical institutions and seven designated businesses such as  mass communications, the sources said.    They said an adoption of punitive heavy taxes is also on the  discussion table for unexplained corporate expenditures that are  widely suspected of being used in dubious political donations  and bribes.    The move is apparently intended to pave the way for raising  the consumption tax rate, currently at 3 percent, in line with  hearings at six major cities conducted by the Tax Commission, an  advisory panel to the prime minister, in November.    Panel members had said the majority opinions at the hearings  were for rectifying unfair tax systems before the tax hike.    The hearings were to gather regional opinions on the panel's  tax reform report that calls for an income tax cut and a  consumption tax hike in a single program.    A Finance Ministry official said, "a huge increase in tax  revenues can't be expected" with the reforms on unfair tax  systems.    The ministry is strongly insisting that an income tax cut  must be financed by a consumption tax hike, thus conflicting  with socialists and some other parties within the ruling  coalition that are against the tax hike.    This dispute is preventing discussions on including the  income tax breaks in the government's fresh economic stimulus  package to be launched around January 20.    Meanwhile, the tax panel will resume its talks on fiscal  1994  tax reform on Friday, apparently with settlements looking set  for Diet deliberations on political reforms -- Hosokawa's top  policy priority.    The panel suspended its meetings in mid-December to watch  the  development in political reforms.    On the entertainment expenses, the government wants to lower  the exemption amount to check those companies evading corporate  taxes through huge write-offs of such expenses to artificially  fall into the red, the sources said.    Currently, entertainment expenses at companies capitalized  at  50 million yen and more are levied fully. But 4 million yen is  allowed for nontax write-offs as losses for companies  capitalized up to 10 million yen, and 3 million yen for  companies between 50 million and 10 million yen.    Some government leaders have been calling for the reform in  those expenses in or after fiscal 1995, to avoid undermining  corporate activities amid the current economic slump.    But the Finance Ministry has been strongly insisting on an  early overhaul.    The sources said the government intends to raise the special  levy rate, currently at 27 percent, on profit-making operations  at religious, educational and other nonprofit organizations by 1  percentage point to 28 percent, the same specially treated rate  on medium-size to small businesses.    Clarification of nontax and tax operations will also be  considered, the sources said. Currently, for example, donations  and charms are tax-exempt for religious organizations, but  postcards and parking tolls are subject to taxation.    A staged abolishment is planned for nontax treatments on  social security rewards to medical practitioners and lower-tax  treatments on mass communications, publications and five other  specially designated businesses.    Considering unexplained expenses, recently uncovered bribery  scandals underlined practices by Japanese companies using such  expenses in political maneuvering.    The government is eyeing a punitive heavy levy as one of the  options to stop such practices, but concerns exist over  companies taking it as an excuse to write off an unlimited  amount of unspecified expenses as long as they pay the heavy tax.    The sources said a final decision on the dubious expenses  will be left to the government and the ruling coalition parties  to decide.</p>

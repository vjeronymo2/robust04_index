			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Energy tax plan may change CONGRESSIONAL Democrats met yesterday to discuss their strategy for hammering out a compromise US budget bill, amid signs of a move towards a new variant on the proposed energy tax, which would raise money from both transportation fuels and utilities. The energy tax proposal, suggested by Mr Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the House of Representatives ways and means committee is Congress's principal tax writer, is being floated as a way out of the impasse between the two different levies passed by the House and the Senate. While the House kept the outlines of the energy tax originally proposed by President Bill Clinton, to be calculated at 26.8 cents per million British thermal units, the Senate adopted a much more modest proposal to tax petrol and diesel fuel at 4.3 cents per gallon. The Btu tax appears to be dead, but House representatives are expected to insist that its replacement raise something much closer to the Dollars 72bn (Pounds 48.6bn) they expected from it than to the Dollars 23bn the Senate fuel tax would raise. It is unclear at what rates the Rostenkowski tax would apply, but by adding electricity it would spread some of the burden of the transportation tax, which falls disproportionately on western states. One rival proposal would scrap energy taxes altogether but stiffen the increases already planned in company and upper income tax rates. The conference between House and Senate delegates to resolve the differences between their versions of the budget bill is expected to prove particularly difficult because of the narrow margins by which the original bills passed in each chamber. Mr Clinton cannot expect a single Republican vote in either chamber, but Democratic whips say he can count on little more than 200 of the 258 Democrats in the House, and perhaps no more than 40 of the 56 Democrats in the Senate. Every adjustment to the bill threatens to cost him support from either the right or the left: if spending is increased too much, he will lose conservatives, and if it is increased too little, he will lose liberals. One thing the House and the Senate had seemed to agree on was the overall target of reducing the US budget deficit from its current trend by Dollars 500bn over five years. Even this, however, has now been called into question, with Senator John Breaux of Louisiana suggesting a more modest deficit reduction goal of Dollars 400bn.</p>

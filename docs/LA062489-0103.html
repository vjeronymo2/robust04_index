			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITT ENDS A COUPLE OF STREAKS;  </P> <P> HIS SIX-HITTER STOPS ORIOLE VICTORIES AT 7, ANGEL LOSSES AT 4  </P> <P> Individually they are called starting pitchers, but collectively they are known  as a rotation, because with starting pitching, everything that goes around  usually comes around.  </P> <P> Examine the state of the Angels' rotation:  </P> <P> Kirk McCaskill, once 7-1 and owner of the major leagues' lowest earned-run  average, was knocked out of his last outing in the second inning. Jim Abbott,  the rookie who regularly pitches to standing ovations, barely lasted four  innings two nights ago. Chuck Finley, winner of seven of his first nine  decisions, has lost four in a row.  </P> <P> And Mike Witt? Remember when he was about one more home-run pitch away from  losing his spot in the rotation, way back around this time last week?  </P> <P> The same Mike Witt was on the mound for the final out at Anaheim Stadium Friday  night, shutting out the Baltimore Orioles for seven innings and ending a  four-game Angel losing streak and a seven-game Oriole winning streak with a 5-1  victory before a crowd of 45,452.  </P> <P> That's two wins in a row for Witt, who presently has the longest streak in the  Angel rotation. In just two starts, Witt has nearly doubled his victory total  -- going from 3-7 to 5-7 -- and lowered his earned-run average from 4.93 to  4.34.  </P> <P> He snapped out of a five-week winless funk last Sunday when he finagled his way  past the Detroit Tigers for seven innings en route to a rather uneventful 3-1  decision.  </P> <P> Friday's victory was eventful, all right. Witt threw a six-hitter, his first  complete game since May 13, and came within a bloop double of pitching his  first shutout of the season. He also made losers of the Orioles for the first  time in more than a week.  </P> <P> Through seven innings, Witt had allowed the Orioles five singles -- two of the  infield variety -- and let only one baserunner advance as far as third base. In  the eighth, he yielded a shallow fly ball to .247-hitting Rene Gonzales that  fell for a double when center fielder Devon White failed to make a diving  catch.  </P> <P> Gonzales moved to third base and scored on a pair of ground-outs, with Steve  Finley's bouncer to shortstop foiling Witt's shutout bid.  </P> <P> The moment was only a minor disappointment for Witt, who began the month  thankful whenever he pitched a shutout inning. In between his third and fourth  victories, from May 13 to June 18, Witt had gone 0-4 with a 7.14 ERA in five  starts.  </P> <P> With Witt, the straits had become so dire, Angel Manager Doug Rader actually  began broaching the topic of moving Witt, his opening-day starter, to the  bullpen for a week or so.  </P> <P> Standing at such a crossroads, Witt began examining last resorts and wound up  trying the once-unthinkable -- redesigning his once-redoubtable curveball, the  "Mercedes-Bends" of American League repute.  </P> <P> "He changed the grip on his curveball," Rader revealed. "Mike said he thought  he'd never have to do that."  </P> <P> But desperate times call for desperate measures, and on the Angels' last trip,  Witt experimented with the new grip, which entails a larger snapping motion.  </P> <P> "I'm basically exaggerating the wrist," Witt said. "I'm 'wrapping' my wrist,  like (Don) Sutton and (Rick) Sutcliffe did when they threw the curve. The way  the ball is coming out of my hand and how the batters are seeing it is the way  it used to be."  </P> <P> New technique, old results.  </P> <P> "The pitch has helped his confidence," Rader said. "There's been a big  difference in his approach the last couple of times out. With a higher  confidence level, you can be more aggressive with the way you pitch."  </P> <P> The Angels backed Witt with an eight-hit attack against Dave Schmidt (7-6),  including home runs by Claudell Washington and Jack Howell, but their most  interesting piece of work was their first run of the evening, brought to you in  its entirety by White.  </P> <P> With one out in the fourth inning, White bunted back to Schmidt and legged out  a hit. Then, White stole second. And third.  </P> <P> But he didn't stop there. Drawing a hurried throw from catcher Mickey  Tettleton, White also drew a mistake, with Tettleton's throw sailing down the  third-base line for an error that enabled White to break a scoreless tie  standing up.  </P> <P> The stolen bases were White's 24th and 25th. The run was his 42nd. And for  Tettleton, the error was his first in 98 games, ending an errorless streak of  219 chances, dating to last season.  </P> <P> The Angels' lead remained 1-0 until Washington's next at-bat. In the sixth  inning, Washington homered over the right-field fence, his ninth of the season,  a club high.  </P> <P> And in the seventh inning, the Angels scored three more runs, two on Howell's  seventh home run.  </P> <P> It's amazing what happens to losing streaks when hitters start hitting home  runs and pitchers start pitching six-hit complete games.  </P> <P> "Much to their credit, these guys didn't fold their tents," Rader said. "The  last three weeks could've been very discouraging, but these guys have stuck  together and worked it out."  </P> <P> And by sticking with Witt, the Angels gave their floundering No. 1 starter the  chance to work things out.  </P> <P> "Every team in the league knows I've been struggling," Witt said. "But, they  also know I have the capability to do what I did tonight."  </P> <P> And now, most importantly, the Angels know it, too.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Kirk McCaskill's rough Tuesday night outing (1 2/3 innings, seven hits, five  earned runs) was enough to make Angel Manager Doug Rader consider skipping the  pitcher's next turn. "When I said that, I was just thinking out loud," said  Rader, who has McCaskill scheduled to pitch Sunday's series finale against the  Orioles. "Lach (pitching coach Marcel Lachemann) has looked at tapes, and it's  a mechanical problem. According to Lach and Mac, it's certainly not only  correctable, but it has been corrected." Rader admitted that his original idea  was "a little radical. It's more drastic when you give time off to a starter.  Skip a start and it's 10 days. That's like giving a hitter in a slump 10 days  off. You'd only do it if there was something physically wrong or if a guy was  just getting creased and (couldn't) get the job done. But the regular amount of  time between starts is enough to heal a pitcher emotionally."  </P> <P> Last year, they put a punching bag in the runway leading to the Angel dugout in  order to stem the rash of bruised knuckles resulting from frustrated players  punching out concrete walls. Now, maybe, they should pad the runway ramp.  Johnny Ray's sprained toe, which kept him out of the starting lineup for the  second consecutive night, was incurred when he stubbed it walking back to the  clubhouse during Tuesday night's 14-inning loss to the Toronto Blue Jays.  According to Rader, Ray can still bat on the foot but is not yet ready to play  in the field.  </P></p>

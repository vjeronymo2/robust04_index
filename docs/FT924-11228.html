			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Skandia to halve global reinsurance operations SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurer, yesterday announced plans to halve its worldwide reinsurance operations. The move comes just days after the group rejected a Dollars 500m offer for its North American reinsurance unit, Skandia America Corp (SAC). It means that the company's total net reinsurance premiums will fall to SKr3.5bn (Dollars 653m) next year from SKr7bn, while its solvency margin will rise by 15 percentage points to 84 per cent. The group operates the world's 10th-largest reinsurance business. The emphasis will be on reducing Skandia's exposure to non-life reinsurance both in Europe and North America. Life reinsurance premiums are expected to hold steady at SKr2bn a year. In the US, Skandia America will focus primarily on casualty business, treaty and facultative (usually single large risks). Meanwhile, the Stockholm-based operations within Skandia International will concentrate on life business and facultative as well as non-proportional non-life business. Mr Bjorn Wolrath, president and chief executive, said: 'This decision is an important step in order to secure that Skandia International and Skandia America stay as long-term reinsurers.' Last week, Skandia rejected an offer worth Dollars 20 per share for SAC on the grounds that it was too low. This was after it had abandoned plans to sell a majority stake in the unit via a public offering and private placement - because the price was inadequate. Analysts believe the group will gradually run off its entire reinsurance portfolio and are surprised it has opted to scale back its operations rather than go for an outright sale. However, Mrs Maria-Louise Wenander, Skandia's chief operating officer for reinsurance (Europe and Overseas) said: 'This is not a run-off. It is a change of strategy designed to focus the group on more specialised areas.' The reduction in the group's reinsurance exposure will largely be achieved through an effort to increase prices in the impending renewals season, which will inevitably lead some clients to defect. ESAB, the world's leading welding equipment producer, increased profits to SKr81m (Dollars 15.1m) in the first nine months from SKr18m a year earlier. The group said it benefited from higher sales in Brazil and tighter cost control for its standard welding products in Europe. Sales edged 1 per cent higher to SKr4.84bn, although, for comparable units, the figure dropped 7 per cent. The order book rose by 6 per cent to SKr4.88bn. The group expected its full-year profit to be higher than last year's SKr9m surplus, even though it remained generally gloomy about market conditions. 'During 1992 demand for welding products has sunk in practically all markets in Europe, including the previously strong central European market. Demand in the US has improved only slightly compared with 1991,' the company said. Lex, Page 24</p>

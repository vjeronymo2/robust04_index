While calling  for the prime minister's understanding of and support for the  early enactment of a law on special measures for use of military  bases after their return, which is still pending, Governor Ota  appealed for settling issues regarding the U.S. military bases  in Okinawa. In response, Prime Minister Hosokawa mentioned such  facts as details of his recent meetings with former U.S. Defense  Secretary Les Aspin and U.S. Forces Pacific Commander-in-Chief  Larson, and said: "I have a good understanding of the present  situation in Okinawa. I have talked over the issues (on the  U.S. military bases) with the U.S. ambassador to Japan and the  commander-in-chief of the U.S. Forces on every possible  occasion." In this way, he stressed his positive approach  toward the military base issues. Meanwhile, Kosuke Uehara,  director general of the Okinawa Development Agency, who  accompanied Governor Ota, called on Hosokawa "to bring up the  Okinawa issue for discussion during his visit to the United  States." In response, Hosokawa said: "Yes. I understand."  Thus, he hinted that the Okinawa issue may be brought as one of  the topics for discussions at the summit with U.S. President  Bill Clinton. This was the first face-to-face talks between  Governor Ota and Prime Minister Hosokawa.    In addition to the issue on legislation of a law on special  measures for use of military bases after their return, Governor  Ota asked Prime Minister Hosokawa for his support in settling  three other major issues that have to be solved urgently. They  are: the return of Naha Naval Port; abolition of live-fire  exercises conducted across Prefectural Highway 104; and the  return of the Yomitan auxiliary airfield and abolition of  parachuting exercises conducted at this airfield. Moreover,  concerning the handling of misfired shells, Ota asked Hosokawa  to understand that this issue has to be settled too, and said:  "There are misfired shells left over from the battle on  Okinawa, and also misfired shells from the live-fire exercises  conducted by U.S. Forces. However, we are concerned with the  danger involved in the disposal of misfired shells at the  exercise sites."    Prime Minister Hosokawa stated his profound understanding of  the base-connected issues, and said: "I understand the present  situation in Okinawa very well, and I also understand that  Okinawa residents were forced to suffer many problems during and  after the last war. I would like to make the situation in  Okinawa (concerning the Okinawa-related issues) turn for the  better." Moreover, in response to the request made by Director  General Uehara, who stated that "the prime minister would  certainly have a hard time in dealing with many problems" but  asked that "the Okinawa issue be brought up during his visit to  the United States," Prime Minister Hosokawa promised he would do  his best, saying, "I understand your points quite well."    In addition to Director General Uehara, Noboru Shimajiri,  head of the Okinawa General Chapter of the Japan New Party,  attended the meeting. As viewed from his standpoint as part of  the ruling coalition, Shimajiri urged the prime minister to  understand the Okinawa-related issues and support their  settlement. They met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura at 1020 and made the same requests.    As part of its mission to appeal for settlement of  base-related issues and the legislation of the law on special  measures on the use of military land after their return, the  governor's party plans to call at the concerned ministries and  agencies, including the Defense Agency, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, and the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, as  well as concerned Diet members in the afternoon.</p>

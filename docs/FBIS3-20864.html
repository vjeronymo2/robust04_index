			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marko Barisic: "What Is the Price of </F> Confederation?"]    [Text] Although it is already a week since the signing of  the Washington agreement, there is still confusion in the  Croatian public about the possible establishment of a  Croatian-Bosnian federation and then its confederation with the  Republic of Croatia. When we add to that that groups of experts  have already begun to work in Vienna and by 15 March were  supposed to work out the remaining details as to the  interpretation of the various articles, and delineate the  borders of the cantons in the federation, one gets the  impression that the public, the political parties, and  professionals are quite surprised by the speed at which the  United States, which authored the idea of this political  breakthrough, has been leading the entire project toward its  conclusion. One consequence of that confusion and the speed with  which events have been taking place, and there is good reason to  refer to them as fateful, and of the lack of complete  information about essential details of such agreements, is that  a vacuum has been formed in the Croatian Republic concerning the  real scope of these intragovernmental and intergovernmental  agreements. Various interpreters, depending on their past  political position, have been expressing satisfaction at the  indications of a Croatian-Muslim alliance, or on the other hand  outright fear that the Croats, again in the kitchen of Western  policy, just as in 1918, will be tricked into a forced alliance  first with the Muslims and perhaps also with the Serbs. Is  Croatian Foreign Minister Granic, who was the first to sign the  Washington agreement, thereafter to call upon the Bosnian Serbs  from Paris to join him (which horrified the public), an  experienced diplomat who knows the consequences of what he does,  or on the other hand is he a synonym of the policy suggested by  the phrase "a goose in the fog"?    That is why we need to see what has been signed. The Croats  in Bosnia- Herzegovina, according to the preliminary agreement,  have entered the Federal Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a  sovereign people. This is a normal state with a federal system  (the federal units are cantons) and with a strong central power.  All the essential powers come under the jurisdiction of that  government, which will be in Sarajevo: foreign affairs, national  defense (joint supreme command), economic policy, finance (a  single currency), and energy. The central government and the  cantons will join together in controlling human rights, health  care, building roads and communications, citizenship, tourism,  and, and this is very essential, immigration policy. The cantons  will have jurisdiction over the police (which will have cantonal  insignia), upbringing and education, culture, and housing  policy. Housing policy is very important, because, for example,  under this agreement the central government in Sarajevo cannot  build several buildings in Neum without a permit from the canton  government, nor can persons from other cantons acquire the right  to move into Neum (or other places) without consent of the  canton government. Those regulations are very essential because  of the Croatian fear that under the cover of the federation  there will be a change in the ethnic composition of the cantons,  that is, that the Muslims, because of their greater numbers and  faster population growth, will move into the Croatian cantons  and thus alter the ethnic composition, and the consequence,  according to Radovan Pavic, would be to turn the federation into  Muslimania. According to chairman Zubak of the presidential  council of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna (whose bodies  will function in the transitional period until the agreement is  implemented), there will be three cantons with a predominant  Croatian majority: Herzegovina, the Sava Valley, and central  Bosnia (where the Muslims will also have their canton). The  central government, which, as we have seen, will have large  powers, will be set up on a parity basis; the Croats will have  at least one-third of the ministers in the government, and if  the prime minister is a Muslim, his deputy is a Croat and vice  versa.  <H5>  Fear of the Bottomless Hole </H5>   The legislative body (parliament) would consist of two  houses: the Chamber of Nationalities (the same number from each  nationality) and the House of Representatives (on a proportional  basis). The president of that federation would be a Muslim one  year and a Croat the next, but the office of president would not  have broad powers. That state, the federation, and this is part  of the same arrangement, would enter into a confederal alliance  with the Republic of Croatia.    To what extent will the federation of Croats and Muslims,  devastated by war, with an economy that differs utterly from the  Croatian economy, rich only in timber and a poor kind of ore, be  a burden on Croatia? Croatia, that is, has bad experience with  the constant financing of the underdeveloped republics of  Yugoslavia, which were usually a bottomless hole. So, will this  be a repetition of history that would affect the economic  stability of the Croatian state, or are other relations  involved? The provisions of the confederal agreement, under  which a customs and monetary union and defense agreement would  be established between the two states, which "would not change  their international identity or legal individuality by  establishing the confederation," are the occasion for such fears.    Lawyers say that they will always be two states, economists  are more skeptical in this regard and say that a customs union  and monetary union envisage a single market, that is, an entire  space in which people will move and trade without restriction.  If a customs union is established, then that means that on the  border between Croatia and the federation there will be no  customhouses, but only police control. And a monetary union does  not mean that one currency will be in use on the territory of  the confederation: Economists cite the example of the European  Union, in which for the present each state has its own currency,  although they have entered into a monetary union, and the ECU  [European Currency Unit] is only an accounting unit. And then  the military alliance, as stated in the confederal treaty,  includes "coordination of defense policies and establishment of  joint supreme commands in case of war or immediate danger of war  for any party." To be realistic, that type of cooperation  (military) could take effect immediately, because both sides are  threatened by Serbian aggression. Does this mean that the  Croatian Army should go to war in eastern Bosnia if the Muslims  want to get back territory from which the Serbs have ethnically  expelled them, or would the army of the federation (it is not  clear as yet how it will be organized) or a part of it, the Army  of Bosnia and Herzegovina, go to liberate Knin or Vukovar if  Croatia invited it on the basis of the confederal treaty?  <H5>  Who Will Repay the Debts? </H5>   The most unclear part of the treaty relates to economic  cooperation. Although they will remain in formal terms two  states with independent governments and legislation, the treaty  also contains a provision that "Croatia and the federation will  adopt internal regulations as soon as possible and conclude  accords necessary to establish" a customs union and monetary  union. Which nevertheless means that those internal regulations  would not be altogether independent, but would have to be  "reconciled." Would it not be a consequence of that  reconciliation that Croatia would nevertheless be deprived of a  part of its sovereignty, especially when we bear in mind that  the entire "Washington arrangement" was nevertheless imposed on  it? Will the federation repay its debts alone, or will this be  done together with Croatia? Croatia furnished Yugoslavia,  through tourism and an economy to some extent oriented toward  export, 80 percent of the inflow of foreign exchange (which is  why financial institutions in the world were against the  separation of Croatia from Yugoslavia). Will this same procedure  be repeated on behalf of the foreign exchange liquidity of the  federation, which will have a hard time earning foreign exchange  in view of the fact that its industry is old and mainly military  in nature? economists wonder. Unless Croatia aids reconstruction  and development of the federation, an economic gap will be  created between the two states: This could result in a quite  considerable emigration of Croats from the federation (following  trends which existed even in the past), and the consequence of  that in turn could be the disappearance of Croats from Bosnia  and Herzegovina, the demographers warn. This kind of Washington  agreement is being interpreted as an American (but also  Croatian) gift of Herceg-Bosna to the Muslims. Opponents of this  kind of thinking point their finger at the powers of the canton  governments, which have the right to regulate moves from one  canton to another and to oversee housing policy. The ethnic  composition of the population on that territory would mainly be  altered from what it was in the former federation. They say that  Croatia would get a new market for its products, that it would  also get manpower which it lacks, and as the stronger and more  highly developed it would impose its interests through the  economic flows of the federation, not the other way about, even  if the same currency is used over the entire space of the  confederation.  <H5>  Promises and Guarantees </H5>   Then they add the international aspect of the entire  Washington package. Croatia, according to them, extricated  itself from a very difficult situation at the last moment. It  was threatened by sanctions, it was isolated from European  financial and political associates. It had no true ally that  would support it concerning recovery of the occupied  territories. And in Bosnia and Herzegovina it could not come out  the victor in an exhaustive war with the Muslims. Now the  situation has changed altogether, they say, an intergovernmental  alliance has been created against the main enemy--Milosevic and  his satellites. The offers of membership in the European Union  and NATO through the Partnership for Peace are the guarantee of  success. Yes, they are told by opponents, but those are all  promises, where are the guarantees that the Croatian-Muslim  federation will embrace more than the present 30 percent of  territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who says that the United  States will not force Croatia in the same way to conclude a  federation with Krajina, what if the Bosnian Serbs, who will  make a confederation with Serbia, also decide to join the  federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina? Is that not Yugoslavia all  over again?    Those are not the only quandaries and murky areas associated  with this federal-confederal tale. There are also analyses of  the distribution of spheres of interest of the great powers  associated with it. It remains to be seen how long and in what  fashion this governmental marriage of Croats and Muslims will  last and what the consequences will be. Still, one thing is  certain. It was imposed by the United States, so that it has a  flavor of punishment for both sides. The Muslims wanted their  own state with an outlet to the Sava and to the sea. The Croats  wanted Banovina, their own state in which after a long time they  would live without an alliance with other nationalities. On this  occasion, this was not made possible either for the Muslims,  because of the danger of radical Islam, or for the Croats,  presumably because of their historical habit of always having  trouble with certain multinational communities, defending  Christianity, or drawing someone into Europe. It does not sound  very optimistic to speak of the confederation as a punishment.  Once again, just as in 1918, the Americans have created a fog,  for the moment it is unclear who will get the role of the  "goose."</p>

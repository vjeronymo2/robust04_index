			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 3 (CTK) -- The new minister should  avoid partial and political pressures, and not give in to them,  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said at today's official  inauguration of new Education Minister Ivan Pilip. The new  minister should perceive the problems of such an important  ministry as a whole, Klaus added.    Pilip, 30, was appointed to the post on May 2, replacing  Petr  Pitha who resigned on April 27 for health reasons. Both of them  are members of the coalition Christian Democratic Party (KDS, 10  deputies in the 200-member Czech Parliament). Pilip has been  the party's chairman since December 1993.    The problems of education should be taken into account in  the  drafting of a law on powers of higher administrative units,  Klaus said. The relevant document, which will devolve powers in  the educational area from the center to the regions, will be  compiled by the end of May, he reported. During the ceremony, a  letter from Pitha sharing his experience with the ministerial  work was read.</p>

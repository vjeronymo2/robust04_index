			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIALING FOR DOLLARS;  </P> <P> DEREGULATED PAY PHONES SPAWN CONSUMER GRIPES, PROMISE NEW SERVICES  </P> <P> Airline pilot Bill Conrey routinely stays at hotels along his flight path,  regularly phoning home to Tennessee and charging the calls on his AT&amp;T  "Calling Card." He considers such expenses unavoidable in his line of work, and  normally is a good judge of what hotel calls cost.  </P> <P> So Conrey was stunned when he spotted a $50 charge on his phone bill for a call  from Washington that he had expected to cost about $25. Moreover, the charge  wasn't from AT&amp;T, but from a long-distance company he'd never heard of.  </P> <P> When Conrey investigated, he learned that the hotel had changed management, and  the new team had cut a deal with another long-distance carrier that offered to  pay more to handle the hotel's phone service.  </P> <P> "It's not like a legitimate long-distance company," Conrey complained. "They're  just providing a service where they can bill you twice as much as AT&amp;T!"  </P> <P> Conrey is not the only telephone customer outraged by unexpectedly high bills  for calls made from hotel rooms or from coin-operated phones. Deregulation of  the pay-phone business, a byproduct of the 1984 breakup of American Telephone  &amp; Telegraph, has brought forth a legion of new pay-phone entrepreneurs,  looser governmental oversight -- and a flood of consumer complaints.  </P> <P> The nature of the complaints has changed somewhat over the five years since  private investors -- not just AT&amp;T and local phone companies -- were  allowed to buy, install and operate pay phones and to handle phone service in  hotels, motels and hospitals. Poor service and simple mechanical breakdowns on  private pay phones remain problems, but these are diminishing as technology  improves. Meanwhile, regulatory reform has reduced complaints in some parts of  the country, including California, about high charges from little-known phone  companies on calls from private pay phones at shopping centers, restaurants,  bars and other high-traffic sites.  </P> <P> But room-phone service remains exempt from regulation and continues to draw  heavy fire from consumers. "They are totally unregulated," said John O'Keefe,  president of the California Payphone Assn. and a former Pacific Bell executive.  "The burden is really on the consumer."  </P> <P> Not everyone is suffering under pay-phone deregulation.  </P> <P> Innkeepers, restaurateurs and convenience-store operators are benefiting from  the commissions they receive for allowing private pay phones to be installed on  their premises. New enterprises, as well as vending firms that have added pay  phones to their other coin-operated machines, maintain the phones and share the  revenue with the property owners.  </P> <P> And the pay-phone business is getting even better these days, thanks to  so-called alternative operator services -- new companies that provide  credit-card and collect-call service for pay-phone owners and long-distance  carriers that have no operators of their own. These operator-assisted calls  produce hefty revenues that once eluded owners of private pay phones.  Previously, their customers could dial an AT&amp;T or local operator for  nothing and charge their calls, providing revenue for the operator's company  but nothing at all for the phone's owner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Price Gouging  </P> <P> It's another story, however, for consumers such as Gayla Daugherty, who sells  insurance in Oklahoma City. Daugherty said she placed an early-morning call  home from a hotel room in Las Vegas and, like Conrey, used her AT&amp;T Calling  Card. Only later did she learn that the operator who handled her call was not  an AT&amp;T employee, as she had assumed, but worked for an alternative  operator service allied with another long-distance carrier. As a result, her  call was billed at more than $1 a minute at an hour of the day when AT&amp;T  would have charged about half that.  </P> <P> "I was livid," she said.  </P> <P> The lodging industry insists that price gouging on room phones is the  exception, not the rule -- certainly among those hotels catering to repeat  customers, particularly business travelers and affluent vacationers. Michele  Kelley, spokeswoman for the American Hotel-Motel Assn., said innkeepers also  have a right to recover the cost of their investment in telecommunications  equipment, especially in view of demands by guests for such new services as  electronic checkout.  </P> <P> Still, unexpectedly high tolls charged by unfamiliar companies are only part of  what galled Daugherty and Conrey. How was it possible, they wondered, that  another carrier could take their business when they had charged their calls --  or thought they had -- to AT&amp;T?  </P> <P> The answer goes back once again to the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.  </P> <P> Before AT&amp;T and its local phone companies were forced to go their separate  ways, it was the subsidiaries, the so-called Baby Bells, that issued telephone  charge cards. Their customers could use these to make local and long-distance  calls while away from home. When AT&amp;T and the locals parted company,  however, AT&amp;T had to develop its own card and, in doing so, used subscriber  data maintained by the Baby Bells.  </P> <P> But the Baby Bells also were required to make the same information available to  other carriers and operator-service firms. Consequently, the newcomers were  able to use AT&amp;T's Calling Card data to bill for their own calls, and  customers often learned the difference only after their local phone bills  arrived, listing their away-from-home calls.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Horror Stories  </P> <P> Now, to meet complaints by its customers, AT&amp;T plans to issue cards with  new codings that can't be used by other companies.  </P> <P> The alternative operator services have created consumer confusion and generated  complaints almost since they first appeared in 1985. Since then, the Federal  Communications Commission has received more than 2,000 complaints regarding  them.  </P> <P> Although industry executives acknowledge some horror stories, such as those  related by Conrey and Daugherty, they insist that most were the unintended  consequences of introducing competition in a former monopoly area and that, in  any case, the worst is over. Moreover, they promise that the payoff for  consumers, in the form of such new pay-phone services as voice-messaging, is  less than a year away, thanks to development of new software and other  technology designed to increase the private phones' versatility. Such services,  they say, would never have come about were the old Bell System monopoly still  in place.  </P> <P> "We pay a price for freedom and innovation," said Paul Gamberg, founder and  president of Operator Service Providers of America, a year-old trade group.  "The litany of horror stories is part of that price."  </P> <P> Many of those bad experiences, Gamberg said, stemmed from converting a complex  network originally built to serve a single entity, into one able to serve many  companies offering a variety of services at different prices. "We are doing our  best to clean up our industry, but we all have to funnel through the bottleneck  that is the old Bell System."  </P> <P> Gamberg's view is supported by consumer advocate Ken McEldowney of San  Francisco-based Consumer Action and past president of the Consumer Federation  of America. "It's a system that was not set up for competition," McEldowney  agreed. "It's not just bad guys."  </P> <P> Even before the emergence of hotel billing problems, the appearance of  privately owned coin phones brought "incredible price gouging," acknowledged  O'Keefe of the California Payphone Assn. But that, he insisted, "has really  settled down." For one thing, O'Keefe said, some of the worst offenders,  particularly active in Florida and North Carolina, are no longer in business.  And the survivors are setting their own service standards to avoid future  complaints.  </P> <P> But if the worst is past, problems continue for captive consumers, as trucker  Kevin Krofchik can testify.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Reforms  </P> <P> Krofchik drives a tractor-trailer from his home in the Washington suburbs, and  he uses whatever pay phones he can find at truck stops along his route. Like  many a hotel guest, he charges the calls to his AT&amp;T Calling Card. But last  February, Krofchik's phone bill showed calls handled by a company called  International Telecharge Inc., or ITI, that totaled $36.12. That's 2 1/2 times  the cost, he calculated in a complaint filed with the Federal Communications  Commission, of the same long-distance calls over AT&amp;T.  </P> <P> At one stop, when Krofchik tried to reach AT&amp;T, the ITI operator invited  him to find another pay phone, causing the trucker to point out to the FCC: "It  is difficult for a loaded tractor-trailer weighing over 75,000 pounds to drive  through congested cities looking for a regular telephone."  </P> <P> As a result of such experiences, some reforms have been imposed on the new  operator-services firms and pay-phone owners. In California, for example, the  Public Utilities Commission has limited the amount that private pay-phone  owners can charge on calls within the state to a maximum of 10 cents more than  applicable local phone company or AT&amp;T charges. And the PUC is expected  this summer to approve a comprehensive agreement among Pacific Bell, GTE  California, consumer advocates and the smaller firms that will, O'Keefe  predicted, "bring stability to the pay-phone marketplace in California."  </P> <P> Among other things, the new agreement calls for the private pay phones to roll  back their price for making a local call to 20 cents, instead of the 25 cents  they have been allowed, and to freeze it there for five years. And the local  phone companies agreed to pay private phone owners for toll-free calls placed  on their telephones.  </P> <P> But such regulations do not apply to calls between states, which provide "most  of the money these companies make," said David Wagenhauser, who heads the  Telecommunications Research and Action Center, or TRAC. "That's the  jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission," he said, "and the FCC,  to put it mildly, has been lax."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Price Limits  </P> <P> Last Feb. 27, however, the FCC responded to a complaint TRAC filed last summer  by imposing the first standards for interstate pay-phone services. These  include requiring all operators to identify their companies and to make  available information on prices. They also must try to connect callers with the  long-distance carrier of their choice. (Not all pay phones have this  capability.)  </P> <P> But TRAC, which still wants federally imposed price limits, has appealed the  FCC decision.  </P> <P> Support is building in Congress, meanwhile, to enact proposed telephone  operator consumer protection legislation introduced by Rep. Jim Cooper  (D-Tenn.) in response to constituent complaints. That measure, which won  unanimous approval last month from the House telecommunications and finance  subcommittee, seeks to protect consumers from unfair rates and unpleasant  surprises without squelching the new competitors. It has the support of the  Washington-based Competitive Telecommunications Assn.  </P> <P> Ron Evans, vice president of Van Nuys-based Com Systems, a long-distance  carrier with its own operators, said consumer complaints run in cycles as  private pay-phone vendors and operator-service companies enter new areas.  "Where competition has been in place for 12 months, the complaints start going  down," he maintained.  </P> <P> Moreover, private pay phones are better built today. Mark L. Mawrence, vice  president of corporate development for U.S. Teletron, a fast-growing City of  Industry partnership that supplies and operates 2,000 investor-owned pay  phones, said fewer than 5% of its high-technology machines are out of service  at any one time -- about half the rate, he said, for the much simpler Bell  phones.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  New Software  </P> <P> Improved equipment is important because, unlike most phone-company instruments,  which are controlled by the local switching office, privately owned phones have  to contain within them all the smarts needed to price calls and collect and  return coins. At an industry meeting last April organized in Las Vegas by  Telestrategies, an industry support firm in McLean, Va., telecommunications  equipment vendors showed off pay phones that could transmit facsimiles as well  as a system that automates even operator assistance.  </P> <P> Mawrence said his company and a national hotel chain are about to start testing  "operator-in-a-box" software enabling innkeepers to connect guests directly to  the guests' desired carriers and provide automated operator assistance at  competitive rates, plus a specified surcharge to compensate the hotel for its  equipment investment. That system, he said, will meet the hotels' revenue needs  without undue cost to guests. This, he predicted, will become "the standard  within a few years."  </P> <P> Still, Commissioner Andrew Barrett of the Illinois Commerce Commission, who  spoke at the gathering, said the key to consumer acceptance of the newcomers is  "lower prices -- or at least reasonable prices -- and more choices and better  services." So far, Barrett added, "the public is not seeing any of those  things."  </P> <P> Moreover, consumer advocate McEldowney said that, while new services are  likely, he doubts that rates will decline much for basic calling, despite the  new competition for customers. That troubles both him and Gene Kimmelman,  legislative director of Consumer Federation of America.  </P> <P> "They may say we offer you greater services and quality and you should pay more  for them -- and that's fine, if you want the greater services and quality,"  Kimmelman said. "But if all you want is basic service -- plain vanilla -- why  should you have to pay more?"  </P></p>

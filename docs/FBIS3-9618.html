Following the talks the U.S. ambassador held a news  conference, at which he said that the aim of his visit to Knin  was to invite Krajina to join a peace process initiated by the  signing of the Washington agreement and to reintegrate into  Croatia so that it could join the building of a democratic  society and avoid isolation.    As another reason for his visit to Knin, the ambassador  mentioned the cease-fire because, as he said, the time for it  has come. This is a path, as Galbraith explained, toward  reintegration into the Western world, in the political,  security, and economic sense, which leads to the building of a  democratic society. However, that path and goal is inevitably  leading the republic of Serb Krajina, through reintegration,  into the Republic of Croatia, the U.S. ambassador said. He  added that the first step in that process is a cease-fire, and  then economic and other measures leading to reintegration into  the Western world.    An alternative for the republic of Serb Krajina is  isolation,  the U.S. ambassador said. He recalled the U.S. stand that  Krajina is a part of Croatia, provided that the people living in  the UN-protected areas (a name for the territory of the republic  of Serb Krajina) are granted full human rights and a  considerable degree of autonomy.    The mentioned process of reintegration into the Western  world  has also been offered to the Bosnian Serbs through their  relations with the Muslim-Croat federation, while such  possibilities are open to Serbia and Montenegro as well, the  U.S. ambassador said. Dwelling on the last round of cease-fire  negotiations in Zagreb and their resumption on Tuesday,  Galbraith expressed the hope that an agreement on the cessation  of hostilities will be achieved in the light of the fact that  both sides -- the Croatian and the Krajina sides -- have shown  flexibility and readiness for a compromise.    President Martic described the talks with the U.S.  ambassador  as useful. He expressed Krajina's readiness for the restoration  of peace. However, as regards the reintegration of Krajina into  Croatia, Martic highlighted the well-known principle of the  right of a nation to self-determination regardless of U.S. and  Russian standpoints, which consider the republic of Serb Krajina  part of Croatia.    Martic said that in this regard he proposed a referendum to  be held in the republic of Serb Krajina and Croatia at which  people would say whether they want to live together or not, but  added he has no doubts about the negative outcome of such a  referendum.</p>

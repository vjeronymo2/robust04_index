			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> A GIFTED, ORIGINAL GUITARIST JOINS FRIESEN AT MCCABE'S  </P> <P> A surprise was in store for the few dozen David Friesen fans who showed up  Friday at McCabe's. The bassist's partner was Uwe Kropinski, a guitarist who  defected three years ago from East Berlin to Cologne.  </P> <P> Not since Stanley Jordan has a guitarist offered such an array of original  ideas. Kropinski plays both gut-string and steel-string guitars, alternates  between finger style and plectrum solos, and, like Jordan, is capable of  playing with his left hand only.  </P> <P> His guitars are equipped with additional high-register frets that extend beyond  the O-holes of the instruments. Kropinski uses this extra range to create  dazzling octave-jumping runs.  </P> <P> Most remarkable of all is his use of the guitar as a percussion medium.  </P> <P> Instead of merely tapping on wood, he creates complex rhythms, often with both  hands, that would defy the ingenuity of most bongo players. At times he would  switch back and forth between lightning guitar lines and wild percussion  effects.  </P> <P> On one tune, Friesen played a bowed solo on his curious Oregon bass while  Kropinski went into a right-hand tremolo that never let up for two or three  minutes, while his left hand changed chords continuously.  </P> <P> During the second set, the duo's novelty aspect went overboard. Friesen tried  to show that he too could be a percussionist, on the sounding board of his  bass; he tried to play a Shakuhachi flute, then indulged in grotesque "Laughing  Bass" sound effects with his bow. Kropinski, wetting his fingers, stroked the  guitar to simulate the wound of a Brazilian cuica.  </P> <P> The repertoire, consisting of originals by Friesen and Kropinski, involved some  clever interplay between the two men but generally was less interesting than  the spontaneous inventions by this fascinating German visitor.  </P> <P> His visa expires soon, but it seems inevitable that he will return to establish  himself as the sensation in this country that he has already become in Europe.  </P></p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Maradona shows glimpses of old skill against Greece Maradona lives: at least Argentina's flawed 33-year-old glory thrived against an outclassed Greece, scoring a goal and playing all but the last seven minutes in his team's 4-0 win at Foxboro Stadium, Massachusetts. He was not the Argentina star of the day. That honour belonged to Gabriel (the archangel) Batistuta, who achieved the World Cup's first hat-trick - a second-minute poke through the Greek goalkeeper's legs, a 43rd-minute right foot blast from 18 yards and an injury time penalty after a hand-ball offence. But there was no sneezing at Maradona's goal, a precise and opportunistic left-foot shot from the edge of the penalty area that squeezed inside Minou's right-hand goalpost. He spent much of the first half on the turf, victim of close Greek marking and his own theatrics, while Batistuta and Caniggia - another Argentine coming off suspension for narcotics abuse - made most of the one-way running. But, after the break, as Greece became tired and disheartened, there were glimpses of the old surging Maradona runs and flicks. Still, the Greeks were ancient, in the calendar sense, and it remains open whether Maradona, playing in his fourth World Cup, can match the pace and toughness of the Nigerians and Bulgarians in Argentina's remaining first round matches.</p>

Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a  statement  calling the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio an  "unfortunate incident" and offered condolences. The statement  said if the incident was an act of political terrorism, it is a  challenge to Mexico's democracy and all the more regrettable as  Japan has been supporting Latin American nations' efforts to  become democratic.    Colosio was shot in the head and the abdomen around 5 P.M.  shortly after finishing a campaign speech in a poor area of  Tijuana. He died later in the evening.    Colosio, 44, was the candidate of the ruling Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI) in presidential elections scheduled  for August.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Letter: High risks of currency juggling Sir, For Exchem, a UK chemicals manufacturer with 500 employees, the old central exchange rate of DM2.95 in the pound might have been a bit on the high side. But at least there was a clear target, to become competitive at around that rate. Today, 'freed of the straitjacket of the ERM', companies are pressed even harder to go abroad and export. Unfortunately the pound has not only been devalued, it has also become volatile. And we find it uncomfortable to bet on exchange rates, even between European countries. Trade abroad needs a long-term commitment and broadly stable prices in our customers' currencies. And medium and small businesses are not often geared to currency juggling. The risk premium on exchange rates and uncertainty over raw material prices have seriously reduced the benefit of the lower pound. For us the volatility of exchange rates is a matter of great consequence. Mr A A Thibaudeau, Exchem Plc, 1-19 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1NU</p>

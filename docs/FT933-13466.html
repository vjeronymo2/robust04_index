			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Observer: Class question Is a privileged upbringing still the best route to the top in Britain? No, according to a survey of 130 headhunters by the Executive Grapevine directory of recruitment consultants. Almost 80 per cent said that who you know had ceased to be more important than what you know when it comes to getting a prized job. So how about their own backgrounds: what sort of schools did they go to, for instance? The fee-charging variety in 60 per cent of cases. As for comprehensives, although the bulk were aged at most in their 40s, the tally was 5 per cent.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Gilts: Correction in yields brings relief LIKE a man with toothache who has finally succumbed to treatment, the gilt market is glad it's over. The big event was the long-awaited correction in yields to compensate for the fairly obvious overvaluation of UK bonds which has been a feature of the past month or so. The excuse for the sell-off was the publication last Wednesday of Central Statistical Office figures showing a higher than expected rise in retail inflation last month. Gilt traders were glad of the CSO's decision to release such data two hours earlier, which gave them more time to sell the securities and gave the gilt market its worst day since the pound left the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago. After the fall of nearly 2 points for 15-year dated gilts on the day, the bonds traded nervously for the rest of the week. On Friday night, gilts of this maturity showed yields at just over 7 per cent on a par basis, roughly 20 basis points higher than the week before. As a result of this change, the difference between UK government and German bond yields was quoted at around 1 percentage point, from the low of around 70 basis points recorded when gilts were performing particularly well in mid-August. The big question now for the gilt market is whether the latest inflation data are a blip or whether the assumptions which have underpinned the market's recent rally will have to be jettisoned for good. If it is the latter, then yields - particularly at the long end of the curve  -may be expected to rise in the next few weeks. The general mood in the gilt market last week, however, was that investor interest is likely to hold fairly steady in the near future. Although some economists warned of further nasty surprises on the inflation front, many went along with the sentiments of Mr Robin Aspinall, an economist at Panmure Gordon, who said the inflation figures were 'nothing to get excited about'. In the year to August the retail prices index rose 1.7 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in the 12 months to July. The Treasury's favoured measure of underlying inflation, the year-on-year rise in the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments, went up to 3.1 per cent in August from 2.9 per cent. A large part of the rise was due to price increases in shops, apparently resulting from retailers trying to compensate for the recent pressure on margins linked to the recession and the long period of discounting. However, Mr Hugh Clarke, trade policy director of the British Retail Consortium, a trade body for the sector, disputed that shops were in any position to push through big price increases. 'A lot of retailers are still suffering fierce competition and weak demand and see little opportunity to increase prices,' he said. Also, the latest evidence on pay is that undue inflationary pressures appear to be dormant. According to the Confederation of British Industry, the pay bill in manufacturing has not grown at all this year and industry is heading for a reduction in unit labour costs this year for the the first time since 1960. Although the year-on-year underlying increase in average weekly earnings across the economy stayed static in July at 3.5 per cent, the same as in June, the figure is historically extremely low and illustrates the weakness of wage pressures. UK economic data released this week are likely to provide few opportunities for big selling or buying, with most interest focusing on the second-quarter figures for gross domestic product in the second quarter due out tomorrow. Gilts were little moved by the announcement that the next gilt auction will be on September 29, when the Bank of England will sell an unspecified amount of stock in the maturity range 2002 to 2006 inclusive. Details of the amount and the auction stock will be announced tomorrow.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> OIL DRILLING OFF COAST DELAYED  </P> <P> Interior Department officials have delayed indefinitely plans for offshore oil  drilling along the Southern California coast so the new Administration can  review the proposal, according to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), an  oil-drilling foe. Robert Walker, an Interior Department spokesman, declined to  confirm that any decision has been made regarding the leasing proposal. But  another Interior official, who requested his name not be used, confirmed that  the oil lease plan has been put on hold for an indeterminate period. It remains  unclear, however, whether the freeze will be a long-term hold or simply a  temporary delay of a few weeks to allow the Bush Administration time to review  the proposal.  </P></p>

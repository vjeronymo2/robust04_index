			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Wang Dan Returns From Xiamen to Beijing, With </F> Authorities' Tacit Consent"]    [Text] Noted pro-democracy activist Wang Dan, who abruptly  left Beijing on the eve of U.S. Secretary of State Christopher's  visit to China, returned to Beijing yesterday. He said he left  Beijing of his own accord to avoid intensifying the conflict  between the government and pro-democracy activists.    On the other hand, as it is believed that many dissidents  still are being detained by the Chinese authorities,  Krzaklewski, leader of Poland's Solidarity trade union, wrote a  letter to Chinese Premier Li Peng calling on Beijing to release  them.    Wang Dan was interviewed by our staff reporter after  returning to Beijing with Zhou Duo and Min Qi. Wang said he  left Beijing because he had learned through relevant channels  that if he did not leave Beijing at that time, the conflict  between the government and some pro-democracy activists --  including himself -- would likely be intensified. Under the  strong persuasion of Zhou Duo and other friends, and in order to  avoid intensifying the conflict, he left Beijing for Xiamen.    Wang stressed that the place and means of travel were  decided  of his own accord and that his freedom of movement during this  period was not restricted or interfered with.    Meanwhile, Wang corrected news agencies' remarks, saying  that  he also returned to Beijing of his own accord. Since he did not  meet with any obstruction or warnings, he guessed that the  government had given tacit consent to his move. According to  news agency reports, after staying in Xiamen for several days,  Wang Dan returned to Beijing with government approval.    In addition, Krzaklewski, leader of Poland's Solidarity  trade union, wrote a letter to Li Peng, calling for the  "immediate and unconditional release" of labor and pro-democracy  activists, such as Wei Jingsheng, Zhou Guoqiang, Qian Yumin,  Yuan Hongbin, Bao Ge, Wang Jiaqi, and Wang Dan.    The letter said, "their prolonged detention constitutes a  clear violation of International Labor Organization conventions  protecting the right to set up trade unions."    So far, however, China has acknowledged only the arrests of  Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbin, and Wang Jiaqi for their "violation  of the criminal law." Yesterday, the whereabouts of Wei  Jingsheng and others (with the exception of Wang Dan) remained  unknown.</p>

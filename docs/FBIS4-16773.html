			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Aratov "Rejoinder": "After Alaska, Baykal?"] </F>   [Text] Say what you like about our democrats, but they  certainly keep us entertained. One minute they are feeding  society "version No. 1," trying to accuse the opposition of  attempting to destabilize the situation, and when this falls  through they come over all innocent and say: But we were only  making public a document about "an incipient palace coup." We  have been misunderstood. The next minute they are circulating a  "directive from Yeltsin" on locating Russian military bases on  the territory of former Soviet republics, including Latvia,  thereby wrecking the Russian-Latvian talks, and all this is  subsequently explained away as a "technical error" -- it appears  that some clerk or typist is to blame for the whole thing. And  now it seems our ears are deceiving us again: "Let's buy  Siberia! For a paltry $3 trillion we can save Russia, add seven  stars to our flag, and give an entire generation the prospect of  unprecedented prosperity" -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA reported this  initiative put forward by the U.S. political scientist U. Mid  [name as transliterated] just the other day.    This initiative first surfaced a year ago and was viewed by  the public here as gibberish not worthy of serious discussion.  But the author of the article "Siberia for $3 Trillion" had  absolutely no qualms about writing the following: "It would be  interesting to find out what Siberians and Far Easterners, for  whom the land beyond the Yenisey is their native region, think  about this proposal." Citing the U.S. press, he adduces a whole  series of "pieces of evidence" in support of this idea. The  sale of Siberia "would be the best way to resolve Russia's  problems," since Russia could use the money from the deal "to  start the transition to the First World instead of the slide  into the Third." The article continues in the same vein: "All  Siberia's inhabitants would be U.S. citizens enjoying all the  rights and privileges of Americans"; "Russia would be able to  pay off all its foreign debts and modernize its infrastructure."  And so on.    U. Mid published his scenario in order to "provoke serious  discussion of how to extricate Russia from its blind alley." He  believes that "economically speaking, this sort of solution is  possible." He says that he came across Americans everywhere in  Russia, and it was the same story in Hawaii: "Missionaries  first of all, then traders, and finally the Navy."    We could safely ignore all this gibberish if it were not  published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, which in the very same issue  reported that it is "the official newspaper of the state." What  is this -- another "technical" (in this case editorial) error,  or a cautious sounding-out of Russian public opinion?</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / The dangers of a quick fix: The global economy cannot rely on the US for leadership The US economy is emerging strongly from recession. The torch of leadership has passed to an able and energetic young Democrat. For the first time in over a decade, the same political party now controls both houses of Congress as well as the White House. The Clinton administration is thus better placed than its recent predecessors to provide global economic and foreign policy leadership. None of the other leading industrial countries shares its advantages. Japan has old and unimpressive political leaders and confronts potentially the most serious recession in decades. The strains of unification have undermined Germany's role as Europe's monetary anchor, sent recessionary ripples across the entire continent and thrown in jeopardy the ambitious timetable for European economic and monetary union. The UK seems unable to break out of a protracted downturn and is going through one of its periodic bouts of acute self-doubt. President Bill Clinton seems fully aware of his global responsibilities. In an eloquent speech in Washington yesterday he adopted a lofty internationalist tone, far removed from his recent carping about Airbus subsidies. 'Open and competitive commerce will enrich us as a nation,' he declared. The US had to 'compete not retreat'. Mr Clinton also sought to place his economic package of last week in the context of a 'global growth strategy'. The message is that the US has put its house in order by taking steps to reduce the budget deficit and raise long-term investment. But while the US is prepared to lead it cannot alone guarantee global prosperity; the time has come for Germany and Japan to play their part as engines of global growth. Mr Clinton left the details for Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury Secretary, who is in London for today's meeting of the Group of Seven industrial countries. It is no secret that the US wants Japan to adopt a more expansionary fiscal policy and Europe to do something - anything - to promote faster growth. In US eyes, Europe is most out of line on monetary policy: short-term interest rates remain far higher than in either the US or Japan. Mr Bentsen is thus likely gently to press the Bundesbank to consider an early easing of policy. The president's attention to international economic issues will be welcomed abroad. But the best grounds for economic optimism lie not in what Mr Clinton said but in the vigorous US economic recovery the Democrats have inherited from the Bush administration. After nearly two years of sluggish expansion, the US economy is finally taking off: the Commerce Department yesterday reported stunning GDP figures for the fourth quarter: growth at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent, the best since 1987. Most forecasters now believe that steady annual growth of about 3 per cent is now all but assured. The US is such a self-contained economy (the share of exports in GDP is still only about 12 per cent) that even a deepening downturn in other countries is unlikely to jeopardise its recovery. On the contrary, as incomes and consumption rise in the US, other countries will benefit from increased demand for their products. The US should thus help pull other countries out of recession, although the pull will be weaker than in the early 1980s, when deficit spending sent US demand through the roof. By curbing future deficits, Mr Clinton may slightly reduce the US growth rate in coming years. But the effect will be small partly because lower long-term interest rates will offset fiscal contraction and partly because the deficit-cutting is less severe than widely appreciated. Buried at the back of Mr Clinton's A Vision of Change for America is a revealing table showing projections for the structural budget deficit (the deficit allowing for the effects of the business cycle). This shows that planned policy changes will reduce the structural deficit by about Dollars 25bn over the next two years and then hold it steady at about Dollars 200bn (roughly 3 per cent of GDP) until 1997. The conventional wisdom that an immediate stimulus will be followed by tough measures to curb the deficit is thus quite misleading. In reality there is no stimulus worth mentioning and only the most modest stab at reducing the structural deficit over the medium-term. Congress however may push for substantial changes to the plan. Beyond allowing a spontaneous private-sector-led recovery to gather momentum, what can the US do to spur global growth? The two areas where US actions potentially matter most, but where signals to date have at best been confused, are G 7 policy co-ordination and trade policy. Since his nomination as US Treasury Secretary last year, Mr Bentsen has repeatedly stressed his wish to 'revitalise' the G7 co-ordination process. He says he will rely mainly on private negotiation and promises to eschew the 'public bullying' that so often proved counterproductive for the Reagan and Bush administrations. Unfortunately, he has already blotted his copybook by declaring publicly last week that he favoured a stronger yen. Predictably, frenzied trading on foreign exchange markets caused a sharp appreciation of the yen, which threatens to intensify already powerful recessionary forces in the Japanese economy. Tokyo was understandably miffed. The US probably does not know what it wants from policy co-ordination. In a competitive global economy characterised by highly mobile capital and instantaneous communications, the G7's significance can easily be exaggerated. Before leaning too hard on trading partners, Mr Bentsen might recall that most of the measures advocated by the US in the recent past subsequently proved misjudged. For example it pushed Japan into overstimulating its domestic economy in the late 1980s, a mistake that led directly to a speculative bubble in share and real estate markets and, ultimately, today's financial turmoil. In due course the Bundesbank is likely to lower interest rates and Japan's Ministry of Finance to sanction more expansionary fiscal measures. If the G7 chooses to dress this up as a great triumph of co-ordination - a quid pro quo for Mr Clinton's 'bold' fiscal retrenchment - that is its prerogative. In reality, however, these steps are like to be taken when and only when they are perceived to be in the self-interest of the countries concerned. Mr Clinton's speech yesterday, which emphasised the importance of US workers and industries adjusting to the realities of global competition rather than seeking to shelter behind trade barriers, will offset some of the damage inflicted by loose protectionist rhetoric in recent weeks. European and Japanese officials, however, would be right to remain suspicious. The fierceness of Mr Clinton's complaints about Airbus subsidies is telling the world something. Mr Clinton is not an overt protectionist but his stance on trade differs considerably from that of George Bush. Mr Bush's formative years were the 1940s and 1950s when US industrial supremacy was unchallenged; Mr Clinton's were the 1970s and 1980s, the decades when the US seemed unable to handle foreign competition in such sensitive sectors as consumer electronics and cars. While Mr Bush took the benefits of a liberal trading system for granted, Mr Clinton and many of his senior advisers believe the US has lost ground partly because other countries bent the rules - by refusing to open markets as fully as the US and by pursuing active industrial policies involving generous government subsidies for strategic industries. The Clinton doctrine is that free trade is beneficial but only if the same standards apply universally. This week he unveiled a mildly interventionist 'technology policy' to meet the perceived threat from European and Japanese industrial policies; he will continue to press hard for reciprocal trade concessions abroad whenever he feels other countries are not meeting US standards. This is a recipe for continued trade tension. In the past the global economy has performed best when an 'anchor' country has served both as a guarantor of monetary stability and a champion of the liberal values on which a market system depends. Britain performed this role with distinction during the 19th century; the US performed well after the second world war as the hub of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system. But towards the end of the 1960s US leadership faltered, mainly because it failed to keep its own inflation rate under control but also because it lost sight of its wider global responsibilities. For the past two decades, for example, the US has perceived the dollar less as a global store of value than as an instrument to be manipulated for the short-term benefit of American exporters. Mr Bentsen's immediate reaction to the widening bilateral trade deficit with Japan (caused mainly by Japan's domestic slump) is wholly characteristic: seek a quick fix by talking the dollar down against the yen. It rarely seems to occur to US policymakers that, in the long run, the countries with the strongest currencies also enjoy the strongest trade accounts. Indeed, despite protestations about improving long-run productivity, a kind of short-termism permeates much of the Clinton administration's economic strategy. Worried about a lack of investment? For Mr Bentsen the answer is obvious: dish out a temporary investment tax credit. Just seven short years after the path-breaking 1986 Tax Reform Act, which eliminated a host of fiscal distortions, the US Treasury is again manipulating the tax code in search of temporary economic gain. Mr Clinton is right to argue for a global growth strategy. But despite the seductive rhetoric there is a danger that the US in practice will continue to press for quick fixes - such as fiscal boosts or currency realignments - and lose sight of the more important long-term determinants of prosperity, such as a genuinely liberal trade regime and non-inflationary monetary policies. The question is whether it will be a good anchor for the world economy in the short or the long term.</p>

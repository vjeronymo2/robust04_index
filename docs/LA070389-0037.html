			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHE DESIGNED MOVIE OUTFITS THAT THE KILLER CALLS 'JUST LIKE MINE'  </P> <P> Goodness gracious: leopard lapels and shiny suits! Stepping out as Jerry Lee  Lewis in "Great Balls of Fire," Dennis Quaid's clothes are the perfect fit for  the role of The Killer, thanks to Los Angeles designer Mary Kay Stolz.  </P> <P> After looking at hours of videos, Stolz re-created Lewis' 1950s wardrobe, shiny  suits and all. "It was a fine line to get the clothes recognizable without  overdoing it," she said in her Hollywood Hills studio.  </P> <P> The biggest help, Stolz said, was a video of Elvis Presley footage. "That's  what Jerry Lee was aspiring to."  </P> <P> Stolz's job in "Great Balls of Fire" was similar to what she did for Quaid in  "The Big Easy," designing the clothes of one character.  </P> <P> In "The Big Easy," Quaid played a New Orleans cop on the take with a wardrobe  that a police officer would be hard-pressed to afford. "He had all his clothes  made," Stolz said. "We were giving a character a look."  </P> <P> In some ways, the look of Quaid's clothes in "Great Balls of Fire" is similar  to "The Big Easy," said Tracy Tynan, "Great Balls" costume designer. "They were  the same '40s and '50s style," she said. "They weren't that radically  different."  </P> <P> Stolz, who had also done concert clothes for Eddie Murphy, Prince, Sheila E.  and Kim Carnes, views movie costumes as part of the nonverbal narrative. "They  must tell something about the character and make the story proceed the way it  should."  </P> <P> After watching the '50s footage, Stolz said she noticed that the clothes  entertainers like Lewis and Elvis wore made them stand out from the band. The  styles were not that much different, she said, "but they hung differently, they  were drapier." In addition, the singers pushed the norm a little further. "They  were a little more theatrical."  </P> <P> Tynan said Lewis and Elvis used to buy clothes at a Memphis store called  Lansky's. "Black entertainers got their clothes there," Tynan said. "They had a  much more interesting sense of style." The bands dressed more conservatively,  with plaid coats and string ties, she said. Lansky's, still owned by Bernard  Lansky, is now a big and tall men's shop -- with nine locations in Greater  Memphis -- and an Elvis Presley gift shop. "We had real sharp, way-out clothes.  People thought we were crazy, but we had the sharpest clothes," Lansky said.  "We were the outfitters to the King. Jerry Lee started coming in right after  Elvis."  </P> <P> For "Great Balls of Fire," Stolz and Tynan had to take some liberties because  much of the '50s footage was in black-and-white and some fabrics weren't  available. "We didn't know what the colors or the fabrics were," Tynan said.  </P> <P> Stolz did find some '50s fabrics, though, from stores in Beverly Hills and in  St. Louis.  </P> <P> "There's still lots of stuff left over from the '50s in St. Louis," she said.  </P> <P> While Stolz, who is also a senior design instructor at Otis/Parsons, is  building a reputation for performance clothes and flashy movie costumes, she  doesn't like to see out-of-character clothes in films. "I don't like it when  terrorists look like GQ models," she says.  </P> <P> She did the opposite of fancy dress while working as costume designer for  "Weeds," which starred Nick Nolte as a convict who goes straight by writing a  play.  </P> <P> "People told me: 'You can't do real clothes,' " Stolz said. "I finally got to  prove that I could in 'Weeds.' "  </P> <P> She wanted unstylish clothes that looked as though they belonged to ex-cons. To  get that effect, she did such things as having clothes run over with a car and  pants pockets abused to the point where they looked as if a guy had been  "sticking his hands in them every day for five years."  </P> <P> Stolz started out in manufacturing but doesn't plan to head back into street  wear any time soon. "I'm trying to do mostly movies," she said. "I'd much  rather do that than try to think of what women in the Midwest want to wear to  work next year."  </P> <P> Besides, she said, in the movies, "when you make people look good, they like  you and everyone's happy."  </P> <P> And how about The Killer himself, who had an active role in the production of  the film and has been promoting the movie in everything from Esquire and  Rolling Stone spreads with Quaid to the unveiling of a Jerry Lee Lewis star on  Hollywood Boulevard?  </P> <P> Well, he ended up wearing one of Stolz's suits for a promotional photo, Tynan  said. And, Stolz said, the best compliment for her was when Lewis said, "These  clothes look just like mine."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> UNO NAMED HEAD OF JAPAN PARTY; WILL REPLACE PREMIER  </P> <P> Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party overcame an attempted rebellion by  young rebels today and chose Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, 66, as its new party  president.  </P> <P> Parliament was to elect him as prime minister this afternoon after Noboru  Takeshita officially submits his resignation.  </P> <P> The change of the guard -- precipitated by an 11-month series of revelations of  a $7.7-million influence-buying scandal -- was marred by six objections from  the floor of a party caucus meeting. Each protested the party's refusal to  permit a formal vote.  </P> <P> The vast majority of the 341 party members of Parliament present, however,  showed their approval for Uno by standing.  </P> <P> The young rebels Thursday decided to field Ganri Yamashita, 68, a former  Defense Agency director, as a rival to Uno, but the party leaders refused to  accept his candidacy.  </P> <P> Shizuka Kamei, head of the so-called Liberal Progressive Alliance, said the  rebels asked Yamashita to run to protest Takeshita's "secret-room" selection of  Uno, a lieutenant of the party faction that was headed until Wednesday by  former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Influence Scandal Grew  </P> <P> During Nakasone's term as prime minister from 1982 to 1987, a $7.7-million  influence-buying scandal grew, tainting Nakasone, Takeshita, and all other  major leaders of the party.  </P> <P> Election rules for party conventions are spelled out, but there are no  provisions for a vote between rivals in a caucus.  </P> <P> The uprising shattered party unity, which had been a hallmark of Takeshita's 19  months in office. It also set the stage for demands for Uno's resignation  should he fail to lead the party to victory in a crucial upper house election  July 23.  </P> <P> Criticism of Takeshita's virtually single-handed choice of Uno erupted in  meetings Thursday of party factions, the cores of power within the ruling  party.  </P> <P> "I have never heard Uno utter a word about political reform," complained former  Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki, 78.  </P> <P> After returning from Paris, where he attended a meeting of the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development, Uno pledged in a news conference that he  would "carry out faithfully" reform plans already drawn up by the party. He  also said he would give up his membership in the former Nakasone faction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Made Courtesy Calls  </P> <P> Uno paid late-night courtesy calls on both Suzuki and former Prime Minister  Takeo Fukuda, 84, who also had complained bitterly about selecting a Nakasone  lieutenant.  </P> <P> Kenzaburo Hara, speaker of the lower house, cleared the way Thursday for Uno to  be elected prime minister by resigning to accept responsibility for allowing  the ruling party to ram the fiscal 1989 budget through the lower house in the  midst of an opposition boycott. Four opposition parties had declared they would  stay away from the election of a new prime minister in Parliament if Hara  stayed on.  </P> <P> Uno was to form a new Cabinet after his election in Parliament.  </P></p>

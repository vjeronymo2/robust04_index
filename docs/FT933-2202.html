			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / International Company News: General Motors sells components offshoot GENERAL Motors, which is divesting peripheral businesses in order to focus on its lossmaking North American car operations, is selling its rear axle, propeller shaft and forging business to an investor group. The business will be renamed American Axle &amp; Manufacturing and its chief executive will be Mr Richard Dausch, a former executive of Chrysler. The deal with American Axle is the first significant sale by GM of one of its car components businesses, although it has also sold several operations not connected with the vehicle industry. Last week, for example, it sold its Allison Gas Turbine division in a leveraged buy-out. GM put the American Axle businesses up for sale last December, and the deal is expected to be concluded by the end of this December. Many analysts say that to improve its North American manufacturing costs, GM needs to shed many of its component operations, which frequently have higher labour and other costs than independent, non-union businesses. The company relies on its own subsidiaries for around 70 per cent of the components that go into its vehicles. However, the United Auto Workers union has adopted a generally hostile approach to moves by the company to source components from outside. GM was quick to point out that as part of the deal, the UAW will continue to represent the new company's hourly-paid workers. Mr Dausch, who resigned as executive vice-president of manufacturing at Chrysler in 1991, has recently been working in Detroit as a consultant.</p>

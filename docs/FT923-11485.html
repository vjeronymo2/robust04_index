			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Issues unresolved as cocoa pact talks draw to a close THREE WEEKS of negotiat-ions on a new international cocoa agreement are set to end today, with producers and consumers still far apart on key issues. There has been tacit acceptance by producing countries of the withholding scheme for stabilising prices proposed by consumers. But there has been no meeting of minds on the price level to be defended, the amount of cocoa to be withheld from the market, or how the scheme is to be financed. Delegates from the 40 member countries of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) have agreed to return to Geneva for two weeks at the beginning of November for a third attempt to finalise an agreement. The current pact, negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), expires in September 1993. Producers want the new accord to defend a price range of SDR1,485-2,155 per tonne, with a median price of SDR1,820, or just over Pounds 1,400. This is more than double current market levels. The present cocoa pact's inability to defend the same price range led to the suspension of buffer stock operations in 1988. Consumers are proposing a range of SDR800-1,200 a tonne, with a median price of SDR1,000 (about Pounds 770). This corresponds to the average market price over the four years since 1988. Producers this week conceded that a ceiling could be imposed on withholding levels. But the 600,000 tonne limit proposed by Mr Kouame N'Guessan of the Ivory Coast, which he argues would enable the accord to defend a bottom price level of SDR1,400 Pounds 1,078) a tonne, is twice that envisaged by consumers. Consuming countries want tough production controls from the start of the new accord to bring supply and demand into better balance. Both sides have agreed in principle to the establishment of a producer committee within the ICCO to co-ordinate a 'production management programme'. But producers claim that output curbs will not start to bite for three to four years. On financing, consumers want the cost to be met first from the payment of arrears, then by controlled sales from the existing 240,000 tonne buffer stock and only later, under certain conditions, by a levy on cocoa trade as proposed by producers. The ICCO's biggest debtors are the Ivory Coast and Brazil, the two largest producers.</p>

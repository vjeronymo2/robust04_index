			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Laurentian policies under Lautro's eye - The probe into whole-of-life and mortgage endowment plans POLICIES sold by Laurentian Life, the life assurance company, have fallen under the scrutiny of the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro). Lautro has sent in a firm of consulting actuaries - Tillinghast - to review a sample of 3,000 policies on suspicion that some people may have been sold unsuitable policies. The problem centres on 'factfinds' which are client questionnaires drawn by the agent. The adviser gathers information about the client's financial circumstances to gauge his investment needs and enters this information on the factfind. He is then in a position to recommend the most suitable type of product for the client. The review at Laurentian by Tillinghast followed a preliminary investigation of several hundred policies by Lautro earlier in the year, which raised doubts that best advice had been given to customers. Recent Lautro reviews of several insurance companies, including Scottish Widows, have found that the amount of information on the factfind has been insufficient to justify any kind of advice being given. Lautro has been active in monitoring the techniques of tied agents, following concern in the industry that unsuitable long-term policies are being recommended for the rich commission that is earned on their sale. An inadequate factfind would suggest that the adviser was more interested in selling products, such as whole-of-life policies, to earn commission than in finding out what his client's needs were. Paul Stott, head of communications at Laurentian Financial Group, said that the only policies under investigation are whole-of-life and mortgage endowment policies. Lautro is concerned that these may have been sold to young people with no dependants. Laurentian has two main sales outlets; Laurentian Milldon, a wholly-owned member of the Laurentian group, with about 550 salesmen, and Laurentian Financial Advisers. Laurentian Milldon had been the company's only tied agent outlet until earlier this year, when Laurentian's direct sales force set up Laurentian Financial Advisers as a separate company within the group. Laurentian says that if the review, which is due to be completed by the end of November, shows that any clients have been wrongly advised, it will offer an alternative policy or compensation in the form of a refund of premiums. Lautro says that in cases of mis-selling, compensation is not necessarily the answer. 'We want the investor to have the right type of policy, said Mike Abrahams, chief enforcement officer at Lautro. He added:'That need not mean compensation.' It is up to the company and the individual to reach agreement in cases of mis-selling but if an impasse is reached, the investor can take his case to the Insurance Ombudsman. Paul Stott said it would be highly unlikely that the company would be asked to check any more policies. However, Mike Abrahams said: 'Where we have cases in which doubts have been raised about best advice, we ask that a full review be taken by independent actuaries. Depending on the results of the review, we may ask for a full review of 100 per cent of the business during the period concerned.' Policies sold before 1988 are exempt from Lautro's scrutiny since that is the year when the Financial Services Act, which established the self-regulatory authorities, was implemented. Barry Sherlock, chairman of Lautro, said in Lautro's recently published annual report that more cases than ever before were going through the disciplinary process. Lautro has also been using its power to fine, which was granted to it last year. The tighter Lautro measures on the selection, training and supervision of salespeople have been biting, with the number of tied agents falling by 14,000 in the year to June 1992. There has been a further fall of 8,000 since then. Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, said the decrease was also a reflection of the recession.</p>

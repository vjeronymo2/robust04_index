			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Finland launches DM1.25bn FRN issue The Republic of Finland enlivened an otherwise quiet eurobond market yesterday as it continued its financing activities with the launch of a DM1.25bn eight-year floating rate note. The notes, issued via a consortium of banks, carried an interest rate of 1/16 per cent over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) with an issue price of 99.76, said lead manager Commerzbank. There was good demand for the new issue, especially from domestic German institutions, the lead managers said. They also reported some interest from smaller continental European banks. This latest deal by the Republic of Finland follows deals earlier in August when it tapped the Canadian dollar and Luxembourg franc sectors. After the last issue, finance ministry officials said Finland planned to borrow at least Dollars 2bn more in the international capital markets this year. The latest bond will be value-dated September 16, 1994 and is scheduled for a listing on the Frankfurt securities exchange, officials said. Elsewhere, the Greek government announced that it will issue one-year and three-year dollar-linked bonds at 6.3 per cent and 7.75 per cent annually, and one-year and three-year fixed rate Ecu-linked bonds at 7.1 per cent and 8.8 per cent annually. The bonds will be issued tomorrow and their rates will be fixed and tax-free, the finance ministry said. The Bank of Yokohama announced that it was planning to launch euroyen subordinated bonds in September. Details have yet to be decided, a spokesman said. Subordinated bonds are generally issued to raise capital adequacy ratios, bank officials said.</p>

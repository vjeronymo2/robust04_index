			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LONESOME' TRACES ELVIS' RISE, DEMISE  </P> <P> The single most striking image in Alan Bleasdale's "Are You Lonesome Tonight?"  is the sight of the young Elvis Presley lovingly singing "Are You Lonesome  Tonight?" to the older, drugged out, bloated man he was to become.  </P> <P> It is a moment that lifts this British-born show, now in its American premiere  at the San Diego Repertory Theatre, more than a cut above the gaudy tributes  that usually pass for commentary on Elvis.  </P> <P> To Bleasdale's credit, he dives into the Presley mythology with both eyes open  and comes up with some of the threads that connect Presley's early  rags-to-riches story to the tale of the self-destructive man who died,  suddenly, a dozen years ago.  </P> <P> He captures the poverty of Presley's youth, alludes in a flashback to the shame  of seeing his father locked up for writing a bad check, lingers over his  mother's constant reminder of the twin he had who died at birth and dwells on  the theme of abandonment -- by the brother who died, his mother who died when  he was in the Army, and his wife and friends who left him one by one.  </P> <P> The richest ore Bleasdale finds is the groping on the part of the aging Presley  to  </P> <P> come to terms with his younger self.  </P> <P> But Bleasdale glides over the character of the young Presley, using him chiefly  to sing some of Presley's greatest hits, such as "Heartbreak Hotel" and "Good  Rockin' Tonight."  </P> <P> Why did the young Presley give up 50% of his earnings to his manager, Col. Tom  Parker? How did his relationship with wife Priscilla begin, falter and end?  Instead of seeing the older Presley remembering his mother's death, could we  not see the younger Elvis experiencing it?  </P> <P> Even with these gaping holes, "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" seems the best stage  treatment of Presley to date. Director George Ferencz brings out the tension  between the older and younger Presleys and between the semi-stupor of the life  inside Presley's Memphis estate, Graceland, and the seedy hotel where Presley's  former bodyguard and friend plots to betray him.  </P> <P> One of the highlights for any Elvis fan will be the nearly dozen rousing songs,  powerfully sung both by Rick Sparks, who does a remarkable job in re-creating  Presley's "1968 Comeback Special," and by Sam Woodhouse, producing director of  the San Diego Rep, who makes his first appearance on the Lyceum Stage as the  older Presley. An on-stage four-piece band, under the direction of Bob Jewett,  backs up the songs masterfully, picking up the beat and fading, sometimes into  silence, when appropriate.  </P> <P> The Elvises are also well supported by Drew Tombrello as Duke, the friend who  betrays him, and Duane Daniels as Duke's dimwitted pal, Jerry. Brothers Tavis  Ross and J. Michael Ross bring intelligence and depth to two of Presley's  friends at Graceland, torn between the desire to stand by him and the need to  flee rather than watch what he is doing to himself.  </P> <P> Bill Dunnam radiates devilish ill will as Col. Parker, but his character, as  written by Bleasdale, is the most flat and caricatured of the roles. Lillian  Byrd is able to bring more to the part of Presley's mother, Gladys, than she is  to Priscilla in a fleetingly brief scene. Similarly, one wishes Jake Schmidt  were given more to do as Presley's father, Vernon.  </P> <P> Victoria Petrovich's inventive set design and Brenda Berry's lighting allow the  action to glide smoothly between past and present and from venue to venue,  capturing the chandeliered opulence of Presley's red-curtained estate, the  drabness of a tiny hotel room, a brightly lit bar with a jukebox, a glittering  performance stage.  </P> <P> Part of the continuing fascination with Presley is that he, like Marilyn  Monroe, was the American dream gone wrong. The scores of books and plays and  movies that have come out about them have one question at the center: Why?  </P> <P> "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" doesn't have the feel of the answer, but it does  shed some light on the loneliness that can emerge in childhood and can, if  unchecked, grow into a malignant tumor by adulthood. Ironically, if Elvis had  been able to make peace between his older and younger selves as this play  suggests, one wonders if he would have continued to destroy himself.  </P> <P>  At 79 Horton Plaza, San Diego, Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 7,  Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. and one Saturday matinee Sept. 16, through Oct. 1.  Tickets: $17-22; (619) 235-8025.  </P> <P> </P></p>

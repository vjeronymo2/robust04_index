			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Customs brokers stopwork at EC borders CUSTOMS brokers, faced with redundancy when European Community frontier controls are abolished next year, yesterday attempted to focus attention on their case by refusing to clear freight through customs and tax formalities at many European border crossings. Clecat, the brokers' trade association, claimed widespread support for the industrial action. Belga, the Belgian news agency, reported severe hold-ups on the French and German borders with Belgium yesterday morning. There were also traffic jams at the frontier between Greece and Yugoslavia, where Greek lorry-drivers took the opportunity to protest against increased duties for the transit of freight through Hungary. Clecat said no action had been taken in Denmark and Ireland, and active support was more limited in the UK and the Netherlands. Dutch brokers are to meet their government tomorrow. Brokers are calling for aid from national governments and the European Commission to help them adapt to the internal market, expected to sweep away most of the paperwork now handled by the private companies. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the EC commissioner responsible for customs union, said yesterday the Commission, national and regional authorities were trying to find ways of retargeting EC funds to assist the 85,000 employees in the sector.</p>

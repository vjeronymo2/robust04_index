			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Two incomes, two pensions? - Briefcase, Q&amp;A I work on salary for the University of London and also have freelance consultancy income. My salary is taxed under PAYE and the consultancy earnings under Schedule D. I pay pension contributions from my salary to the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) but make no further pension provision from the freelance earnings. Can I remain in the USS and, simultaneously, take out a personal pension funded solely from my freelance earnings? There is no reason why you cannot start a personal pension based on your freelance earnings while remaining in the occupational scheme in respect of your salary. You might also like to consider making free-standing additional voluntary contribution (FSAVC) payments at the same time as contributing to a personal pension.

All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

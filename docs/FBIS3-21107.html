			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Bull Trying To Define Its </F> Limits"]    [Text] After the Compagnie des Machines Bull refinanced to  the tune of 8.5 billion FF in December and after it reduced its  debt to 2.4 billion thanks to a squeeze in capital, the group's  directors are now looking for ways to retain the advantage of a  strengthened financial structure. Two goals have priority for  1994: an increased business volume, and cost reduction.  Jean-Marie Descarpentries, Bull's CEO, is said to have begun by  asking his dealers to produce 4 billion FF in 100 days! He has  even supposedly found his war horse: ISM, the distributed  systems environment for manufacturing management.    Trying to save 3 billion FF in 1994, the Bull CEO presumably  will bring about a reorganization and a reduction in the number  of locations, as well as measures favoring more part-time work  and salary reductions. This program is becoming increasingly  harder to negotiate with the unions, which walked out on the  management team on 4 January on the grounds that some  representatives had not been invited to the meeting. The agenda  would have included a discussion of employee layoffs at the  Villeneuve-d'Ascq plant, and the startup of Athesa, FM  subsidiary of Bull. Nevertheless, it is now a given that Athesa  TSP will take over the internal computer operations of Bull  (about 750 MFF business volume), while the Athesa International  holding company prepares the opening of a subsidiary in Great  Britain in the near future. Athesa France, meanwhile, has just  landed an initial contract for 20 MFF with the Caisse Centrale  du Batiment for the Paris region.</p>

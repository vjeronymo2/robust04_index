			<p>BFN     [Text] bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- In an address on  Thursday [21 April] to the Crans Montana conference meeting in  Bucharest, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that his  meeting with the PLO leader [Yasir 'Arafat] at the Crans Montana  Forum was not incidental because Bucharest had a peculiar  significance for Jews and Arabs, as this was the place where  essential contacts had taken place some years ago on the way of  building a real peace in the Middle East.    The Israeli minister reminded that Israel had recently  established diplomatic relations with the Vatican and  appreciated that as an event of the category of those occurring  once at two thousand years. This model of understanding with  the Catholic world could be followed by closer relations with  the Moslem world, said Shim'on Peres. "The historic decision"  taken by Yasir 'Arafat to negotiate the peace with the Israeli  was not an easy decision to make in a world dominated by hatred  and suspicion, said the Israeli foreign minister.    Shim'on Peres added that Israel could not afford to remain  an  island of prosperity in a sea of poverty because only a new  standard of living must be the answer to the fundamentalism.  This is the moment to finalize the peace and not the war, said  Shim'on Peres, who added further that one could not win through  battles, but rather through toils in schools. The Israeli  minister concluded that the "hunting season" was over and it was  high time that the "creation season" should start. Shim'on  Peres said he thought the peace bay was near.</p>

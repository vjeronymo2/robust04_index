			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSWALK INDUCTS 4 FORMER STARS, HONORS LITTLE LEAGUERS  </P> <P> The future and the past of sports came together this week when the San Pedro  Sportswalk inducted four new members and created a new "Circle of Excellence"  for Little League players.  </P> <P> The four inductees were the Dodgers' Roy Campanella and the late Jackie  Robinson, Jerry West, the general manager and former scoring star of the  Lakers, and Mando Ramos, two-time world lightweight boxing champion.  </P> <P> Also present for induction into the Circle of Excellence were the players from  the Eastview All-Stars Little League who went to the Little League World Series  this year. The team was widely publicized because of Victoria Brucker, the  first girl to start on a team vying for the title.  </P> <P> Campanella, West and Ramos implored that the youngsters stay off drugs and work  hard for their dreams.  </P> <P> Jackie Robinson's posthumous award was accepted by his brother, Mack Robinson,  a silver medalist in the 1936 Olympics. Robinson recounted his brother's career  and thanked the committee for remembering the ballplayer who pioneered the  integration of baseball.  </P> <P> "It's an inspiration for the children to remember Jackie," Robinson said.  </P> <P> West said, "Sports are granted a special place in America and the ability to  abuse it is just as great." He added that a lot of visible sports figures have  harmed themselves and the reputation of sports figures in general, but that he  was happy to give back what he could.  </P> <P> Campanella said that getting the award prompted him to look back on the  opportunities that had been given him and how today's youth has even greater  opportunities.  </P> <P> Ramos capped things by presenting the Sportswalk committee with a plaque from  the DARE anti-drug program.  </P> <P> The Eastview Little Leaguers were presented with baseballs signed by the  Dodgers as it was announced that they would be the first inductees of the  Circle of Excellence for Little League players in the San Pedro area.  </P> <P> The team will also have a bronze plaque placed at Daniels Field in San Pedro.  </P> <P> The Sportswalk was created in 1978 as part of the Beacon Street revitalization  in San Pedro. It is set up to honor prominent athletes from all sports. Some of  the past inductees include Wilt Chamberlain, John Wooden and Jackie  Joyner-Kersee. The four inductees this year bring the total to 43.  </P> <P> Bronze plaques are placed along Beacon Street with the honorees' name and a  symbol to depict the sport they played. They are selected by a committee of  sports media and civic leaders.  </P> <P> Ray Martinez was also honored as the winner of the Trani Sportswalk award,  which honors people who have made great contributions to area sports.  </P></p>

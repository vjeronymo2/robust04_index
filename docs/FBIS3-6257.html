Ozawa told a group of reporters in the Diet that it would be  difficult because he has not made any preparations for the trip.  His U.S. visit was believed to be a troubleshooting mission to  find a breakthrough in the strained Japan-U.S. trade ties.    Secretary general of the coalition's primary bloc Shinseito  and a close associate of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Ozawa  initially considered going to Washington on March 21 at the  request of the National Press Club to deliver a speech.    Ozawa, however, had eyed using the opportunity to meet  officials in the administration of President Bill Clinton and  congressional leaders to work out difficulties that hampered the  development of bilateral economic ties following the failure of  the "framework" trade talks last month, political sources said.  Hosokawa and Clinton failed to reach agreement in the talks  aimed at opening up Japan's market to U.S. goods and reducing  its huge trade surplus.    On the possibility of visiting the U.S. in the future, Ozawa  said he would consider going after the intense media speculation  over the trip has died down.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Safe haven for Moslems IN THE spring of last year western governments were in a quandary about Iraq. They did not like what was going on there, but were fearful of the consequences of doing anything about it, and tried to escape doing so by disclaiming any responsibility for the Kurdish uprising. But they found they had misjudged public opinion and moved sharply into a different gear. Troops were sent in, President Saddam Hussein withdrew his forces, and a 'safe haven' was established in which the Kurds could return to their homes. We may now be close to a point where something similar will happen over Bosnia. Public opinion in Britain has been aroused by the Home Office's mishandling of an attempt by a British charity to bring a small group of 183 refugees to Britain. By saying that these particular refugees are no different from 2m other displaced people in former Yugoslavia, Mr John Major has simply highlighted the scale of the problem, and the inadequacy of Britain's response. His government argues, rightly, that accepting those 2m people in foreign countries would not be the right solution to the problem. It would amount to validating the odious Serb tactic of 'ethnic cleansing', that is, mass expulsion. They should, where possible, be enabled to return to their homes, or at least resettled in their own country. Britain claims that, through its small contingent in the UN force in Bosnia, it is making a contribution at least as important as is Germany by taking larger numbers of refugees. Far better to feed and protect the people on the spot than to evacuate them hundreds or thousands of miles from their homes. Intervention force Yes, but the UN force is neither large enough nor adequately equipped or mandated for the task. It is getting food through intermittently to Sarajevo and other beleaguered cities, but not in large enough quantities to avert the prospect of tens of thousands dying of cold and starvation within the next few weeks. And even if people are fed, they cannot be expected to stay in their homes under constant shelling. If the war is to be stopped on any other basis than acceptance of Serbian victory and removal of most of the Moslem population, a much larger intervention force is needed, with a clear mandate to secure a 'safe haven' for that population, as was done for the Kurds last year. Legally such a move is less problematic than it was in Iraq, because it does not involve overriding state sovereignty. The Bosnian government, internationally recognised as sovereign, has been calling for military intervention for months. Actively opposed The practical objections are of course more serious. The operation might well be actively opposed by Serb forces. Neither its outcome nor its duration could be guaranteed. The objective could not be the liberation or conquest of all Bosnia, since most of the Serb community (comprising roughly one-third of the population) must be presumed to be hostile. It could only be to secure a sufficient area for the Moslem population to live in safety, and to put them in a position from which they would have some hope of negotiating an equitable political settlement with the other two communities. It would require an explicit mandate from the UN Security Council, backed up by tighter enforcement of sanctions to choke off Serbian aid to the Bosnian Serb forces. The intervening force could be supplied by Nato or the Western European Union, with the US providing air cover and logistical support even if it does not commit ground troops. Western governments are rightly cautious about embarking on such an enterprise. But they have to face up to the consequences of not doing so: acceptance in EC countries of most of the 2m already displaced and probably many more yet-to-be-displaced persons, with much more bitter arguments about the share each country should take; a wave of similar conflicts elsewhere in central Europe and the former Soviet Union, as ethnic cleansing is seen to be the effective way to deal with unwanted minorities; and a wave of anti-European anger throughout the Moslem world, where it is already universally believed that the Bosnians are being left to their fate only because they are Moslems.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Scottish utility in Dover contract HYDRO-ELECTRIC, the Scottish electricity company, yesterday announced an innovative deal to sell power directly to Dover Harbour Board from a combined heat and power plant. The utility is to lay a cable across Dover between the Pounds 7.25m plant which it is building with Arjo Wiggins, the paper maker, and the harbour. The plant is Hydro-Electric's first outside Scotland. Dover Harbour Board has signed a 10-year contract to take surplus electricity from the mill for the port's eastern docks. Hydro-Electric intends to sell any remaining power to Seeboard, the local electricity company. Mr David Sigsworth, head of energy trading, said he believed it would be the first time an electricity company operating outside its area had laid a cable from a CHP plant across a town, avoiding use of the local distribution network. He said another unusual feature of the plan was that Arjo would avoid paying the nuclear levy on its share of the electricity from the project. Usually a company is exempt only if it takes more than 51 per cent of the power from a combined heat and power plant. The exemption has been allowed because the 9MW plant has two installations, one owned by Hydro and the other by Arjo, so the 51 per cent rule applies to only half the plant. The plant is expected to become fully operational in April next year. It has been designed to increase efficiency, improve environmental impact and reduce costs at the paper mill and will enable Hydro to sell more power outside its core area.</p>

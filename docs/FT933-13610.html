			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Bonn threatens to cancel air accord MR Matthias Wissmann, German transport minister, said yesterday Bonn would cancel a 1955 air agreement with the US unless more access was granted to German carriers, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Mr Wissmann called on the US government to renew efforts toward 'a fairer agreement'. He said Germany would otherwise cancel the existing agreement by September 15. Mr Wissmann said on German television last night that the 1955 air traffic agreement 'placed disadvantages on German carriers'. He added that Lufthansa, the loss-making national carrier, was continuing to lose money on North Atlantic routes as a result. Washington and Bonn have been in negotiations for more than a year, without reaching agreement, on a new air traffic agreement to replace the existing one, which is widely perceived in Germany as a relic of the post-second world war occupation. Negotiations broke down earlier this year and an interim agreement is being used by both countries. Mr Wissmann said the interim agreement would continue to be valid if Germany went ahead with the cancellation but that the US would be forced to open new talks.</p>

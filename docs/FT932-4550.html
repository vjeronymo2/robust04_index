			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Swiss ease rules on finance houses THE Swiss authorities have eased conditions under which foreign controlled securities houses can participate in Swiss franc bond underwriting syndicates, apparently with a view to stemming any further contraction of Japanese securities company offices in Zurich, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Under a 1989 order, all Swiss-domiciled securities companies wishing to participate in syndicates had to convert themselves into banks by the end of last year. So far, 30 Japanese houses have become banks, but eight remain as finance houses. Last year, three Japanese securities companies closed their Zurich offices partly in response to troubles at home, partly because a much reduced level of Japan-related business in Switzerland undermined the case for converting themselves into banks. However, in the meantime, the Swiss government opened syndicate membership to all European-domiciled banks. Since April, only the lead manager of a syndicate has to be Swiss-based. That left foreign controlled securities houses in Switzerland at a disadvantage to their affiliated banks elsewhere in Europe. The Swiss financial authorities, meeting their Japanese counterparts, acknowledged the anomaly and agreed to be 'very flexible'.</p>

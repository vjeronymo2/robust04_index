			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Many London hospital services face axe A SERIES of reviews ordered by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is about to recommend widespread closures of specialist hospital services in London. The six reviews of the allocation of specialist services in London are also about to propose several transfers of facilities to areas of population growth outside the capital. An unexpected consequence of the reviews, which came after the Tomlinson report into London healthcare, is that they could undermine the financial stability of successful hospitals identified for survival by Tomlinson. St Mary's, Paddington - one of the capital's most financially viable teaching hospitals - stands to lose 10 per cent of its annual income if the government accepts a recommendation that its cardiac surgery and renal transplant facilities close. Mrs Bottomley will receive the final recommendations of the review teams - which have examined the provision of cancer, renal, neurosciences, plastic surgery and burns, cardiac and children's services - next week. But confidential briefings of the review teams' overall thinking, given this week to senior managers and medical school academics, indicate that there will be radical restructuring of specialist services around fewer, bigger units. The inquiry concluded that the 14 inner London hospitals providing specialist cardiac services should be reduced to five, with a new cardiac centre located at Brighton. A similar reduction in neuroscience services is proposed, with some of the capital's surplus specialist capacity transferring to Guildford. The survival chances of Charing Cross hospital, one of those threatened with closure after the Tomlinson report, have risen as a result of the reviews, which envisage retaining it as a specialist centre. Other inner London teaching hospitals likely to emerge from the reviews with a strong range of specialist services are the combined Guy's-St Thomas'; St George's; the Royal London and University College. The review teams are expected, however, to support the removal of specialist services from St Bartholomew's hospital in the City, another of those recommended for closure in the Tomlinson report. This would make it increasingly probable that St Bartholomew's would be fully amalgamated with the Royal London on the latter's East End site. There is general acceptance that London's many scattered specialist services need rationalisation, but some of the specific recommendations will cause anger and alarm. Staff at St Mary's reacted with dismay yesterday to the proposed loss of specialist activities. The Tomlinson report concluded that St Mary's ranked 'fairly low' on a vulnerability list of London hospitals and had a stable financial position. But the review recommendations would lead to the loss of Pounds 10m from its Pounds 100m annual income. Lord Glenarthur, chairman of the St Mary's Trust, said: 'This hospital has worked hard to become viable and is a good example of the fact that the NHS reforms are working. But instead of rewarding success, we are apparently now being told to try to walk on one leg.'</p>

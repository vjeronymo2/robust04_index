			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT'S PARTY DEFEATED IN ECUADOR  </P> <P> Voters dealt center-left President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos a political defeat in  legislative elections Sunday, giving his rightist opposition potential control  of Congress, according to early unofficial returns.  </P> <P> The victory by opposition parties is likely to bring an end to the political  calm that has marked this small Andean nation in the last several years.  </P> <P> The conservative Social Christian Party of former President Leon Febres Cordero  gained 11 seats and will control 18 seats in the 72-member unicameral Congress.  The projections showed Borja's Democratic Left party losing half of its 30  seats.  </P> <P> The elections are seen as a referendum on the first two years of Borja's  four-year term in office. His popularity has been undermined by his failure to  keep a campaign promise to reduce inflation from more than 50% last year to  25%.  </P></p>

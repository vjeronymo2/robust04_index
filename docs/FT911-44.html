			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: UK markets Towards the bottom of the roller-coaster, the ride gets bumpy. If the UK is indeed reaching the trough of the recession, yesterday's bumps are easy to understand. The retailing and consumer credit figures, Wall Street, the outlook for UK interest rates - all have a stomach-jolting feel about them. More jolts ahead: the last two days of the week will bring grim economic figures (because they are backward-looking) and the Monmouth by-election result. The Fed, though, shows every sign of taking the US recession seriously; if that leads to a further easing after today's meeting, Wall Street's reaction could help London recover its poise, for a day or so at least.</p>

			<p>Remarks   <F P=102>   PA2304030194 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal  A in Spanish 0000 GMT 23 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA2304030194 </F> <F P=104>  Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal  A </F>  <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Reaction from the country's political circles to the  outrageous hearing held by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on  Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations were not long  in coming. Several presidential candidates, who according to  Gabriel Taboada are in the pay of drug traffickers, had this to  say today. [begin recording]    Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party presidential  candidate: I am concerned to see that the attempt to  besmirch Colombia's name continues. When a person makes  accusations, he should name names. That is what the country  needs. If he has names, let him say so. It is important that  the country know if there is drug money in the political  campaigns. The information must come out. As far as I am  concerned, I am absolutely certain there is no drug money. I  have just given my records to the Overseer of the National  Treasury, to the National Electoral Council, and to the  Colombian people. People cannot continue making these  accusations.    Antonio Navarro Wolff, presidential candidate for 19  April Movement Democratic Alliance: I say categorically  that Antonio Navarro and Jesus Pinacue have not received a penny  from drug traffickers for their campaign. I am not familiar  with the rest of Mr. Taboada's statement, and it is hard to  comment on something with which I am unfamiliar.    Enrique Parejo, presidential candidate of the National  Democratic Alternative: Some of what was said reflects what  many Colombians have been saying. There is drug money in the  political campaigns, and there has been in the past. Drug money  has infiltrated institutions. That is a fact, and I have  denounced it. [end recording]    The government and the Prosecutor General's Office commented  on the matter. [begin recording]    Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Sintura:  Senator Kerry, respect Colombian justice and do not get too  close to rogues.    Defense Minister Rafael Pardo: Those remarks  cannot be taken seriously. They reflect an ill-intended  distortion to harm a country that has suffered a great deal from  drug trafficking. It is not justified to give credence to  someone who has no information and no way to get any and whose  charges are not serious. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> C&amp;S SET TO BATTLE NCNB TAKEOVER  </P> <P> Two Southeastern banking giants are girding for a long battle as North  Carolina-based NCNB Corp. stands by its $2.4-billion hostile takeover bid for  Georgia-based Citizens &amp; Southern Corp.  </P> <P> Citizens, a $21-billion bank holding company based in Atlanta, has rejected the  NCNB bid and invoked Georgia's anti-takeover law. It has also hired an array of  legal experts and financial advisers.  </P> <P> However, Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB, the $50-billion banking behemoth of the  growing Southeast region, has reiterated its intention to carry out a deal that  would be among the biggest mergers in American banking history and create the  nation's sixth largest bank.  </P> <P> NCNB operates in seven Southern states and manages assets of more than $50  billion. Its own assets totaled $29.85 billion at the end of 1988, but it also  manages $25.6 billion in assets that belonged to Dallas-based First  RepublicBank, of which it bought a 20% interest last summer and renamed NCNB  Texas.  </P> <P> Citizens' spokesman Scott Screedon, said Georgia regulators would likely oppose  the proposed takeover "because of the possibility that Georgia assets may be  expected to be shifted to Texas" to help NCNB fulfill its commitment to revive  First RepublicBank.  </P></p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Sins of commission exact a price: A long dispute over payments to intermediaries in the financial services industry THE 'sins of commission' came back to haunt the UK's financial services industry yesterday. Two reports issued yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading conclude that consumers know too little about the financial products they buy to choose them wisely and that commissions paid to sales agents distort those choices. Most financial intermediaries are paid by commission for each sale they make. The level of commission varies substantially between products and between companies. This report revives a long-running dispute within the industry and raises the question of whether self-regulation is workable for the industry. Regulation has been controversial ever since the Financial Services Act (FSA) became law in 1988, but the publication at the end of last month of the conclusions of the Securities and Investments Board's 13-month retail investment review was supposed to put the issue to rest. The OFT's reports attack SIB's conclusions on commission disclosure - forcing intermediaries to disclose what they have been paid by product providers - but they also throw into question the scope of the entire regulatory regime. Mr Jeremy Mitchell, a former director of the National Consumer Council and director of consumer affairs at the OFT, and Ms Helena Wiesner, a director of Lautro, the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Office, produced independent reports. They agreed on several points. Levels of commission may influence the advice of salesmen. That is illustrated by growth in the sale of endowment mortgages, which pay a commission not available for standard repayment mortgages. In 1970, endowments accounted for 6.7 per cent of mortgages and repayments for 88 per cent. In 1990, endowments took 75 per cent of mortgages and repayments only 20 per cent. Endowments are less flexible and often more expensive than their repayment counterparts, according to Ms Wiener, who believes the high rate of surrender of such policies gives 'considerable grounds for concern'. The drive by life companies to secure sales outlets, particularly with building societies, has pushed up commission levels. 'Tied agency' deals, in which a building society sells only the products of one life office, have proved very popular, and only two large building societies, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Yorkshire, remain independent. According to Ms Wiesner's report, Halifax building society, which is tied to Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, received Pounds 162m in commission during 1990 - 16 per cent of income and 27 per cent of profits. Since 1989, the share taken by commission from a 10-year endowment policy has risen by 27 per cent for independents and 47 per cent for tied agents. According to Lautro's last commission survey, the highest commission paid on a Pounds 50-a-month, 25-year endowment policy at a tied agent was Pounds 642  -more than the whole first year's premiums. High turnover of sales staff may have implications for their training and competence. On average, 38 per cent of new sales recruits to life insurance companies leave within a year and 54 per cent leave within two. One office, Provident Mutual, loses 90 per cent of recruits within two years. Ms Wiesner says a company representative leaving a company may encourage people he or she has advised to surrender their policies and invest with a new company. SIB decided not to force intermediaries to disclose their commissions because direct sales forces and tied agents could not be made to do the same. That would put independents at a disadvantage as SIB forces independents to disclose their commissions, if asked, once a sale has been completed. Ms Wiesner rejects that argument, saying independent advice is worth paying for, and that consumers should know the true price. The OFT reports agree with SIB in one area. Sir David Walker, outgoing chairman of SIB, called the scope of regulation under the FSA into question. He pointed out that insurance products come under one regime, but building society accounts, which most consumers regard as closely comparable, are regulated by another - the Building Societies Commission. Mr Mitchell pointed to the levels of compensation a consumer could expect for different investments. An investor claiming compensation on an investment of Pounds 60,000 could expect a maximum of Pounds 60,000 if the investment were covered by the Law Society or the Policyholders' Protection Act, but only Pounds 18,000 for a building society deposit, and Pounds 15,000 for a bank deposit.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Vukolov] </F>   [Text] Stockholm June 6 TASS -- "Good prospects are opening  up for the development and deepening of traditional  Russo-Swedish relations in agriculture. We are interested in  the conclusion of a Russo-Swedish agreement on agricultural  cooperation," Russian Vice- Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha told  ITAR-TASS, summing up the results of a Russian delegation's  visit to Sweden at the invitation of the Swedish Government.    "Longstanding and stable relations exist between the two  countries in the field of seed-farming, in joint ventures with  the "Tetra-Laval" concern to produce machines for the food  industry, and in several other domains. The current reforms in  the Russian countryside open up new opportunities for promoting  Russo-Swedish interaction. We want to attract Swedish  investments to Russian agriculture, to the creation of farm  banks and model farms, which could serve as training centres for  private farming in Russia.    "From this point of view, the delegation's visit to Sweden,  which included talks with Agriculture Minister Carl Erich Ulsson  and visits to Swedish farms and farm products processing  enterprises, were most useful and instructive. We have  acquainted ourselves with a really highly efficient agriculture,  based on private land ownership and personal incentives. At the  same time, we saw that in addition to these important factors,  contributing to effective farming, the agricultural producers  needed state backing, rendered through subsidies, which are  typical for Sweden. We are now setting up a wholesale market in  Russia, which presupposes direct contacts between producers and  consumers. This is typical for the West, including the  Scandinavian countries. I believe these are the main ways to  develop Russian agriculture, too" Zaveryukha stressed.    Today, the Russian delegation is to fly to Denmark, where it  will continue to study Scandinavian agriculture.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Vodopija: "A Lecture From Sarajevo"] </F>   [Text] I have done everything I could, I have done my  best, U.S. President Bill Clinton said, cornered by unpleasant  questions by CNN's top journalist, Christiane Amanpour from  Sarajevo. I did expect to be given lectures from Sarajevo...  because this poor woman has seen the horrors of that war. She  is wonderful and has done a great favor to the entire world and  I do not reproach her for being angry, Clinton said at the end  of his 90-minute confrontation with CNN reporters in Sarajevo,  Jerusalem, Seoul, Johannesburg, and the Carter Center in Atlanta  with some eminent journalists from all over the world. Clinton  left a medium impression: His speech was full of cliches, two  studios remarked that he dealt insufficiently with specific and  concrete issues, he was humorous twice, made no major gaffes  (Wolf Blitzer of CNN), and was better with domestic topics such  as trade with Japan or Latin America than with Bosnia (Ralph  Baker of CNN).    The U.S. President showed that U.S. foreign policy has been  torn apart into various sides, that it begins much but completes  little, and that it does not use same criteria for similar  crises in the world. Clinton pointed out the three priorities  of U.S. foreign policy: security, economic progress, and  democracy. Haiti was exhausted as the first topic of the  program and then came Bosnia. Belgrade Television Journalist  Miodrag Ilic, who popped up from somewhere, wanted to know  whether the United States will change its strategy toward Bosnia  and treat the warring sides equally instead of "satanizing the  Serbs through the media" and when the sanctions on Serbia will  be lifted. Unlike the generalized answers that he gave to the  majority of other questions, Clinton was surprisingly concrete.  The short answer was as follows: "No," the U.S. President  said, "at least as long as the negotiations are under way." He  openly said that the embargo on weapons for former Yugoslavia  had become a joke, as it gave a huge strategic advantage to the  Serbs and their heavy artillery and made ethnic cleansing easier.    With her questions, Christiane Amanpour was beating Clinton  down. She asked why he, as the leader of the free world, needed  so long to articulate his policy toward Bosnia, why the West and  the United States were hostages to those with a clear policy  (the Bosnian Serbs), why he, with his vacillating policy, was  setting a dangerous precedent that may make Kim Il-song and  similar potentates take him less seriously than he would like.  A frustrated Clinton provided a nervous and weak reply, but he  nevertheless managed somehow to smoothe out the dispute with  Christiane. In an extensive excuse for vacillating about  Bosnian problem, Clinton said something that could be of  interest to Croatia as well. In the case of Bosnia, we have no  control over the situation, we only have influence, the U.S.  President said.    During his speech Clinton mentioned Croatia only once and  that was only in passing, while speaking about Bosnia. However,  it is important to be aware of the part about control in this  case too. Namely, somebody who controls a certain territory has  control and the U.S. influence can, albeit does not have to, be  a weight that will help him extend his control to those  territories that he temporarily loses. This is important so  that one can bring down to earth the people who thought that if  things get even worse, the U.S. cavalry will invariably ride in  to help. It might come in the form of strong diplomatic or  military support, but not to aid the weak, but to help the  strong.    Another link with Croatia can be discerned in Clinton's  reply  to a Palestinian journalist's question concerning help for the  Palestinians in the occupied territories. Two billion dollars  have already been waiting and the U.S. Administration will  prompt Jewish and Arab lobbies in the United States to invest  private capital the moment they see the peace is being  respected. The message to Croatia would read as follows:  Consistent respect for the Washington Agreement and Croatia's  curbing the Herzeg-Bosnian practice of "hitting the brakes" will  start opening the door to foreign capital and touch off the  magic suggestion by the U.S. Administration to emigre and other  capital in the United States: Croatia is no longer a region of  risk. Final peace and agreement on the status of the occupied  territories will let Croatia into the world. Until then, there  will be that small consolation in the form of the recent first  installment of the $10-million U.S. loan to Croatia, which was  really meant to stimulate U.S. cotton producers to sell their  surplus to Croatia.    And there is a third, albeit not the least important matter.  Where were the Croatian journalists in Atlanta? Was somebody  from Croatian Radio and Television [HRT] there, but not invited  to speak? Or was nobody there because they were not invited?  Or were they invited, but did not accept? Only CNN and HRT  know the answer. Only it has happened again that journalists  sent into the world Serbian deceptions without a Croatian reply.</p>

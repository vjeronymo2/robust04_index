			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: SAS forecasts full-year profit Scandinavian Airlines System said yesterday it was on course for its first profit in five years following a dramatic improvement in its first-quarter figures. Although the airline remained in the red, pre-tax losses fell to SKr101m (Dollars 13.07m) from SKr1.53bn. The result reflected higher traffic volumes, cost-cutting, exchange gains and lower interest costs. The airline expects the improvement to continue, despite intense competition, as the second and third quarters are traditionally stronger than the first. Confidence is based on an improving traffic trend and the impact of tough restructuring. First-quarter group revenues were SKr8.99bn, compared with SKr8.67bn, while operating losses after depreciation were cut to SKr84m from SKr651m. All business units showed better results, but the improvement was felt most in the core flying operations. Traffic was 5 per cent higher and yields were up 3 per cent. There was also a much better financial performance. The stronger krona produced a SKr200m unrealised exchange gain, compared with a SKr500m loss in the first quarter of 1993. Interest costs fell to SKr194m from SKr465m due to lower interest rates and a SKr2bn reduction in net debt since the start of the year.</p>

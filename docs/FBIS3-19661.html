			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Isaias Gomes Teixeira: "The Dance of the </F> Generals"]    [Excerpts] Following the appointment of Admiral Fuzeta da  Ponte as chief of the Armed Forces General Staff (CEMFGA), the  Army, Navy, and Air Force are planning various changes in their  top leadership during March.    The Air Force is the only branch of the service where  changes  are practically defined. General Baptista Pereira, who was its  inspector general for the last five years, will leave midmonth  for the Azores to assume the command of that autonomous region,  replacing Admiral Malheiro Garcia.    Baptista Pereira's departure will make possible a promotion  in the generals' ranks. According to available information,  Brigadier General Vasques Osorio will be chosen by the Air Force  Superior Council to receive a third star. To replace Baptista  Pereira, General Mendes Dias will reportedly appoint Evandro do  Amaral, presently in charge of the Air Force  Logistic-Administrative Command (CLAFA). This appointment stems  from the fact that Evandro is one of the generals with the most  seniority, a prerequisite for occupying the third-highest  position within the Air Force.    With Evandro do Amaral's appointment as inspector general,  the problem of his replacement arises. According to our sources,  Sergio Carrilho is best placed to become CLAFA chief, even if  the final decision has not yet been made. In fact, Carrilho has  an excellent technical preparation for the post. Secondly,  Mendes Dias's options are limited if he does not wish to cause a  veritable revolution in the top leadership, for the following  reasons:    General Alvarenga Santos, presently deputy CEMFGA in charge  of operations, has already been named to head the Portuguese  military mission to NATO, and is thus out of the running. So is  Aleixo Corbal, in charge of Air Force personnel, since he is a  past CLAFA chief. Another possibility would be Vaz Afonso.  However, this general has been director of the Air Force  Institute for Higher Studies for less than a year and could not  be transferred again.    Under these circumstances, Sergio Carrilho appears to be the  best solution, all the more so because the issue of his own  replacement as head of the Air Force Operational Command (COFA)  -- one of the best posts in this branch of the service -- is  easy to solve. Brig. Gen. Vasques Osorio, who should get his  third star with the departure of Baptista Pereira, would be a  natural replacement for Sergio Carrilho.    As far as the Navy is concerned, important changes are  expected during the course of this month, first because it has  lacked a general staff chief, and second because there are four  vice admiral positions waiting to be filled. Until yesterday  afternoon, the government had not decided which of three  officers (Machado da Silva, Ribeiro Pacheco, and Carmo Duro)  will succeed Fuzeta da Ponte as Navy chief. According to our  sources, the decision will be made next week. Meanwhile, Admiral  Machado da Silva, deputy chief of the Navy general staff, is  reportedly out of the running, the reason being the rather  inflexible image he projects. Above all a military man, Machado  da Silva has great difficulty adapting himself to the political  game that the relationship between military chiefs and the  Ministry of Defense represents.    A factor that may influence the government's choice is Adm.  Fuzeta da Ponte's opinion. As principal adviser to Minister of  Defense Fernando Nogueira, Fuzeta reportedly has expressed a  preference for Carmo Duro. [passage omitted]    However, despite Carmo Duro's strong support within and  without the Navy, his appointment may cause important changes  that do not figure in the government's plans. According to  information, if Carmo Duro becomes the next Navy general staff  chief, four promotions to vice admiral rank ought to take place,  a figure considered excessive at a time when the Ministry of  Defense's slogan is "redimensioning."    Finally, the Army is also preparing for important changes.  The Army Superior Council met for a whole day to advise  Cerqueira Rocha about the general he should indicate to Fuzeta  da Ponte for the presidency of the Supreme Military Tribunal.  Joao Almeida Bruno was the name that attracted the largest  consensus.    With regard to other appointments, it seems increasingly  certain that General Espirito Santo, present chief of the  Portuguese mission to NATO, will take over the Army's  operational command.</p>

This was stated at a news conference in Prague today by  Zoran  Thaler, the chairman of the Slovenian Parliament's Foreign  Committee, who is heading a delegation of this committee on a  two-day visit to the Czech Republic.    Too much has been achieved in Bosnia by military means so  now  it will be difficult to approach the solution merely in a  political way, he stressed.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nortel management reorganised NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telephone equipment maker, is reshuffling its international management team following the departure of Mr Paul Stern, the former chairman. Mr Jean Monty, who took over from Mr Stern as president and chief executive in spring, has promoted several long-serving officers to top strategic positions. Analysts say this is only the first wave of a broad management restructuring. More changes are due shortly as Nortel moves to shore up its worldwide utility customer base, rebuild labour relations, and restore investor confidence. The group stock has fallen about 20 per cent in heavy trading on North American exchanges following Mr Monty's warning a week ago that the company would report a second-quarter loss after special charges. The leading appointments are: Mr Roy Merrills, head of the US subsidiary, becomes executive vice-president of a new Americas division and responsible for all marketing in North and South America and the Caribbean. Mr Gedas Sakus, now head of the Canadian subsidiary, will head switching equipment operations worldwide, in charge of both manufacturing and product development. He replaces Mr Alan Lutz. Mr James Long, now head of the Asia-Pacific subsidiary in Tokyo, becomes executive vice-president of a new division responsible for Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</p>

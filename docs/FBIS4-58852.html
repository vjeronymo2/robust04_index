			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement on Voice of the Arabs Radio today,  Dr. 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Dali, member of the politburo of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] and secretary of the YSP Central  Committee, called for the need to stop the fighting first and  then to separate the combatants. He stressed to Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak that he was convinced of the importance  of giving the Arab League and the Arab brothers latitude for  finding a solution to the Yemeni crisis. It is worth mentioning  that Brother Dr. al-Dali has delivered a number of letters from  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the deputy chairman of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the YSP Central  Committee, to his brother leaders of fraternal Arab states.</p>

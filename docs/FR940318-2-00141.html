			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The new-formula allocation of $16,801,818 is based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of initial placements in each county during CY 1983_September 30, 1993. Welfare dependency rates were not used as a factor in this portion of the formula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Proposed Allocations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Table 1 lists the participating counties, the number of placements in each county during CY 1983_September 30, 1993, the amount of each county's proposed allocation which is based on the old formula, the amount of each county's allocation which is based on the new formula, and the county's total proposed allocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Table 1 shows an amount for each county, the Director proposes, in the case of a State which contains more than one qualified county, to continue to permit the State to determine (in accordance with the requirements set forth in this notice) the appropriate allocation of the State's targeted assistance award among the qualified counties in the State. If a State chooses to make allocations which are different from the notice, the State, as in the FY 1993 TAP, would be responsible for determining an appropriate and equitable basis for allocating the funds among the qualified counties in the State and for including in its application a description of this allocation basis, the data to be used, and the allocation proposed for each county.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 2 provides State totals for the proposed county allocations set forth in Table 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 3 indicates the areas that each participating county represents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

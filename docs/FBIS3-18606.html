The time has  come to change." This was one of the first statements made by  Secretary of State Warren Christopher after Clinton came to the  White House. His remarks reflected the thinking of the  President, who was convinced that since the end of the Cold War  economic rivalry has taken the place of the ideological kind in  relations between nations.    Indeed, in his international strategy Clinton has been as  vague and contradictory on geopolitical problems as he has been  steadfast and resolute on economic matters. Thus, while  American foreign policy still lacks a guiding principle and a  coherent sense of direction., U.S. international economic policy  is regulated by a very precise premise: The world, Clinton  says, has now entered the era of "the globalization of the  economy" and America must adapt its conduct to this fact.    Trade policy thus becomes an essential component of foreign  policy and represents the point of contact between domestic  economic development and expansion in the foreign markets.  These two issues, the President stresses, cannot be separated  but must be viewed from the same angle. The latest examples of  this change of course in America's trade strategy came with  Clinton's personal intervention to guarantee the U.S.  aeronautics industry a giant $6 billion order from Saudi Arabia  and his breaking off of the negotiations with Japan following  the threat of economic reprisals.    Although these issues are different in nature, they have in  common the "aggressiveness" of the White House, which contrasts  with the passive line pursued by previous Washington  governments. The stakes were high with Saudi Arabia -- a $6  billion order to renew the entire Saudi commercial fleet (50  aircraft). The choice was between the offers submitted by two  giants of the American aeronautical industry, McDonnell and  Boeing, and the European Airbus consortium.    Clinton intervened personally with King Fahd to ensure that  the order went to the American firms, pointing out to the Saudi  monarch that it was only Washington's intervention that saved  his country from Iraq's aggression. The outcome is that this  giant order will save the jobs of tens of thousands of people  and will have positive repercussions on many activities  connected with the aeronautics industry.    To those who accuse him of having violated the principles of  free trade, Clinton has been able to reply that he blocked a  similar move by French President Francois Mitterrand in favor of  the Airbus and that in any case the time had come for the United  States to defend its industries by adopting the practices of  intervention that its competitors have been using for some time.    The issue of the trade negotiations with Japan is more  complex. The negotiations to reduce the growing American trade  deficit with Japan have been proceeding inconclusively for some  20 years, with agreements in principle not followed by concrete  implementation. Meanwhile, the annual trade deficit with Tokyo  has reached the unprecedented figure of $60 billion.    At his recent meeting in Washington with new Japanese  Premier  Hosokawa, Clinton changed tactic. Instead of being satisfied  with vague and ambiguous agreements, like his predecessors, he  preferred to break off the negotiations. No agreement, he said,  is better than a merely artificial and cosmetic agreement.    The clash occurred over America's demand to set numerical  levels for market shares for American products in the various  sectors of the Japanese economy, which Hosokawa rejected.  Unless he makes some concessions within the next month, Clinton  reserves the right to adopt reprisals through the imposition of  duties and other measures against Japanese products.    Where will this trial of strength lead? There is obviously a  chance that it will give rise to an outright trade war, but few  people believe in such a development, which would be damaging to  both countries and would disrupt the entire world economic  outlook. The expectation, therefore, is that a compromise will  be reached whereby Japan will allow its market to be opened up  more to American industries, while, however, avoiding the rigid  "numerical quantification" sought by Washington.    Clinton's aggressive strategy is criticized in America by  those who perceive in it the abandonment of the principles of  free trade and a return to protectionism, albeit in disguised  forms. The White House's reply is that to raise the issue in  such terms means to fail to understand the fact that the debate  now is not between the proponents of free trade and the  protectionists, but between the theory of absolute free trade  and that of the so-called cautious activism propounded by the  head of the President's economic advisers, Laura Tyson, which  envisages the possibility of limited interventions designed to  support home industries abroad. The difference, Washington  stresses, lies in the fact that, whereas protectionism entails  the closure of the American market to foreign competition, thus  reflecting the concept of a "closed economy," "cautious  activism," on the contrary, aims to open up foreign markets to  American products, thus reflecting the current expansive  dynamism of the U.S. economy.    This must be the starting point for understanding the  significance of the commercial turnabout. A year ago, in the  midst of the election campaign, Clinton lamented the "economic  and technological" decline of the United States with respect to  Europe and Japan. Now he himself admits that the situation has  been completely reversed. It is not just that the increasingly  solid pace of the American recovery contrasts with the  continuing recession in Europe and Japan, but also the  increasing U.S. successes in the technological field. The  structural renewal of the automobile industry has enabled  Detroit's big three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) to make  exceptional increases in their profits, while the automobile  industries in both Japan and Europe -- once feared rivals -- are  now in a deep crisis. Furthermore, the United States has  regained its primacy in the semiconductors field, and all its  electronics and computer technology sectors are advancing more  rapidly than any of their competitors.    Clinton does not conceal the fact that his aim is to  increase  America's international competitiveness, especially in the high  technology sector, through cooperation between government and  private industry. This approach, which envisages a number of  incentives for investment in technology and government  interventions in the international field, does not, the White  House stresses, conflict with the strengthening of free trade  already achieved through the NAFTA and GATT accords. The common  objective is to accelerate the creation of "open markets"  throughout the world economy, with the advantage of creating new  jobs in America and at the same time providing Europe and Japan  with a useful means of emerging from the recession.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Italy discusses bringing lira back into ERM A growing body of opinion in Italy is urging the government to bring the lira back inside the European exchange rate mechanism before the end of the year. The Berlusconi government has yet to take a position on the issue but is expected to make informal soundings with its EU partners at Monday's meeting of European finance ministers. Under the Maastricht Treaty timetable for the next stage of monetary union, EU governments must meet at the beginning of 1997 to consider which currencies have respected their parities over the previous two years. Thus under the current regime if Italy fails to rejoin by January, it would be technically excluded. The issue has been quietly discussed within the government, among the opposition and by business leaders for some six weeks. But it was highlighted last weekend by the public call to rejoin the ERM from both Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the head of Fiat, and Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the head of Olivetti. These captains of industry have since been followed by Mr Nino Andreatta, the economic spokesman for the Popular party and a former treasury and foreign minister, who put the case at its crudest this week: 'It's not a bad idea for a country like ours, which has an identity crisis every time someone talks of Italy ending up in the B league or the slow lane of Europe, to remind people of obligations undertaken and the need to respect them.' Yesterday Mr Luigi Grillo, deputy minister charge of the economy in the prime minister's office, went public and backed Mr Andreatta's logic adding: 'There are the conditions to consider a re-entry of the lira into the European monetary system.' The lira was forced to leave the ERM to float during 'black September' of 1992. From being L850 against the D-Mark it has of late come close to L1,040. With a 15 per cent fluctuation band now permitted, supporters of the return argue the lira is already under-valued and could seek to have a parity of L1,000 against the D-Mark. Until recently the French were strongly against Italy re-entering at such a parity, having enjoyed the benefits of a competitive devaluation of over 30 per cent. But Paris' resistance is reported to have softened as the French economy picks up, while in Brussels Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing EU president, favours the idea. Within the government Mr Antonio Martino, the foreign minister, is hostile. Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister and a key figure in any decision, is said to be still listening to different points of view. But the treasury is anxious to latch on to any signal that might encourage the markets to have more faith in the lira and permit domestic interest rates to fall.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Mr Clinton's trim There seems to be little that finance ministers meeting in the OECD can do except mark their forecasts down. While the OECD is particularly concerned at the downturn in Europe, it is not getting much help from the US whose recovery is clearly far from vigorous. Even yesterday's purchasing managers' index only looks good in the context of a particularly weak April reading. Given the revised US first quarter growth of only 0.9 per cent, estimates of growth for the year as a whole may have to be scaled back to between 2 and 2.5 per cent. It is difficult, though, to square these more modest expectations with continuing worries about inflation. A recovery led by productivity and investment should not be inherently inflationary. The effect on unemployment remains disappointing and, car sales apart, consumer demand is weak. Doubtless the Federal Reserve would act quickly if the May price data due next week again show upward pressure on inflation. But the greater risk must be that the recovery will continue to disappoint. That suggests a more positive climate for bonds than for equities, especially now President Clinton appears to be overcoming Senate opposition to his budget package. That the package is of necessity mildly deflationary adds to the sense of how little scope there is for concerted international action to revive the world economy. The temptation for some governments may be to go for increased protection as an alternative. Or something similar: like competitive devaluations.</p>

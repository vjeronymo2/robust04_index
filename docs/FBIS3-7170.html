In order to revive an excellent tradition of Sangkum Reas  Niyum [Sihanouk's former ruling party] of the 1950's and 1960's,  I will receive once a week the representatives of my respected  and beloved little people who wish to communicate to me any  serious problems or difficulties they experience in their  livelihood.    2. On 12 April 1994, from 0900 to 1200, at the Phoucheakni  Pavilion in the royal palace I will be happy to welcome the  representatives of my respected and beloved little people who  wish to relate to me five of their most serious problems.    3. I also understand and know that all my respected and  beloved little people are experiencing not only five problems in  their lives.

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: European banks expect returns on equity of 10% MOST senior European bank executives expect competition over the next decade to force down banks' annual returns on capital to an average of 10 per cent  -well below the level many have set as a target for their own banks. A survey of 65 executives has found that despite the number setting target returns on equity of at least 15 per cent, most privately think this is unsustainable. They believe mergers will be forced by competition and falling profits from corporate banking. Nearly a third of executives interviewed by the consultants Gemini Consulting and EFMA believed there would be a significant number of bank bankruptcies by the year 2005 as banks try to cut costs. Some 68 per cent believed only 15 to 20 significant European retail banks would remain. Mr Mark Tilden, a vice-president of Gemini Consulting, said the study had shown that executives were privately pessimistic about the industry and the erosion of lending margins caused by competition. 'They think there is a difficult period ahead,' he said. The executives, from 15 countries, were particularly doubtful about the future profitability of corporate banking. Some 78 per cent thought 'disintermediation' - the provision of their own financial services by big corporations - would continue to undermine bank profits. The chief effect of this process to date has been to reduce margins on corporate loans as large companies find it cheaper to issue their own securities than to borrow from banks. But executives also expected companies to provide other forms of banking services themselves. Some 88 per cent of executives thought that large corporations would provide their own cash management services, 67 per cent thought they would carry out foreign-exchange dealing, and 63 per cent thought they would provide their own medium- and long-term finance. About a quarter thought that fewer than 10 European banks would be undertaking corporate banking by 2005. Mr Tilden said that banks were already finding it hard to gain a role in corporate banking aside from offering to manage company risk through derivative products. Only 48 per cent of executives thought that corporate banking would be a significant contributor to profits at the end of the period. However, some bankers believed they would have to continue to offer loans to companies in order to attract other business. Executives mostly believed that the retreat from banks having retail branch networks in other countries would continue. Only 28 per cent thought that their own bank would have a significant retail banking presence in another country, given the competitive pressures. European Banking: A View to 2005.

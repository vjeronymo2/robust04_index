Is it knuckling under to  "Russian Hitler" Zhirinovskiy just in case? Is it permitting  the Kremlin to lay claim to being a great power, which is  something that it should resolutely counter? In the middle of  January, the Atlantic alliance offered the Central and East  European states a Partnership for Peace, which puts off full  membership in NATO until some indefinite time in the future.  The Partnership for Peace was also offered to Russia, so -- as  President Clinton justified it -- not to create "a new border  between East and West, which could prompt a confrontation in the  future." Since then, the charge of "appeasement" has been  appearing in the columns of the conservative press.    Appeasement? Until September 1938, it was a highly  respectable concept which described the goal of all diplomacy:  tranquility, satisfaction, and reconciliation. However, since  the Munich conference, at which Chamberlain and Daladier gave in  to the brutal pressure applied by Hitler and agreed to the  dismembering of Czechoslovakia, the concept has been a negative  one. Since that time, it has no longer stood for sound, but for  anxious reconciliation; not for the wise conclusion of  compromises, but for dishonorable capitulation; not moderate  compromise, but lily-livered conciliation.    Historical analogies are a lottery. Every situation is  different. It can be just as wrong to be blind with regard to  the lessons of Munich as it is to apply them blindly to the  wrong situation. The ability to recognize, compare, and  distinguish remains the most difficult aspect of the art of  statesmanship.    A long time ago, Hans J. Morgenthau, the doyen of the  subject  of international relations, produced an appropriate criterion  that is worth heeding. He wrote: "Appeasement is a corrupt  compromise policy. What is erroneous about it is that it  considers an imperialist policy to be a policy for maintaining  the status quo." Morgenthau preached that that would be fatal.  He also warned: "It would only be marginally less risky to  react to a policy that only seeks to achieve adjustments within  the existing state of affairs, as if it were an imperialist  policy."    Thus, the first question is: Are we going to write -- under  different circumstances -- 1938 once again?    The plain answer is no. Today, there is no one who  resolutely wants war, who wants war in the way that Hitler did  (his appetite for expansion was in no way whetted by Munich --  he wanted his war long before that). There is no one anywhere  who is being ruthlessly blackmailed with territorial demands.  Just as the European democracies in their weakness gave in to  Europe's dictators in the 1930's, today, the situation is  reversed, the point being to support the democrats in Russia in  order to prevent the emergence of a new dictator.    The next question is: Can a democratic Russia also pose a  threat to East Europe and even West Europe?    The straightforward answer is, of course, in principle it  can. Russia remains a great power simply by virtue of the area  it covers, its location in both Europe and Asia and its arsenal  of nuclear weapons. It was always unrealistic to believe that  it will withdraw from world politics as a eunuch state without  interests following the collapse of communism. Democracies also  have foreign policy interests, fears, and ambitions. They can  become uncomfortable and go off course, especially if they owe  their establishment to a total collapse, if they feel hurt, if  they imagine that they are "undefeated in the field," and if,  because of their amputation from the old state body, they suffer  from imagined pains that can only be eased with difficulty. A  new imperialism can easily develop on that kind of soil.    However, distinctions have to be made: between the  "internal" empire of the tsars and commissars that collapsed at  the end of 1991, and Stalin's "external empire," which collapsed  in 1990. More than just traces remain of the internal empire:  common structures, close economic ties, monetary policy ties,  and security interests. These links can only be separated from  each other with difficulty. It would even make practical sense  for some of those elements to be brought together again in a way  that would benefit all. When Yeltsin says that the CIS states  have realized that there are many problems that they cannot  solve by themselves, that without cooperating, they will not  survive by themselves, there is nothing threatening about that.    That Russia sees itself in a protective role with regard to  25 million Russians in the "the abroad near at hand" can only  with difficulty be immediately termed an expression of new  expansionism. If Hitler had only insisted that the rights of  the Sudeten Germans be respected, then no one could have leveled  any accusations against him. Russia has legitimate interests to  protect. The West can only demand that these interests be  protected with peaceful means and in accordance with the  principles of the CSCE charter, and that is all that it can  demand.    The situation with respect to the former external empire --  the former Warsaw Pact states and the Baltic republics that  Stalin brought back under the Russian yoke by force with the  assistance of Hitler -- is entirely different. No one can doubt  that Russia has interests there, but a kind of "Monroeski  Doctrine" that gives Moscow a dominant influence in that area is  unacceptable. That area is also the "abroad near at hand" for  the West. The West also has interests there. NATO has  abandoned shifting its alliance borders from the Oder to the  Bug, but the expectation underpinning that is that the great  power Russia will not act in a big power way there and throw its  weight about.    So far, there has been no reason to consider that  expectation  unjustified or unrealistic, and that also applies to the latest  statements made by [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev,  statements which require clarification. So far, the East  European states have been seeking to join NATO for very  different and egoistical reasons, reasons that have nothing to  do with the actual degree of threat. That made it easy for NATO  to offer the Partnership for Peace as an interim solution. It  offers two chances. Either Russia becomes drawn into it, which  makes full membership superfluous or means membership could be  extended to Russia too. Or, if Russia displays a dangerous new  expansionist impulse, then a new clear demarcation line will  have to be drawn, NATO's border will have to be moved 800  kilometers to the east. Following the Partnership for Peace  adjustment phase, this would be easier, more effective, and more  reliable than today.    This interim solution has nothing to do with yielding to  pressure. It is far removed from all thinking in terms of  "worst case" categories, the worst is not considered inevitable.  However, that does not oblige the West to entertain a "best  case" illusion, a boundless expectation of a condition of  general bliss. It is pragmatic in the best sense. It does not  maliciously provoke what we should fear, and it does not rule  out any of the things that we should do if things turn out  differently. Cowardice? No, wise statesmanship.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Man in the News: Free-wheeling Olympian - Lord Justice Scott Senior UK civil servants are not accustomed to being grilled in public. But such was the fate this week of the hitherto unflappable Peter Verker, head of arms control and disarmament at the Foreign Office when he gave evidence before Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into arms sales to Iraq. Mr Vereker had suggested it was irrelevant to the inquiry that Jordan had been left off a government blacklist despite evidence it was an important route for arms supplies. The judge was unconvinced. 'Where Jordan should be  - you can see it is alphabetical  - it looks rather as though someone has just snowpaked it out, or that it has just gone, has it not?' snapped the judge. Mr Vereker, answered: 'That is a gap.' The encounter is typical of the sharp questioning by Lord Justice Scott, alongside judge's counsel Ms Presiley Baxendale QC, over the past three months of hearings. Lord Justice Scott's timely interventions have cut through virtually impenetrable Whitehall jargon. He has also read thousands of government documents made available to him on the instructions of the prime minister. The volume of material and complexity of the inner workings of the Civil Service might have worn down a less sturdy character. 'The judge is absolutely determined to get to the heart of what has happened and he will follow it through in a very determined way,' says Christopher Muttukumaru, an assistant Treasury solicitor and secretary to the inquiry. 'He is enjoying this immensely and finding it enormously challenging.' But Lord Justice Scott's approach has apparently jangled nerves in Whitehall. Though one Conservative MP close to the government claimed yesterday he had heard 'neither a murmur nor a ripple' about the inquiry, others in the Commons suggest the government is nervous. Few who know Lord Justice Scott are surprised at the spectacle. 'He is completely fearless, enormously intelligent and won't accept waffle,' says a former colleague. 'He wants to get to the bottom of things and does.' Lord Justice Scott was brought up in South Africa, but was born, of English parents, in Dehra Dun, northern India, where his father served in the 2/9th Gurkha Rifles. His early childhood was spent in Peshawar and it was not until he was eight that the family moved to a 500-acre dairy farm on the Mooi River in the Natal midlands. He was educated at Michaelhouse, one of South Africa's elite private schools, where he excelled both in the classroom and on the sportsfield. He read law at Cape Town University before taking up a Commonwealth scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1955. He gained a first as well as a rugby blue at wing forward. Lord Justice Scott met his wife Rima Ripoll, the daughter of a Panamanian dancer, during a year teaching in the US after which he returned to London and joined the Chancery Bar. His rise to the top of the profession was rapid. He took silk in 1975 and in 1982 at just 48 was elected Bar chairman. The following year he moved on to the High Court bench where he quickly found himself in the limelight, trying the case brought by the government against The Guardian newspaper for return of a confidential memo leaked by Sarah Tisdall, the former Foreign Office clerk. He ordered the document's return on the grounds that it was government property. Ms Tisdall was later convicted under the Official Secrets Act and jailed for six months. It was not until 1985 that his libertarian credentials became established after he granted a group of South Wales miners an injunction preventing officals of the National Union of Mineworkers organising mass-picketing. But it was Lord Justice Scott's judgment in the 1987 Spycatcher case, where he rejected ministers' attempts to place a permanent ban on press coverage of former MI5 officer Peter Wright's book, which made him a media darling. Later, his place as one of England's less conformist judges was assured, when he warned of the dangers of government legislation on confidentiality, saying judges should be left to develop the law and to reflect society's needs. Yet barristers say he is tough, can be brusque, and drives his court hard. 'He's been a great success on the bench,' says one QC, 'but he's not the warmest of judges. You could say he's 'slightly Olympian'.' The only apparent blot on an anti-establishment reputation is his love of fox hunting. He regularly rides out with the Grafton Hunt in north Oxfordshire and with a local draghunt  - the Farmers' Bloodhounds  - which hunt a man leaving an animal-scented trail rather than a real fox. This country activity fits his Action Man persona (he is a fit-looking 58-year-old) but sits oddly with the green image he creates by bicycling to work each day, and his unstuffy social and parental manner. He enjoys his social life with his high-spirited wife while having gracefully accepted the conversion to Islam of a son and a daughter. A close friend says of him: 'What underpins both his private and professional life is a very firm belief that there should be personal freedom of action so far as it does not impinge on the general good.' But it is Scott's reputation as a judge capable of taking on the political establishment that begs the question of why the government picked him to lead the Iraq inquiry. Those close to him insist that his appointment is as much a mystery to him as to the bulk of the judiciary. Some close to the inquiry suggest the appointment was made after unusually high level consultations, including with the prime minister. Mr Major apparently wanted to be seen to be committed to more open and fair government, which would be better served by appointing a judge like Lord Justice Scott than one with a more compliant reputation. The next big test of Lord Justice Scott's style however, will come in the autumn, when taking their turn before the judge will be the prime minister, and his predecessor, Baroness Thatcher.</p>

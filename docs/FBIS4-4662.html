			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramos and his Cabinet recently approved  an expanded list of flagship projects even as it was decided to  have two calendars for its implementation: one to fit the  remaining four years of the Ramos Administration and the other  for the long term.    Presidential Committee on Flagship Programs and Projects  (PCFPP) Chairman Emilio Osmena told reporters yesterday his  committee of seven is formulating a more focused priority list  that will identify which projects can be accomplished in the  next four years; which ones are to be put in place or begun;  and, which ones are to be left for the next administration to  implement.    The current list consists of 79 "different and discrete"  projects representing components of the original 19 flagship  projects identified by Mr. Ramos in his First Quarter Report.  Flagship projects are infrastructure projects eyed for their  high impact on the economy or their necessity in supporting and  encouraging the inflow of private investments.    These are part of the 400 or so projects identified by the  Core Public Investment Program of the National Economic and  Development Authority [NEDA].    According to Mr. Osmena, the setting up of the PCFPP and the  two calendars will mean better implementation of the projects.  The committee, whose members include the Secretaries of  Transportation and Communications, NEDA, Public Works and  Highways, Tourism, Agriculture, and Trade and Industry, "will be  putting on a national hat so that government does not become  like an octopus where each tentacle does not know what the  others are doing," said Mr. Osmena.    The PCFPP head said the strategy for prioritization will  take  on the demographic approach. That is, creating population  density centers with high domestic output. This is otherwise  known as "growth corridors."    Geographically, Luzon has the most number of projects, with  a  total investment of Pl00 billion [Philippine pesos]; the  Visayas, P11.3 billion; and Mindanao, P10.2 billion.</p>

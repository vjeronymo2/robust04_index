			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Treasury may give Pounds 1.5bn for Channel rail link The government is believed to be ready to provide up to Pounds 1.5bn of public-sector funds for the long-delayed Pounds 3bn Channel tunnel rail link, it emerged last night. In a significant policy switch, the Treasury has apparently given its approval to provide between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 1.5bn, compared with Pounds 300m to Pounds 500m previously believed to be available. An announcement on the final route for the 68-mile rail link is due next week, and the government is understood to be keen to improve the attractiveness of the project to the private sector. However, increasing public funds represents a large change in the government's attitude. The Channel Tunnel Act, which gave the go-ahead for the tunnel and set the terms for its financing, restricted public funding for the rail link to investments that would benefit the domestic rail network, such as stations. Financing the international aspect of the rail link was expressly excluded. But the Treasury and the Department of Transport are understood to have decided that the break-up of British Rail and the proposed franchising of its routes to private companies meant they were no longer bound by these conditions. The Department of Transport last night declined to comment but an official said: 'This department is at the forefront of the private finance initiative (which seeks to get private money into public sector projects) and we are working closely with the Treasury on this.' The Channel tunnel rail link is the largest project to be launched under this initiative and the government is keen to avoid further delays. A decision to redirect the link's route north of the Thames rather than through south London has led to delays, and the link is not now expected to open before 2002. The announcement of the rail link route next week is expected to confirm St. Pancras as the north London terminal. Eurotunnel Pounds 1bn action, Page 5</p>

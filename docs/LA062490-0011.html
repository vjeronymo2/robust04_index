			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MIND'S EYE: ENGINES OF WAR MERCHANTS OF DEATH AND THE NEW ARMS RACE BY  JAMES ADAMS (ATLANTIC MONTHLY PRESS: $19.95; 297 PP.; 0-87113-352-0))  </P> <P> Now that communism's virtual collapse in Europe is helping us forget "the  doomsday clock" and other dreadful Cold-War imagery, we are inclined to dismiss  military correspondents such as James Adams of the London Times, who stares at  us gravely from his jacket-cover photo, his hair wind-swept, as if from a  recent mission covering the dangerous covert warfare described in these pages.  </P> <P> We note the outdated nomenclature (America and the Soviet Union are described  as the world's "two great countries") and the reporting that does not seem to  have been updated since this book appeared in England earlier in the year.  Adams tells us, for example, that a high explosive called Semtex, perhaps the  world's most dangerous "engine of war," is manufactured only in Czechoslovakia;  is Vaclav Havel's government likely to crack down on production?, we'd like to  know, and if so, will other small countries be able to pick up the slack?  </P> <P> Unfortunately, though, we remain aware that these are merely quibbles which do  little to undermine Adams' basic argument that new threats are appearing, not  only from the A-bomb (now that Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu  civilizations have it) but from what we might dub the C-bomb: chemical weapons.  They are "the nuclear bombs of the Third World," Adams reports, and they range  from cheap, virtually undetectable explosives such as Semtex to deadly  genetically engineered weapons such as tularemia bacteria, only .077 an ounce  of which can produce a cloud 325 feet high, covering six-tenths of a mile and  infecting thousands of people.  </P> <P> Adams' grave mien is no doubt the product of his frustration at superpower  blunders that have allowed developing nations to procure this high-tech  weaponry (Stinger missiles sent to the mujahedeen, for instance, were later  fired back at U.S. helicopters from Iranian gunboats) and of his outrage at  First-World nations who wittingly help the arms merchants.  </P> <P> The worldwide regulatory policy Adams says we need, however, will be a long  time in coming, as one can see from Adams' own argument. He glibly dismisses  developing nations who assert that they have as much of a right to possess  nuclear weapons as the First World. But only a few paragraphs later, he  inadvertently confirms the fears that have caused some of these countries to  assert that right, claiming that "The West should not lower its guard (because)  the unpredictable could happen, and the Soviets and Americans could confront  each other over a modern missile crisis."  </P></p>

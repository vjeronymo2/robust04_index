			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The index of B-shares  on the Shanghai Stock Exchange climbed to a new record high to  close at 71.98 points Thursday, up 1.25 points compared to the  close of the previous trading day and 4.81 points higher than  last week.    Four B-shares -- Lujian, Refrigerator, Lianhua and Shangchai  -- topped today's five highest-rising stocks on the exchange,  ranging from 4.21 percent to 7.14 percent, while the index of  A-shares witnessed a continuous drop.    Experts here attribute the rise of B-shares, exclusive to  overseas holders, to the better macro-economic situation China  witnessed from January to April.    They pointed out that price hikes basically alleviated in  April and the rate of foreign exchange remains stable. Foreign  exchange reserves grow steadily and bank savings are soaring.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Vardon beats forecast and buys seal sanctuary for Pounds 2m VARDON, THE leisure attractions group which runs the London Dungeon, the York Dungeon and the Sea Life Centres, is acquiring Seal Sanctuary in Cornwall for Pounds 1.8m in cash and paper. Separately the group, which obtained its Stock Exchange listing in October, reported full year pre-tax profits ahead of flotation forecasts. The seal sanctuary at Gweek, on the banks of the Helford river, was set up in 1973 and is a profitable visitor attraction based on the rescue, care and release of injured seals. It attracts more than 200,000 visitors a year and, after charging interest and non-recurring items of Pounds 251,000, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 124,000 in the year to end February 1992. Together with two new Sea Life centres being built in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and Scheveningen in the Netherlands, which are due to open later this year, the acquisition of the Gweek sanctuary will increase Vardon's operating attractions from 11 to 14. Vardon's pre-tax profits in the year to December 31 reached Pounds 2.43m, compared with a flotation forecast of Pounds 2.29m, and Pounds 797,000 in the previous year. Turnover increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 9.73m (Pounds 7.62m). The acquisition of Sea Life has been accounted for as a merger, while the results of the Dungeons are included from their acquisition at the end of March last year. Vardon acquired the Dungeons for Pounds 5.6m from Kunick after Mr David Hudd, chairman, and Mr Nickolas Irens, chief executive and former finance director of First Leisure, joined the board of Winchmore, restructured the company and changed its name. The latest results include Pounds 171,000 (Pounds 24,000) of investment income and a Pounds 273,000 extraordinary charge related to the cost and losses of the sale of Headley Agencies. Earnings per share of 4.2p were 5 per cent ahead of forecast and the company is paying a final dividend of 0.5p, making a taotal of 0.75p for the year. Mr Hudd said the results were 'very pleasing' given the state of the economy. Visitor attendances during the year totalled 2.9m, a 6 per cent increase on a like-for-like basis.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> NEW ALLIANCES CAN HELP SAVE CALIFORNIA'S GREAT NATURAL ASSETS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE IRVINE CO. AND THE NATURE CONSERVANCY  MAY SEEM STRANGE BUT IT OFFERS HOPE OF PRESERVING THE FUTURE.  </P> <P> When the California Nature Conservancy and the Irvine Co. recently announced a  new partnership, reaction from the community was quite favorable, but at the  same time a few eyebrows were raised.  </P> <P> Environmentalists working with a large-scale community developer? The  combination strikes some as incongruous, even contradictory.  </P> <P> But while many conservationists and developers have historically found  themselves at odds with one another, this new partnership has more to do with  the future than with the past. The future requires that we discard old  assumptions and discover new approaches if we are to be successful in our work,  be it community planning, land management or environmental protection.  </P> <P> You've heard the song before, but it bears repeating: We are losing our natural  world at an alarming rate. The disappearing tropical rain forests of the Amazon  or Malay peninsula are much discussed, but California, too, is in crisis: 98%  of our state's river forests are gone; 99% of our native grasslands and our  valley oak woodlands have been wiped out; 95% of our wetlands have disappeared,  and with them the plants and animals that have contributed inestimably to  California's reputation as the Golden State, a treasure trove of life and  abundance.  </P> <P> If humans were forced to live in 2% of their normal habitat, we'd all be living  in closets. It doesn't take imagination to understand that this loss of nature  cannot be sustained without immeasurable harm to our economic life and personal  sense of well-being.  </P> <P> While it is readily agreed that change is a fundamental rule of nature, and  that extinction is part of that process, it is also true that the current rate  of extinction is anywhere from 40 to 400 times the rate of species extinction  during the time of the dinosaurs. The hands of the evolutionary clock are  spinning wildly primarily because of human activity. More of our native plants  and animals have become endangered in the last 200 years than in the last 10  millennia.  </P> <P> As the problems we face become more complex, the solutions fewer and less  obvious, we need to involve alliances, teamwork and imaginative effort to  effect the changes so desperately needed for the health of our state's  wildlife.  </P> <P> The Nature Conservancy has been doing just that. For 40 years, we've been  protecting habitat for endangered wildlife and natural communities, and we've  employed innovative strategies to do it. In the Coachella Valley, for example,  the California Nature Conservancy worked with developers and environmentalists  to pioneer a mitigation/habitat protection plan that is now being used as a  national model to allow human and wildlife habitats to coexist. This  willingness to explore new approaches has resulted in remarkable success: to  date we have helped to protect more than 15 million acres globally, 5 million  nationally, and over half a million of the most ecologically sensitive acres  here in California.  </P> <P> We also know that saving pieces of fragmented habitat is not enough. Large  animals such as deer and pronghorn antelope need rangeland. Highways bisecting  wildlife corridors result in animal isolation, injury and death. Preserving a  particular parcel does not necessarily guarantee sufficient water to maintain  healthy animal populations; or that the water that is available will be free of  pesticides, siltation or fertilizer runoff.  </P> <P> So increasingly, saving land for plants and animals requires thinking big, and  taking a look at the larger picture. And thinking big, taking action on so  large a scale, requires collaboration of many key players.  </P> <P> The Nature Conservancy's approach has always been one of negotiation and  cooperation, and as a result we've had the opportunity to work with an  extraordinarily diverse group of people and organizations. Nationwide, we have  cooperative agreements with the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of  Defense, and in California, the U.S. Forest Service. These three partners  control a whopping 42% of the land in our state, and almost 60% of the  biodiversity.  </P> <P> For the first time in recent memory, a new California governor will have had  significant experience with these federal agencies and so has the opportunity  to forge unprecedented federal-state partnerships in favor of wildlife.  </P> <P> Southern California has one of the richest and most varied array of species in  the continental United States. With 64,000 acres in Orange County, the Irvine  Co. is uniquely positioned to protect that natural heritage, and our  partnership represents a commitment to do it wisely. When they approached us  earlier this year to ask if we would consider developing a natural  resource/public access management plan for their lands slated for eventual  public ownership, the California Nature Conservancy understood the opportunity  the Irvine Co. was presenting to us. The parcels of their land we inventoried  are large, contiguous tracts of prime wildlife habitat, an increasingly rare  commodity in burgeoning Southern California.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the Irvine Co. was offering evidence of something the Nature  Conservancy has been saying for a long time: What's good for the environment is  ultimately good for business communities and society. Development of  sustainable land-use policies and protection of wildlife benefit everyone.  </P> <P> Intelligent planning of communities involves not only the creation of  sensitively designed buildings, but also protection for those special places we  turn to for beauty, peace and a sense of balance. California can no longer  afford the polarization of "either/or." If we work together we can have "all of  the above." At the Nature Conservancy, we think this is not only possible but  absolutely essential. Happily, the Irvine Co. agrees.  </P></p>

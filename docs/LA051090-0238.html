			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> RELIGIOUS CAR DEALS BACKFIRE  </P> <P> Car dealer Freddye (Action) Jackson says he's baffled by the uproar over his  offer of special discounts to fellow Christians.  </P> <P> But the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith says the problem is clear:  Jackson's 9-month-old incentive program discriminates, even though it also is  available to Jews.  </P> <P> "Any time you talk about Christianity, people blow it out of proportion; people  take it negatively. I don't know why," Jackson said.  </P> <P> He started the Christian Members Buyers Plan at Brown Lincoln-Mercury in this  Washington suburb last August. But the uproar started when a local newspaper  reported on the incentive program Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Snacks setback at JLI Group A setback in its snack foods operations was behind a decline at JLI Group in the year ended March 31. Trading profits at the snacks and ingredients maker showed little change at Pounds 5.85m (Pounds 5.95m) but after carrying restructuring and reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.15m, pre-tax profits were down by the same amount at Pounds 4.06m. Turnover of Pounds 111.6m (Pounds 104.7m) included Pounds 3.89m from acquisitions. On a divisional basis food services reported operating profits of Pounds 2.45m (Pounds 2.06m) on turnover ahead to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 40.7m); food ingredients increased to Pounds 2.56m (Pounds 1.53m) on sales of Pounds 38.5m (Pounds 31.2m) but snack foods fell to Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 2.86m) on turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 32.8m). Mr Yoav Gottesman, chairman, said the company had tackled underperforming areas and addressed changes in its market, and the current year had begun in line with expectations. He saw potential for growth 'both organically and through strategic acquisitions'. The final dividend is raised to 3.2p, making a total of 4.8p (4.65p) on earnings per share of 7.1p (9.3p).</p>

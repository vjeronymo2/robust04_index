			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Simon sells European consultancy for Pounds 10.5m SIMON Engineering, which last August put its environmental division up for sale because of falling profits and worries about its dividend, yesterday announced the sale of its European environmental consultancy business to Northumbrian Water for Pounds 10.5m. This follows last month's Pounds 14.2m disposal of its water and waste treatment arm to Thames Water. The group, however, has been unable to find a buyer for the third part of its environmental division, the North American consultancy. Mr Brian Kemp, chief executive, said that would now be retained as a 'profitable, stand alone business'. Analysts welcomed the sale, which would cut forecast year-end net borrowings of nearly Pounds 100m, equal to gearing of about 80 per cent. However, the change of heart on the North American division was seen as inconsistent and will reduce the overall proceeds expected from the disposal programme. The arm, known as Hydro-Search, was acquired for Pounds 6.7m in 1991. Simon is due to announce results for 1992 next month. Pre-tax profits are expected to fall from Pounds 18.3m to between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m because of recession in its process engineering and access divisions. Speculation that it will have to cut the dividend, which was uncovered last year, knocked the shares from a high of 301p to a low of 70p last year. Yesterday, they gained 2p to 137p. Net borrowings have almost doubled from Pounds 51m at the interim stage. This was mainly the result of advance payments in the process engineering division and devaluation of sterling, which increased the amount of US debt. The disposals will reduce borrowings by about Pounds 30m because Thames Water assumed Pounds 6m of debt in its acquisition. Both sales should be completed when the results are announced but will not be reflected in the balance sheet.</p>

Bulgarian anti-terror  department director Feodor Vladimirov told AA that they have met  with Turkish officials in July and have signed a cooperation  protocol against international terror organizations. He added  that the matter had been kept in secret so far, for security  reasons.    During the meeting Turkish officials briefed their Bulgarian  colleagues on the terror organization in Turkey and gave  detailed information on the connections of these in Europe.  Vladimirov said that Bulgaria was being used as a bridge in  drug and arms smuggling.    "We also know that some separatist terrorists are  temporarily  staying in Bulgaria when they flee to Europe. However, terror  groups are not using Bulgaria as a shelter," he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the technical nature of this interim rule, the Department has determined that a full notice and public comment procedure under 24 CFR part 10 of the United States Code is unnecessary and is therefore issuing this document as an interim rule with public comment requested. The interim rule relieves a regulatory restriction that adversely affects and has proved to be an undue burden on the public housing community. Further, the interim rule supports several of the Department's key strategies for improving the way the Department's programs operate, including deregulating programs to the extent feasible, focusing on risk management and taking actions to speed the expenditure of funds. For these reasons, it is desirable to make the interim rule effective as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Other Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subject matter of this interim rule is categorically excluded from HUD's environmental clearance procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(k). The interim rule relates to administrative procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision but only to the preparation of reports and HUD management activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Executive Order 12612, Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the provisions of this interim rule do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The interim rule does not, in any substantive manner, change existing relationships between the Federal government and State and local authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

This interim rule only directly affects PHAs and IHAs which are State and local governmental entities. The interim rule should prove beneficial to PHAs and IHAs and should have no negative impact upon their contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D.

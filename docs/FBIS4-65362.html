			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "U.S. Inconsistencies"] </F>   [Text] Is there such a thing as a U.S. policy on Bosnia?  Judging from the Geneva meeting on Friday, 13 May, the answer  can only be negative. While the United States agreed to the  approach advocated by the Europeans with respect to the Bosnian  crisis, it was once more with plenty of reservations and  unresolved contradictions.    One may say that, since World War II, Europe has never  appealed so forcefully to the United States. And never has it  had to deplore such a noncommittal and inconsistent policy by  the United States.    Behind the contrived consensus arrived at in Geneva there  remain two different approaches to the Bosnian crisis, which  boil down to a clash between America's moralism and Europe's  realism. For the United States, there is no question of  imposing on Bosnia's Muslims a settlement that they would not  agree to, as in this war they are the victims. For Europe, what  matters most is stopping the war, even though there cannot be a  settlement that does justice to the victims.    According to [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe, the U.S.  Administration is now beginning to understand the limits of its  "moral" arguments and the danger of leaving the belligerents  free to fight it out to the last instead of intervening  directly. However, because of domesitc considerations, U.S.  officials will not say this aloud; while off the record they  reject the notion of lifting the arms embargo which has been  requested by the Senate, they do not say so publicly6 and they  simultaneously issue contradictory statements on the partition  of Bosnia between the various communities.    However, without a clear U.S. stand, Alain Juppe's already  fragile "realistic" line collapses: Judging from what has been  going on in the field, one can clearly see that the belligerents  will opt for peace only if they feel the international community  is ready to force it on them. While in the last few weeks the  Serbs could appreciate the limits of Western threats regarding  air strikes, Bosnia's Muslims will have noted how unconvincingly  the United States called upon them to lay down their arms.    The Europeans did no better than the United States on the  outset of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. And both the  Europeans and the United States are still paying for those  initial errors inasmuch as they cannot control the crisis. In  this respect, things are unlikely to change as a result of this  latest episode in Geneva.</p>

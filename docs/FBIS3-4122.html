More than 20 million people have directly benefited from the  schemes. This was revealed at a symposium which concluded here  today on the subject of WFP assistance for development in the  Asia- Pacific region.    Since 1979, when China first participated in the  organization, the WFP has supplied great quantities of food,  including 9.4 million tons of wheat, 45,000 tons of skimmed milk  powder, 15,000 tons of butter and many advanced facilities to  China's 55 agricultural development projects, covering 160  poverty-stricken counties all over the country.    Among the projects applauded by local governments and people  are improvement of dairy products in six large cities, fish  farming in nine large cities, soil erosion prevention on Loess  Plateau, protection of pandas in Sichuan Province and production  of forage grass in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.    WFP assistance is mainly utilized for comprehensive  agricultural development projects and its aid emphasis in recent  years has been further shifted to areas inhabited by minority  nationalities and remote mountain areas in north-western and  south-western China.    With 43 projects already completed and 12 others still under  way, the WFP-assisted schemes have played a positive role in  improving production conditions and the ecological environment  and in increasing farmers' incomes.</p>

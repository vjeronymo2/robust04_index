			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Brussels to probe pay-TV venture The European Commission has ordered an investigation into a planned joint venture by two German media groups and the state telephone monopoly. It is suspicious that the concentration could create a dominant position in the German market for pay-television services. Bertelsmann, the world's second largest media group, Kirch, one of Germany's biggest private television companies, and Deutsche Telekom notified Brussels of their plans last month. They intend setting up a company to provide infrastructure, marketing and booking services for commercial pay-TV, including such services as video-on-demand, home banking and interactive television. The company would be known as MSG Media Service. The Commission is concerned that, with the introduction of digital broadcasting in Germany over the next few years, the pay-TV market will expand rapidly. This is particularly so in Germany where a large number of households already receive cable or satellite television. 'The proposed concentration raises the question whether MSG could obtain, on a permanent basis, a dominant position on the German market for technical and administrative services for Pay-TV,' the Commission said yesterday. Deutsche Telekom is the country's leading cable network operator. It also recently acquired a substantial stake in the European satellite operator Ses-Astra. Bertelsmann and Kirch have a stake in Premiere, Germany's only pay-TV channel, and Kirch is a dominant programme supplier to German television. Media analysts value its library at more than Dollars 2bn. 'It is therefore particularly important to examine the effects which may result from the combination of companies which probably would have a leading position in pay-TV and cable networks in the future,' the Commission said. Brussels is particularly uneasy that, by dominating the pay-TV infrastructure at an early stage, the joint venture would control standards for any newcomers. It fears MSG would be able to set the standards for household decoders. Mr John Scaife, a media financier at London-based Charon Capital, said: 'The concern is that if the joint venture effectively controls the gateway to pay television services, and people at home do not want to have to pay for more than one decoder, then this group could be in a very dominant position. Anyone coming in later, would have to use their standards.' The Commission decided the need for investigation went beyond Germany's borders arguing that the proposed concentration could affect the access of pay-TV suppliers from other EU member states to the German market. It has four months to decide on the merger.</p>

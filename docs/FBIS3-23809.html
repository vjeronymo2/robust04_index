			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aram Tarakchyan, chief of the foreign </F> investments department of the Ministry of Economics of the  Republic of Armenia: "A Technologies Market Needs to be Created  In Armenia"]    [Text] The department of foreign investments was  created four months ago in the Ministry of Economics of the  Republic of Armenia. The chief of this department, Aram  TARAKCHYAN, characterizes the situation with foreign investments  in Armenia like this.    The department is not engaged in procuring foreign  investments. Our goal is the creation of conditions so that  investments would come into Armenia without the help of the  president or the prime minister. To do this one needs to know  how and for what purpose investments are made in the world. It  is necessary to create a mechanism for the support and  encouragement of investments. The principle of supporting  investors is clear and common the world over: a favorable  legislative field. In this case our task is clear: to adopt such  laws. Encouragement is another matter. In this case the presence  of a well thought-out and considered program specially for  Armenia is required.    Official letters of proposals with invitations to foreigners  to make investments were sent from Armenia to various addresses  in the past. Not a single positive reply has been received up to  this day. The reason, it seems, is in the lack of information  about investment processes.    Investments can first of all secure for us the fruits of the  work of the scientific and technological thought of Armenia.    Today the Japanese are successfully selling the "Narine" [as  transliterated; not further identified] on the international  market. However, this is not the "Narine" purchased from us but  one which they have made over and brought up to the requirements  of world production standards. We have not been able to achieve  this despite the fact that we have received the tens of  thousands of dollars due us and the Japanese have offered us  cooperation.    Intellectual property--these are resources which are not  exhausted when sold but augmented. One needs simply to learn the  way to enrich them by sale. Today in Armenia there are several  score of new technologies of the "Narine" level and several  hundreds of technical and technological research and development  projects which may interest foreign investors.    The first and most important investment program is a program  for the creation of a technologies market in Armenia.    This program cannot be created by a single step, by a single  order or other administrative act. The components of the market  must arise and function by stages. The following steps are  essential:    a) creation of an information bank which will include  various  kinds of information on research and development projects and  inventions being brought about in Armenia that are promising  from the technological viewpoint. Use of this bank should  require payment. It will make it possible for everyone who is  interested to become familiar with a research and development  project or technology;    b) creation of a small group of 200-300 innovation  consultant  specialists--the connecting link between the information system  and those who need the technologies, their potential customers.  A mutual influence of the supply and demand for intellectual  property is thus created. This is the basis of the market;    c) development of the basic directions of the government's  scientific and technical innovation policy. In this case many of  those whom the state now finances free of charge as scientific  workers will switch to that system of financing which directly  serves the creation of new technologies.    If there are all these components, there will also be a  technologies market and only then will foreign investors be able  to carry out investments here.</p>

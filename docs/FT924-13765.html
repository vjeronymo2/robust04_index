			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / NCB chief blames 'mad' dash for gas MR NEIL CLARKE, British Coal's chairman, blamed the 'economic madness' of Britain's rush to switch from coal to gas for electricity generation for yesterday's sweeping programme of pit closures. The 'dash for gas', he warned, would push up electricity prices and result in a huge excess of generating capacity. Plans for gas-fired power stations already announced would squeeze 30m tonnes of coal a year out of the market. 'A sizeable portion of the electricity generation market has been shut off for coal,' Mr Clarke said. He stressed that the new gas stations would produce electricity more expensively than coal stations they were driving out of business. The dash for gas was prompted by the discovery of huge natural gas supplies under the North Sea. The first of a new generation of gas-fired power stations was opened earlier this month. By some estimates, gas might account for 20 per cent of the market by the middle of the decade. The attraction of gas is that power stations are quick and cheap to build. Gas is easy to transport, and is environmentally friendly. Many of the stations are being built by electricity distribution companies keen to escape the duopoly run by National Power and PowerGen in England and Wales. Because they are allowed to pass through all generation costs to the consumer, they have been criticised for failing to ensure the cost of the gas is economic. A group of coal community interests and electricity consumers has challenged Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to investigate gas contracts and rule them uneconomic. He has declined to take specific action and is to be challenged in court. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday: 'The investment in gas is taking place as a result of decisions by people to invest money in economically viable enterprises.'</p>

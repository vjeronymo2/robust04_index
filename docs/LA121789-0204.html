			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> JORDAN TUNES UP FOR LAKERS AS BULLS WIN  </P> <P> Michael Jordan warmed up for his showdown with Magic Johnson by rallying the  Bulls to a 115-104 victory over the Charlotte Hornets Saturday night at  Chicago.  </P> <P> The Hornets, who have lost 10 in a row, led 96-92 with six minutes to play.  </P> <P> But Jordan led the Bulls on an 8-0 run. Then, after the Hornets went ahead  103-102, Jordan scored three points during a 10-0 run that ended the Hornets'  hopes.  </P> <P> Jordan scored 33 points, had nine rebounds, seven assists, two blocks and two  steals to lead the Bulls to their fourth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> The Bulls and Lakers will play Tuesday night at Chicago in the first of their  two regular-season games.  </P> <P> It seems certain that Jordan will be ready for this one. When Johnson was voted  the NBA's most valuable player last season, Jordan wasn't happy.  </P> <P> "I am certain," Jordan said, "that I had an MVP season."  </P> <P> While leading the Bulls to their four victories in a row, Jordan has averaged  35.3 points, increasing his scoring lead over the New York Knicks' Patrick  Ewing.  </P> <P> During the four games, Jordan has averaged nearly 59% accuracy from the field  and eight rebounds and seven assists.  </P> <P> Jordan likes to play down the individual battle between himself and Johnson.  </P> <P> "We are progressing as a team," Jordan said. "We are developing a killer  instinct. It won't be an individual battle between Magic and myself."  </P> <P> The Bulls' Craig Hodges made five of six three-point shots to keep the Hornets  from taking a solid lead.  </P> <P> Miami 99, Milwaukee 96 -- The Heat sneaked up on the Bucks while they were  still celebrating Friday night's surprise road victory over the Pacers.  </P> <P> With Rony Seikaly scoring 22 points, including a three-point play with 1:24  remaining at Milwaukee, the Heat, winners of only five of their first 22, won  their second in a row. They beat the Minnesota Timberwolves Friday night at  Minneapolis.  </P> <P> The Bucks are the first non-expansion team the Heat has beaten in more than a  month.  </P> <P> Sherman Douglas made four consecutive free throws in the last 35 seconds to  preserve the victory.  </P> <P> Golden State 104, Detroit 92 -- The Warriors are back.  </P> <P> They followed up Friday night's victory at Portland by beating the NBA champion  Pistons at Oakland. The Warriors have won four in a row after winning only four  of their first 18.  </P> <P> The Pistons, playing without Isiah Thomas, lost their third in a row. Thomas  returned to Detroit after suffering a concussion during Friday's loss at Utah.  </P> <P> The Pistons also lost Bill Laimbeer three minutes into the second half when he  threw the ball at referee Hue Hollins. He missed, but still was ejected.  </P> <P> New York 118, Seattle 97 -- Every two or three days Patrick Ewing converts  another team to the idea he is the dominant center in the NBA.  </P> <P> As Ewing led the Knicks, the only NBA team still unbeaten at home, to their  ninth consecutive victory at Madison Square Garden, it was the SuperSonics'  turn to be convinced.  </P> <P> Ewing, although he missed most of the second quarter because of foul trouble,  had 30 points and 14 rebounds.  </P> <P> While Ewing was on the bench, the Knicks' second unit outscored Seattle 19-6,  and it was another romp for the Atlantic Division leaders.  </P> <P> "He (Ewing) has improved considerably over last season," Coach Bernie  Bickerstaff of the SuperSonics said. "We couldn't do anything with him."  </P> <P> San Antonio 125, Orlando 116 -- The Magic gave the Spurs trouble for only a  half at San Antonio.  </P> <P> David Robinson, the favorite to be voted rookie of the year, had 21 points and  16 rebounds, and Terry Cummings added 29 points and 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> "We played just good enough to win," Cummings said. "But in this league you  take what you can get. We fumbled a lot early and they rebounded well. My own  game is just coming around."  </P> <P> Washington 112, Dallas 108 -- Bernard King had his best night of the season,  and the Bullets needed it.  </P> <P> King scored 31 points and his two jump shots and two free throws in the last 96  seconds thwarted the Mavericks.  </P> <P> The Mavericks, with Adrian Dantley leading the way, built a 65-57 halftime  lead, but Dantley went sour in the fourth quarter. Rolando Blackman scored the  Mavericks' last 13 points. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

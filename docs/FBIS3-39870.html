			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers has decided to recommend  to the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA] to extend the  state of emergency in force in the provinces of Batman, Bingol,  Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli, and  Van for another four months, effective 19 March. The Council of  Ministers met for approximately 90 minutes under Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller.    In a statement after the meeting, Yildirim Aktuna, state  minister and government spokesman, said that the Council  discussed the terrorist incidents that took place over the past  10 years and the issue of extending the state of emergency in  force in the 10 provinces for another four months. He pointed  out that the extensive terrorist activities that began in 1984  increased greatly up until the end of 1991. As a result of the  measures taken by the coalition government at the time, he said,  terrorism began to decline in 1992. The number of terrorists  who lost their lives between 1 January and 21 February 1992 and  1 January and 21 February 1993 amounted to 88, while 345 lost  their lives in the first 52 days of this year, Aktuna said,  adding: The statistics show an increase in the number of  operations against terrorists and in the number of terrorists  killed or captured. This is the result of the important  decisions made by our government in fighting terrorism.    Aktuna pointed out that within this framework, foreign  support for the terrorist organization has been significantly  reduced, mobile security forces have been trained, and  conditions have been created for the antiterrorist struggle to  be waged effectively under harsh winter conditions.    Aktuna stated that the Council of Ministers, in its  determination to safeguard security during the coming local  elections and to end terrorism, decided to recommend to the TGNA  to extend the state of emergency in force in the 10 provinces by  another four months as of 19 March.</p>

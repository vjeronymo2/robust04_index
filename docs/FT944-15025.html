			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A battle over 7m merchants - US advertisers' public feuds Comparative advertising, they call it: promoting your products by doing down a rival's. But in the US, where the practice seems to have taken a particularly nasty turn, one recent campaign might better be described as a bare-knuckle fight. For the last three weeks Visa International and American Express, two of the world's biggest payment card organisations, have been conducting a public slanging match in which they have used full-page newspaper advertisements to abuse one another's products. The story started last month when American Express, famous for its charge cards, decided to launch an assault on the market with a new product called the Optima True Grace card. In advertisements, American Express said Optima True Grace offered an advantage unavailable to holders of other credit cards: an interest-free grace period on new purchases even if the monthly bill was not paid in full. Most cards, it said, charged interest from the moment of purchase if holders did not pay off the full balance. At the end of September, Visa started hitting back. In newspaper advertisements across the US, it yelled: 'American Express is offering you a new credit card, but you don't have to accept it. Heck, 7m merchants don't' In smaller type beneath the main message, it said 7m merchants accepted the Visa card that did not accept Optima True Grace. After a couple of weeks, American Express's patience snapped. It started running full-page counterblasts to the Visa campaign, asking: 'Why is Visa incorrectly claiming 7m more merchants than American Express? (We challenge Visa to name them.) Answer: So you won't notice the Dollars 1.5bn unnecessary interest they charge you.' Both sides vigorously defend their advertisements. Visa says it will be happy to name the 7m merchants which do not accept American Express if American Express will pay for the space. American Express says this is a red herring because most Visa agents are outside the US and have never seen, nor will ever see, an American. The real issue, it says, is the interest charges. 'We are firing a missile directly into Visa's home base. We are going right after its market. Visa's scared as hell about it. That's what these ads are about,' says American Express's Thomas Ryder, president, establishment services worldwide. One obvious drawback of responding to a rival's advertising claims in this way is that it can draw attention to a product that would otherwise have gone unnoticed. An increasingly popular alternative is to lob a lawsuit at the offending party. Last week Hertz, the car rental company, employed the technique in an attempt to stop its rival Avis from running a television commercial promoting an airport valet service. The Avis advertisements offer a chauffeur-driven lift from car rental parking lots to airport terminals across the US, but Hertz's suit says many airports do not allow such a service because it adds to congestion. Avis has filed a counter-claim. Even so, the public name-calling does seem to have become unusually loud of late. In another newspaper advertisement, AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications company, has been contradicting the claims made by rival MCI Communications for a discount calling plan, saying: 'You never save 40 per cent off your bill. (You actually save an average of only 13 per cent).' The National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the US industry's self-regulating body, says the outbreak is probably coincidental rather than indicative of a trend. Debra Goldstein, the division's acting director, says opinions remain divided about whether comparative advertising provides the consumer with additional valid information or whether it simply gives competitors free advertising time. 'There are pros and cons on both sides,' Goldstein says. 'But many advertisers may feel it just turns the consumer off, publicly airing a feud. No one wants to listen to that.'</p>

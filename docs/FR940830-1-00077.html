			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Door Locks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Standard No. 206 specifies that side doors must be equipped with a locking mechanism with an operating means in the interior of the vehicle. For locks in side front doors, the outside door handle must be inoperative when the locking mechanism is engaged. For side rear door locks, both the outside and inside door handles must be inoperative when the locking mechanism is engaged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency recognizes that many production vehicles do not have a true ``locking mechanism'' on their back doors and provide no inside door handles. In many cases, unlatching can not be performed by occupants seated near such doors. As part of proposing to extend Standard No. 206 to back doors, NHTSA is considering applying door lock requirements to some or all back doors. The agency requests comments on whether the requirements for side front door locks or side rear door locks should be extended to back doors, which types of back doors should be included/excluded from this requirement, and why.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Leadtime  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency is proposing an effective date of the first September 1 that occurs following a two year period beginning with publication of a final rule. NHTSA believes that a leadtime of about two years is needed, since manufacturers will need to make design and tooling changes for many of their passenger cars and MPVs. The agency believes that a longer leadtime would be unnecessary, since manufacturers are already familiar with the kinds of designs needed to comply with the requirements of Standard No. 206.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Additional Considerations and Questions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the wide variety of passenger car and MPV designs, both with respect to the back door latch itself and with respect to passenger access to the back door, NHTSA recognizes that there may be a number of issues concerning whether some of the proposed requirements should apply to only certain back doors and whether any additional modifications need to be made in the test requirements and procedures to make them appropriate for all covered vehicles. The agency specifically requests comments on the following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. As discussed above, the full requirements of Standard No. 206 apply only to hinged side doors other than cargo-type doors; abbreviated requirements apply to hinged cargo-type doors and to sliding doors. To what extent should full versus abbreviated requirements apply to back doors? Are there any back doors, such as split back doors, to which the requirements should not apply at all?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Are the proposed test requirements adequately clear and appropriate for all back doors? For example, are latch faces and hinge faces designed so that the direction perpendicular to these components can readily be determined? Commenters who believe that some of proposed requirements are not adequately clear are encouraged to suggest specific changes to clarify the procedures. Depending on the comments, the agency may make changes in the procedures in a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Identify which and how many of your current passenger car hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, and vans would need to be upgraded to meet the proposed requirements for: (a) latching mechanisms; (b) hinges, and (c) locks? Please indicate the consumer cost to upgrade and the relative increase in strength or other benefit for each upgrade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Identify which and how many of your current passenger car hatchbacks, station wagons, sport utility vehicles, and vans would pass the proposed requirements for: (a) latching mechanisms, (b) hinges, and (c) locks?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Please identify and/or provide any studies or data that might assist the agency in quantifying the safety or other benefits of this proposed rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Costs and Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendments to Standard No. 206 would affect back door locks and door retention components on passenger car hatchbacks, station wagons, utility vehicles, and vans. About 1.5 million hatchbacks, 0.4 million station wagons, 1.6 million utility vehicles, and 1.8 million vans are expected to be produced in the 1997 model year, for a total of about 5.3 million vehicles that would potentially be affected by the proposed amendments in this notice, if they are required on a proposed effective date before September 1, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

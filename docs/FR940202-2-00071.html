This program is designed to improve the condition of research equipment and facilities in our Nation's academic institutions in all areas of science traditionally supported by the National Science Foundation. One of the goals of the program is to assist graduate and undergraduate academic institutions, including those that historically have received limited Federal research and development funds, to improve their academic science and engineering infrastructure. The Program consists of two components: instrumentation and facilities modernization. The former provides support for the acquisition or development of major state-of-the-art research instrumentation. The latter provides support for the renovation and/or repair of existing science and engineering research and research training facilities. In FY&hyph;1994, separate competitions will be held for instrumentation and facilities modernization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Program expects to allocate approximately $50 million in FY&hyph;1994 for instrumentation and $50 million for facilities modernization. Previous proposal success rates for the program have been 26% for instrumentation and 30% for facilities modernization respectively. Awards for instrumentation will range from $100,000 to $2 million with a required matching/cost sharing at the level between 30&hyph;50% for all institutions. Awards for facility renovation/repair projects will range from $100,000 to $2 million with a required 50% matching/cost sharing on the part of the submitting institution from Ph.D.-granting institutions or at a level between 20% and 50% from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions. It is not the intent of the program to fund new construction or expansion of existing facilities. Proposals may be submitted by institutions of higher education, independent nonprofit research institutions, research museums, and legally incorporated consortia thereof. Proposals for Instrumentation must be received by March 15, 1994, and proposals for Facilities Modernization must be received by April 5, 1994.

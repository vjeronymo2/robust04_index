			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Congo ballot for leader Thousands of people lined up to vote for a new leader in the former Marxist-Leninist state of Congo yesterday in the first contested presidential ballot since 1963, AP reports from Brazzaville. Voting was slow but peaceful, except for one incident in which young people attacked a police station they said was holding the national identity cards they needed to vote. Among leading contenders is discredited President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the former Marxist military ruler who was stripped of all but ceremonial powers last year by a national conference for democracy. It accused him of assassinating opponents and stealing state money, but decided to forgive him. He retains the support of the army and has been locked in a power struggle with Prime Minister Andre Milongo, another contender who has led an interim government to organise elections.</p>

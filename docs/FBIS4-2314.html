			<p>BFN     [Text] The ninth plenum of the Liaoning Provincial  Discipline Inspection Commission concluded in Shenyang on 7  April. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  delivered a speech at the plenum, in which he stressed: The  more deepening of reform and the more development of the  economy, the more we should resolutely oppose corruption. Gu  Jinchi said: Party members and cadres at all levels,  particularly leading cadres, should appraise the anticorruption  work done in the former period by seeking truth from facts and  upgrade their understanding on the importance and emergency of  successfully conducting anticorruption work. They should also  firmly foster the thinking of unremittingly and frequently  grasping the work and carry forward the struggle against  corruption deeply, protractedly, and effectively. Party  committees and governments at all levels should correctly  understand and successfully deal with the relationship among  reform, development, stability, and anticorruption by proceeding  from the whole situation. They should unswervingly implement  the principle of taking two-handed approach and being tough with  both hands. While successfully grasping the central work of  economic construction, it is imperative to do a good job in  grasping the anticorruption work.    Gu Jinchi pointed out: A good job should be done this year  in realistically implementing various tasks for the  anticorruption work. Efforts should be made to concentrate on  dealing with the deep-rooted problems so as to strive to score  greater results in the work. It is necessary to seize the  emphasis of having leading cadres perform their official duties  honestly and be self-disciplined, to reinforce the dynamics in  investigating and handling serious and appalling cases, and to  continuously correct the malpractice. Efforts should be made to  further perfect the supervisory mechanism and to take radical  and stopgap measures concurrently.    In his speech Gu Jinchi urged party committees and  governments at all levels to realistically enhance their  leadership over the anticorruption work. The principal leading  comrades of party and government organs should take personal  charge of the work. Efforts should be made to establish or  improve the responsibility system enforced for the  anticorruption work, to enhance the supervisory and inspection  work, to further strengthen leadership over the work undertaken  by the discipline inspection commission so as to bring its  functional role into full play.    Attending the plenum were provincial leading personnel,  including Wang Huaiyuan, Shang Wen, Chen Suzhi, Xu Wencai, Wen  Shizhen, and Zhang Lingyun; as well as veteran leaders from the  provincial level organs, including Ge Xifan and Lin Sheng.    During the plenum, the participating members approved the  resolution on the work report given by the Liaoning Provincial  Discipline Inspection Commission at the plenum.</p>

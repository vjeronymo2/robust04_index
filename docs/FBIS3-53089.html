To contemplate such an eventuality, howsoever remote  it may be, cannot be accepted. Firstly, because Pakistan has so  far been insisting that its nuclear programme is of a peaceful  nature. And secondly, because such a statement coming from  Pakistan's Foreign Minister will only give an excuse to India  not to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. India would  project his statement abroad as a threat and start stockpiling  nuclear arms openly. The reason why Sardar Assef made that  statement, if at all, is not hard to find. His perception, as  also the perception of most Pakistanis, is that India is not  serious in solving the Kashmir problem. It wants to intensify  its brutal suppression of the freedom movement till all those  involved in it are killed or otherwise eliminated. By holding  talks with Pakistan, it only wishes to impress those foreign  powers which have been pressuring it to find a negotiated  settlement with Pakistan. It also wants to buy time. An  indication of that is the recent statement of the Indian Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao, in which he said that India would soon  solve the Kashmir problem in its favour. Provocative as this  and other statements of the Indian leaders may be (such as that  of the Defence Minister Dinesh Singh, who said that the  Kashmiris have only one choice, that of joining India), our  reaction ought to be of restraint.    After all, not all the peaceful means of tackling this  problem have yet been exhausted. Pakistan's efforts to rouse  international opinion against Indian obduracy have yet to begin.  The effort to mobilise public sentiment abroad against the  violation of human rights in Held Kashmir, which had to be  abandoned earlier, has yet to be revived. Fortunately, the  attitude of the UN Secretariat, which used to be of indifference  only a few months back, has changed. Its rebuttal of the Indian  Foreign Secretary's claim about the `irrelevance' of the UN  Resolutions has been quite firm and clear. We have to wait and  see if the world will stand by and condone the genocide of the  Kashmiris? We will also have to see if we, being driven to the  wall, are left with no way out. Only then we should think of  other solutions than of peace.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Somalis kill 3 Italian soldiers Somali gunmen killed three Italian soldiers and wounded 21 when they forced 800 Italian UN peacekeepers and 400 Somali police to retreat after a search for illegal weapons in Mogadishu yesterday, Reuter reports from Mogadishu. Lieutenant Colonel Giovanni Fiantini said the gunmen pinned down a convoy of six Italian tanks and up to 20 armoured cars for three hours. 'The general preferred to pull back and to return in the next days,' said an Italian military spokesman. Meanwhile the Italian cabinet agreed to send almost 2,500 servicemen to Somalia at the request of the United Nations and the US and a further 1,200 troops to support UN humanitarian operations in Mozambique, writes Robert Graham in Rome. In Bonn, Germany's parliament approved deployment of 1,700 troops to Somalia, limited to providing logistical support for other UN peacekeepers. The vote cleared the final hurdle for Germany's biggest deployment of ground forces abroad since the second world war.</p>

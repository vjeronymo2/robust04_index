Late last year, Axel Springer - publisher of Bild, the daily tabloid, Die Welt and several big regional newspapers and national magazines - fired off a lengthy questionnaire to its paper suppliers on their forest management policies.

Springer's action, unique in Germany, followed a campaign by the Hamburg office of Greenpeace which opposes many of the practices of the paper suppliers, especially clear-cutting. Greenpeace says it welcomes Springer's initiative and expects others to follow suit. Publishers like Springer are aware of their readers' concern about environmental issues. Its questionnaire was aimed at communicating the strength of this feeling to its suppliers in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Germany and Canada. All answered the questionnaire, in which Springer made no threats about future contracts. 'When an important paper buyer does something like this, it sends out signals,' says Florian Nehm, Springer's environmental representative. The company will draw up other questionnaires on such aspects of papermaking as plant emissions and use of chemicals. Publicly, the papermakers have reacted calmly. 'I can understand the action of the Springer company very well, being under such pressure from Greenpeace,' says Knut Kringstad, responsible for environmental affairs at Norske Skog, the Norwegian paper manufacturer. 'It was a very natural thing to ask suppliers how they run their forests.'</p>

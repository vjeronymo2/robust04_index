			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Britton turns in Pounds 2.32m loss BRITTON GROUP, the pack-aging company formed last October after the acquisition by Firstland Group of Gelpack Industrial, yesterday reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.32m for the year to end-December. That compared with losses of Pounds 743,000 last time incurred on the company's discontinued oil and gas activities. Mr Robin Williams, chief executive, said the acquisition of GIL was completed on November 2. Consequently, the results included less than nine weeks' contribution from the packaging operations and principally reflected a Pounds 2.1m loss on the sale of the oil and gas assets. Turnover for the year totalled Pounds 2.28m, of which Pounds 345,000 came from discontinued activities. For the previous year the figure was Pounds 393,000. Losses per share came out at 5.16p (3.34p) and, as foreshadowed, a token dividend of 0.03p is proposed.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CITY SEEKS TO LIMIT PEEP SHOW HOURS  </P> <P> Another round in the battle between the city of Garden Grove and the operators  of peep shows is scheduled for today as the city attempts to crack down on  alleged lewd activity and other problems at A-Z Books.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the city will appear before Superior Court Judge John C. Wooley  seeking to impose shorter operating hours on the adult bookstore and peep show  business at 8192 Garden Grove Blvd.  </P> <P> The store is open 24 hours a day. According to City Atty. Stuart C. Scudder,  the city will be seeking to limit the operating hours to between 8 a.m. and 8  p.m.  </P> <P> Residents of the apartment building behind the store have complained of  customers littering, making noise and committing lewd acts, Scudder said.  </P> <P> A police report prepared for the City Council said that undercover police  officers were solicited for lewd acts 15 times between October, 1988, and July,  1989. Also, a police officer has observed customers exposing themselves in  arcade booths in the peep show portion of the business.  </P> <P> "Were those acts all on the A-Z property, or just near it?" asked Roger  Diamond, attorney for the bookstore.  </P> <P> "There's a world of difference there. I don't have any evidence that lewd acts  are being committed on the property. If it's not on the property, that's  somebody else's problem. And as for the noise, there's a bar just a short  distance away that can account for some of the noise."  </P> <P> The city is also trying to get A-Z to remove the curtains from the booths of  its video arcade. While most of Garden Grove's seven adult bookstore and peep  show operators have agreed to conform with the city's ban on doors in the video  booths, A-Z Books replaced its doors with lacy curtains.  </P> <P> This week, the City Council voted 5-0 to tighten up the 1983 ordinance  governing doors and curtains so that the law reads "no partially or fully  enclosed booths shall be maintained." Diamond said that the ordinance doesn't  prohibit curtains. Moreover, he said, the store's curtains don't block the view  of exit signs that the city ordinance requires customers to be able to see.

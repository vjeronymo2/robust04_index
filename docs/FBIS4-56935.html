			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 9 May (NA) -- The Italian courts  today filed an extradition petition with Argentina against  former Nazi officer Erich Priebke, allegedly involved in the  killing of more than 300 people during World War II, who was  discovered in San Carlos de Bariloche last week.    Argentine Foreign Vice Minister Fernando Petrella announced  that the petition filed by the Italian courts will be "discussed  immediately." Petrella, however, made it clear that the Foreign  Ministry "only reviews" the petition, while it is the courts  that actually "thoroughly study the issue." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Mainly by using foreign  funds and imported power generating equipment, Huaneng  International Power Development Corporation (HIPDC) has fast  grown into a leading independent power producer (IPP) in the  world.    IPP refers to those specializing in power generation  wherever  it is necessary and without any prerequisites of building  massive power transmission grids.    HIPDC, a joint venture founded in 1985, was the first of its  kind aimed at raising funds, mostly foreign capital, to speed up  China's power construction. There is a great shortage of  electricity supplies compared with the swelling demand resulting  from China's rapid economic development.    This venture now has 11 power plants across China, with  operational generating capacity totaling 6,100 mw -- all  accomplished in just nine years.    It also has sub-stations of 8,620 mva [expansion unknown]  and  3,470 km of high voltage transmission lines, in addition to the  corporation's growing involvement in other trades and sectors.    According to a corporation source, a total of more than 2  billion U.S. dollars in export credits, mixed government loans  and commercial loans have been utilized over the past nine years.    Yu Minji, spokesman of HIPDC, said complete advanced power  generating units were imported from Western countries and Japan  to equip nine of the 11 plants now in operation.    He said that along with this procedure, advanced technology  was brought in to fill the gap in China's power industry.    The Shanghai Shidongkou Second power plant, for example, was  the country's first to install two 600 mw coal-fired  super-critical units, in a bid to raise fuel efficiency and  lower energy consumption.    The introduction of the fume-gas desulphurization equipment  in Luohuang power plant and the combined cycle gas/steam turbine  in Chongqing gas turbine power plant were also both "firsts" for  China.    These plants also adopted a management system and model  common in developed countries in order to upgrade themselves to  international standards. Their streamlined structure allows  them to operate with half the staff, or even less, usually  required by other Chinese plants with similar capacity.    Yu said the corporation is expanding. Four power plants --  Yingkou, Shantou, Nanjing and Beijing Co-Generation -- are under  construction.    He said that negotiations or preparations are being carried  out for another four projects -- two extension projects and  Dandong and Jinling power plants.    After their completion, the gross generating capacity of the  corporation is expected to reach 10,500 mw, the spokesman added.    The corporation's practice epitomized China's drive to tap  the international financial market for more power supplies. The  country's whole power generating capacity stands at 180,000 mw  and the figure needs to more than double by the end of this  century if China's thirst for power is to be eased.    Yu said his corporation will build another 8,000 mw of  generating capacity in seven years. More methods, such as joint  investment and project financing, will be tried to make use of  more foreign capital, he added.    Huaneng Power International, a company formed by HIPDC and  its partners, is scheduled to begin offering its shares globally  and is to be listed on the New York Stock Market later this year.    The company, composed of five power plants with their  generating capacity amounting to 2,900 mw, is one of the five  enterprises first approved by the State Council Securities  Commission for New York listing.</p>

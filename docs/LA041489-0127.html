			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY'S SCHEDULE FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival opens today  for two weeks at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas. Here is today's  schedule:  </P> <P> 'Phobia'  </P> <P> Australia, 1988, 86 min.  </P> <P>  6:35 p.m.  </P> <P>  Writer/director John Dingwall has fashioned what is essentially a  two-character horror story about an imprisoned woman and her tormentor. The  twist is that the heroine's confinement is purely psychological: She is a  friendless agoraphobic with a brutal, mind-raping husband, and the suspense  lies in whether she will gather the wherewithal to walk out the front gate of  her own house. The husband's bottomless catalogue of crafty bullying tactics  eventually becomes as wearying for us as for her. It's an exaggerated and  tiresome but often truthful portrait of the quintessential co-dependent  relationship. CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

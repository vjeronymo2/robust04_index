			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Compass Airlines joint bid to remain open A BID by the Republic of Nauru and an Australian merchant bank for Compass Airlines will remain open in spite of its rejection by the liquidator, the government's joint venture partner said yesterday. Mr Duke Minks, managing director of Austfin, an Australian merchant bank, said he was confident the ADollars 54.7m (Dollars 41.9m) bid for the airline would be accepted next week. Mr Ian Ferrier, the Compass liquidator, has signed a binding agreement to accept a rival offer of ADollars 50m for 75 per cent of Compass from Southern Cross Airlines, an Australian company seeking to enter the aviation market. However, Mr Minks said he believed Southern Cross might be unable to raise sufficient funds to finance the deal, leaving the field clear for the Nauru/Austfin offer. 'If we were given the go-ahead next week, we could start up 90 to 120 days after (reaching) a binding agreement,' he said. Mr Minks said the government of Nauru, a tiny Pacific island state, was keen to break into the Australian aviation market even if the liquidator continued to refuse to accept the offer. Under the joint venture proposals, the government of Nauru would own 75 per cent of Compass, with the balance being acquired by Austfin. Compass shareholders would receive ADollars 4.28m in cash, plus a 10 per cent discount on tickets for three years. Creditors would be given ticket vouchers worth ADollars 21.5m, and a further ADollars 29m in vouchers would be provided for customers holding unused tickets. Compass collapsed amid financial and customer confusion in December. Mr John Hutchinson, provisional liquidator of AAA Airlines, another putative entrant to the Australian market, said he would ask a New South Wales court today to adjourn winding-up proceedings for eight weeks.</p>

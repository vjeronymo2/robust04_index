			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Buoyant News Corp improves to ADollars 453m NEWS CORP, Mr Rupert Murdoch's Australia-based international media company, has announced a 27 per cent increase in after-tax operating profit to ADollars 452.8m (USDollars 305.9m) in the fiscal first-half to end-December, compared with ADollars 355.3m in the same period a year ago, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. Earnings per share fell to ADollars 1.09 compared with ADollars 1.10. News Corp said 'gains in operating profit were reported by almost all of the company's businesses.' It said Fox Broadcasting and Fox Television Stations in the US reported 'significant gains' compared with a year earlier. 'In addition, inserts, magazines and newspapers worldwide all posted particularly strong results in weak advertising environments. These gains were partially offset by lower earnings from Twentieth Century Fox Film and HarperCollins.' News Corp said the dividend would be increased 20 per cent to 1.5 cents. Profit before accounting for abnormal or unusual items rose 94 per cent to ADollars 490.1m from ADollars 252.2m. Sales rose 1 per cent to ADollars 5.33bn against ADollars 5.27bn.</p>

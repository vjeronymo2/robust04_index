			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Period <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim rule incorporates the provisions of Section 346 that establish the permissible length of the notice period. Under the interim rule, a notice is deemed approved by operation of law 60 days after receipt of a complete notice, unless extended as provided in Section 346. As provided in the statute, the interim rule provides that a notice is deemed complete when it contains all information required in the interim rule and all other information requested by the Board or the Reserve Bank in connection with the notice. The Board may extend the notice period for an additional 30 days upon notice to the bank holding company. If the proposal involves an unlisted activity, the Board may extend the notice period for a 90-day period in addition to the 30-day extension, provided the Board notifies the bank holding company and explains the reasons for this additional extension. Further extensions are only permissible in the event the Board determines to conduct a hearing on the proposal, or the notificant has consented to an extension or tolling of the notice period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rule adopts the provision in Section 346 that permits the Board to request additional information about a proposal at any time during the notice period. The rule also includes the provision of Section 346 that provides that the Board may deny any notice if the notificant neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish the Board all the information required by the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Abbreviated Notice Procedure for Small Acquisitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The interim rule retains the current abbreviated notice procedure contained in Regulation Y for small acquisitions of assets or shares of companies engaged in activities previously approved by the Board by regulation. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Currently, this abbreviated notice procedure may be used for acquisitions where neither the book value of the assets to be acquired nor the gross consideration to be paid for the securities or assets exceeds the greater of (i) $15 million or (ii) 5 percent of the consolidated assets of the acquiring company up to a maximum of $100 million. The interim rule retains this abbreviated notice procedure for small acquisitions of companies engaged in laundry list activities, and increases the size limitation for acquisitions that qualify for this procedure from a maximum of $100 million to a maximum of $300 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This procedure is only available to bank holding companies that meet the Board's Capital Adequacy Guidelines and are proposing to acquire a company engaged in activities for which the bank holding company has previously received System approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary benefit of the abbreviated notice procedure for small acquisitions is the shortened approval process realized by opting to publish public notice of the proposal in local newspapers in the communities affected by the proposal. Since this provision of Regulation Y was adopted, notificants have increasingly opted to publish notice of the proposed acquisition in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in order to conduct the nonbanking activity nationwide or throughout a geographic area so large that public notice of the proposal by means of local newspaper publication is unduly expensive or impracticable. Moreover, the streamlined notice procedure established by the interim rule would effectively shorten the notice period for all acquisitions involving listed activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Shakir] </F>   [Text] A major reshuffle of Prime Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali's cabinet is expected tomorrow. The  reshuffle will include 7-10 ministers. As is customary, all  ministers will place their resignations at the disposal of the  prime minister at a cabinet session today. Matters began to  take shape after His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the Prime  Ministry last Saturday, during which he presided over a cabinet  meeting. He praised the government efforts and the ministers'  services. It was reported that his majesty the king later paid  a long visit to Prime Minister al-Majali at his home.    The statements obtained by reporters after his majesty's  chairmanship of the cabinet meeting said that Jordan cannot much  lag behind other peace tracks and that the challenges facing  Jordan and the poor peace coordination with the Palestinian side  require a cabinet reshuffle to include all political trends in  the country in order to deal with the next phase.    Accordingly, Dr. al-Majali has over the last 48 hours held  consultations with a number of deputies and senators in their  capacity as representatives of the nation, and with various key  figures and political trends so that the cabinet reshuffle will  be based on a broader parliamentary base and will be acceptable  to the various political trends.    It was reported that some deputies may participate in the  government in their personal capacity. Other sources, however,  said Prime Minister al-Majali's consultations with some deputies  might have been confined to clarifying the various aspects of  the Jordanian policy and the accelerating developments of the  peace process and whether personalities from outside the House  of Representatives are acceptable to the various political blocs  and trends in the House.    It was reported that Dr. al-Majali contacted Senator Dhuqan  al-Hindawi to appoint him deputy prime minister with large  powers to run domestic affairs. However, sources close to  al-Hindawi neither confirmed nor denied such reports. It was  also reported that Dr. al-Majali, who is conducting most of his  consultations from his home, has already met with some deputies  and senators. Names from outside the House were mentioned to  fill some portfolios. Some sources expected Marwan al-Qasim to  be appointed deputy prime minister and minister of foreign  affairs. The names of Dr. Raja'i al-Mu'ashshir, Jawdat  al-Subul, 'Aql Biltaji, Dr. Muslih al-Tarawinah, and  academicians from Jordanian universities and former ministers  were also mentioned.    Once the cabinet reshuffle has taken place, major  appointments will be made. These include the post of director  general of the Radio and Television Corporation as well as  changes in ambassadors, secretaries general [of ministries], and  directors of state departments and institutions.</p>

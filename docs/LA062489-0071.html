			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO FUND OLYMPIC TRAINING CENTER IN S.D. GOES TO ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> The state Senate has approved use of $15 million in state funds to help develop  an Olympic training facility near San Diego, despite claims that the money  could be better used for other programs.  </P> <P> The upper house, by a 28-4 vote, on Thursday sent SB 1403 by Sen. William  Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) to the Assembly.  </P> <P> The measure would authorize the payment of $15 million to the San Diego  National Sports Training Foundation over three years, if the foundation raises  an equal amount.  </P> <P> The state is supposed to recover the funds, plus interest, through the sale of  $100 commemorative Olympic license plates to California motorists, according to  Campbell's proposal.  </P> <P> Campbell described the bill as an "exciting opportunity for California to take  the lead in providing unsurpassed training and support for athletes to compete  in national and international competition."  </P> <P> He said the facility would be the third in the country but the only one aimed  at training for the summer games.  </P> <P> Sen. Dan McCorquodale, D-San Jose, complaining about cuts in mental health  programs, suggested there were better ways to use the money.  </P> <P> Sens. Ed Davis (R-Northridge) and Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) suggested  that the city and county of San Diego should guarantee repayment of the money.  </P> <P> "It's not really a loan; it's a gift. It seems to me that this is the wrong way  to go," Rosenthal said, claiming there was enough money raised by the 1984  Olympics in Los Angeles to help pay for the training facility.  </P></p>

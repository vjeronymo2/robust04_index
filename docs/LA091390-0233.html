			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLECTOR BUYS 'WINGED FIGURE,' WILL DONATE IT TO MUSEUM;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY: THE ICARUS-THEMED PAINTING OF A NUDE MALE TORSO THAT HAD BEEN  COMMISSIONED -- THEN REJECTED -- FOR JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT, IS PURCHASED BY A  LAGUNA ART MUSEUM TRUSTEE.  </P> <P> Jim Morphesis' controversial painting "Winged Figure" will be donated to the  Laguna Art Museum by a longtime museum trustee who agreed Tuesday to buy the  work from the New York artist for an undisclosed amount.  </P> <P> "Winged Figure" is the Icarus-themed painting of a nude male torso commissioned  for a poster that was to commemorate the opening of the new terminal at John  Wayne Airport. The poster was squelched after an airport commissioner objected  to the painting as "inappropriate" to the occasion because of the nudity and  because it featured no airplanes.  </P> <P> Laguna Art Museum trustee Joan B. Rehnborg, whose private collection of  contemporary art includes three other Morphesis paintings, said she decided to  buy "Winged Figure" and give it to the museum as a way of "taking someone  else's missed opportunity and turning it into a nice opportunity for us."  </P> <P> Rehnborg also said her offer was meant as a vote of confidence in the artist.  </P> <P> "I respect and admire Jim's work a great deal," she said. "I like him very much  as a person. I saw the work here at the museum. It's a very strong work; it's  stunning. The museum's collection will be enhanced by it."  </P> <P> Although she would not specify how much she will pay Morphesis, Rehnborg said  the amount exceeds the $5,000 the artist had agreed to take as part of the deal  on the posters but said that it is less than he would ask if he was to sell  "Winged Figure" on the open market. "Our arrangement was a compromise, but it  was a price he was satisfied with," she said.  </P> <P> Museum spokeswoman Nancy Coop said the painting will be added to the museum's  permanent collection pending acceptance by the collections committee and by the  board of trustees, which are expected to approve the donation. "Winged Figure"  is scheduled to be exhibited at the museum Sept. 28 through Dec. 16.  </P> <P> Rehnborg describes herself as a "born-again" Christian and said that "the irony  of (that) struck me last night. . . . I get kidded about that a lot in the art  world. But I also have written my own letter to the President as well as a  dozen or so senators and congressmen asking for unrestricted reauthorization"  of the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> She said her collection focuses on artworks that include Christian symbology  and that the three Morphesis works she bought previously are from his  Crucifixion series.  </P> <P> "Jim's gift, as far as I'm concerned, is a gift from God. He's a beautiful  painter. It's great that he can share his gift this way," she said.  </P> <P> "The nudity" in "Winged Figure" "is very tasteful," she added. "It's a very  strong work of art overall."  </P> <P> She said she does not object to federal funding of more explicit works such as  the controversial photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe "because, No. 1,  I think there are far more obscene examples of pornography in the local video  store. And I would rather risk a little bad taste in art exhibits than have  someone else determining what is good taste for me."  </P></p>

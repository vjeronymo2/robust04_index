			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Wellcome shares slide on 14% real rise SHARES in Wellcome, the UK drugs group, fell 72p to 818p after the company posted disappointing underlying growth for the first six months. Pre-tax profits for the half-year to February 27 were at the top end of expectations, up 33 per cent from a restated Pounds 204.7m to Pounds 324.6m. However, excluding currencies the increase was 14 per cent. At the time of the Wellcome share issue last year analysts had been predicting annual profits growth of about 20 per cent. Mr John Robb, chief executive, said: 'I think the figures are pretty damned good given the environment has changed considerably over the last 12 months. The market's reaction shows how volatile and nervous it is to drugs stocks.' 'These are not easy times, with countries such as Germany, Italy, Spain and, to a lesser extent, the UK taking extreme measures against the pharmaceutical industry in an effort to control healthcare costs,' he said. European prices had declined since the same period last year and sales had been affected by health reforms in Germany. Turnover from continuing operations increased 22 per cent from Pounds 839m to Pounds 1.03bn. Excluding currencies the rise was 11 per cent. For prescription medicines the increase was 13 per cent, while the over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription division declined 3 per cent. Lack of growth in OTC business had partly been caused by 32 per cent growth the previous year, and partly by the low incidence this winter of coughs and colds, an area where Wellcome was particularly exposed, said Mr Robb. He added that competition in the US had been fierce. Mr Robb said the group was looking to set up a joint venture before the end of the year in OTC, probably as a junior partner. The intention was to broaden Wellcome's product base and exploit Zovirax, Wellcome's best-selling herpes and chickenpox treatment, in the OTC market. Excluding currencies, sales of Zovirax increased 17 per cent to Pounds 369m. Underlying revenues from Retrovir, the HIV medicine, increased 14 per cent to Pounds 131m. Trading margins improved to 30.5 per cent while spending on research and development increased 16 per cent to Pounds 153m. Earnings per share increased 33 per cent to 23.2p. The dividend is 4.8p (4p). Bumpy ride in US, Page 25 Lex, Page 20</p>

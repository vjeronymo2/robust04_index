			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] China is to name up to 400 community leaders to  serve as District Affairs Advisers with the first batch of about  100 to be appointed this month, sources say. Days after their  appointment premier Li Peng is to renew the appointment of the  first batch of 43 Hong Kong Affairs Advisers in Shenzhen on  March 2. The 43 received notification at the weekend from the  local branch of XINHUA (the New China News Agency) for the  Shenzhen trip.    Now on a swing in the southern cities including Zhuhai and  Shenzhen, the premier is scheduled to make his second tour to  the border city early next month to attend a celebration of the  completion of a mammoth water supply facility from the East  River to Hong Kong.    The strengthening of united front work comes as the first  piece of legislation on the 1994/95 elections is about to be  passed by the Legislative Council and the remaining  controversial parts are due to be tabled in the legislature.    According to sources close to XINHUA, the de facto embassy's  three district offices have begun finalizing the list of the  first batch of District Affairs Advisers. Formal invitation is  scheduled to be extended by heads of the three district offices  in Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and Sha Tin in the next fortnight.  The official appointment is expected to be made by the local  director of XINHUA, Zhou Nan. Unlike the Hong Kong Affairs  Advisers who were jointly appointed by XINHUA and the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Offce, the newly-created District Affairs  Advisers will only come under XINHUA.    The first batch of District Affairs Advisers would include  members of the district boards, area committees and mutual aid  committees which form the skeleton of the lower-tier political  structure under the British administration. A number of  District Affairs Advisers will be chosen from the hundreds of  traditional kaifong associations, residents groups and  neighborhood bodies in the territory. The source said it was  almost certain that core leaders from the United Democrats, seen  as subversive, would be excluded. But members of other liberal  political groups such as the Association for Democracy and  People's Livelihood might be enlisted.    The source maintained that, like the Hong Kong Affairs  Advisers, the District Affairs Advisers would not be working as  a group. "They will have regular meetings with XINHUA officials  and be consulted on territory matters," the source said.    The appointment of District Affairs Advisers means China  will  have its own three-tier consultative network in Hong Kong. Top  of the structure is the 30 Hong Kong members in the 57 strong  Preliminary Working Committee, which was formed under the  National People's Congress Standing Committee last summer to  pave the way for the setting up of the post 1997 region.  Further down will be the Hong Kong Affairs Advisers of which 91  local leaders in two batches have been named since 1992. The  third batch is expected to be appointed next month. The next  structure will be District Affairs Advisers, the idea for which  apparently came from Hong Kong people.    Beijing decided to seriously consider the idea about "one to  two months" ago in the face of the breakdown of Sino-British  talks, the source said.</p>

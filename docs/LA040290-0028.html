			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Eastwood Sues Tabloid: Actor Clint Eastwood has filed a $20-million lawsuit  against the Globe, accusing the supermarket tabloid of fabricating a front-page  story headlined, "Clint's Life Threatened by Nazi Cult." Eastwood's lawsuit,  filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, contends that the tabloid's Jan. 1 story,  featuring a photo of Eastwood holding a handgun, has put the actor's life in  danger. The Globe story says a group called the Aryan Nation had put a $100,000  bounty on Eastwood's life because the actor refused to speak at the  organization's convention in Washington.

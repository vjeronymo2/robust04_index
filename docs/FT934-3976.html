			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Caldera breaks mould in Venezuela Mr Rafael Caldera, a 77-year-old lawyer, has won the presidential election in Venezuela, according to official figures released yesterday by the Supreme Electoral Council. The outcome represents a big shift in modern Venezuelan politics. Mr Caldera, running as an independent supported by 17 small political parties, broke the control that the country's two mainstream political parties, Democratic Action (represented in the presidential race by Mr Claudio Fermn) and the Christian Democrat Copei party (represented by Mr Oswaldo Alvarez Paz) have exercised over the presidency for 35 years. Mr Caldera, who founded Copei in 1946, left the party he created to launch his presidential candidacy. The outcome also is a defeat for advocates of free-market economic policies, which began to be implemented in Venezuela in 1989. Caldera and Velasquez opposed these policies; Fermn and Alvarez backed them. Votes from the poll on Sunday are still being counted but Mr Caldera, who was president in 1969-74, had 28.5 per cent of tallied votes yesterday, followed by Mr Velasquez with 27 per cent, Mr Alvarez with 22 per cent, and Mr Fermn with 21 per cent. Mr Fermn, a former mayor, recognised Mr Caldera's victory on Sunday night. Mr Velasquez, a labour leader, and Mr Alvarez, a former state governor, followed suit yesterday. There were no results yesterday in the congressional races held on Sunday, but the next Congress is expected to be fragmented, rather than dominated by Democratic Action and Copei as it was. Mr Caldera, speaking to reporters, said that he did notknow which aspects of the free-market reform programme in place would be discarded. See feature</p>

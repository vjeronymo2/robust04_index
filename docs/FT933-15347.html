			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Bayer criticises curb on drugs bill BAYER UK, the subsidiary of the German chemicals group, yesterday attacked the government's proposed system to control the growing National Health Service drugs bill. Mr Klaus Behrendt, director of UK pharmaceuticals at Bayer, said the system was worse than anything in the rest of Europe. He added: 'The British have a reputation for fair play, but this system is not transparent. We have no idea what the rules are.' The health service drugs bill was Pounds 3.4bn last year. According to IMS International, market researchers, spending on drugs in the UK increased by 11 per cent in the first four months of this year compared with the same period last year. Mr Behrendt criticised the decision to extend the blacklist of products which the health service will no longer provide. About 625 products could be affected and the first recommendations of a committee set up to decide which treatments should go on the list have been sent to drug companies. Mr Behrendt said the cheapest rather than most effective or safe remedies were being recommended by the committee. However, companies were being told their more expensive products would be used by the health service if prices were cut to the same level as the cheapest product. Mr Behrendt said: 'The government has, in effect, introduced a system of reference pricing (paying for a drug at the price of the cheapest product in its area) through the back-door. This is very unfair. If innovative products can no longer create a premium, there is little point launching new products on the market.' The Department of Health said yesterday that limited lists were introduced to make sure effective and cost-effective medicines were used by the health service. However, it is understood that sections of the department are in favour of reference pricing systems. Mr Behrendt said: 'Most companies in the UK are not complaining because they aren't affected. But once the system is in place it could be extended to cover all medicines. The industry, which is highly fragmented, must tackle the issue. The whole sector could be affected if there are further extensions.'</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> One takeover does not a market make. Georgia Pacific's unsolicited bid to take  over Great Northern Nekoosa last week gave the Dow Jones Industrial Average  hope as it rose 33 points, making up some of the previous week's 92-point  plunge.  </P> <P> Monday, the market gave it all back and then some. The Dow lost 47 points as  investors are lowering earnings expectations in the aftermath of disappointing  third-quarter results, said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas  Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> San Diego stocks, particularly savings and loans, have been in their own bear  market, Katz said. HomeFed continued to plunge as analysts lowered projected  earnings estimates for 1989 and 1990. The stock closed Monday at $32.125, down  from its October high of $47.50. Great American Bank hit a new low of $8.25,  dropping $.375 for the week, while Imperial Corp. of America gained $.75 and  continued a recovery from the previous week's low of $1.50.  </P> <P> New lows were also recorded by Chart House Enterprises, Rohr Industries,  Biomagnetic Technologies, Intermark and Mission West Properties.  </P> <P> The only new high by a local stock was the result of a takeover. Chugai  Pharmaceutical of Japan began a $6.25 per share bid for Gen-Probe stock. The  stock, which went public in 1987 at $7, was selling in the $3 range when the  offer was made, causing an instant doubling in price.  </P></p>

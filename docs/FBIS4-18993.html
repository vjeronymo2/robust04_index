			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Theo </F> Sommer; place and date not given: "Europe Must Not Become a  Loser"]    [Text] [Sommer] Mr. Chancellor, what belongs together is  gradually coming together in Europe. Are you satisfied with the  results of Austria's European Union [EU] membership negotiations?    [Vranitzky] I am satisfied with the result of the membership  negotiations. We stood our ground and realized our objectives  in virtually all the fields of particular importance to us. The  transit treaty in its present form is actually an improvement of  the original version. Therefore, one can tell the Tiroleans  with reason and good conscience that they have won something.  In addition, the transit treaty provides for the speedy  alternative of rail transportation, in many places underground,  including the Brenner Pass tunnel. And our farmers are well  off. Bavarian Minister President Stoiber visited us recently.  He said that, after the conclusion of our negotiations, he now  has to explain to his mountain farmers why Austrian mountain  farmers are treated better.    [Sommer] How friendly are the Austrians toward Europe after  the conclusion of the negotiations? If the referendum were held  tomorrow....    [Vranitzky] ...we would have a majority of positive votes.    [Sommer] The referendum will be held in June, and the  parliament will deal with the treaty in May?    [Vranitzky] Our treaty has already been submitted to the  parliament here. However, we have to wait for final adoption  until the European Parliament has made a decision. Its final  deadline is 4 May.    [Sommer] Since the last elections in three of your provinces  the question has sometimes been asked whether a radical domestic  policy change in Austria is imminent that might run counter to  your willingness to become a member. What importance should be  attached to the anti-European factor, Haider?    [Vranitzky] One has to start with the knowledge that both  the political prerequisites and the election results in the  three provinces were quite different. By the way, Haider's  attitude has resulted in the formation of blocs in the Freedom  Party of Austria [FPOe]; many people in the party take an  absolutely positive view of integration. Provincial  organizations in individual provinces will dissociate themselves  from Haider as party chairman; today nobody can tell yet whether  Haider will decide in favor of or against EU membership in the  end.    [Sommer] Does the question of Austrian neutrality still play  a role in connection with entry into the EU?    [Vranitzky] Insofar as more than 50 percent of our people  are in favor of maintaining neutrality.    [Sommer] Even after the end of the Cold War and the  confrontation of the blocs in Europe?    [Vranitzky] Even after these developments. One must neither  underestimate nor ignore the emotional value [of neutrality].  For a country that was involved in either war or civil war,  occupied, or otherwise disrupted until about 1955, it has  primarily to do with the attainment of independence and  identity. Therefore, I am particularly glad that we have found  a consensus with the EU members by our clear declaration that we  also want and are able to participate in the development of a  European security system on the basis of our neutrality.    [Sommer] You will participate in the development of an EU  security policy identity?    [Vranitzky] That's right. Neutrality is not affected by a  joint security policy. This is also the reason we have not  abandoned neutrality overnight. As soon as a visible and  recognizable European security system is developed, it will also  be possible to discuss neutrality far more calmly in this  country.    [Sommer] Austria is not considering closer involvement with  NATO or even becoming a NATO member, which is desired by many  Central European countries?    [Vranitzky] We are indeed not discussing NATO membership.    [Sommer] But you would not rule out membership in the  Western European Union, either associate status or as a full  member?    [Vranitzky] I would not rule it out.    [Sommer] How will Austria change after entry? What will you  get? What will be made easier for you?    [Vranitzky] I start with the premise that today Austria is  already one of the most integrated countries in the field of  economy and commerce. We transact two-thirds of our trade with  EU countries. This share is far higher than the share of many  EU members.    It is also undeniable that the development of the single  market will result in disadvantages for those who do not belong  to it. The longer it takes, the more this disadvantage will  increase.    Moreover, in the so-called European treaties, the EU  concluded free trade agreements with the Visegrad states that  are in this way better off than us. These disadvantages cannot  be eliminated in another way than by our entry. That is to say  that we will formalize a very intensive relationship and  eliminate disadvantages from one moment to the other by our  entry.    [Sommer] How must the EU change if the present round of  enlargement is to be successful and, in addition, one aims at  further expansion to the east?    [Vranitzky] The political voting mechanisms should become  more conclusive and gain in substance. The EU is now reaching a  new dimension, the next substantive step. The enforcement of  certain principles of order is no longer at issue here. Rather,  it must be important to jointly develop structural measures,  politically resolve them, and then implement them.    [Sommer] Do you also feel that there is a lack of  democracy in the Community?    [Vranitzky] From the point of view of someone who is still  an outsider, one certainly has to show understanding for the  fact that countries with functioning parliamentary democracies  on a national level also do not want to do without a functioning  parliamentary democracy at the level of integration.    [Sommer] Some people have lately voiced the fear that the  enlargement by Austria and Scandinavia will "Germanize" the old  Community and an imbalance in favor of the north might replace  the imbalance in favor of the south, about which many are  complaining today. The original European Community was a  Carolingian community. Now a piece is being added to it.    [Vranitzky] A combination of Kaiser Wilhelm and Metternich  or something of that sort.    [Sommer] From the point of view of history, one could say  that a Habsburg element is being added. Romans, Germans, and  Slavs will be unified in the future Europe.    [Vranitzky] If the EU is to truly integrate, it probably has  to be expected that other elements yet to be historically  defined will be added.    [Sommer] The idea of a EU with 24 or even 30 members does  not worry you?    [Vranitzky] No. Then we will certainly have to basically  consider the institutions. The statutes of the club will have  to be different if the number of the club members increases that  much. I do not assert that everything will be simpler then.  The challenges will increase. However, if we reduce the idea  of integration to its original idea, that is, to establish  security and peace, this objective has already been reached in  the present circle of members. It has become inconceivable for  one to aim a gun at the other again. There is no justification  whatsoever for stopping at borders when this objective is  pursued.    [Sommer] Will the next group enter the EU en bloc like the  countries of the European Free Trade Association now? Or will  readiness for entry have to be judged more according to the  individual capacity of the candidate countries?    [Vranitzky] It is not easy to predict. However, there seems  to be a trend toward individualization. But I believe that we  will be busy with the expansion to the east in the next decade.    [Sommer] What is your concept of the future EU? Will it be  a confederation? A federal state? Or, as the Constitutional  Court in Karlsruhe said, a union of states?    [Vranitzky] Provided that this debate is not primarily an  academic one, I believe that what we call federalism in a  national state is probably the most obvious model. This would  also be in line with the subsidiarity principle according to  Maastricht.    [Sommer] Will the EU become a big bloc in addition to the  two big blocs that are already beginning to appear now, that is,  the North American and the Asian-Japanese? And do you  anticipate confrontations or cooperation between these  structures?    [Vranitzky] I do not like to use the word "bloc" because, on  the one hand, it expresses monopolization and, on the other, it  might confirm the reproach that Europe is developing into the  "fortress of Europe." European integration is to create a  certain framework of order and rules of behavior; it is to  formulate and implement policies without restricting peoples or  individuals. The first challenge would be to guarantee these  areas.    The second challenge is to come to an understanding with the  rest of the world beyond these forms of integration. For  example, in the economically very successful Asian countries  there are certain views of social standards, the standard of  living, individual rights, human rights, and democracy rights  that do not correspond to ours. The danger that I see is if  these different views are used to strengthen competitiveness in  competition with other areas. Thus, if some Asian states say  coolly and bluntly: "We do not want to achieve a living  standard such as that of the Europeans because we think that the  defense of it over decades is too difficult," we are worlds  apart in this respect. However, we have to take care that, in  this division of the world, Europe does not permanently lose,  which is currently beginning to show to a certain extent.    [Sommer] Do you think we in Europe again capable of offering  work to our people without reducing our standard of living, our  social standard?    [Vranitzky] Even though we in Europe currently anticipate  the first signs of an economic stimulation and are delighted by  it, one must clearly state: If a basic problem is that the  strengthening of Europe's competitiveness means almost  exclusively a reduction of jobs in industry and the industrial  environment, there are not enough alarm bells ringing in Europe  because the next aspect of such a development would be a threat,  a danger to the present standards of our social security.  Certainly the answer cannot be in the reduction of the European  income level.    [Sommer] We cannot adopt the hourly wages of southern China.    [Vranitzky] Precisely. And the answer cannot be the  reduction of social security either, if only because for  humanitarian reasons. The answers that one must find and give  lie in overcoming what I would call the third industrial  revolution. We have to become the new leader in technology,  production, finding markets, cooperation, and systems  engineering through research, development, education, training,  and the best possible mobilization of human capital.    [Sommer] Can the economy achieve that on its own or does it  need the state's protective or even guiding hand for it?    [Vranitzky] This question is essential. I am firmly  convinced that the economy needs support from the state. The  very clever question was once asked: How much of the state does  the market need? Politicians have to define the answer to it  always anew. Meanwhile, even the most committed market economy  experts realize that the market or the market economy cannot  work without a certain guiding network, a network of state  management and services.    [Sommer] What will thousand-year-old Austria bring to  Europe in the way of historical experience?    [Vranitzky] We must ensure that with the process of reform  and the restoration of democracy that is underway in the former  communist states, the European West and my country in particular  do not turn away from the reform states for political reasons or  isolate those states permanently.    What I mean by that is: When, following parliamentary  elections in those reform countries, a political grouping is  formed that does not correspond exactly to our Western model, we  distance ourselves. That should not be the case. I fear that  the Western democracies will not be able to choose what  preferences and priorities our brothers and sisters in the east  develop.    Furthermore, now that there is a glimmer of hope that the  armed conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina can be brought to an end,  one must support efforts that really will seen an end to the  conflict. However, we already have to start thinking about what  will happen after the conflict: What would we do to assist in  the reconstruction of these regions that have been destroyed?  How will we overcome the isolation of those who are currently  outcasts?    [Sommer] Whom do you mean? The Serbs?    [Vranitzky] For example. One must in general give the  postcommunist countries a chance to develop a new mentality, a  chance to transform their own systems. There are some who  believe that free market economy evidently cannot be created in  Ukraine. That is why there is a distancing from Ukraine.  However, without a basic readiness on our part for cooperation,  Ukraine will not be able to develop a free market economy. Also  those who have a bad record on human rights are kept at arm's  length. We must win them over to treating human rights in the  way that we decide within the CSCE [Council for Security and  Cooperation in Europe] or the European Council. We should not  always say: "We do not want to have anything at all to do with  you," but "we would like to have something to do with you, but  create the appropriate conditions."    [Sommer] As Foreign Minister Mock put it, Austria lies on  the edge of a storm zone. You have mentioned Ukraine. Vienna  is closer to the Ukrainian border than to the city of Bregenz.  In the north, you witnessed how Czechoslovakia fell apart after  75 years. On your southern border, you have witnessed how  Yugoslavia has fallen apart.    [Vranitzky] The statistics of European wars shows clearly  that most wars arose as a result of threats in southern and East  Europe. That is why European integration is so important:  Europe must treat the task of achieving peace in a courageous  and resolute manner, even if this venture will undoubtedly take  years and decades and in some respects appears to be impossible  today. However, utopias were on very many occasions the engine  of development, not restrictions, limitations.    [Sommer] During the EU negotiations in Brussels, cooperation  between Bonn and Vienna was very good.    [Vranitzky] Yes.    [Sommer] During our thousand-year-old relationship, we have  experienced some happy periods and some unhappy ones. What will  be the hallmarks of this new phase in Austrian-German relations?    [Sommer] I believe that the qualitative element in future  politics will involve introducing historical and cultural  relations into a common Europe in a way that will always make it  possible to cultivate and develop other relations.    We have an existing historical and cultural relationship  between Germany and Austria. However, the wisdom and art of  politics, above all in view of the relationship, must involve  developing new, promising relations.</p>

The Indian people have made great strides in their efforts  to  consolidate national independence and build a prosperous new  society since the foundation of the republic, MINJU CHOSON in a  by-lined article says, and continues:    The Republic of India, one of the founders of the  Non-Aligned  Movement, is pursuing the non-aligned foreign policy. India is  developing the friendly and cooperative relations with different  countries including neighbouring countries and striving for  peace in Asia and the rest of the world.    The Governments and peoples of Korea and India, non-aligned  countries in Asia, established the bonds of friendship and  cooperation long ago and have developed it.    The Korean people, believing that the ties between the two  peoples will further strengthen in future, sincerely hope that  the Indian people will make greater progress in the endeavours  for the independent development and prosperity of the country.</p>

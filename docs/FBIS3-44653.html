Reviewing our work over the past year, we can see in retrospect  that with the encouragement of the Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the  spirit of the 14th party congress, and the "Resolution" adopted  by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  the whole party and the people of all nationalities of the  country have attained heartening accomplishments in deepening  reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating the pace of  development. At present, our country is enjoying a sound  situation featuring economic growth, political stability,  national unity, and social progress. A retrospective of our  work over the past year will give us encouragement to work  harder and strive for greater achievements in the coming year.  To this end, this newspaper herwith opens a special column "'93  Yearender," in the hope that it can become a window showing the  rapid changes that have taken place on the Divine Land in the  past year.    At the end of the year, latest figures released by the State  Statistics Bureau showed that since the beginning of this year,  the state's fixed-asset investment in the communications and  transportation industry exceeded 80 billion yuan for the first  time, making up 17 percentage points of the total investment by  state- owned units. Construction of China's basic  communications facilities has begun to enter a historical phase  of large-scale development. China's extensive communications  framework is taking shape gradually -- a comprehensive  transportation network system based on the well-coordinated  operation of railroads, high-grade highways, major coastal  ports, inland river routes, and key airports.  <H3>  Railroad: Winning the Very First Victory in a Decisive  Three-Year Battle </H3>   In December, the construction of the 1,000-li  Beijing-Kowloon  Railroad was in full swing: Tracks were being laid and a bridge  erected to the north of the Huang He; infrastructure [xian xia  4848 0007] projects were going full steam ahead; to the south of  the Chang Jiang, construction was being unfolded in a  comprehensive way. The first year of the construction of the  Beijing-Kowloon Railroad, which is a "key project of all key  projects" launched by the Ministry of Railways during the Eighth  Five-Year Plan, has entailed more than 2 billion yuan of  investment and has won its very first victory.    This is the first year of a decisive three-year battle  launched by the Ministry of Railways. The curtain of the  railroad construction was drawn open at a time when the rail car  utilization rate of major bottleneck sections had gone down to  40 percent and the potential-tapping renovation had yielded no  result. A total of 11 key projects started construction at the  same time in almost all provinces, autonomous regions,and  municipalities. At the end of the year, the construction of a  number of key projects scheduled to for completion at the end of  the Eighth Five-Year Plan, had reached a high tide, including  the Beijing-Kowloon Railroad, the Lanzhou- Xinjiang Multitrack  Railroad, the Baoji-Zhongwei Railroad, the Houma-Yueshan  Railroad, the Zhejiang-Ganzhou Multitrack Railroad, the  electrification renovation of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railroad, as  well as the renovation projects concerning the Hengyang North,  Zhuzhou North, and Guangzhou North Railroad Stations. After  these projects are completed and put into operation, China's  transportation capacity will increase by 200 million tonnes.    Next year is a crucial one for the "decisive three-year  battle" of railroad construction. By the end of the Eighth  Five-Year Plan, China's operational railroad mileage will total  60,000 km, the rates of multitrack and electrification will  reach 30 and 23 percent respectively, the handling capacity of  railroads will increase considerably, and the present tight  transportation situation will be alleviated.  <H5>  Water, Land, and Air: Each Enjoying Major Breakthroughs </H5>   A new chapter also has been opened with the construction of  highways -- another of China's major means of land  transportation. A modern highway network has taken shape which  focuses on highways for the exclusive use of vehicles and aims  to achieve the goal of "two verticals and two laterals" across  the country.    Construction of three high-grade highways between Beijing  and  Shanghai, Beijing and Shenyang, and Chongqing and Beihai, has  been accelerated, while technical renovation is being carried  out of the "two verticals and two laterals" -- the national  trunk lines between Tongjiang and Sanya, Beijing and Zhuhai,  Shanghai and Chengdu, and Lianyungang and Horgos -- with the aim  of upgrading these trunk lines at an early date. Within two  years, China will have an additional 90,000 km of highways, and  an additional 30,000 km of second-grade highways. As a result,  China's highway situation will be improved considerably,  transportation capacity will be enhanced immensely, and the  average driving speed on national trunk lines can exceed 50 km  per hour, thus giving full play to the advantages of highway  transportation: speed, convenience, and flexibility.    This year, departments in charge of water transportation  have given priority to solving problems caused by lack of  unloading capacity at ports, and have designed and built a large  number of modern ports with deep-water berths. By 1995, the  coal loading capacity of coastal ports will reach about 120  million tonnes. After the completion of coal ports in Dalian,  Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as well as power station ports in  Waigoqiao, Shenzhen, and Zhanjiang, the coal unloading capacity  of these places also will reach 130 million tonnes, thus  obtaining a basic balance between loading and unloading  capacities. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan, a total of more  than 100 deep-water berths are being built up in coastal ports,  with newly added handling capacity of 140 million tonnes.    China's civil aviation industry, which is enjoying a 30  percent increase in transportation volume each year, has placed  its focus on the construction of airport support facilities this  year. Airports are being built in (or moved to) Wuhan, Guiyang,  Shijiazhuang, Guilin, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and  Sanya; while a number of key airports have been expanded and  renovated, including those in Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, Lhasa,  Harbin, Urmuqi, and Lanzhou. By the end of this century, the  total number of China's civil airports will reach 146; the total  volume of circular flow of civil aviation transportation will  reach 12.2 billion tonne/km; and the passenger transport volume  will reach 100 billion, thus basically meeting the needs of  economic development and exchanges with foreign countries.  <H3>  Next Year: Foreign Investment Will Be Utilized in More  Fields </H3>   Li Duanshen, director of the Transportation Department of  the  State Planning Commission, said during an interview the other  day: "This year, China has made unprecedented investment in the  construction of basic transportation facilities, and has  attained in many fields a rapid progress not seen for many  years. China's tight communications and transportation  situation is expected to be eased by the end of this century.  During the last seven years of the 1990's, the state will start  nearly 400 large- and medium-scale communications and  transportation projects, entailing investment of more than 700  billion yuan. However, we are still faced with the problem of  insufficient funds."    In order to attract more funds, the state will adopt in the  coming several years a series of effective measures to allow  foreign investors to participate in the construction of  communications projects. With a view to enhancing the  efficiency of investment, while encouraging Sino-foreign joint  ventures or solely foreign- owned companies to build up highways  and ports, and encouraging joint ventures to build up railroads  and civil airports (excluding the aviation management system),  the state will allow investors to engage in comprehensive  compensation trade within a preset scope in districts along  railroad lines and high-grade highways, and in port areas.    The year 1993 is one in which China's communications  construction is striving to extricate itself from a low ebb and  to make major breakthroughs. Under the guidance of the state's  macroeconomic policies to check the "bottleneck" restrictions  and with the backing of huge funds designated by the state, the  country now is gradually improving the conditions of national  trunk lines, including thoroughfares for coal transportation  centering on energy bases in the "three Xi's [Shanxi, Shaaxi,  and western Mongolia]"; passenger transport thoroughfares  centering around large and medium-sized cities; and trunk  transportation lines among all major economic regions and with  foreign counties. In addition, the country also is striving to  coordinate the operation of water, land, and air transportation.  At present, the framework of China's comprehensive  communications network -- which consists of trunk lines, feeder  lines, ports, and station hubs -- has taken initial shape.</p>

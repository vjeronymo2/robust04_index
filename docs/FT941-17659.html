			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Railtrack The Treasury seems finally to be warming to the transport sector. After its consent to the extension of Eurotunnel's franchise, it has now reduced the return requirements on Railtrack for the early years of rail privatisation. In its first year, Railtrack, which is to operate the track and signalling under the new arrangements, will only have to generate enough revenues to earn a 5 per cent return on capital. This is welcome evidence of a more pragmatic approach - but the target will rise in stages to 8 per cent and the Treasury has still not given much away. Railtrack has lost the other part of the argument - that its track should be valued at less than its replacement cost of around Pounds 7bn. A lower valuation would have reduced the amount Railtrack needed to earn to hit its return target and hence its charges to the private operators, who will actually run the trains. The government must hope its modest concession on return targets will stimulate flagging interest among bidders for such operating franchises. Yet the attraction of low initial charges to train operators is limited. They will also need a franchise long enough to allow for the depreciation of rolling stock. Railtrack could help by meeting the escalation in its profits target entirely through cutting costs, rather than by raising charges to franchisees.</p>

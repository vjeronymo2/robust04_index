			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the General Committee of the </F> General People's Congress on the first anniversary of the 27  April 1993 Yemeni parliamentary elections; dated 26 April]    [Text] Today, Wednesday, is the first anniversary of the  legendary legislative elections held by our great Yemeni people  on 27 April 1993. On that day, they realized an unprecedented  historic achievement. They accomplished the greatest and most  fundamental democratic and strategic mission along the road to a  united Yemen, and toward establishing the foundations of its  shura-inspired and democratic system of government on the basis  of political pluralism and a multiparty system, and in  accordance with the principle of universal suffrage, and direct  and secret balloting. This sought to consecrate the principle  of popular participation, as well as the peaceful and democratic  exchange of authority.    Our people have accomplished this great mission with  matchless success, and in an honorable democratic competition,  the fairness of which was attested to by all fraternal and  friendly parties which closely watched the [words indistinct]  elections. Thus, our people managed to occupy their special  position among all peoples of the civilized community of nations  in the course of efforts to build a democratic community on the  basis of free choice, as well as peaceful and democratic  competition. By so doing, our people demonstrated that there  was no longer any room within their ranks for any form of  tyranny, (?parochialism), or tribalism, which could rehabilitate  the imamate regime, colonial rule, and the humiliating  partitioning, particularly since the injustice and darkness of  these worn-out totalitarian systems of government have been cast  away by time, and brushed aside by the winds of change and  transformation.    On this occasion, the General People's Congress [GPC]  appeals  to all Yemeni national forces [words indistinct] to reiterate  their commitment to the democratic course being pursued by our  people and our unified state. Since the inception of the  Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990, the GPC has sought to  epitomize this course in order to set a splendid example in  terms of respect for and compliance with this course for other  national parties and political organizations. It has been doing  so by democratizing its action programs.    There is no denying that the GPC has encountered several  difficulties along this road since the beginning of the  transitional period on 22 May. Nonetheless, the GPC was careful  not to allow these difficulties to become an excuse for  abandoning this course, or for revoking its commitment to hold  the elections in order to enable the people to cast their votes  and to make their choices through the election of their  representatives to the first elected legislative body. Given  all this, the GPC has spared no effort to do all that could have  been done to convince others of the need to promote the march of  unity and democracy to help implement the constitution of a  unified Yemen, which was approved in a national referendum, so  that Yemen may establish its political system on the basis of  the constitutional legitimacy gained through direct and free  elections.    In this regard, there is no need to explain the efforts the  GPC has made, or to detail the extensive dialogues and meetings  it has held, or even to the moves it has made to safeguard the  dignity of all sides, particularly [words indistinct] to  reassure them, and help them overcome the fears they had about  their future in the context of the political pluralism of united  Yemen. The strongest evidence of this was the fact that the GPC  leadership and bodies expressed a willingness to merge with the  YSP so the two parties could share the same destiny and fate,  not to mention that the GPC proposed other formulas for [words  indistinct] alliance with the (?YSP). However, all these  proposals have not, regrettably, met with any measure of  favorable response or understanding. There is no doubt that our  people are well aware that our partners in the unity deal  actually agreed to take part in the elections only after the GPC  had provided them with guarantees, made concessions to them, and  demonstrated goodwill toward them.    When the elections were held under the close scrutiny and  observation of Arabs and international agencies, those who  supervised the election process had no doubts at all about the  fairness and honesty of the elections. Although some  undemocratic practices were committed by some people during  their election campaigns and the balloting process, the overall  election process earned the admiration and appreciation of the  entire world community.    It never dawned on the GPC that its landslide victory in  these elections would provoke the grudges of some parties,  particularly in the aftermath of the emergence of the Yemeni  Reform Grouping as a major political force in the country.    Out of a desire to ward off some of the consequences of this  development, the GPC gave up some of its constitutional rights  to safeguard and promote national unity. Consequently, it  [words indistinct] with the YSP and the Yemeni Reform Grouping  in a national government coalition that epitomized the spirit of  sharing the burdens of national responsibilities. It also  agreed that the prime minister of this coalition government  would be a YSP official, and the speaker of the parliament  [words indistinct]. Moreover, the GPC gave up a third seat it  was entitled to hold on the Presidential Council [words  indistinct) to be agreed upon and approved by the House of  Representatives. Once the agreements regarding these amendments  were signed, the GPC, just like other national forces and  organizations, as well as all local, Arab, and international  quarters, were surprised by the return of YSP Secretary General  brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid from [words indistinct] homeland to  the city of Aden. By his action, he refrained from taking the  constitutional oath as vice president. He made this move to  avoid assuming his duties within the Presidential Council.  Since then, he has been in a new seclusion, the aim of which is  to preclude the endorsement of these agreements, obstruct the  work of state institutions, and flagrantly undermine the results  of the elections held on 27 April, not to mention other serious  practices and transgressions that are jeopardizing and  prejudicing the unity of the homeland.    We should also recall the desperate and flagrant attempts  being made by some renegade and separatist forces to  misrepresent facts in order to cover up for their positions,  which are diametrically opposed to the results of the general  parliamentary elections. These forces are demonstrating  indifference to and boastful disregard for the people's will,  decisions, and unionist and democratic choices, which they made  on two occasions: First when they headed for polling stations  to vote in favor of the draft Constitution of unified Yemen, and  then when they headed for polling stations to elect their  representatives to their legislative branch of government. It  is peculiar that some of these isolationist leaders have  relished this crisis. They do not have any sense of shame, any  conscientiousness, or any honorable [words indistinct] that  could deter them from proceeding with their efforts to mislead  the public, deceive citizens, and promote their false  allegations, which aim to tarnish the image of the historic  accomplishment made by our people on 27 April 1993. These  forces also seek to obstruct the determined efforts of [words  indistinct] our homeland to promote its unity and build its  democratic political system of government, oblivious to the fact  that these reckless attempts will always fail to undermine the  people's awareness. Likewise, they will not make us budge a  hairbreadth from our positions and democratic course, which we  chose and adopted when the Republic of Yemen came into being on  22 May 1990.    On the first anniversary of the general parliamentary  elections, the GPC would like to extend its heartfelt  congratulations to the masses of our Yemeni people, who forged  the 27 April victory, in which the eternal [words indistinct]  vindicated their democratic option, their will, and their strong  and unswayable faith in the unity of the homeland. Similarly,  the GPC would like to reiterate its firm commitment to  respecting our people's constants with regard to unity and  democracy. Likewise, it reiterates its adherence to its  legitimate constitutional right to defend all the gains [words  indistinct] of our masses. It announces once again its firm  convictions that any solution to the current impasse in the  country should not undermine any of the sacred historical  national constants cherished by our people, chief among which  are the following: Compliance with the Constitution of unified  Yemen, the only text that enjoyed national consensus; the  activation of the legitimate elected bodies, headed by the House  of Representatives; the holding of meetings by the state's  leading institutions so they may perform their duties;  expediting the full implementation of the accord document; and  ending once and for all military, political, and media  repercussions of the crisis.    The GPC would like to reiterate that these constants are the  only tenets that can safeguard our people's unity, democratic  option, and eternal revolution.    May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.    [Signed] The GPC    [Dated] 26 April 1994</p>

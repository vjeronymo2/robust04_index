			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'FESTERING HATRED' FUELED STOCKTON KILLER;  </P> <P> SCHOOLYARD MASSACRE LINKED TO TREND OF ATTACKS ON MINORITIES  </P> <P> A "festering hatred" of racial and ethnic minorities drove Patrick Purdy to  massacre five children in a Stockton schoolyard last January, an extreme  example of a growing trend of hate crimes, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said  Friday.  </P> <P> In an extensive report on the life, habits and psychological makeup of the  troubled young drifter who killed himself after firing 105 rounds from an AK-47  into the crowded Cleveland Elementary School playground, Van de Kamp said his  investigators concluded that the 24-year-old had been obsessed with a hatred of  Cambodians, Indians, Pakistanis and especially Vietnamese.  </P> <P> Even his last known spoken words -- made to a fellow guest at a cheap motel in  Stockton as he prepared to get into his car for the drive to the Cleveland  School -- reflected that obsession, the report said. As the other guest  remembered it, there was a joking reference to the fact that the motel was  operated by a Hindu family and then the final words from Purdy.  </P> <P> "The damn Hindus and boat people own everything," he was quoted as saying. A  short time later, five Southeast Asian children were dead and 30 other  children, mostly minorities, and one teacher were wounded.  </P> <P> "Sadly, such sentiments are common in California -- whether they are directed  at immigrant groups or at native-born minorities like blacks, Jews and  Hispanics," Van de Kamp said. "Most people who believe and say such things are  not so dangerous and unstable as Patrick Purdy. But it is no coincidence that  the number of racially and ethnically motivated crimes in California is rising  rapidly."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, said the  investigation had been requested by Asian-American groups worried that the  killings were part of an organized attack on new immigrants.  </P> <P> Although the report found that Purdy acted alone, Van de Kamp said he had also  hoped to reassure ethnic groups that the killer's decision to attack a school  with a predominance of Southeast Asian-American children was merely a "tragic  coincidence."  </P> <P> "The truth proved otherwise," he said. "Purdy was filled with hate and anger  toward many groups of people, including virtually all ethnic minorities. But in  the last days of his life it seems clear that he had focused on Stockton's  large and highly visible population of Southeast Asian immigrants."  </P> <P> Dale Minami, a San Francisco lawyer who is chairman of the attorney general's  Asian/Pacific Islander Advisory Committee, said leaders of Asian-American  groups were disturbed by initial reports that found little racial motivation  for the crime. He said they believed that it was important "for our peace of  mind" to confirm that racial hatred was a factor so that attention could be  focused on it and "we could begin to fashion remedies and solutions."  </P> <P> "For Asian-Pacific Americans the report confirms a disturbing fact, that  violence and hostility against Asian-Pacific Americans is a growing trend in  this state," Minami said. "In this sense Patrick Purdy's attitude toward  Asian-Pacific Americans is not simply an aberration but a more frightening omen  of what could become a theme in California in the next decade."  </P> <P> Noting that California, more than any other state, has had to assimilate huge  numbers of ethnic minorities, Van de Kamp recommended that schools be  encouraged to develop curriculums that includes instruction in human relations  and ethnic studies and that communities establish human relations centers to  work with local organizations to "respond to and prevent hate crimes."  </P> <P> The investigators who prepared the attorney general's report, however, devoted  most of their efforts to sketching a portrait of Purdy, whom they described as  hopelessly alienated from society by a turbulent childhood in which he was  provided no love and little stability.  </P> <P> Richard M. Yarvis, former chief psychiatrist for the Federal Bureau of Prisons,  traveled across the country to interview family members and acquaintances for a  psychological autopsy, an investigatory device commonly used to study suicidal  behavior.  </P> <P> While there were gaps in the evidence he was able to gather, Yarvis concluded  that Purdy had "compensated for his own feelings of powerlessness and  inadequacy by shifting blame to others and by rationalizing that he was  unsuccessful only because of unfair favoritism to others who were receiving  government support while he was not."  </P></p>

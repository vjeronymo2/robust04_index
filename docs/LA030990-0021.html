			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BIG WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> FRESNO STATE SHUTS DOWN MILLER TO BEAT THE TITANS  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton had to contend with Simone Srubek, Fresno State's  6-foot-6-inch center. And Fresno State had to contend with the Titans' Genia  Miller, who is 6-3.  </P> <P> In two other games this season, Fresno State has been content to play Miller  straight up and try to stop the other Fullerton players.  </P> <P> But after an eight-point loss to the Titans late last month, Fresno State  decided the thing to do was to concentrate on Miller.  </P> <P> The Bulldogs did just that Thursday, holding Miller to two points in the first  half and taking a 17-point halftime lead en route to a 72-60 victory in a  quarterfinal game of the Big West Conference women's basketball tournament at  Long Beach Arena.  </P> <P> Fresno State (19-10) advances to a semifinal game Saturday against UNLV, a  102-67 winner over San Jose State.  </P> <P> With Srubek playing behind Miller and with Stacey Cornaggia fronting her,  Fresno State held Miller to 15 points and six rebounds, far below her averages  of 24 points and 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> Miller took only three shots in the first half as Fresno State jumped to leads  of 17-2 and 27-8.  </P> <P> "We lost the game in the first five minutes," said Fullerton Coach Maryalyce  Jeremiah, whose team finished the season with a 14-14 record.  </P> <P> Kathy Werth, a Fullerton forward left open because of the double team, scored  27 points, but made only 11 of 30 shots.  </P> <P> "I was hesitant about shooting in the first half," Werth said. "I couldn't  believe how open I was. When we don't have our big girl Genia scoring, it's  really tough."  </P> <P> Fullerton also tried to break down the Bulldogs' collapsing defense from  outside, but made only two of 17 three-pointers.  </P> <P> Cornaggia led Fresno State with 18 points, making all eight shots she attempted  and both free throws. Geri Gainey added 14 and Srubek had 12. ROBYN NORWOOD  </P></p>

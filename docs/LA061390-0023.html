			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KEY WITNESS DENIES HE THREATENED SILBERMAN;  </P> <P> TRIAL: GOVERNMENT INFORMER CONTRADICTS SILBERMAN'S CLAIM THAT HE WAS COERCED  INTO MONEY DEAL.  </P> <P> Asserting that there were no threats, government informer Robert Benjamin said  Tuesday that he did not pressure Richard T. Silberman into completing the  second of two deals at the heart of the money-laundering trial against the San  Diego financier.  </P> <P> Directly contradicting Silberman's testimony on a key defense theme, Benjamin  said he did not make either of two early 1989 phone calls Silberman claimed to  have received from the eight-time convicted felon. It was in those calls that  Benjamin made the threats, Silberman testified last week.  </P> <P> Benjamin, however, said Tuesday that he did not make the calls because he did  not have Silberman's phone numbers. He added that he thought it was  "ridiculous" to suggest he had made threats against Silberman, a one-time aide  to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.  </P> <P> Though most of his testimony involved sparring with Silberman's defense  attorneys, Benjamin never lost his composure. He appeared to be wryly amused at  once again finding himself in a courtroom.  </P> <P> Silberman, 61, who is standing trial on seven felony counts, showed no emotion  as he listened to testimony from Benjamin, a New Yorker who is in the federal  witness protection program.  </P> <P> Silberman is charged with laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent  allegedly characterized as Colombian drug profits. Testimony in his trial,  which begin May 18 before U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, is due to  conclude today.  </P> <P> The jury will get the case after closing arguments Friday.  </P> <P> The case involves two transactions involving cash supplied by the undercover  agent, Peter Ahearn, who was posing as Pete Carmassi, a front man for Colombian  drug lords.  </P> <P> The first deal is a November, 1988, swap of $100,000 for stock in a Silberman  gold mine subsidiary. The second is a February, 1989, exchange of $200,000 for  U.S. Treasury bonds.  </P> <P> Silberman maintains the first deal was simply a legitimate stock sale. As for  the second, he testified last week that he was coerced into it by threats aimed  at his family, claiming Benjamin made them in phone calls Jan. 5 and Feb. 4,  1989.  </P> <P> A central element of defense strategy, throughout months of pretrial hearings  and in questioning of various witnesses during the trial, has been a focus on  Benjamin and the purported threats. Benjamin testified at the request of  defense attorneys, not prosecutors.  </P> <P> Curiously, however, lead defense lawyer James J. Brosnahan never asked Benjamin  at any time Tuesday -- or during Benjamin's initial, brief appearance last  Friday on the stand -- about the purported January and February threats.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case,  finally asked whether Benjamin had ever threatened Silberman. "Never," Benjamin  said.  </P> <P> Benjamin said he could not have made the Jan. 5 phone call to Silberman's  office.  </P> <P> "I didn't even have his office number," Benjamin said.  </P> <P> He added that he also could not have made the Feb. 4 call, which was to  Silberman's home. "I never had his number," Benjamin said. "I never called  him."  </P> <P> Instead of asking about the January and February threats, Brosnahan sought  primarily to ask about various threats and crimes the defense team contends  Benjamin -- whose eight convictions include bookmaking and bank fraud -- has  been involved in over the years.  </P> <P> Irving, however, refused to allow Benjamin to answer questions on unrelated  topics. However, the judge said he may convene a separate hearing to consider  the defense contention that Benjamin's past made it "outrageous" for the FBI to  use him in the case against Silberman.  </P> <P> Brosnahan also focused on a March, 1989, meeting involving Benjamin, Carmine  DiNunzio and Jack Norman Myers.  </P> <P> DiNunzio is an associate of reputed mobster Chris Petti, through whom Silberman  met Ahearn. Myers, a Malibu investment banker who was charged with being a  courier in the alleged money-laundering scheme, pleaded guilty in mid-May to  one felony count and agreed to testify against Silberman, which he did May 31.  </P> <P> The meeting, a lunch at an Encino hotel, was called to discuss why the value of  the bonds that were delivered in the second deal was perhaps $50,000 less than  Ahearn had expected. Discussing the shortfall, DiNunzio "got threatening,"  Myers testified a couple of weeks ago.  </P> <P> Benjamin said Thursday that he agreed with DiNunzio that Myers -- and Silberman  -- had to make up the difference. But he said he "didn't agree with the  threats," which he called "veiled at best."  </P> <P> The threats have not been explicitly described in court.  </P> <P> Following Benjamin's recital of the lunch conversation, Brosnahan suggested to  Benjamin that the meeting was "not the first time you've threatened Mr.  Silberman." "That's an absolute lie," Benjamin said.  </P> <P> Brosnahan immediately contended that since Benjamin was on the FBI payroll, the  informer had a financial motive to make the case against Silberman a good one.  </P> <P> "I always need money," Benjamin said.  </P> <P> But he added: "Mr. Silberman needed money, not me. He sent for me. I didn't  send for him."  </P></p>

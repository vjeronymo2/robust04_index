			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (12): Spotlight on the Carter Centre - Ambitious goals include conflict resolution in the world's trouble spots The Carter Centre sits atop a hill overlooking downtown Atlanta, and the objectives of the institution set up by former president Jimmy Carter match its lofty location. The centre, backed by millions of dollars in funds from individual donors, corporations and private foundations, is dedicated to 'fighting disease, hunger, poverty, conflict and oppression through collaborative initiatives in the areas of democratisation and development, global health and urban revitalisation.' Although it has been pursuing these ambitious goals since 1982 when it was established alongside the Carter presidential library and museum, its work did not begin to attract much attention until more recently, when Mr Carter's high-profile role as a freelance foreign policy trouble-shooter focused the spotlight on the ex-president and the Carter Centre. So active has Mr Carter been in tackling political problems around the world from his base in Atlanta that some foreign policy pundits have dubbed the Carter Centre the 'State Department of the South.' The nickname, however, is not likely to be popular at the centre, which goes out of its way to emphasise that it has no ties with the federal government. Its non-governmental, non-partisan status, in fact, is the institution's greatest asset when it comes to meeting its most challenging objective - conflict resolution. Its independence from official political and diplomatic structures enables the centre to become involved in disputes without taking sides, and it allows the staff and Mr Carter to negotiate with political and military leaders who may be persona non grata in Washington and other capitals. As Mr Carter explained to an audience at his Centre last month: 'I deal with the people the United States considers unsavoury.' Aside from Mr Carter's role last month in helping to facilitate the peaceful removal of the military government in Haiti and his efforts earlier in the year helping to cool tensions between North and South Korea, he and the Centre have been involved in less-publicised work in strife-torn countries such as Ethiopia, Liberia and Sudan. Mr Carter also keeps a line open to Fidel Castro, Cuba's isolated leader. The centre's international role does not stop at conflict resolution, however. Its also helps countries hold elections, draft new constitutions and manage the transition to democracy. Additionally, the centre and its staff run programmes in the developing world aimed at improving agriculture and food production, disease prevention and the quality of health care. While much of this work is conducted away from the public eye, the diplomatic initiatives, particularly those embarked upon by Mr Carter personally, have often come under intense scrutiny. The response to these efforts has not always been favourable. In the past, Mr Carter has been criticised for interfering with US foreign policy, and sometimes for undermining or contradicting that policy. The former president's reknowned ability to see something positive in almost everyone he meets has also left him vulnerable to attacks that he coddles dictators and terrorists. As one State Department official put it recently: 'Some tyrant will say, 'I don't have to listen to the American government representative, because I can always call Atlanta and get a better deal.'' It was recently discovered, for example, that Mr Carter tried in 1991 to persuade foreign leaders to not back President Bush's coalition to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi control because he believed he could act as a mediator between the US and Saddam Hussein. Although they conform with the Carter Centre's broader mission to 'wage peace' around the world, some of Mr Carter's forays into foreign policy situations are not necessarily part of the Centre's official work - much of which is conducted in less glamorous arenas, both abroad and at home. On the domestic front, the centre and its staff devote a lot of energy on improving conditions in the nation's inner cities. The Atlanta Project (known as TAP) is probably the centre's best known domestic programme. Launched in October, 1991, TAP helps communities in Atlanta's 20 poorest neighbourhoods tackle their problems, among them crime, homelessness, drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, unemployment, and poor health. That help involves providing each of the 20 Atlanta neighbourhood 'clusters' with corporate sponsors (Coca-Cola, Bell South and Marriott are among the TAP supporters), recruiting a force of local volunteers to work in the communities, and enabling the clusters gain access to federal or state funds. So far, TAP's work has ranged from somewhat vague initiatives such as a survey of residents's views on how to tackle crime, to more tangible problem-solving efforts such as a massive child innoculation drive and a successful campaign to make it easier for Atlanta families to the apply for public financial assistance. TAP has its critics, including those who say its impact upon local communities' problems depends too much on the level of commitment from each cluster's corporate sponsor, and those who have chided the project's director for being insensitive to Atlanta's black community ('sensitivity training' was subsequently arranged for TAP participants). There has also been some disillusionment over the lack of more noticeable progress in improving the life of the urban poor. These criticisms, however, have not prevented the Carter Centre from planning a national version of TAP, called The America Project.</p>

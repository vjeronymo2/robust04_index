			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Steady growth at Aegon shown in opening quarter AEGON, the Netherlands' second-largest insurer, said yesterday that it posted a 12.3 per cent rise in operating profit in the first quarter of 1992, although growth in net profit was held to just 1.5 per cent because of reduced gains on the sale of shares and property investments. Net profit was slightly higher at Fl 193m (Dollars 104m) compared with Fl 190.2m a year earlier. Operating profit, however, saw more marked growth to Fl 187.7m from Fl 167.1m. This reflected a 8.75 per cent rise in operating earnings in its core life-insurance business, as well as strong improvements in non-life insurance and miscellaneous activities. Operating profit from health and accident insurance eased to Fl 11m from Fl 12m. Total turnover rose by 13.2 per cent to Fl 4.43bn. The company said turnover and earnings in the US were considerably higher, but it gave no details.</p>

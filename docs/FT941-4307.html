			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Stronger second half gives MTL Pounds 4.33m MTL Instruments, the USM-quoted maker of electronic measuring devices, got back on track in the second half buoyed up by a 22 per cent sales rise. In the first half pre-tax profits declined by Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 2.1m. But the pre-tax result for the full year at Pounds 4.33m was just 9 per cent down on last time's Pounds 4.77m (restated) which benefited from a Pounds 1.05m exceptional item caused by the different accounting treatment of a pension scheme refund under FRS 3. Sales in 1993 advanced to Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 19.4m) of which acquisitions contributed Pounds 655,000. Operating profit from continuing operations came to Pounds 4.04m, but a Pounds 174,000 deficit incurred by acquisitions reduced this to Pounds 3.86m (Pounds 4.22m). Mr Ian Hutcheon, chairman, said the sales rise reflected the start of economic recovery in some markets, particularly the US and Australia, greater market penetration in continental Europe and a rise in the number and quality of new products as well as the acquisition of Transition Technology. A final of 2.4p is recommended, making a total of 4.1p (3.6p) payable from earnings of 15.5p (16.8p). The shares added 5p to 270p.</p>

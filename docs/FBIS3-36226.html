			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Observer Manki Ponomarev article: "In Search of a New </F> Strategy"]    [Text] Last summer the U.S. Defense Department published  an extensive report entitled "Cardinal Review of the Armed  Forces' Structure." At the time analysts perceived it as a  document setting forth the main provisions of a new U.S.  military doctrine and military strategy.    In time, however, it became clear that this was not quite  so.  It turned out that the "new national program of military  building," as the U.S. press called it, was certainly not a  finished program but just a rough draft of one, although it had  been worked out in depth. Two months after the Pentagon's  report appeared, President Clinton ordered the formation of an  interdepartmental group of experts with the task of preparing  recommendations for a "fundamental reappraisal" of U.S. nuclear  policy and strategy and the elaboration of new approaches to the  building and utilization of the nuclear forces. Along with the  elaborated data on a review of the general principles of  military building and of the structure of the armed forces, the  conclusions of this group of experts are to be approved by the  President and set forth in his special "Policy Review  Directive." This directive does not yet exist, although it has  been given the number 34.    Other parameters of U.S. military strategy, of the structure  of the armed forces, and of policy in the defense sphere are  also being elaborated. Defense Secretary Les Aspin declared  this when he recently addressed a conference of the Reserve  Officers' Association. According to him, the purport of all  this work is that the United States must be the only superpower  remaining in the world after the Cold War.    The task of creating armed forces which, the Pentagon boss  said, must be "capable of fighting and winning two large  regional wars being waged simultaneously" is now advanced as the  basis of Washington's military policy. This "two-win strategy"  will demand greater "flexibility and maneuverability" both of  regular units of the U.S. armed forces and of the reserve  forces. At the same time a special role is allocated to reserve  and National Guard units. They must be equipped, manned, and  trained so as to be able at any moment to embark on fulfilling  combat tasks equally with regular troops.    This is just one element of the ongoing review of U.S.  military policy and strategy. Measures are being taken to  further improve other components as well. The task has been set  in such a way as to complete this work, in the main, by this  spring. The U.S. Administration believes that the rapid changes  in the international situation, the departure from the scene of  old threats and the emergence of new ones demand the constant  renewal both of the theoretical arsenal and of the practice of  military building.    President Clinton, the defense secretary declared, "is sworn  to ensure that America continues to have the best trained, best  equipped, and most combat-efficient troops in the world." But  this does demand extra money, which will be forthcoming. The  White House has already reported that the Administration will  request $263.7 billion for military purposes in the coming  Fiscal 1995 -- $3 billion more than was allocated in the current  year.    This is the only way, Washington believes, that the United  States will be able to remain the No. 1 superpower.</p>

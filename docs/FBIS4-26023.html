Under the cordial concerns of the party  Central Committees of the two countries, the peoples of the two  provinces have helped and supported each another, made important  contributions to their respective socialist construction, and  made due contributions to developing friendship between the two  countries of China and the DPRK and between the two peoples. In  the future, we will continue our efforts to promote and develop  the friendly relationship between the two provinces and further  deepen the friendship between the two countries and between the  peoples of the border areas of the two countries.

We heartily rejoice at this and sincerely wish you  greater achievements in the future.

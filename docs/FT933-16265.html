			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Row blows up over holiday failures A ROW over who should bear the cost of compensating the customers of failed holiday companies has broken out between the Civil Aviation Authority, credit card companies and the travel industry. Travel agents have complained that the authority and Barclaycard have forced them to bear the cost of tour operator collapses. All the holidaymakers involved have received full compensation because the failed tour operators had Air Travel Organisers' Licences issued by the authority. Where travellers had paid for their holidays by Barclaycard, the authority insisted that Barclaycard bear the cost. The Association of British Travel Agents says that 10 of its members complained that Barclaycard had, in turn, debited their bank accounts for the cost of the holidays. The travel agents say they should not be held responsible for the collapse of tour operators. They say the debiting of their accounts has left them out of pocket. Although they have had to pay the full cost of the holidays, they only received commissions of between 5 per cent and 15 per cent at the time of sale. This was further reduced by having to pay credit card commissions. The authority says its policy is to look for other means of compensating customers before drawing on the failed company's bonds or its own reserve fund. Barclaycard says it has not debited travel agents' accounts itself. In some cases, it passed on the cost of compensation to the bank responsible for the agents' card transactions.</p>

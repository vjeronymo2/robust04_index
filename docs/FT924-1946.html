			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Cracks in the tunnel In the tortuous history of disputes between Eurotunnel and its contractors, it has often been hard to distinguish between brinkmanship and irreconcilable disagreement. Yesterday's announcement by TML that negotiations are at a standstill perhaps amounts to little more than a vigorous shaking of the publicity tree. TML's implicit threat is that if Eurotunnel does not settle terms on the disputed Pounds 1.2bn of cost over-runs it will work to rule, delaying the partial opening of the tunnel now forecast for December 1993. Any such postponement would be punitively expensive for Eurotunnel. On some estimates, the bill could amount to Pounds 100m a month, pushing the project's break-even point ever further into the distance. The uncertainty would be particularly unwelcome for Eurotunnel as it ponders how to raise fresh funds when its banking waivers expire in 1994. But despite the high stakes, Eurotunnel's pugnacious chairman, Sir Alastair Morton, may yet be inclined to call TML's bluff. The value of the contractors' outstanding work is small and TML would not appreciate being identified as the consortium that spoiled the opening party. Given that part of its payment will also be in Eurotunnel shares and loan stock, it hardly makes sense to cause too much disruption. The longer the row, the more the value of Eurotunnel's paper will fall. Contractors already complain about the uncertain worth of Eurotunnel's equity. Sadly, shareholders must know exactly how they feel. Yesterday's spat wiped a further 3 per cent off the value of their investment.</p>

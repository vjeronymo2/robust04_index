			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Letter: All is not egalite in the EC Sir, The Common Market is a sham to an ordinary chap like me who divides his time between continental Europe and Britain. I cannot access the FT index (your 0891 number) from the Continent - nor any similar service the other way round. I am not allowed to hold my shares in Deutsche Bank in my own name: they have to be held by nominees in Frankfurt. I cannot insure in Britain the French-registered car I keep in France. I cannot buy a continental car with left-hand drive here: I am told it would not be 'type-approved', although the identical model with right-hand drive is so approved. The excuse is that you cannot see when overtaking. By that token, continental visitors to Britain and British visitors to the Continent will presently have to leave their cars at the port of entry and go on without them. (Incidentally, in 1963 - before Britain joined the Common Market - I bought a new left-hand drive Renault 4 in Britain for use in France, simply because exchange control did not permit me to buy it in France.) I cannot use my portable telephone on the Continent, nor, for that matter, any other British approved telephone. And so on. . . Liberte, oui. Fraternite, peut-etre. Egalite, non.

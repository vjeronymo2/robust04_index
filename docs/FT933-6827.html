			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Samancor net slides to R175m SAMANCOR, the South African chrome and manganese producer, reports steeply lower profits for the year ended June. It is cutting its dividend from 90 cents a share to 50 cents, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Turnover fell from R2.06bn (Dollars 613m) to R1.79bn, and the weak business background translated into pre-tax profits of R144.4m, down from R381.5m in the previous year. Attributable net earnings, following a one-off rationalisation charge of R42m and a tax credit of R53m, were R175.6m, against R277.1m. Samancor hopes to form joint ventures with two French and Japanese companies this year to secure outlets for products and so enhance its market position. It said its manganese division was finalising a joint venture with Societe du Ferromanganese de Paris-Outreau of France to produce medium carbon ferromanganese. Samancor expects to take a 5 per cent equity stake in the French company for a 'relatively modest investment'. Its chrome division is also negotiating an agreement with Japan's Nippon Denko.</p>

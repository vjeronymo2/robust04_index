			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TAX PREPARER GETS PROBATION FOR FRAUD  </P> <P> A Sylmar man who prepared fraudulent tax returns by claiming deductions for  phony church donations was sentenced Tuesday in federal court to three years  probation and 300 hours of community service, a spokesman with the Internal  Revenue Service said.  </P> <P> Rudolf Kies, 57, was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie to  stop preparing income tax returns while he is on probation, Assistant U.S.  Atty.  </P> <P> Nancy Spiegel said.  </P> <P> Kies pleaded guilty April 9 to three counts of preparing fraudulent income tax  returns in 1983 and 1984. Kies, a tax preparer, falsely claimed that his  clients made deductions to the Mission Church of America, which was  incorporated in 1976 and based in Kies' house. Kies listed himself as the  church's president and would send his clients receipts for the phony donations.  </P> <P> The reported deductions saved eight clients -- most from the San Fernando  Valley -- more than $14,000 in tax payments. Internal Revenue Service  investigators said none of the donations were made.  </P> <P> Kies' clients will be responsible for paying the back taxes, but no charges  will be brought against them, investigators said.  </P></p>

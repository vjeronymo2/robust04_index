			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Money management funds attract Y2,000bn JAPAN'S money management funds - bond and money market investment funds - have attracted Y2,000bn (Dollars 15.8bn) since their launch last month. The funds are aimed at the retail investor. Investors have been attracted by the higher yields of the funds, relative to bank deposits. The sharp inflow of retail money to Japanese brokerages comes at a time when individual investors are mostly shunning stock market investment. Fee margins on the money management funds are significantly lower than that of stock trading commissions. Brokers hope the funds inflow will lead eventually to investors shifting back into direct stock market investment. According to the Investment Trust Association, 75 per cent of the collected money was invested in long and short-term government bonds at the end of May. The minimum purchase price in money management funds is Y1m. Currently the funds yield around 4.7 per cent. This compares with 0.5 per cent in ordinary bank deposits and 3.29 per cent on bank money market deposits. Banks have become increasingly concerned over the large inflow of money to the broker-instigated money management funds, which look set to head the securities houses' marketing offensive ahead of the summer bonus season. Brokers also want to give the instrument a settlement function, similar to that of a bank account. The Osaka Stock Exchange plans measures to expand disclosure of trading information in stock-index futures and options, AP-DJ reports. The exchange currently discloses daily results of volume in the front-month Nikkei index futures and three Nikkei options. From Friday it will also disclose daily trading for other futures contracts, plus five options.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. Fefelkin, chief of the Financial Service </F> of the October Railroad, by A. Shchuchkin, GUDOK correspondent:  "The October Railroad: Changes Are Coming"; St. Petersburg, date  not given]    [Text] In March, the MPS [Ministry of Railways]  Collegium heard the report of the director of the October  Railroad "On Measures To Stabilize the Economic Situation on the  Road." This subject was more than topical for the entire  network. A. Fefelkin, chief of the road's Financial Service,  answers our correspondent's questions.    [Shchuchkin] Anatoliy Nikolayevich, just why was the  management of the October Railroad heard at the collegium? In  relation to what?    [Fefelkin] We tried to predict in advance the development of  the situation in the road's economy. Foreseeing the sharp slump,  and not expecting any orders from above, we had already begun,  by the start of the year, to take certain steps to avoid the  blind alley or at least to ease the situation. As far as I can  tell, the ministry tried to obtain, using the experience of the  October Road, the initial material for an objective analysis of  the situation, the results of which could be used on the entire  network.    We decided to change the number of divisions on the road, to  cut back the administrative staff and to reduce the expenditures  to maintain it. Now, instead of ten divisions, we will have  eight. The Moscow and Rzhev divisions are merging, as well as  the Leningrad-Finland and the Leningrad-Moscow.    This is an interesting fact in this situation. In previous  years any cut in the staff on the divisions was made with a  terrible squawk. If we asked to cut 200-300 people, the  management of the divisions found dozens of reasons for our not  doing this. Now, when the decision on the merge is finally made,  the divisions are ready not only to cut 200 or 300 people, but  double or triple that number, if only we don't combine the  divisions. That is, at the local level, we see a reluctance to  change the existing structure.    For example, the management of the Rzhev Division, on  finding  out that it was being combined with the Moscow Division,  presented the road administration with a document specifying a  whole set of measures, allegedly making it possible to avoid  combining. These measures included cutting the collective by 917  people, which is 10 percent of its number, combining a number of  stations, closing some of them and converting some subdivisions  to single-shift work. All this indicates that we do have  reserves, not only on this division, but also on others.    [Shchuchkin] Mechanically combining divisions, without  structural reorganization of the management and horizontal  communications system, though, can hardly solve all your  problems in any major way?    [Fefelkin] Of course. All this should not be undertaken for  the sake of a simple merger. That is just why we are planning to  improve the entire management structure, not only on the level  of the divisions, but also by changing the structure of the road  administration.    [Shchuchkin] What will this look like?    [Fefelkin] Technical cost-accounting boards of directors  will  be set up on the divisions. For example, on the Rzhev -- a board  of directors for cost-accounting conversions, on the Moscow  division -- a board of directors for technical service of track  installations, communications and power supply. For the time  being, the innovations will be implemented as an experiment, and  if the results are favorable, these boards of directors will be  able to take their place on the road as partners with equal  rights.    Experience in setting up these boards of directors abroad  have fully justified themselves. In particular, our neighbors in  Finland set up these boards of directors a long time ago and  they have proven themselves. This experiment is incorporated in  our concept of reorganizing the road management, which means  replacing the vertical administrative relations with horizontal  ones. This means creating associations of track, railcar and  locomotive services. After these associations have been set up,  the remaining division structures, which are the property of the  NOD [Ministry of Railways Railroad Division Chiefs], should  become cost-accounting boards of directors for transport and  work with all the depots, stations and other independent  subdivisions on contractual, equal-rights principles, in this  case having no administrative command, but working on equal  terms with everyone.    The road administration is now also drawing up a group of  documents on its structural reorganization. Some of the  departments and services are merging and some will be cut back  or reorganized and given different or additional functions.    [Shchuchkin] In addition to creating radically reorganized  structures, what other armament are you taking on?    [Fefelkin] In my opinion, we too hastily and unjustifiably  rejected reliable methods such as planning and establishing  quotas. The consequence of this was an increase in the  overexpenditure of operating funds, a weakening of the role of  operations workers in high-quality utilization of rolling stock  and a reduction in the material responsibility of many workers.  This will do tremendous damage to the entire road economy. We  must therefore return to the former measures -- planning and  setting quotas for all our needs. We have partially begun to  utilize them. Today not a single division receives financing in  the necessary amount, because of a lack of funds. Wages are  planned strictly according to the quota system and financing is  implemented on each division only for this quota. The divisions,  of course, require more funds than the sums put down for wages,  but there is nowhere to get them. This means that we must live  according to our means.    In February we had 48 billion rubles [R] in monetary  receipts, but the wages, allowing for deductions, were R62  billion. There was nothing with which we could cover the  difference. It turned out that all the monetary receipts were  being spent on wages. There was simply nothing left for  reproduction. The only thing that would alleviate our situation  was mutual offsetting.    [Shchuchkin] From what funds do you cover expenditures to  maintain divisions that are operating at a loss?    [Fefelkin] There have always been a few unprofitable  divisions on the road: the Bologoye, Rzhev, Pskov divisions.  After Karelia was given equal status with the regions of the Far  North, the Petrozavodsk Division (one of the largest on the  road) also began to be subsidized. Today it lives not only  through its own allocations, but also those of the Murmansk and  Volkhovstroy divisions. The expenditures for wages here,  allowing for deductions, constitute R11 billion. The division is  not in a position to earn these funds on its own.    [Shchuchkin] What is the road doing to increase monetary  receipts and reduce its debts?    [Fefelkin] Here is an example. The other day we signed a  contract with the management of the Cherepovets Metallurgy  Combine. According to it, the Kostomuksa GOK [Mining-Enriching  Combine] will supply the road with pellets, counting toward  clearing off the combine's debt, and the Cherepovets Combine  will supply metal for the road. We turn over this metal to the  plants that do not have the funds to buy it, and there they use  it to make the brake shoes which are in such short supply for  us, and also spare parts for rolling stock. In addition, there  is a possibility of selling metal on the foreign market and  obtaining "real" money for it, which we need.    If our trade in metal and the barter based on it is  successful in the next few months, we will draw the Kovdor and  Olenegorsk GOK, which produce iron ore concentrate, into  cooperation on similar conditions. There are already preliminary  agreements on this.    The road intends to develop this sort of commercial activity  for all types of goods produced by our debtors, be they pellets,  iron ore or apatite concentrates. In order not only to survive,  but also to keep the road economy in good operating condition,  today we must simply become sensible businessmen.    [Shchuchkin] The road has its own bank -- the Baltic. What  is  its role in the stabilization process?    [Fefelkin] The bank has essentially accelerated the passage  of payments, which, strictly speaking, we were trying to do,  when we created it. Today the intra-bank transfers of the  Lenuzel enterprises take place in an hour. Unfortunately, the  development of branches of the Baltic Bank on the road is still  going slowly. Their opening on the Bologoye, Petrozavodsk and  Volkhovstroy divisions is planned for the near future. Then it  will be possible to accelerate the passage of payments not only  at Lenuzel, but also along the entire road. For the time being,  we have decided to open a branch of the bank directly in the  administration, in order to make it a unique standard, or if you  want, school, where interested road specialists could learn to  raise their level. In addition, this branch will also be used as  a savings bank for the railroad workers, in order to draw their  funds into the development of the road. This will benefit  everyone.    [Shchuchkin] How do you intend to solve the problem of the  unprofitability of passenger transport?    [Fefelkin] We have arranged with the St. Petersburg  Municipal  Council that, instead of paying taxes into the local budget, the  road, by agreement with the authorities, will direct these funds  into covering the losses from passenger transport and purchasing  new electric trains at Torzhok.    In 1994, We plan to obtain R40 billion by reducing the NDS  [VAT] deductions for the local budget. Part of these funds will  go to cover the losses, and we will buy 10 Torzhok-produced  electric trains for R16 billion. The total, as you can see, is  quite sizable. We are counting on spending a small part of it on  repairing our terminals.    [Shchuchkin] What contribution are commercial structures  making to the road's financial support?    [Fefelkin] A considerable one. After all, we were not at  first prepared to receive the tremendous flow of in-kind  carriage charges which rained down on us one-and-a-half years  ago. If it had not been for the commercial structures, we could  hardly have been able to dispose of everything that was piled on  us: after all, nothing like that had ever happened on the road  before. Their activity was a great help to us.    True, not everything developed and worked out fully. Some of  them began to die out, but some are working with a good return.  These are the funds that we are using for construction.    For example, the Yugstroy Construction Organization was  created, and is building a sanitarium for the road in Sochi.  Through the profits from commercial structures, we completed the  construction of an electric centralization post at the  Kushelevka Station. In the near future we plan to rebuild the  Olenegorsk Station. I am therefore convinced that the activity  of the commercial structures is of appreciable help.    [Shchuchkin] Many people on the road today are talking about  the major cuts in staff. Is there not a danger that many  able-bodied people will find themselves thrown overboard and  will fill the ranks of the unemployed?    [Fefelkin] This danger, in my opinion, is exaggerated. I  don't think that the reduction in the contingent will hurt the  interests of a large number of workers. The pensioners will  leave first of all. When they retire on pension, they are paid a  lump sum of six average monthly wages. Note, not salaries, but  wages. Their situation will therefore not be serious or,  moreover, hopeless. As for the rest of the age categories, I can  say one thing here -- there will be no thoughtless cutbacks on  the road. We are trying to do things so as to make this process  as painless as possible.</p>

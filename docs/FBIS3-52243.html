According to a report by the Central News Unit in Kabul,  clashes have raged since yesterday in the capital of  Afghanistan, and so far hundreds of people have been killed or  wounded. Also, thousands of shells, mortars, and rockets have  hit the warring sides positions and various areas of Kabul.    Kabul Radio and Television, which is controlled by the  supporters of President Borhanoddin Rabbani, strongly attacked  General Dostam and announced that he has been stripped of all  his legal and official powers.    Borhanoddin Rabbani last year appointed General Dostam as  the  first deputy of the Afghan Defense Ministry.    According to the Kabul Radio and Television, Hekmatyar's  Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] forces are  confronting the Defense Ministry forces and are fighting  alongside General Dostam's forces.    Rasul Sayyaf, the leader of the Etehad-e Eslami [Islamic  Union of Afghanistan] and the main ally of Afghan President  Borhanoddin Rabbani, also stressed, during a speech broadcast on  that country's radio and television, that battles will continue  until the complete annihilation of the Northern Movement led by  General Dostam.    The report of the Voice and Vision correspondent from Kabul  mentions that again today the Iranian Embassy in Kabul became  the target of a mortar attack during the exchange of fire  between the warring sides, but none of the embassy workers were  harmed.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / ANC halts talks after township massacre: South African power-sharing negotiations 'in tatters', says Mandela SOUTH AFRICA'S peace process was in danger of collapse last night after Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), announced the suspension of bilateral talks with the government. Mr Mandela's decision follows the massacre last Wednesday of 42 people in Boipatong township. A further three people died on Saturday when police opened fire on a crowd which had gathered to protest at the killings. The ANC has blamed Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party for Wednesday's tragedy, and accused the police of complicity, a charge which is denied by the government. 'I can no longer explain to our people why we continue to talk to a regime that is murdering our people and conducting war against us,' Mr Mandela said. He also said he would lead a campaign of defiance should the government reimpose a state of emergency, as suggested by President FW de Klerk after his abortive visit to Boipatong on Saturday when angry youths chased him out of the township. The negotiation process was 'completely in tatters', Mr Mandela told a rally yesterday of about 15,000 supporters in the township of Evaton, 50km south of Johannesburg. He said an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the ANC would be held tomorrow to 'examine our options' in the light of the events at Boipatong. While militant elements within the ANC would favour calling off negotiations, this can, at best, be a short-term measure. With sanctions gone and the armed struggle suspended, the ANC lacks the means to force the government from power. It will probably show its displeasure by intensifying mass action while making its continued participation in negotiations contingent on a suitable government response to Boipatong. Mr Mandela's comments came at the end of a week which saw relations between the government and ANC sink to their lowest level since the unbanning of the ANC in February 1990. 'We are back to Sharpeville days and the gulf between the oppressor and the oppressed has overnight become unbridgeable.' Earlier Mr Mandela had visited Boipatong where the rapturous reception afforded him contrasted sharply with the hostility towards Mr de Klerk, whose visit lasted less than 15 minutes. The Vaal Triangle townships visited yesterday by Mr Mandela are among the most volatile and dangerous in the country. The road from Boipatong to Evaton, which passes through Sebokeng, resembles a war zone. Burnt tyres, rocks and tree-stumps are strewn across all the main streets to discourage police patrols and attacks launched from fast-moving cars. The mood of the crowd in the dusty football ground where Mr Mandela spoke was very militant. Posters read 'Mandela - give us permission to kill our enemies'. Mr Mandela reminded his audience that the infamous Sharpeville massacre in 1960 had occurred in the same vicinity as Boipatong. 'I come back today to this area where Sharpeville has been repeated with a ferocity that may completely put an end to negotiations with the regime.' He said he would request the secretary-general of the United Nations to call a special session of the Security Council to discuss the 'massacres committed by Mr de Klerk and his regime'.

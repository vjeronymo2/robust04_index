The host Moden and his wife Tova [names as received] warmly  greeted Chinese visitors at the door. Moden's parents made a  special trip to their son's house to meet the distinguished  guest from China.    Moden's house is a typical Danish farmhouse, a white-fence,  red- roof two-story house surrounded by a vast lawn and garden,  with a piggery and machine room at the side. [passage omitted]    Led by Moden, Chairman Li and his entourage first visited  the  piggery. [passage omitted]    After Chairman Li completed the tour of the farmhouse, the  host brought out refreshments and shared them with the guest on  the lawn. Li Ruihuan presented an embroidered tablecloth set to  the Danish couple and toy pandas to their two children. The  hostess shook hands with Chairman Li and thanked him for the  gifts, while the two kids were totally immersed with their new  toys.    Before leaving the house, Li Ruihuan had a picture taken  with  the Danish family. The whole farmhouse was filled with profound  sentiments of friendship between the Chinese and Danish peoples.</p>

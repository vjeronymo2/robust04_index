			<p>SUMMARY                                Reflecting increasing Chinese leadership concern over mounting  inflation, Politburo standing committee member and central bank  governor Zhu Rongji recently introduced a potentially  controversial package of tough anti-inflation measures, which  includes a plan for tight new controls over credit.                             END SUMMARY      Zhu announced the new measures at the closing session of a  national conference on financial work held from 12 to 15 January.  While calling for continued implementation of key policies from  the austerity program instituted last July to address the chaotic  behavior in the financial sector, Zhu also unveiled a new  hardline policy on credit expansion (Xinhua, 19 January).  Ordering financial authorities to "strictly control" the "total  credit supply," Zhu said that the "planned total credit line"  must not be exceeded "even by one yuan" and that "investigation"  will be carried out to ensure compliance.  He went on to back up  his statement in warning against unauthorized bank lending.      Underscoring the importance the leadership appears to attach to  the new program, the State Council immediately reinforced Zhu's  demands, releasing a circular on 29 January calling for tight  central control over investment (Xinhua, 29 January).  Echoing  Zhu's speech, the circular stated that "in principle, no more new  projects will be approved this year" in an effort to prevent  "reckless and redundant" construction.  The circular also ordered  tighter controls over the "sources of capital," urging further  action against illicit fund-raising schemes employed at local  levels.  Seeking to reassert strong central control over new  investment projects, the circular went on to establish  restrictive requirements for authorization and demanded strict  screening and tight management of the approval process.  Investments in real estate development and construction, in  particular, it said must be "incorporated" into the state  investment plan or they will lose their eligibility for loans.      Guarantees for Priority Projects      Perhaps still sensitive to criticism that his anti-inflationary  economic policies last year shut off funding to important  enterprises and projects, Zhu sought to reassure potential  critics of the stringent credit controls of the leadership's  standing commitment to a "soft landing" for the economy.  For  example, he implied that loans for projects in "infrastructure  and basic industry" would not be cut off, stating that they would  be managed by a new "state development bank" in charge of policy-  related lending.  Seeking to give added authority to his  instructions, Zhu urged financial cadres to follow paramount  leader Deng Xiaoping's instruction to avoid making the bank a  "locked safe," just as it also should not be run "like a currency  issuance company."      The 29 January State Council circular further reinforced Zhu's  message, stipulating that the "needs of priority projects" should  be "ensured" by "pooling together" financial resources.  It  called on all regions and departments to "give priority" to  completing major projects approved last year, including, for  example, improvements in China's housing stock.  Similarly, a 24  January article in the PRC weekly journal Liaowang by commentator  "Bao Xin"--a forum frequently used by the leadership to  illuminate its pronouncements--stated that the new restriction on  the overall scale of investment "does not mean" that "no new  investment" will be made in capital construction.  "Necessary"  capital construction, according to the commentator, is a "major  means" of sustaining the "lasting momentum" of economic  development.  The commentator went on to reaffirm that "priority"  should be given to basic industries and infrastructure projects,  while the scale of other projects, including real estate, office  buildings, and hotels, must be "resolutely cut down."      Motives      The need to check rising inflation appears to have made it  politically possible for Beijing to call for the potentially  painful economic measures.  In his speech, Zhu attributed the  introduction of the new policies to the danger that "inflationary  pressure could build up at any time."  PRC media had already  served notice that inflation had begun to rise late last year.  Judging from media reports citing State Statistical Bureau  figures on cost of living increases in 35 Chinese cities, the  urban inflation rate in December jumped 3.9 percent over the  previous month's rate (Xinhua, 17 December; Zhongguo Xinwen She,  20 January).  Adding to the leadership's worries were dramatic  increases in the prices of grain, cooking oil, and other  essential commodities beginning in November, which prompted an  important State Council meeting on 25 December and calls for  price controls on these products (Xinhua, 27 December 1993).      Implications      Beijing's introduction of tough new economic measures serves to  underscore the party leadership's concern over inflation.  However, the campaign faces a rough road ahead as it is likely to  run up against stiff opposition, ranging from state enterprise  advocates and provincial and local officials with a vested  interest in investment-led growth to radical reformers promoting  rapid growth.  Beijing's apparent inability to strictly enforce  earlier central directives to cool investment also threatens to  be a liability.  The political tug-of-war over inflation and  investment is unlikely to end until Beijing makes good on its  promise to establish a more independent banking system able to  exercise sound economic judgment in allocating capital.

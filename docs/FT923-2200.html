			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: EBC falls 60% and dividend halved A further deterioration in trading conditions meant EBC Group, the west country construction and development group, suffered a 60 per cent fall in first half profits and has halved its interim dividend. Pre-tax profits for the first half of 1992 dived to Pounds 535,000 (Pounds 1.34m) on turnover 10 per cent lower at Pounds 25.3m. Earnings per share were 3.31p (6.74p) and the interim dividend came to 1.75p (3.5p). Marwood Homes, the housing offshoot, again suffered substantial losses. With the market unlikely to improve in the short term, Mr Cockroft warned of further losses in the second half. Options for this operation were being reviewed.</p>

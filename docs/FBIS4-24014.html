			<p>BFN     [Text] The South African Chamber of Business, SACOB, says  the financial rand and exchange control systems have outlived  their usefulness and they are sending the wrong messages to  international investors. SACOB says in a discussion document  that South Africa's changed international status, and a need to  create a more favorable climate for foreign investment, make it  necessary for the government to review its position on exchange  control. It says the government should commit itself as soon as  possible to the phasing out of the exchange control system when  the country's foreign reserves return to satisfactory levels.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Kohl warns on EU contributions: Funding of Union becomes big issue in German Euro-elections Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday warned that Germany had reached the limit of its financial contributions to the European Union, and called for future budget payments to be linked more closely to per capita incomes. In the stormiest debate so far in Germany's European election campaign, Mr Kohl sought to counter a rising tide of criticism of the country's contributions to the EU budget. He was facing an accusation from Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), that the government was guilty of 'gross negligence' in fixing its budget contributions without proper regard for the soaring costs of German unification. In a formal government declaration to the German parliament on European policy, Mr Kohl said that those member states with income levels comparable to Germany's should assume greater financial responsibility. At the same time Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said the government would refuse to approve any new EU programme which was financed according to the 'old key'. Finance Ministry officials were unable to clarify his statement last night, but it suggests that he will be seeking an adjustment of Germany's budget contributions before approving any new spending areas beyond those already included in EU budget headings. He pointed out that Germany had sunk from second to sixth place in the prosperity-ranking for EU member states, although it remained by far the largest net contributor to the Brussels budget. He added that Bonn would reject any attempt to finance the budget with greater use of borrowing. The harsh line on EU financing from Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel comes in response to a wave of criticism in Germany over the country's net contributions to the EU budget, which reached Ecu9bn (Pounds 6.9bn) in 1992. The question has become a big issue in the current European election campaign. Mr Scharping, accused the government of agreeing to a German budget contribution fixed up to 1999, without taking any account of the loss of German per capita income since unification. In a sharp attack on the government's record in Brussels, he insisted that Germany's budget contribution was at least DM3bn (Pounds 1.2bn) higher than it should be, aggravated by a further DM1.2bn contribution to the British budget rebate. The confrontation in the German Bundestag came in an emergency debate on European policy, summoned specifically to answer the challenges emerging in the current European election campaign. Mr Kohl also spoke out on his commitment to European economic and monetary union, stressing that maintenance of the strict economic convergence criteria for a single currency was more important than keeping strictly to the present timetable. 'We do not want in any way to postpone the deadlines,' he said, 'but realistically I must stress that the correct priority must be to stick to the stability criteria in the first place, while the question of the timetable must take second place. That must be clearly said.'</p>

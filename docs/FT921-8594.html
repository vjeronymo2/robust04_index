			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Newmarket Venture assets up NEWMARKET Venture Capital had a net asset value of 60p at December 31, its year-end. At the end of 1990 the figure stood at 56p. The company has a portfolio of venture capital investments in the UK and the US. These are currently being realised and, as has previously been announced, it is proposed that the company is wound up voluntarily and the assets distributed to shareholders in 1994. The company added that it does not take realised gains on its successful investments into the profit and loss account and it does not normally expect to pay ordinary dividends. The p&amp;l merely reflects deposit and investment income and the running costs of the company. Pre-tax losses were cut to Pounds 776,000 (Pounds 1.25m) and losses per share to 2.1p (3.4p).</p>

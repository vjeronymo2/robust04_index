			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Bronshteyn: "Tatar Oilmen on the Verge of </F> Bankruptcy"]    [Text] Kazan -- A financial crisis has arisen in the  Tatneft Joint-Stock Company. Consumers' debts, which totalled  197 billion rubles [R] at the beginning of the year, have  reached R343 billion. The Tatneft leadership has been forced to  take extraordinary measures.    IZVESTIYA's correspondent was told in Tatneft's public  relations department that the work of drilling teams, teams for  the underground and capital repair of wells, and of production  facilities and shops not directly engaged in the extraction and  preparation of oil was suspended for six weeks from the  beginning of April. Employees of the production facilities,  which have been halted, are being granted administrative leave  with payment of the minimum wage.    The situation is exacerbated by the fact that sulfur-bearing  oil has entirely ceased to be pumped to Kremenchug Oil Refinery  owing to uncertainties in relations between Ukraine and Russia.  This has made it necessary to halt all extraction of  sulfur-bearing oil, which was being extracted from 5,300 wells.    The 50th anniversary of the opening of the first oil field  on  the Republic's territory was celebrated in Tataria [Tatarstan]  last fall. This is only the third year that Tataria, which  proclaimed the underground wealth to be its own property, has  been independently exporting oil (within the quota agreed with  Russia). The stake on petrodollars was very high when  formulating and realizing the ideas of the republic's  sovereignty. The proceeds from oil sales helped to soften the  entry into the market for Tataria's inhabitants. But today, the  oil sector's indicators are simply joyless. Suffice it to say  that oil extraction in the first quarter of this year fell by  1.8 million tonnes compared with the same period last year.    Oilmen believe that only concerted action by Tataria and  Russia can ensure a way out of the grave crisis.</p>

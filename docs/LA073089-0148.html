			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 10% INCREASE IN REFUSE HAULER'S FEE IS APPROVED IN HAWTHORNE  </P> <P> In an attempt to help resolve a $2.5-million budget deficit, the Hawthorne City  Council has approved a plan to raise the city refuse contractor's franchise fee  10%, with the cost to be passed on to city residents and businesses.  </P> <P> The council differed sharply over the plan last week, and finally voted 3 to 1  to increase the fee for one year.  </P> <P> Mayor Betty J. Ainsworth, Councilman Charles Bookhammer and Councilman Steven  Andersen supported the revenue-raising measure, while Councilwoman Ginny M.  Lambert blasted the plan as a thinly disguised tax imposed without the  necessary voter approval.  </P> <P> "Essentially this city is disenfranchised," Lambert contended, noting that the  fee increase was handled without a public hearing even though residents will  end up footing the bill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Represented by Council  </P> <P> Andersen bristled at Lambert's comment and called it "a flat misstatement." He  said the public is represented by its elected City Council: "They have the vote  of the people who sit up here. That is their voice. We can be removed if we are  not their voice."  </P> <P> The increased fee, effective retroactively to July 1, will raise the city's  revenue by $550,000, helping to offset its $2.5-million deficit for 1989-90,  City Manager R. Kenneth Jue said in an interview Friday.  </P> <P> The increase will raise the average household's monthly refuse bill to $10.45  from the current $9.40, placing it "right in the ballpark" for refuse fees in  neighboring cities, Jue said.  </P> <P> Jue said the city is searching for ways to provide additional funds to replace  two sources of revenue -- paramedic fees and sales taxes -- that have fallen  short of expectations.  </P> <P> If revenues are not increased, the city may have to lay off as many as 32  employees and close one fire station to balance the $44.8-million budget, Jue  said. A budget hearing is scheduled Aug. 21.  </P> <P> At Monday's council meeting, Lambert attacked the franchise fee increase,  saying that it amounted to a new tax that, by law, should have been subject to  a citywide vote. Proposition 62, a ballot measure enacted by state voters in  November, 1986, bars cities from enacting new taxes without voter approval.  </P> <P> Lambert pressed for a delay on the council vote, saying that the issue was  handled hurriedly, without proper public notice. City officials said the issue  needed to be resolved quickly to meet a Los Angeles County deadline for  information to be included on county property tax bills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increase Passed On  </P> <P> She noted that the item on Monday's council agenda made no mention that the  increased franchise fee would be passed on to city residents and businesses.  Lambert said that the language of the measure should be changed to spell out  that the increase will be passed along.  </P> <P> Under close questioning by Lambert, City Atty. Michael Adamson said that the  city has to word the measure carefully. The city has a binding contract with H  &amp; C Disposal Co. that cannot be changed without the consent of the  contractor. H &amp; C would be unlikely to agree to the 10% increase unless it  could be passed through to customers, he said.  </P> <P> Also, he made it clear that the city does not want to word the measure so that  it becomes a tax subject to voter approval. "If you impose the fee on citizens  directly, you probably have a contract violation. And you also have a tax,"  said Adamson.  </P> <P> "That's exactly my point," retorted Lambert.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Controversy Not New  </P> <P> Controversy over the city's refuse collection system is not new. In 1984-85,  the Los Angeles County Grand Jury conducted an investigation of Hawthorne city  government and recommended that the city seek bids on the contract. H &amp; C  has hauled the city's trash since 1957, and the city has never sought  competitive bids.  </P> <P> In March, without competitive bids, the City Council voted 3-2 to give H &amp;  C a five-year extension on its contract. Andersen, who voted for the added five  years, said the company has earned the extension because of its good service.  </P> <P> But Lambert, who voted with Ainsworth against the extension, questioned the  long-term contract and the recent extension. "I don't think we have done right  by our constituents," she said at the time.  </P></p>

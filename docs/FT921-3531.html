			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Thomas Cook slims corporate card service THOMAS COOK, the travel services arm of the Midland Bank, has staged a partial withdrawal from the corporate credit-card market which it entered less than two years ago. Small business customers of Thomas Cook have received a letter from its corporate card division telling them that their card facilities are being withdrawn at less than 48 hours notice. About 400 companies are affected with a total of 600 corporate cards. Thomas Cook believes this is around 13 per cent of the market. The cards carry the MasterCard branding. Thomas Cook said yesterday the decision had been made because of the growing cost of operating the corporate card service for small business customers. Small business customers have been told that they can only continue to use the corporate card if they also make regular use of Cook's direct travel services. Ms Stephanie Booth Maple, chief executive of Maple Leaf Holdings, a Manchester retailer which was told that it could no longer use the card, described the company's letter to its customers as very high-handed. 'Everyone is entitled to make commercial decisions, but I was surprised at the tone of the letter we got,' she said.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Bellwether still set on winning Aberdeen Bellwether Exploration Company said yesterday that it remained convinced of the merits of its proposed merger with Aberdeen Petroleum, which would improve the marketability of both companies' shares. On Monday, Aberdeen urged investors not to support the suggested swap of 3.75 Aberdeen shares for each of Nasdaq-quoted Bellwether's, saying there was minimal marketability in the latter's stock. Yesterday Bellwether used the same claim against its target. It added that a merger would make considerable expertise available to Aberdeen, through the services of Torch Energy Advisors, which manages Bellwether's oil and gas assets worth Dollars 1.3bn. Bellwether also stressed that 57 per cent of its shares are held by three UK-based institutions. Aberdeen's shares yesterday added  1/4 p to 11p.</p>

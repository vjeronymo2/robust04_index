			<p>BFN     [Text] The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, has said the  time is not yet ripe for declaring the general amnesty in Jammu  and Kashmir or lifting the ban on the militant outfit JKLF  [Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front]. He said the stage for general  amnesty will come when the center takes a political decision as  a final solution to the problem. In an interview to PTI, the  home minister said the Jammu and Kashmir government has already  been reviewing the cases of release of some of the detenus  against whom there were no serious charges. Mr. Chavan said he  will be visiting the state in about a months time to hold public  meetings in various areas.    In Jammu and Kashmir, curfew has been imposed in Bhadarwah  town of Doda District as a precautionary measure following the  killing of a youth by the militants this morning. The youth was  shot dead by the militants while he was going to an adjoining  locality.    Most of the foreign mercenaries in Kashmir are critical of  Pakistan for misleading them on jihad as they do not find the  prevailing situation in the valley as such. Two Pakistani  mercenaries -- Mohammad Ramzan of Faisalabad and Fahadullah of  Multan told newspersons at Jammu yesterday that Pakistan is  infiltrating foreign mercenaries into Kashmir for political  purposes after indoctrinating them in the name of jihad. They  said there is no danger to Islam in Kashmir. Both of them  disclosed that the Lahore based (Markaz-e-Dawatul Arshad) and  the ISI [Inter Services Intelligence] are training Muslims from  foreign countries for fanning international terrorism in the  name of jihad.</p>

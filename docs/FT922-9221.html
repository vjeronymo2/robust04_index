			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Mercury increases pay bill by 5.7% MERCURY Communications has increased its salary bill by 5.7 per cent, putting pay rises at the telecommunications group at the top end of current awards, Hugo Dixon and David Goodhart write. Mercury, BT's main rival in the telecommunications market, has also improved benefits, including paternity leave and a helpline for staff. Individual rises will vary because Mercury operates a performance-related pay scheme. The scheme takes account of market rates and the company's financial position as well as the performance of individual employees. Mercury, which does not recognise unions, prides itself on being at the forefront of industry in setting pay and conditions. The National Communications Union, the main BT union, claims that the generosity of the deal is in part a response to its present recruiting efforts. Mr Alan Harley, NCU national organiser, said Mercury responded 'in a friendly manner' before the general election. But since then 'it has stopped replying to our letters'.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Greenspan angry at banking plans Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has launched a scathing attack on administration proposals for overhauling US bank regulation. He says the plan to transfer regulatory powers from the Fed to a single new banking commission would seriously undermine the Fed's ability to respond to potential financial crises and reduce the quality of bank supervision by removing important 'checks and balances' in the current system of multiple regulators. It would also make the Fed less sensitive to monetary conditions and thus threaten the efficiency of monetary policy. Mr Greenspan's criticisms are contained in a rare signed article in today's Wall Street Journal. The Clinton administration has proposed that a new Federal Banking Commission should assume regulatory powers now divided among the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Under the plan the Fed would lose its regulatory authority over about 1,000 banks and 6,300 bank holding companies. Officials say consolidation of regulatory powers in one agency would eliminate duplication and create a simpler, more consistent regulatory system. The Fed would have access to all information collated by the new commission. Mr Greenspan says it 'is unrealistic and unduly hopeful to believe that the knowledge and expertise the Federal Reserve needs to do its job properly can be gained from studying the exam reports of another agency, having narrow authority to examine the payments system, or having representation on the board of a monolithic regulatory institution.' He concedes the present regulatory system 'has not been functioning efficiently in recent years' but says there are many alternative solutions.</p>

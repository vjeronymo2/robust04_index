			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Liffe set to relaunch Ecu bond future THE London International Financial Futures Exchange is relaunching its Ecu bond future tomorrow, in an effort to revive interest in the flagging contract, which started trading last March. Liffe has instituted a formal market-making scheme, under which five firms - Deutsche Bank, San Paolo, Swiss Bank Corporation, Tokai International, and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - will make prices at a maximum bid/offer spread of four basis points in a minimum amount of 15 contracts. The contract design has been changed to include only sovereign debt, but will allow greater flexibility in the selection of deliverable bonds.</p>

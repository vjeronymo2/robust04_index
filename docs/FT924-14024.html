			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / IBM warns on chip chemicals INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) said yesterday it had reduced the use of two chemicals used to make semiconductors which are suspected of causing miscarriages among women workers, Reuter reports from Armonk, New York. The company said the use of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and ethylene glycol monethyl ether acetate was cut by 40 per cent between 1989 and 1991. The two have not been incorporated into any newly developed chipmaking processes, an IBM spokesman said. According to a study by Johns Hopkins University that IBM commissioned, 10 of 30 women who worked with the chemicals at two IBM plants and then became pregnant had miscarriages. IBM has told its own workers, all other semiconductor makers in the US, and its suppliers about the study. Mr Jim Ruderman, a spokesman for the company, emphasised that the study's results were preliminary. He said that the results to date did not establish a 'direct link' between use of the chemicals and the miscarriages but showed a 'preliminary link'. He added the number of miscarriages was small but statistically significant. Mr Ruderman said IBM was 'continuously finding advances' in semiconductor manufacturing processes, and 'the environment that may have caused the miscarriages may or may not exist anymore'.</p>

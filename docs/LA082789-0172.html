			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSESSMENT OF LYNCH  </P> <P> The purpose of this letter is to comment on some of the claims made by Assessor  John J. Lynch with respect to his explanation of the failure of his office to  process Proposition 60 applications (Speaking Out, Aug. 6).  </P> <P> In his carefully worded response to Jenny Erickson's complaint about the  processing of Proposition 60 claims, Lynch attempts to portray himself as a  champion of responsive taxpayer assistance. Nothing could be further from the  truth.  </P> <P> The essence of Lynch's response to Erickson is a good example of his real  commitment to "quick action." Although she initiated the sequence of events in  December, 1986, Lynch refuses to admit that his office failed to timely process  the claim, lamely blaming Erickson and her adviser. As if this isn't  objectionable enough, Lynch tells her to wait until December, 1989 for her  refund, years after his department could have processed the claim.  </P> <P> It is a shame that Lynch's best response to a senior citizen is to only promise  that to resolve her problem will still require another six months.  </P> <P> MICHAEL J. SCHAAF  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

The Frontier Corps and  Antinarcotics Task Force will work jointly to implement the  program. A high-level meeting in Islamabad today reviewed  various aspects of the prevailing narcotics problem in the  country. Federal minister for interior and narcotics control,  Major General, retired, Nasirullah Khan Babar, presided over the  meeting which was also attended by governor of NWFP [North-West  Frontier Province], Major General, retired, Khurshid Ali Khan,  and other senior officials. The meeting considered mechanics to  eliminate the cultivation of poppy and cannabis and decided to  involve tribal elders in this process. Stress was laid on  adoption of strict measures to eradicate drug abuse and  interdiction of illicit narco-trafficking. It was decided that  a comprehensive legislation should be enacted to effectively  deal with all aspects of the drug menace before its extension to  FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas].</p>

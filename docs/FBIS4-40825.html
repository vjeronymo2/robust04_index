			<p>BFN     [Text] On Monday the Russian Deputy Minister for Foreign  Economic Relations Georgiy Gabunia told INTERFAX that Russia and  the European Union have reached agreement on a draft treaty for  partnership and cooperation and on Tuesday the document is  expected to be formally approved by the EU Council.    President Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of EU countries plan  to sign the document in Corfu, Greece on Friday.    According to Gabunia, the package of documents related to  the  treaty, including a joint declaration and letters of exchange,  consists of some 100 typewritten pages. Under the treaty the  European Union will recognize Russia as a country with a  transitional economy, not one with a state-run system of trade.    Gabunia said that talks on the agreement have been going on  for two years. The section on trade in commodities has caused  the greatest difficulties. The sides decided to offer each  other most- favored-nation status in trade. The treaty has  sections regulating business and investment activities, in  particular the formation and operation of companies, the flow of  capital and payments. It describes cooperation in finance,  economy, culture and crime- prevention.    The implementation of the agreement will be controlled by a  Cooperation Council formed of high-ranking government officials:  ministers or deputy prime-ministers. Under the draft the  council is to assemble onece a year. Routine control will be  carried out by a Cooperation Committee consisting of officials  of a lower rank and experts.</p>

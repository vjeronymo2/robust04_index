"The attacks were well-calculated, planned assassinations," Mr  Khoza told a press conference at the Inkatha Freedom Party  offices Monday night.    Questioning the role of the security forces in the  afternoon's mayhem, he said the IFP had received information on  Sunday evening that the African National Congress (ANC) meant to  attack the march and he had personally passed this on to the SA  Defence Force and the police. They had telephoned the IFP on  Monday morning to confirm this was true but it was too late to  stop the march even if he had wanted to, said Mr Khoza.    The trouble allegedly started as the march -- about 10,000  Zulus massed in support of King Goodwill Zwelithini and his  demand for Zulu sovereignty -- moved past ANC headquarters.  "They sniped at us from the building. One of our leaders was  killed on the spot and others were seriously hurt," said Mr  Khoza.    Later when the marchers were gathered in Library Gardens "a  hail of bullets came down from the buildings".    According to police and press reports, it now appears that  up  to 18 people were killed during, before and in the ensuing chaos  which followed this incident.    Mr Khoza said the question was why the security forces,  already warned by the information passed on to them by the IFP,  had not prevented the sniping. "And if that is not enough  several of our people were also shot and killed by the police."    The people who had been killed were the same who the  Goldstone Commission had accused him of supplying with arms, Mr  Khoza noted. "Nothing has been said about the ANC and their  caches. No amount of killing will fade our hearts. It is  freedom we are committed to...the struggle continues. But at  the end of the day we are left with bitterness and stress and a  wish that it does not happen again, not to anyone."</p>

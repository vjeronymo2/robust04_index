			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Description of plan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 12, 1993, the SCAQMD adopted its Rate-of-Progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plan, following reasonable notice and public hearing. CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted the Rate-of-Progress plan as a proposed SIP revision on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1993. The submitted plan shows a 1990 base year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions inventory of 1683 tons per day of reactive organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds (ROC), an adjusted 1990 inventory of 1450 tons per day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (after subtracting FMVCP and RVP reductions of 233), resulting in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a 1996 target emissions reductions of 217.5 tons per day. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit for fully adopted State and local measures and taking into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account growth in emissions through 1996, the plan achieves almost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all of the reductions needed to meet the target. The plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addresses the small remaining shortfall by commitments to adopt 9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SCAQMD measures in 1994, one SCAQMD measure in 1995, and one CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measure: the enhanced I/M program. Even after applying an 80  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent rule effectiveness discount (in accordance with EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy), the proposed SCAMQD measures alone would eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shortfall, without the need to count credits assigned to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced I/M program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 110(k)(4) of the Act, EPA has the authority to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditionally approve the South Coast plan based upon the State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitment to adopt these measures. However, EPA's current policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not allow approval of rate-of-progress plans if they depend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon commitments to adopt measures in order to meet the 15 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction requirement. See Memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, ``Guidance on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues Related to 15 Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans,'' August 23,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993. As a result, EPA intends not to take action to approve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Coast Rate-of-Progress Plan at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Conditional approval of commitments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, EPA policy does not allow approval of 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Percent Rate-of-Progress Plans based on committal measures. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with this policy, EPA does not propose to assign credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the SCAQMD committal measures and approve the progress plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until all measures are submitted in fully enforceable form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, commitments that strengthen the existing SIP can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved, although without assignment of emission reduction credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to conditionally approve the SCAQMD commitments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to adopt the measures listed below, as strengthening the SIP. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has evaluated the commitments to adopt measures and finds that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those commitments to adopt rules before 1996 are eligible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditional approval under section 110(k)(4). EPA cannot propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conditionally approve commitments to adopt measures with 1996 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later adoption dates because the SCAQMD's commitment may extend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond one year from the date of the final conditional approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action (see pages 2&hyph;4 and 6&hyph;2 of the plan, and the SCAQMD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resolution of Adoption).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Commitments to adopt measures to contribute emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in the period 1990&hyph;1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SCAQMD has committed to adopt fully enforceably controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 1994 for the following measures:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> P&hyph;B&hyph;7, Further Control of Emissions from Bulk Terminals; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P&hyph;C&hyph;1, Further Emission Reductions from Rubber Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&hyph;B&hyph;2, Control of Emissions from Gasoline Transfer: Phase II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Improvements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&hyph;B&hyph;3, Control of Emissions from Pleasure Boat Fueling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&hyph;B&hyph;5, Further Control of Emissions from Gasoline Dispensing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Facilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&hyph;B&hyph;6, Control of Emissions from Utility Engine Refueling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&hyph;B&hyph;9, Control of Emissions from Active Draining of Liquid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Products;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&hyph;C&hyph;2, Control of Emissions from Commercial Charbroiling; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A&hyph;C&hyph;4, Control of Emissions from Deep-Fat Frying. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SCAQMD committal measure scheduled for adoption in 1995 is A&hyph;F&hyph;1, Installation of Best Available Retrofit Control Technology on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Miscellaneous Sources. All of the measures are listed in Table 4&hyph;1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the plan, along with the identification of the date for full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation, the implementing agency, and the 1996 ROC emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions with and without the 80 percent rule effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discount. Appendix A of the plan provides further details on each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the measures, including descriptions of the regulatory history,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed method of control, and the calculation of emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions and cost effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

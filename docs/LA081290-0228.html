			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVATION OF WATER NEW WHITTIER LAW  </P> <P> City Council members last week unanimously passed a water conservation  ordinance that they hope will cut local water use by about 10%.  </P> <P> The new law makes it illegal to hose down surfaces such as sidewalks and  driveways or to allow gutters to flood repeatedly or water pipes to leak.  </P> <P> Restaurants may serve water only on request under the ordinance, and  landscaping and lawns can be watered only before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m.  </P> <P> Violators have 24 hours to correct a problem after receiving written notice.  Then the city can send another notice, install water-saving devices or  disconnect water service. Repeated offenses carry a fine of up to $300 and a  jail term of up to 30 days.  </P> <P> Neil Hudson, director of the Public Services Department, said the penalties  would apply only to the most crass, repeat offenders.  </P> <P> "There's some teeth in here so we can deal with that type of individual," he  told council members, but overall the conservation program will be "soft sell."  </P> <P> Whittier's ordinance is based on a similar one developed by Monrovia. The law,  which applies only to residents who buy water from the city, will automatically  become void in April unless continuing drought conditions prompt the council to  re-enact it.  </P></p>

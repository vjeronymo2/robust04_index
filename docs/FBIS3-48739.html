The noise of long-tail boats was deafening as boat after boat  skimmed along the rivers while passengers chatted away.    This was not a normal scene. During the war when there were  only the sound of gunfire and the smell of gunsmoke not many  people dared to use the rivers.    However, since the Burmese Government ceased military  operations in the Karen State in April 1992, the atmosphere has  changed and more people have since traveled this route.    These extraordinary events took place as the Karens living  on  the banks of the Moei and Salween rivers came to the Manerplaw  Headquarters of General Bo Mya, president of the Karen National  Union [KNU], located on the banks of the Moei river about 50 km  north of Ban Mae Tawo pier in Tha Song Yang District, Tak  Province. Many also came by foot from across nearby mountains.    They Karens came to celebrate the 67th birthday of Gen. Bo  Mya on 20 January, to express their loyalty, and convey their  greetings to the man they regard as the leader of the Karens. A  minority group, the Karens have waged a protracted struggle  against the Burmese Government, and every year they have only  few days for such joyous activities.    The grounds of the Manerplaw camp was thronged by people  from  the evening of 19 January, the first day of the celebrations.  There were 11 folk performances, most of which were meant to  arouse patriotic feelings. The performers totaled in the  hundreds, and those who satisfied the organizing committee would  receive several thousand bahts in reward.    Lasting over half the night, the performances were a prelude  to the celebrations.    The next morning before the fog cleared, thousands were  already gathered in great anticipation. Gen. Bo Mya and his  family sat on the stage waiting for the ceremonies to take place.    A Buddhist ceremony performed by about 10 Karen monks  started  off the occasion. Then, Karen student leaders of various levels  sang greetings to the melodies of church hymns, praising the  revered leader.    Then, for almost an hour, Karens representatives who lived  too far away to attend the celebrations, read their greetings.    Next came a party representing several Karen groups under  the  control of Gen. Bo Mya along the Thai-Burmese border from Mae  Hong Son to Ranong Provinces. They included the All Burma  Student Democratic Front [ABSDF] representatives from Dawngwin  camp, Karen alliance groups, and even Thai logging firm  operators. They lined up to hand gifts to Gen. Bo Mya.    As with earlier years, most of the gifts were blankets, a  necessity not only for Gen. Bo Mya but for Karen soldiers in the  field as well. Gen. Bo Mya then blew out the candles and cut  the big cake given by his men.    Next came what all Karens eagerly waited for -- Gen. Bo  Mya's address. The address in Karen was translated into English  sentence by sentence. His address seemed to reflect his  sincerity and long experience of the struggle. It was full of  substance and determination and was punctuated by occasional  applause from the big audience.    That concluded the official ceremonies.    In the afternoon, attendants gathered on the edge of the  field which was used as a boxing ring. Boxing is the favorite  sport of Karens of all ages, and all of them waited eagerly for  the event. The event began with fights between volunteers, who  were picked by referees on the spot. Some boxers were only  about 100 cm tall. Foreign visitors were surprised by the  enthusiasm of these boxers. There were many willing boxers and  all the referee had to do was to give the signal.    There was no fixed length for a match. The pair displaying  skills that pleased the cheering crowd would be allowed to fight  longer. The boxers fought viciously. There would be two  referees in each match to ensure that a boxer would not be taken  unfair advantage by the other. Some matches were so exciting  that they had to be interrupted for other matches before  resuming.    After the match, each boxer would be given bunches of  20-baht  and 100-baht notes by the referees as a prize.    As dusk approached, the audience began to disperse and the  boxing matches, which evidently projected a quality of the  Karens, ended. This quality is their fighting and sporting  spirit. They love boxing and they do not bet on matches. There  were no shouts offering odds during matches as would be the case  in Thailand. Gambling and alcohol are strictly prohibited in  Karen land.    Karens participants of the celebrations waited for the night  of 20 January, for "Li Ke Karen" [Karen folk play] which was  held on the same field. These people thoroughly enjoyed each  other and the play. The next day everything returned to normal  at Manerplaw camp, and those who came from afar returned to  their homes, while camp members would resume their normal daily  chores.    Many agreed that the attendance at this year's celebrations  was smaller than previous years. Not many dared to offer  reasons, but some claimed that Gen. Bo Mya's influence had  declined and so he had less interests to be exploited. In any  event, this seemed to be the current situation with the Karen  general.    In mid 1993 there were attempts by certain Burmese minority  groups, such as the Kachin, the Wa, Shan, Pa-O, and other  groups, to seek a cease-fire with the Burmese Government. There  was a report that the Karens and the Burmese Government would  negotiate a cease-fire in early 1994. The world is following  the outcome of this event closely.    However, Gen. Bo Mya recently said: "The negotiations  between  the Karen and the Burmese did not take place. If a negotiation  is to take place, it is likely to be held in a third country,  possibly Thailand. First the Thai Government will have to give  its consent. The Karens have not approached the Thai Government  on this matter. The KNU will have to hold internal consultations  on the timing of the negotiation.    "On our part, we will negotiate with the Burmese military  government, but the negotiations must cover every political  field, such as freedom and the liberty of minority citizens and  political issues. We feel that there must be negotiations with  every group, including the revolutionary group and the Burmese  people. This will result in peace in the country. If the  negotiation involves only the KNU, peace will probably not  materialize nationwide."    Regarding the attempt by certain minority groups to seek  negotiations with the Burmese Government:    "Those groups do not uphold correct political principle.  Their action amounts to a surrender or a subjugation of  themselves to the enemy without undertaking political  negotiations to resolve the people's problems. The minority  groups that participated in cease-fire negotiations are groups  that have no political ideology."    On this, Nai Aung, president of the ABSDF, whose command  post  is located on the bank of Salween river, opposite Ban Mae  Samlap, Sop Moei subdistrict, Mae Hong Son, and who participated  in the celebrations of Gen. Bo Mya's birthday, said:    "The Burmese military government will negotiate with each of  the minority groups in the format that it wants. This is no  problem, providing that the negotiations deal with solutions to  the political problems, to freedom and liberty problems, and  diversities among the different minority groups. If these  negotiations succeed, other minority groups will benefit as  well. In any event, the students have not negotiated with the  Burmese Government."    An issue that occupied great attention was the projected  construction of dams on the Moei and Salween rivers by the Thai  and Burmese Governments. The project will result in the areas  on both banks of the rivers being submerged. The Karen forces  and the student group occupy the Burmese side of the rivers.    On this issue, Gen. Bo Mya clearly opposed the project.    He said: "The construction of the dams will definitely  affect  us. Farmland will be lost. Our people will suffer. Most  importantly, our areas of operation will be curtailed. So far,  we have written to the World Bank and the free governments to  help them understand the picture so that they will not support  the project."    What if this effort fails?    "If our appeals fail we will resort to violence to stop it."    Meanwhile, Nai Aung said:    "We do not support dams on the Moei and Salween rivers. The  student group will write their about the opposition to the dams  to international organizations, environmental conservation  groups, and international humanitarian groups to inform them  that the project will destroy natural resources and human  rights. Thailand may want to solve its domestic energy problem,  but we have our problems too."    "If our opposition does not succeed, we will resort to  violence in our territory to block the construction. That is  our last resort."    Now that the direction and objectives of the two individuals  who are allied in the struggle against the Burmese Govrnment are  the same, the situation in the Salween river along the  Thai-Burmese border is clear. Whether they choose peace or  violence will depend on the future conditions.</p>

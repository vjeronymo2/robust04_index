			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 8 (CNS) -- The Fuzhou authorities  will harshly punish persons found guilty of violation of  property owned by foreign-invested enterprises and of the  personal safety of investors or of posing hazards to the normal  production of foreign-funded enterprises.    The Fuzhou police recently decided to further boost the  administration of public order for foreign-invested enterprises  here in a bid to safeguard the normal running of these  enterprises as well as the legitimate rights and interests of  investors.    There are now some 3 000 foreign-funded enterprises approved  for operation here and public security for these enterprises and  their running was generally stable. Incidents in breach of the  legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises,  however, such as thefts committed by workers in a handful of  foreign-funded enterprises, disruption of enterprises by  outsiders, blackmail and extortion as well as fighting are not  something new. Adverse effects on these enterprises are  therefore the result.    The Fuzhou bureau of public security set up a special  leading  team responsible for public order for foreign-invested  enterprises. The team will keep an watchful eye on public  security for these enterprises while at the same time working  out policies, carrying out inspections and supervision as well  as studying the main security problems related to  foreign-invested businesses. The bureau has asked the police at  various levels to carry out their duty of protecting  foreign-funded enterprises. Great attention must be given by  the local police regarding various kinds of criminal offences  reported by these enterprises and a rapid response and  settlement of the problem must be made.    In a similar development, Vice Mayor Mr. Gong Xiong has  asked  the judicial department to actively deal with economic disputes  related to foreign-invested enterprises in accordance with the  law.</p>

The decision was made at a kwaZulu cabinet  meeting, a statement by Mr Buthelezi said. "The kwaZulu  government will therefore not hold itself responsible for the  consequences which may ensue should such an invasion take place  in areas under the jurisdiction of the kwaZulu police. And nor  will the kwaZulu government be held accountable for anything  that takes place outside formal arrangements and co-operation  with the kwaZulu government," said the statement.    Mr Buthelezi said both police forces could operate in each  other's jurisdiction only after consultation.</p>

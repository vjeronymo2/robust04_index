			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Move to tighten Libya sanctions THE US, Britain and France yesterday introduced a Security Council resolution tightening sanctions against Libya to press Tripoli to handing over for trial two men accused of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, Reuter reports from New York. No vote has been scheduled in the 15-member council on the draft. The document suggests a freezing of Libya's financial assets abroad, but excludes funds derived from oil, natural gas or agricultural products. It proposes a ban on the sale of oil-related equipment for refineries and for transporting oil and gives a detailed list of this equipment. It also closes loopholes on the air embargo against Libya, in force since April 1992, such as immediate closure of Libyan airline offices abroad.</p>

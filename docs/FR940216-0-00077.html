This approach offers several important advantages. First, it takes full advantage of existing knowledge regarding the effects of the parameter in question on emissions. Second, it reduces inconsistencies between the complex model and the augmentation, thereby simplifying certification and enforcement. Third, it reduces the possibility of petitioners deliberately manipulating the test program to obtain a desired augmentation since the limited data generated by the test program will be combined with the much more extensive data available in the complex model database. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis process is described in detail in section 80.48 of today's regulations and in Section IV.G of the RIA. The process requires that the emission effects of the parameter being tested be verified at the extended level while not permitting emission effects of other parameters to be modified from the effects incorporated in the complex model. In addition, the augmentation would only apply to fuels with levels of the parameter being tested that fall outside the range for which the complex model is valid. These safeguards are intended to prevent the results of vehicle testing from being used to alter aspects of the complex model that a fuel supplier or other organization deems undesirable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Data analysis to add new fuel parameters.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Vehicle test data for new fuel parameters such as new additives cannot be analyzed in the manner described above for existing fuel parameters. Vehicle-to-vehicle variability can cause significant differences in vehicle responses to parameters already included in the complex model from what the complex model would predict. The analysis method described above would apply these differences entirely to the new parameter, which would allow substantial opportunities to game the testing and model augmentation process. To minimize the risk of gaming and assure proper representation of the effects of new fuel parameters, a different analysis process must be used when augmenting the model with a new fuel parameter. This process is designed to identify the effects of the new parameter itself, including its behavior upon dilution, as well as any interactive effects between the parameter and existing complex model parameters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The process itself is described in detail in section 80.48 in today's regulations and in Section IV of the RIA. The modeling process incorporates five techniques to minimize gaming and isolate the actual emission effects of the new parameter being tested. First, the complex model is used to adjust the emissions performance of the test vehicles on the three fuels for any differences in fuel parameters other than the one being tested. These adjustments should be minor, since fuel properties other than the one being tested are required to be nearly identical. Second, the linear and squared terms for the new parameter are determined based on test data from addition fuels 1, 2, and 3 before interactive effects are introduced into the augmented complex model based on the results of testing addition fuels 4, 5, 6, and 7. This approach is used because the direct effects of fuel parameters (represented by the linear and squared terms) are less easily gamed or obscured than are interactive effects since fewer variables are involved. Third, the statistical criteria defined in section 80.57 are used to assure that only statistically significant terms are included in the augmentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth, the model must include all terms for the pollutant being modeled that are already included in the complex model. In addition, only the linear, squared, and interactive terms involving the new parameter are permitted to enter the augmentation. The coefficients for the complex model terms will be fixed at the values established in this rule. By not permitting the augmentation to change existing complex model terms, the analysis process reduces opportunities to game to modify complex model effects that the testing organization considers undesirable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

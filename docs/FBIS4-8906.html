			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic] </F>   [Excerpt] The situation in Gorazde is becoming ever more  dramatic and the [Serbian] fascists are again massing along all  the lines of attack on the town. The greatest concentration of  chetniks and the largest amount of military hardware have been  registered in the valley of the Praca River from the direction  of Necici toward Jabucko Sedlo and Sjenokos. The situation in  the town (?center) is taking on the bloodiest proportions. The  innocent civilian population has been suffering from being out  in the open. A wide-scale epidemic is threatening, so Gorazde  is again sending an appeal for help for the suffering. The  situation in the war hospital, the health center is worse than  sad. No words can describe the situation there. Dozens of  civilian victims killed by the criminals from the hills are  lying in the streets of the town and on the bridges over the  Drina. It was impossible to help them at all, as the chetniks  blanketed every inch of the free Gorazde territory, and  particularly the town center, with fierce artillery and sniper  fire from the surrounding hills.

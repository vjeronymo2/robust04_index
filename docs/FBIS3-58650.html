			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Guido Passalacqua report: "Rooting for Italy Weds League"] </F>   [Text] Milan -- A day of shameless, extreme denials --  including even denials of obvious facts -- was followed late in  the evening by an admission, in the best tradition of  old-fashioned politics. This is what happened with the meeting  in Brescia between People's Party leaders Mino Martinazzoli and  Roberto Formigoni and the League's Lower House floor leader,  Roberto Maroni, the great architect of the liberal-democratic  alignment. The meeting was supposed to be top secret and could  perhaps have marked a politicoelectoral turning point, but  instead saw no change in its participants' starting positions.  Basically, this means that Martinazzoli remains unwilling to  establish electoral agreements with the League.    The three politicians' desire for secrecy was undermined by  an unknown citizen of Brescia who informed an ANSA correspondent  about Maroni and Formigoni arriving at Martinazzoli's office,  thus nullifying all the precautions and denials. The meeting  was organized by Formigoni, who had been bombarding Maroni's  telephone answering machine with messages since Friday [14  January]: His aim was to find a point of agreement between the  League and the former Christian Democrats, albeit only on the  principle of not competing in the electoral constituencies.    In the event, after over an hour's discussions, the three  parted without any shift from their starting positions. After a  series of "no comments," Maroni admitted: "There is nothing  doing; they are going their own way." Then in an official  statement he said: "My impression is that there is no scope for  joint action." He added: "I listened to Martinazzoli's  arguments, his `yeses' and `noes' to the entry of the People's  Party [PPI] or of what remains of it in the alignment that is  taking shape, and I acknowledged a situation of basic  irreconcilability between our positions."    In practice, this was the final admission of the  impossibility of an agreement with Martinazzoli's former  Christian Democratic Party [DC]. Shortly before that a  statement emanating from circles close to the People's Party  Secretariat confirmed the outcome of the meeting.  Martinazzoli's adviser, Rocco Buttiglione, commented: "The  center has already been established between [Pact for Italy  leader] Segni and Martinazzoli," in practice excluding the  League from a key role in the future alliance. The only ones  who interpreted the Brescia meeting positively were the  neocentrists, who have their bags packed and are ready to set  off for an accord with the League and who judged the failure of  the meeting in Brescia a good thing.    But Maroni's hectic morning did not stop in Brescia, in  Martinazzoli's legal practice on via Gramsci. After his private  meeting with the secretary of the PPI-DC, he set off back down  the highway and by 1330 was at Silvio Berlusconi's villa at  Arcore. This was another political meeting, this time more  productive. Over lunch Berlusconi, Maroni, and the organizers  of Rooting for Italy discussed everything. Starting with a  stocktaking of the political situation. Maroni explained the  situation regarding relations with the Catholics and Segni  following the meeting with Martinazzoli, then they broached the  main issues on the agenda -- drawing up lists of candidates and  examining the constituencies. Names of a number of figures from  the entertainment and sports world have already been mentioned.  The crucial issue of whether or not Berlusconi will stand as a  candidate was also broached. For the present it seems that  Fininvest's president has not yet decided and that he is waiting  to see more clearly how the situation evolves. Meanwhile, an  agreement has apparently been reached on the League and Rooting  for Italy presenting single candidates in the various  constituencies under the same symbol.    Yesterday's two political meetings strengthened the League's  grip. On the one hand, the League members saw specific  confirmation of what they have been saying over and over for  days and what they confirmed with the decisions adopted by the  Federal Council session at the end of last week -- that is, that  there is no scope for maneuver with Martinazzoli, despite the  fact that some people portray the secretary of the former DC as  willing to come to an agreement with the League. On the other  hand, however, stronger relations are being established with  Berlusconi, who is now the League's special partner. Maroni is  already listing the components of the alignment: "The  neocentrists will be there if they separate from the DC; Rooting  for Italy, if it enters the arena; the liberalistic Center  Union; the European federalists, if they so decide; and the  nonconfessional components of the Pact, if they do not follow  Segni in his suicidal agreement with Martinazzoli. And, last,  something new -- a left-wing grouping that is not following the  communists: Rete and Communist Renaissance. But not the  Socialists; they will have to sit this one out."    In the middle, between [League leader] Bossi and  Martinazzoli, sits Mario Segni. The League and Berlusconi are  pulling him one way, and Martinazzoli, the other. The League is  hoping to win over the referendum leader, but is not counting on  it too much. The signs are that, as the League put it, he is  "bound by a double chain to Martinazzoli," but in the confused  scenario of the center there are plenty of conflicting signs.  Having established an agreement with Berlusconi, and pending a  decision from the neocentrists, who should be arriving very  soon, having settled their business with Martinazzoli, the  League is now pondering the real question: What will Mario  Segni do?    The League and Berlusconi are willing to grant him the role  of prime minister, as proposed by the liberal-democrats, but are  pressing for Segni to make up his mind quickly. Meanwhile they  are working from the sides. Sunday [16 January] Maroni invited  Segni to a meeting, and yesterday the referendum leader replied  in an interview: "I am ready to engage in an exchange of views  with Bossi, especially after the abandonment of the League's  extremist stance on the three Italies. The exchange of views  with the League," Segni said, "must take place on the program  presented by the Pact for Italy Saturday." As for Berlusconi,  Segni said again: "He must be careful not to fragment the  center." Maroni replied from Milan: "We have sought a meeting  with Segni, but we have not yet received an invitation. The  political timetable is determined by the new electoral law.  There are only two or three days. Then if he does not want to  meet with us, we will go ahead without him." Indeed, there is  talk of a meeting between Segni, Bossi, and Maroni already  scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday, at the latest.</p>

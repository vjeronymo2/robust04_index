			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Privatisation, not efficiency, the real government objective Sir, The leaked details of the government's forthcoming civil service white paper ('Cabinet plan to reform Whitehall pay bargaining', July 5) are noteworthy not for the references to delegated pay bargaining so much as the predicted move from market testing to straight privatisation. It is claimed that there will be 'a reduced emphasis' on market testing and 'increasing encouragement for privatisation'; apparently because market testing is costly and private sector bidders are 'reluctant to bid because most contracts are won by departments' own teams'. The government's own statistics make interesting reading. Of the first Pounds 1.1bn-worth of work market tested, the private sector was awarded Pounds 855m-worth. Of this, Pounds 768m was directly contracted out, with no in-house bid permitted. Where an in-house bid was allowed, six out of seven of the market tests were won by the in-house team. So much for the exhilarating effects of exposing civil servants to the chill winds of competition with the private sector. In the foreword to the 1991 white paper, Competing for Quality, the then chancellor, Norman Lamont, said: 'Services may be bought either from the private sector or within the public sector; we have no dogmatic preference for either one over the other . . . we believe that public sector managers and staff will welcome the opportunity to compare the services they provide in fair and open competition with the best of the private sector.' An examination of the more recent Citizen's Charter second report revealed government claims for annual savings of Pounds 100m to be virtually meaningless, the figures having been calculated on anticipated savings over a 10-year period. Even then a note warned that 'the calculation of any net savings figure should be treated with caution and regarded as illustrative only'. So, on two counts the government stands exposed as having as its real objective not efficient public services but rather privatised services - regardless of the quality. Public servants and public service users are entitled to better than this. John Sheldon, general secretary, NUCPS, 124/130 Southwark Bridge, London SE1 0TU</p>

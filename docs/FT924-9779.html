			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Mubarak casts his vote Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak casts his ballot in the country's local elections yesterday. Turnout was said to be low, and the opposition put up no candidates in 85 per cent of 2,779 seats. Moslem fundamentalists, who boycotted previous local elections and the last parliamentary elections in 1987, are seeking to capture at least a handful of key local councils.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Observer: Energetic payer It must say something about Turkey - but what? - that the country's largest individual taxpayer should be Matild Manukyan, doyenne of Istanbul's madams. Last year she was busy enough to justify a Dollars 722,751 tax bill. She went along to an Istanbul chamber of commerce prize-giving ceremony for top taxpayers. But instead of receiving her gold plaque from the hands of president Suleyman Demirel himself, she was fobbed off with the chamber's vice-president. Did she feel offended? Maybe. But she must be getting used to this kind of treatment - it's the third successive year she has walked off with the prize.</p>

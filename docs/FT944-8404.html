			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Books: New order in the archipelago A NATION IN WAITING: INDONESIA IN THE 1990s by Adam Schwarz UCL Press Pounds 15.95, 370 pages A country where the president's children are routinely handed control of big businesses sounds more like a failed African dictatorship than one of Asia's free market economic successes. Such is the paradox of President Suharto's Indonesia: the authorities are corrupt, prone to nepotism and have scant respect for human rights, yet the country attracts billions of dollars in annual foreign investment and aid, and its economy grows consistently at more than six per cent a year. Indonesia is one of Asia's most important but least understood emerging economies. With more than 180m inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous country in the world, and home to more Moslems than any other nation. The archipelago stretching from Sumatra to Irian Jaya includes somewhere between 13,000 and 17,000 islands; even the Indonesians are not sure. Schwarz, who reported on Indonesia for the Far Eastern Economic Review for four years, explains many of the baffling complexities of Indonesian politics and commerce with clarity, precision and some well-chosen examples of how nepotism and cronyism function in practice. Due credit is given to Suharto's 'New Order' government for restoring political stability after the overthrow of Sukarno in 1966 and laying foundations for economic growth. But few businessmen in Jakarta would dispute Schwarz's conclusion on the economic influence of Indonesia's first family: 'In recent years,' he writes, 'hardly a single major infrastructure contract has been awarded without one Suharto relative or other having a piece of it . . the tendering process is just for appearances' sake. The only suspense is over which crony will emerge victorious.' Schwarz also explores the shifting balance of power between the armed forces and civilians in government, the role of Chinese businessmen, the different strands of Islamic thought, and the conflict in the Indonesian-occupied territory of East Timor. He also analyses the rancorous dispute between the 'technologists' and the 'technocrats': the technologists, led by BJ Habibie, the Research and Technology Minister and close friend of Suharto, favour the immediate establishment of high-technology industries; the technocrats dismiss this as costly and over-ambitious, and believe Indonesia should use its cheap labour to develop export industries step by step. Indonesians and foreigners agree, however, that the most important questions concern the succession to Suharto - the retired general is 73, has held power for 28 years and has no obvious successor - and the future evolution of the country's authoritarian political system. Will it be possible to arrange an orderly transfer of power to a new president? Has authoritarian rule, regarded as necessary by many Indonesians following the massacres of the mid-1960s, outlived its usefulness? Schwarz notes the increased militancy of factory workers, the frustration of Indonesia's sophisticated middle class with the sterility of intellectual and political debate, and the jockeying for power among army officers and politicians, but he is prevented from predicting an outcome to the succession debate by the enigmatic Suharto's refusal to state his intentions. Given that Suharto's opinions are crucial yet impenetrable, Schwarz has done an admirably thorough job of explaining the most significant political and economic dilemmas confronting the Indonesian elite.</p>

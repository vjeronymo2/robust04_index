As this reference is not publicly available, it was not cited in the Background Information Document (BID). The measurements were made at typical in-situ moistures for phosphogypsum stacks. The arithmetic average of these data is about 0.35. Thus, the value of 0.3 used in the BID is reasonable and applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data and other information (NI82) show the dependence of E on moisture. At lower moisture levels E increases significantly with moisture. This is also demonstrated in the work of van Dijk and deJong (HP91) referenced by TFI. As their Figure 4 shows, E for phosphogypsum can increase by more than 50 percent as equilibrium moisture increases. The E values of 0.18 and 0.19, reported in their Table 2 and referenced by TFI, are for nearly their driest conditions. As they were interested in the effects of using phosphogypsum in building materials, these lower values were appropriate. However, the exalation rates that they measured at higher moistures give E values of about 0.28. This is consistent with the value of 0.30 used in the risk assessments. Moisture saturations in soils under residences are expected to be near the values in the Rogers measurements and closer to the higher moisture measurements by van Dijk and deJong.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The higher emanation coefficients are further confirmed in field measurements of the specific radon flux from the surface of phosphogypsum stacks. In 1985, Dr. C.E. Roessler (University of Florida) determined that the specific radon flux from phosphogypsum stacks in central Florida was 1 pCi/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2^ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> s per pCi/g of Ra-226 in the phosphogypsum. This value requires an E value of at least 0.29.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TFI also commented that an E of 0.2 was used in the PATHRAE model (EPA87). This value was used in an example problem in the reference. However, the example problem was for soil, not phosphogypsum, and should not be construed as a recommendation for all cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Objection:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The radon diffusion for concrete is given as 16 m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /y. Published measurements of radon diffusion in concrete (HP80a, HP83) provide values that are factors of 8 to 15 lower. Use of the lower radon diffusion coefficients would reduce the indoor radon risks by a factor of about two.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The value of 16 m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /y (5.1 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  cm <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /s) for the radon diffusion coefficient of concrete (D <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> c <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is the upper end of the range of D <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> c <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 's measured for residential concretes by Nielson and Rogers (NI91). The upper end of the range was used because PATHRAE only considers radon diffusion as the entry mechanism for soil radon. While diffusion may dominate radon entry (TA90, RO90), advective transport is also a factor and may dominate under some circumstances (RO90, LO90). The value that was used for D <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> c <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the risk assessments partially accounts for the radon entry by advection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

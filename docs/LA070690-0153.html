			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WANTED: A TENANT WHO KNOWS ROACHES AREN'T PETS  </P> <P> A landlord tired of undesirable tenants said today that he has received  hundreds of phone calls since advertising for tenants with standards, including  knowing that "roaches are not household pets."  </P> <P> Landlord Jim Kennedy, 45, of New Paltz said he placed the classified ad in the  Kingston Freeman after booting a perceived drug dealer out of one of his  apartments.  </P> <P> Kennedy said he was tired of renting to the "dregs of society."  </P> <P> The advertisement requires that tenants:  </P> <P>  -- "Have a job or at least give the appearance that you could get one."  </P> <P>  -- "Have some type of schooling or at least know there are other adverbs  besides the one which starts with 'F' and ends with 'ing.' "  </P> <P>  -- "Realize roaches are not household pets and you will keep the apartment  clean so that you will not attract any."  </P> <P>  -- "Actually pay the rent on time, with a good check."  </P> <P>  -- "Realize drugs are not fun and you must have a doctor's prescription to use  them."  </P> <P>  -- "Must actually be married to your partner or at least know the correct  spelling of their last name."  </P> <P> Kennedy said he got the idea for the ad "from the people who were coming to  look at the property. I own a lot of houses and have had this problem for a  long time -- you put $200,000 into a building and it's not taken care of."  </P> <P> Kennedy said he has received 200 calls since placing the ad and "195 were  positive." He said he rented the apartment "to a lovely couple."  </P></p>

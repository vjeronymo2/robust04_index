Returning from a three-day official visit to Turkey, Baudys  said the only thing for which he could be reprimanded was that  he used two military air attaches, in Brussels and Washington,  to distribute the initiative.    "Dismissal of a minister is within the premier's  jurisdiction  and I see no reason to resign," he said, adding that he would  make no further statements on the initiative today.    Baudys will meet with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec later  tonight.    Baudys told journalists that Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin spoke shortly with him before his departure, which proves  that "in Turkey, at least, the Czech Republic's interests have  not been harmed by my initiative proposal."</p>

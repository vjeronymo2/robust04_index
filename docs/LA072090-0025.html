			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED UNDER NEW PORNOGRAPHY LAW  </P> <P> A Van Nuys man has been ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling after  pleading guilty to possession of child pornography, in the first city case  prosecuted under a new state law, the Los Angeles city attorney's office  announced.  </P> <P> Larry Earl Wiese, 40, was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to  donate $1,000 to the Children's Home Society, a nonprofit organization that  helps abused children, after entering his plea Monday in Los Angeles Municipal  Court.  </P> <P> Wiese was convicted under a law drafted by Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn  and passed last year by the California Legislature making it illegal to possess  child pornography. The statute went into effect Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Wiese was arrested Jan. 23 after police discovered pornographic materials in  his bedroom. The materials included magazines, books, photographs and  videotapes depicting nude children engaged in sex acts, Deputy City Atty. Tracy  Webb said.  </P> <P> Police discovered the materials while investigating an alleged rape at the  residence, Webb said. Wiese was not a suspect in the rape. Wiese, who was a  manager of a La Crescenta McDonald's restaurant before his arrest, faced a  maximum sentence of one year in jail, Webb said.  </P> <P> Webb said similar laws have been passed in other states and were recently  upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that a state's interest in  protecting children outweighed the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of  speech in such cases.  </P></p>

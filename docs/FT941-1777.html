			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Kurds seek last word on Turkish poll Drive south from Adana to the poor suburb of Daglioglu, and there comes a point in the road where the campaign flags and posters suddenly disappear. Among clusters of dismal mud-built tenements it would be easy to forget that Turkey was preparing for municipal elections on Sunday. This is a vote which the politicians in Ankara believe could be the prelude to early general elections, or at the very least a shake-out in the current conservative-led coalition of Mrs Tansu Ciller. Adana is in many ways the electoral frontline, Some 500km south of Ankara, it is the Turkish city closest to the Kurdish heartland in the south-east, where the separatist conflict has seriously curtailed the electoral process. Adana has a proud history. Briefly under French occupation after the Second World War, the city is an ethnic mosaic, where Turks, Arabs and Kurds live side by side in the heart of a rich agricultural belt. Four of Turkey's biggest industrial conglomerates trace their fortunes to the cotton fields and the textile wealth of the nearby Cukurova plain. This prosperity has proven a strong magnet for large numbers of economic migrants from poorer regions, particularly the nearby Kurdish-speaking areas. However, in the last few years, the cracks have been showing in Adana as the separatist violence has spread. The social and economic strains created by poor Kurds seeking work or escaping the pressures of the war have presented the municipality with a serious problem. The unemployment rate - although no ethnic breakdown is available - is believed to be twice as high in the Kurdish community compared with the city as a whole. More worrying is the prospect of a widespread Turkish nationalist backlash in the city. Some residents believe it has already started. It was here that the police took the unprecedented step of marching in protest against the office of the human rights association, which is widely seen by local Turks as being a front for radical Kurdish elements. Community loyalties are certainly stretched. When Mr Selahattin Colak, the mayor, first stood for office in 1977, local residents remember him openly playing on his Kurdish origins to win votes. This time around he is being more discreet. Even Mr Colak is not venturing into the majority-Kurdish Daglioglu district, a no-go area for most of Adana's citizens. At night the roads are patrolled by armoured personnel carriers with search lights scanning the alleyways for snipers of the Kurdish Workers' party (PKK). In what was once the city's Arab quarter, angry young radicals say they will boycott Sunday's vote, a pattern which is likely to be repeated in hundreds of towns and hamlets in the Kurdish-speaking region. At the national level, Sunday's polling to appoint mayors in more than 2,000 towns, is the first real test of the popularity of Mrs Ciller since she was chosen as leader of her True Path party (DYP) in June and became prime minister after Mr Suleyman Demirel moved to the presidency. A bad showing could trigger defections from her DYP and a possible leadership challenge. The main opposition Motherland party is describing the elections as a national referendum on Mrs Ciller's nine-month-old administration. The vote is also important as a measure of the growing national support for the Islamic Refah party (RP). In the south-east, merely holding the elections without disruption is presenting a challenge to the authorities. Diplomats point out that this is the first time since restoration of parliamentary government in 1982 that Kurdish violence has threatened nationwide elections. However, a widespread boycott would provide the most visible evidence yet of the extent to which the Turkish government has lost credibility in the Kurdish region. Ten days ago the Interior Ministry issued special instructions to secure the polling stations, but only after the pro-Kurdish Democracy party (DEP) had already withdrawn its candidates. According to some unofficial estimates from western embassies, the DEP might have been expected to win about 70 per cent in a free vote. However, the intimidation faced by the party has been considerable. At least 54 of its officials have been assassinated in the past two years. More recently, five DEP MPs have been arrested in Ankara and could now face the death penalty on charges of making speeches espousing the radical Kurdish cause. In today's climate of fear, many locals believe almost the only people who will turn out to vote will be the Korucu - the government-armed village guards and their families. In such an event, many towns and villages will fall into the hands of the neo-fascist party, the Nationalist Movement.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Arts: Mixed up breakfast menus - Television The 'Question Of The Day' is: what can you find in your garden shed? Other items on the programme include a test to see what happens when you pour a bucket of ice cubes into a man's underpants. A Scottish actor, chosen because of his role in an ITV detective series, is visited 'unexpectedly' in his home, Cilla Black style, and invited to ride a gently undulating mechanical bucking bronco. There is an embarrassingly inept attempt at square dancing. Dancing to a bhangra beat may be a bit better, though it is impossible to be sure since the item is very brief and the dancers are lost in a cloud of dry ice. Puppets called Zig and Zag, looking like rejects from the Muppets, screech so much that it is impossible to hear most of what they say. This is The Big Breakfast on Channel 4, the programme which, we are assured, has been such a ratings success that GMTV, the ITV breakfast show which notoriously displaced TV-am, has appealed successfully for an easing of its licence requirements to be able to go further down-market and compete more effectively. One of the most striking aspects of The Big Breakfast is its astonishing cheapness. The 'surprise' visit to the actor must have been the most expensive item on this day since it involved sending out a camera crew. Virtually everything else was done in the three lock-keepers' cottages which the company uses as its studio. The 'family of the week' was there, Paula Yates did her interview-on-the-bed (with, of course, Hugh Grant, star of Four Weddings And A Funeral) upstairs, and the chap who blow-dried his chickens was downstairs. The sexy building worker with bare chest, shorts and a big hod was actually on the stairs. Another striking fact is the extent to which the appeal of the programme depends upon other popular television output. Not only is there a regular 'Snap, Cackle And Pop' item promoting forthcoming programmes (commercial programmes, anyway) there is also a lot of talk about the soaps. Even more obviously, presenter Mark Little is a young Australian whose sole claim to the job seems to be his previous experience as a member of the cast of the Australian soap Neighbours. He certainly does not exhibit any obvious talent for presentation, though co-presenter Gaby Roslin does. Indeed her charm and natural flair will surely take her pretty well anywhere else in television that she wants to go . . . which must surely be almost any other series. But what strikes you most of all is the childishness of so much of the material. Even on days when the ultra brief news bulletins do turn up every half hour or so (on this day there is some technical hitch at the cottages and most of them are dropped) the overwhelming feeling is of a programme pitched at about the level of Noddy In Toyland. The studio colours - brilliant yellow, bright red, vivid mauve, lurid orange - are straight out of Noddy, the animated cartoons appeal to Noddy's public, as do Zig and Zag, and it is surely no coincidence that the outside reporter is the former children's presenter Keith Chegwin. The commercial breaks reinforce the impression: much of the advertising is clearly intended for young children. So it seems that The Big Breakfast is aiming at an audience with a median age of about seven. But what on earth is GMTV up to? Its presenters, Eamonn Holmes and Penny Smith, look just like the sofa couples who come on later in the morning, apparently intending to appeal to women at home. To this extent GMTV is the last breakfast show still relying on the formula originally used by the BBC and TV-am when the whole thing began in spring 1983 and Frank Bough and Selina Scott sprawled on the sofa in their sweaters being ever so cosy. But who does GMTV think it is appealing to? The phone poll asking 'Do you want a referendum on the EC?' (90 per cent said yes) is obviously of widespread interest, but what about the long item on popcorn sales in American cinemas? Or the weirdly contrived report asking 'What is it that American men find so fascinating about Scottish women'? Once again there is much exploitation of soap operas, but that sits oddly with the items on cricket ball tampering and a new off-the-wall Irish magazine called 'DV8' (a name already used by a well known modern ballet troupe). Perhaps the idea is to have something for everyone, but the trouble is that it looks unlikely to satisfy anyone. The BBC on the other hand seems to have achieved, in this area at least, what it boasted it would do throughout television: it has taken the 'Himalayan option', climbing back to the commanding heights and establishing itself as the provider of high quality. Whether FT readers really want to watch television at 6.00 in the morning I do not know, but Business Breakfast between 6.00 and 7.00 am can be remarkably lively. On the day in question it offered - in addition to routine reports on the Footsie, Nikkei and so on - items on the success of the price cutters in UK food retailing, the revival of US car manufacturing, the modernisation of Scotch whisky's image (can you imagine Scotch and lemonade?) and the academic/commercial schism within the Internet computer network. A similar approach, exploiting the BBC's tremendous resources in international news, continues in Breakfast News between 7.00 and 9.05 am. True, on the day in question the overkill in covering Nelson Mandela's forthcoming inauguration was embarrassing, and the tone of religious solemnity in which it was discussed absurd. But the reports on Nagorno-Karabakh, Hizbollah, and opposition to the use of Lake Windermere by motor boats were excellent. Moreover they were - as always on this programme now - introduced by Nicholas Witchell and Sally Magnusson from behind news readers' desks, as they would be on the Nine O'Clock News or Newsnight, and not from a sofa. Watching television at breakfast time still feels depraved to me, and almost any newspaper or radio programme seems preferable at that time of day. For those who do want television with their toast, however, there is now, undeniably, a range of sharply - even wildly - contrasting programmes.</p>

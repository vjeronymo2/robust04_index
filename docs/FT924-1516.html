			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guemassa mine to double Morocco's non-ferrous metals output MOROCCO'S OUTPUT of non-ferrous metals is being doubled with the opening of the Guemassa zinc-lead-copper mine, 35 km (22 miles) due south of Marrakesh. Guemassa, Morocco's largest mine, is a joint venture between the privately-owned Omnium Nord Africain and the state-controlled Bureau de Recherches et de Participation Miniere. The mine has reserves estimated at 12m tonnes and production is forecast to run at a rate of 750,000 tonnes of ore a year, giving a 16-year mine life. It is scheduled to produce annually concentrate (an intermediate product) containing about 67,600 tonnes of zinc, 19,200 tonnes of lead and 3,000 tonnes of copper. Most of the output will be exported to Europe, particularly to Spain. The Guemassa mine ranks as one of the ten largest zinc mines in the world and the second largest in the European and Mediterranean region after the Tara mine in Ireland. ONA has invested Dirhams 850m (Pounds 70m) in the project, Dh520m from its own reserves. The annual turnover of ONA, whose activities include tourism, food processing, distribution, banking and real estate, amounted to Dh14.2bn last year, Dh600m coming from mining, which is concentrated in three areas. They include mining precious metals and copper oxide in the Anti- Atlas, polymetallic ores and precious metals in the Maroc-Central region, as well as Guemassa.</p>

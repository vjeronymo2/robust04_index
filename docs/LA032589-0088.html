			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUTHERANS JOIN IN ANCIENT BLESSING OF OILS RITE  </P> <P> Lutheran pastors renewed their vows and their bishop blessed oils in a Holy  Week service that is more traditional in Roman Catholic and Episcopal Church  dioceses.  </P> <P> Bishop J. Roger Anderson of Los Angeles, who oversees 158 Southern California  congregations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, said the rite is  infrequently conducted in Lutheran churches.  </P> <P> "It is not seen as essential, but it has become an option in an attempt to  restore some of the ancient services," said Anderson, who led a similar service  last year. This year's ceremony on Thursday was at Redeemer Lutheran Church in  Rowland Heights.  </P> <P> As in the Episcopal and Roman Catholic churches, the renewal of vows by the  clergy is voluntary. The service also incorporates a blessing of oils to be  used in the coming year for anointing the sick and in other rites.  </P> <P> Episcopal Bishop Frederick H. Borsch of Los Angeles presided over the annual  rites Tuesday before about 150 priests at St. Luke's Church in Monrovia.  </P> <P> In the Catholic ceremony Monday night at St. Vibiana Cathedral in downtown Los  Angeles, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony blessed the oil -- filling three large  silver urns -- to be used in parish baptisms and confirmations, anointing the  sick and ordaining priests.  </P> <P> During the Mass, about 300 of the archdiocese's 1,280 priests, plus deacons and  members of men's and women's religious orders, renewed their commitment to  faithfully proclaim the Gospel and serve the church.  </P> <P> As the priests and bishops processed down the center aisle, about a dozen  demonstrators carrying signs and holding candles stood outside the cathedral  protesting the Catholic Church's ban on women priests.  </P> <P> "Now is the oil of women's ordination being crushed and refined. When will it  be blessed?" one sign proclaimed.  </P> <P> "The hierarchy refuses us but God's Spirit calls us," explained Margaret  Arnold. She said the group was part of the Chicago-based National Assembly of  Religious Women.  </P> <P> During his homily, or sermon, Mahony referred to the priest shortage and  repeated one of his favorite themes:  </P> <P> "I am convinced that Jesus Christ is calling more than enough young men into  priestly service in this archdiocese, more than enough young women to go on in  religious communities. . . . Jesus tells us prayer and sacrifice and suffering  and adoration and petition will bring about all the laborers we need for the  harvest."  </P></p>

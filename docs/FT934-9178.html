			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (1): Freedom moves higher up the agenda - One of the world's most tightly controlled markets is finally facing the prospect of deregulation. John Burton finds a growing awareness that the system's restrictions are hampering the nation's economic growth INITIAL scepticism about President Kim Young-sam's commitment to financial liberalisation has been replaced by growing optimism that the new South Korean leader is serious about deregulating one of Asia's most protected capital markets. Liberalisation hopes were given a boost in mid-August when Mr Kim announced a ban on the tax dodge of using false names in financial transactions, which will increase transparency in the banking industry and money markets. But perhaps the most significant result of the ban on anonymous accounts will be that it may accelerate implementation of the government's five-year (1993-1997) financial reform plan, which was announced at the beginning of July. Requiring the use of real names in financial dealings has increased pressure on the government to introduce other changes to counter the threat of untaxed money flowing out of banks and into the large underground economy - estimated to be equal to 20 per cent of gross national product - over the next several years. Deregulation of all interest rates - a crucial component of the reform package - is considered instrumental in preventing a liquidity drain because it would give banks the freedom to offer higher deposit rates and by doing so improve their ability to attract funds. The government has freed most lending rates earlier this month and it has been suggested that deposit rates will be deregulated completely ahead of the current 1996 deadline. The financial stability of the banks will also be improved as the government gradually reduces its interference in the allocation of credit. The state's past policy of forcing banks to give low-interest loans to strategic industries has burdened them with a large share of non-performing assets. Meanwhile, barriers to the free flow of capital into and out of the country are also set to be dismantled. Foreigners will gain wider access to the stock and bond markets. Restrictions are being eased on Korean corporate borrowing abroad. The exchange rate system will be liberalised. These changes are taking place as Korean officials acknowledge that the current financial system has outlived its usefulness. The present financial structure was shaped by the critical role it played in the country's centralised economy during the past three decades. The state, for example, used the banking system to funnel scarce capital to the heavy industries that led Korea's export drive. Interest rates were kept under control to ensure that strategic companies were provided with cheap funds. But the past few years have provided a wealth of evidence that the state-controlled financial system is now hindering industrial performance and hampering economic development. Credit allocation has become increasingly inefficient and this has created distortions in the industrial structure. Money has been poured into favoured industries that are no longer competitive. The government's credit policy also promoted the economic dominance of the nation's large conglomerates, or chaebol, while hindering the growth of small and medium-sized businesses. The widely-diversified chaebol have grown too unwieldly and need to concentrate on a few core industries. The lack of funds for the small business sector has meant that the country's subcontracting network remains underdeveloped, while entrepreneurial ventures have been stifled. COMPANIES that are competing for funds on the open financial markets must pay high interest rates. Deregulation would eliminate the two-tier financial system of cheap state-directed industrial loans and expensive open-market funds, thereby creating a more rational distribution of credit governed by market forces. A deregulated financial market and the increased inflow of foreign investment would eventually lower the nation's high capital cost structure and improve corporate balance sheets, which are highly-leveraged. This would allow companies to spend more money on such long-term goals as research and development instead of devoting considerable financial resources to servicing their debts. Increased R&amp;D spending is vital since Korea lacks strength in advanced manufacturing industries that offer export potential. While economic arguments alone provide a compelling reason for Korea to adopt financial liberalisation, it is also facing foreign pressure to relax restrictions. The conclusion of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations would push the move toward free trade in financial services. Korea must also internationalise its financial market if it wants to achieve its goal of joining the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development by 1996. The US has been a persistent critic of Korea's closed financial market. Washington claims that the financial restrictions not only hamper the operation of foreign banks in Korea, but also represent a barrier to foreign investment in the country. Foreign companies, for example, have difficulties in raising sufficient funds to expand activities. That argument has proved persuasive since Korean officials are worried about declining foreign investments and a growing number of disinvestments. Although momentum appears to be increasing in favour of financial liberalisation, some foreign financial representatives in Seoul remain cautious about the scope and timing of the deregulation measures. 'It all looks fine on paper, but we still have yet to see most of the steps being taken,' said the head of a western brokerage firm. Indeed, some of the most important liberalisation measures are not scheduled to be introduced until 1996. This has raised concerns that the Korean government may revert to its past record of announcing reforms and then delaying them. The current five-year liberalisation plan, for example, is only the latest of several similar programmes that have been offered over the past few years, but which have failed to be implemented. Ministry of finance officials argue that this time things will be different. They point out that the government is showing greater commitment to liberalisation by offering a precise timetable for the reforms. Their introduction will also no longer be dependent on the achievement of macro-economic preconditions, a feature of previous plans that critics charged would delay the reform process. Moreover, a few reforms, such as the easing of controls on foreign exchange transactions have been introduced ahead of schedule. But the most significant factor that could guarantee successful implementation of the plan this time is Mr Kim's anti-corruption campaign, which is weakening bureaucratic resistance to change. The bureaucracy opposed liberalisation because state control of the economy provided officials with the opportunity to accept bribes in return for granting favours to business. However, the ban on anonymous accounts, which were used to hide pay-offs, has deprived officials of the possibility to keep their ill-gotten money out of sight. The result is that bureaucrats may have less incentive to maintain financial controls. Moreover, Mr Kim has installed a new generation of reform-minded technocrats who argued that financial liberalisation is necessary to achieve 'economic democracy' in what the president has proclaimed as the 'New Korea'.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Salvage task for metal man: Japan's depressed electronics groups are seeking high-tech saviours A few years ago, it was not unusual to spot in Tokyo's rubbish dumps perfectly functioning TV sets or audio equipment, abandoned by their owners to make room for the latest model. Today, Japan's hard-pressed consumers are loath to throw away anything, let alone buy another electronic gizmo for their small apartments. Yet the worst recession in 20 years is only one of a daunting list of problems facing the country's once world-beating consumer electronics groups. Most of their main foreign markets are shrinking, at a time when the yen's rise has hit their price competitiveness. The domestic market, once a willing test-bed for new products, is saturated. In addition, the consumer electronics giants are short of the imaginative new gadgets they badly need to ensure future growth. The impact of such pressures and shortcomings on consumer electronic sales has been considerable. The Japanese market's total turnover has plunged by 23 per cent from a peak of Y2,150bn in 1988 to Y1,657bn last year. Last month the mighty Matsushita warned that pre-tax profits for the year would be 35 per cent less than earlier forecast. Today, the company, along with Sharp, is likely to report lower profits for the past six months; Toshiba and Hitachi should be in a similar position on Thursday. While the problem of product saturation was countered by the rapid rise in consumer spending of the late 1980s, recession has served to reveal the glutted home market. According to the Electronics Industry Association of Japan, 99 per cent of households have at least one colour TV; more than 75 per cent own a video-cassette recorder; and 54 per cent a compact disc player. 'The era of continuing expansion is over,' mourns Mr Nobuyuki Idei, a director of Sony. When asset prices, particularly land, collapsed soon after the turn of the decade, the knock-on effect was to make consumers more price conscious. Consumer electronics companies were jolted by the realisation that they had lost touch with what their customers wanted. Nothing illustrates the giants' sleepiness more clearly than their failure to spot the emergence of the video games market, where smaller, more entrepreneurial companies, such as Nintendo and Sega, have achieved dominance. 'Before we realised what was happening,' admits Sony's Mr Idei, 'the market was dominated by Nintendo and it was very difficult to get in.' Such strategic blindness has proved costly. The Japanese video games market saw sales rise 13.5 per cent last year, while VCR sales fell 12 per cent, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Having missed out on the surge in video games, the pressure on consumer electronics groups to find growth areas is intense. Many observers agree that they need to look beyond traditional boundaries. 'We cannot rely on consumer electronics alone,' says Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice-president of Matsushita. For some, the answer has been to diversify into the entertainment industry. Sony, Matsushita, JVC, the maker of audio and visual equipment, and Toshiba, the broad-based electronics company, have all bought stakes in US entertainment companies. Matsushita has invested in 3DO, a US start-up company developing a three-dimensional games machine, while JVC has launched a machine with Sega. Another move has been to use digital technology, the basis for modern computing and telecommunications, to open the door to a range of possible new products. Compact discs are one example. Here, the boundaries are being expanded as discs begin to carry video as well as audio entertainment. The marriage of computer technology and telecommunications could form the foundation for the growth business the consumer electronics industry is seeking. The electronics industry association of Japan estimates that the global market for such 'multimedia' products could eventually be worth Y325,000bn a year. 'Multimedia will enter the home so consumer electronics companies must participate in the market,' says Mr Murase. But the way forward for digital technology has not yet been mapped out. Exactly how companies will penetrate the home and workplace is a question Mr Murase and his competitors are struggling to answer. 'The future of multimedia is not yet clear,' he says. The Japanese industry is still debating whether multimedia will take off as a sophisticated video games machine, a communications tool for business people, or a high-tech TV set that lets viewers communicate with each other. One snag is that multimedia requires consumer electronics makers to venture into areas where they have little experience. Japan's competitors, particularly computer makers in the US, have greater expertise in digital technology and many have already introduced multimedia computers which can display videos, play music and send faxes. Companies in the US are also ahead of Japanese companies in developing multimedia software. Microsoft, the computer software company, recently launched a line of home business and entertainment programmes under the Microsoft Home brand, which will target the home computer user. The Japanese have been forced to catch up by linking with US groups. Sony and Matsushita have bought stakes in General Magic, an Apple subsidiary developing communications software, and Matsushita has invested in EO, another embryonic US company which is developing personal digital communicators. 'As telecommunications and computers combine, the relationship with the US becomes increasingly important,' says Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita. It is clear that Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers will have to rely on the expertise of video games makers, computer companies and software developers in creating the vital partnerships that could herald future growth for the industry. Even with the help of such partners, Matsushita and its rivals will need skills far beyond their traditional business of making electronic boxes. The test of whether Japanese consumer electronics companies continue to lead the world market into the next century is how they live up to this new and unfamiliar role.</p>

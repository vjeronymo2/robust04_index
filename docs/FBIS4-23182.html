			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 27 SAPA -- When Mr Justice Johann  Kriegler went on the air to announce the final result of South  African's first fully democratic election, he did not yet have  the final data in his hand, he revealed on Friday [27 May].    Addressing a Cape Town press club lunch, Judge Kriegler,  head  of the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] which ran last  month's election, said because the provincial legislatures had  to be constituted the next day, and inauguration day had been  set for the next Tuesday, "we simply had to go public on the  available data at that stage".    He believed that in future South Africa should have a  permanent, parastatal, non-political electoral body to run  future elections. The country could "simply not afford" to have  10 different (one national and nine provincial) administrations  running a poll. "We will need suckers like Kriegler to be the  watchdogs of the public," he added.    Asked whether he would do it again, he gave a tentative  "yes"  but added immediately "but I'm not volunteering for any job!"  The experience he and his commissioners had picked up should  not be wasted.    Answering another question, he revealed that the Inkatha  Freedom Party [IFP], the Freedom Front and the National Party  had been the three parties to temporarily benefit from a three  percent mark-up following the IEC's computer programme failure.    A basic problem encountered by the IEC in the whole  electoral  process had been that "we were supplying an over-sophisticated  system to a society that couldn't handle it". "We had a Rolls  Royce system for a dirt track."    No deal or agreement struck between parties to expedite a  result had been brought into the IEC's calculation.    Lessons learnt from the election included that never again  should a poll be run without a voters' roll, and there should be  a permanent professional staff, timeous preparation and no  last-minute changes such as the entry of the IFP six days before  election day.    It was still true, however, that the election had worked. He  said he was satisfied there had been no significant evidence of  any material irregularities in the KwaZulu-Natal area which had  affected the result.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (13): Clear approach - Finance / Peter Montagnon looks at a book giving useful advice Finance for the General Manager by Roger Mills and Janine Stiles McGraw-Hill Book Company Pounds 23.95, 256 pages One of the more daunting challenges facing managers moving from middle to senior executive positions is that of getting to grips with finance. While most will have had some financial experience as they climb the corporate ladder, few will be familiar with the broader role of finance in making and evaluating strategic decisions. This book, written by two members of the teaching staff at the Henley Management College, is designed to help. It will not take anyone looking for a top-flight MBA very far, but its by-and-large lucid and matter-of-fact approach will be of practical help to the executive who suddenly finds he or she is moving in a world where understanding of financial issues is required. Many such people fear they are entering a world obscured by jargon. The authors are well aware of this when they quote an apocryphal story of three men who apply for a job as an accountant. They were each asked to calculate two times two. The first two answered correctly. The third replied: 'What figure did you have in mind, sir?' He, of course, got the job. Again, this book will not enable the new general manager to face down the creative accountant but a reasonably numerate reader does not need prior understanding of finance to find it rewarding. Moreover, the authors cover the waterfront from the relationship between profit, cash flow and the balance sheet, to the evaluation of company accounts and control of working capital and capital spending. Throughout, there is emphasis on the need to ensure good quality data. Another theme is the importance of cash flow. The authors show how an otherwise positive business plan can be a recipe for disaster if the timing of cash flow is not taken into account. 'Understanding how to manage cash is vital,' the authors argue. 'While general management typically demands the ability to manage profitability, to do so without paying close attention to cash will produce limited results.' One drawback is that this is neither a detailed theoretical textbook nor, perhaps, sufficiently practical for the manager with his sleeves rolled-up. Thus, for example, the authors refer to the possible use of options in hedging foreign exchange risk. They explain clearly how options work and how the result differs from using the forward currency market, but they do not discuss how to value options. Judging whether he or she is getting a good deal is, presumably, is a skill that general managers have to learn elsewhere. Similarly, the book gives explanations - with reference to Hanson, perhaps one of the more complicated examples - of how to examine and assess balance sheets. Various ratios are discussed, but as is so often the case, the reader is left in doubt as to how to evaluate the ratios that emerge. This is a perennial problem as there can be no hard and fast rules, but more examples would help. Given the recent history of the stock market, one must treat with a pinch of salt the general statement that it is worthwhile being cautious of companies with a price/earnings ratio of more than 20 times. But at least the authors do point to sectoral differences and make it clear that the notes to the accounts must be scrutinised to make sure that like is being compared with like. The conscientious reader will want to delve further once this book has been digested. If that simply means yet more work for the aspiring chief executive, there is a small consolation as well. In their discussion on evaluating capital projects the authors note how the paperwork thins out as the decision-making moves closer to the board. They quote the case of a company where more than 150 documents with 1,750 pages were identified with a particular project. By the time the project was up for consideration by the finance department, these had been reduced to a 20-page document with 30 pages of appendices. The main board did not even have to read that. Directors received a three-page summary.</p>

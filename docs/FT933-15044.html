			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: So little time . . . THE DEADLINE to apply for shares in the third tranche of British Telecom (BT3) draws ever closer. There are separate deadlines for the public offer (July 14) and the retail tender (July 16). To add to the confusion, different share shops have imposed their own deadlines. The Bank of Scotland (for example) needs to receive applications by 3.30 pm on July 12 at its branches, or by 10 am on July 13 by post. The deadlines for the big four banks are: Barclays (branches - 3 pm July 12; post - 10 am July 12); Lloyds (branches - 3.30 July 12; post  - 5 pm July 13); Midland (branches - 3.30 July 12; post - 10 am July 13); NatWest (4.30 pm July 12). Those who want large amounts of shares stand their best chance in the retail tender. The following brokers will accept new clients for the tender: Arnold Stansby (061-832 8554); Branston &amp; Gothard (071-250 1180); Cave &amp; Sons (0604-21 421); Chambers &amp; Remington (021-236 2577).

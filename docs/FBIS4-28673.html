			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement today said the DPRK Foreign  Ministry has been authorized to declare a countermeasure on the  unreasonable "sanctions" taken by the IAEA against the DPRK and,  moreover, on its insolent attempt to intrude even into military  sites of the DPRK.    The statement says:    Firstly, we will immediately withdraw from the IAEA.    We will consider invalid all the unreasonable "resolutions"  adopted by the agency with regard to our issue up until now and  will not be bound to any rules or resolutions of the agency  hereafter.    Secondly, we declare that the inspections for the continuity  of safeguards which we have accepted in our unique status will  no longer be allowed.    Any unreasonable inspection can never be allowed till it has  been decided whether we return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty or completely withdraw from it.    Hence, the agency's inspectors now will have nothing to do  any further in our country.    Thirdly, we strongly reaffirm our position that UN  "sanctions" will be regarded immediately as a declaration of war.    "Sanctions" and dialogue are incompatible.    It is our inevitable option to counter expanded "sanctions"  by hostile forces with expanded self-defence measures.    This stand of ours will never change until our nuclear issue  has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiation.    We will keenly watch the development of the situation in the  days ahead.</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / UN backs forces for Georgia The UN Security Council has given its blessing to a controversial Russian peacekeeping force in Georgia on condition that UN military officers monitor the operation. This is aimed at enforcing a truce between the former Soviet republic and its dissident province of Abkhazia. The US, Britain and France joined Russia in sponsoring the UN resolution welcoming the intervention by 3,000 Russian troops. Its adoption was facilitated by a change of heart by Mr Edouard Shevardnadze, who now has asked for Moscow's help. Troops from other former Soviet republics may join the Russian operation.</p>

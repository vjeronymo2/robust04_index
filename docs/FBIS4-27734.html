The charge was  made by Colonel Prasit Mongkhontham, deputy chief of staff of  the Third Region of the Thai Army and member of the Thai-Lao  general border peacekeeping cooperation committee, in his  interview carried by the 16,298th Saturday issue of the DAILY  NEWS newspaper on 28 May 1994, the THAILAND TIMES newspaper on  27 May 1994, and many other Thai newspapers. The colonel  charged that in the past two months, the Lao People's Army  sprayed toxic chemicals in water sources and (?lakes) in areas  along the Thai-Lao border opposite Chiang Kham District in  Phayao Province, Mae Rim District in Nan Province, and (Bansok)  Village in Uttaradit Province, killing a large number of animals  and Lao inhabitants.

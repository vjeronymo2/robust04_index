			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 0715 GMT on 21 May, in a "How Shall We Live?"  program, carries a 45-minute live studio discussion of current  developments in the Crimea. The Russian guests include Ramazan  Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council; Marshal  Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov; Emil Pain, member of the presidential  council; and academician Valeriy Shchegortsov. Crimean guests  include President Yuriy Meshkov and Vice President Yevgeniy  Saburov through a link-up studio in Simferopol.    Yuriy Meshkov begins by saying:    "The name of this television program is How Shall We Live?  My reply is that we shall live normally. Those who have packed  their suitcases and are planning to go on holiday to the Crimea  don't need to unpack. What is happening and what is behind it?  Typical political games. In this particular case they have  been generated by a forthcoming event in Ukraine -- the  Ukrainian presidential elections. And all the games are around  this event. It is important not to go too far with these games.    "As for the Crimea, all is quiet here. We have no reason to  be alarmed. But, naturally, this does not mean that one can  forget about us, give us up, and not help us to resolve  problems, which Russia's involvement would obviously help in  tackling."    Ramazan Abdulatipov says:    "Most of the Crimean problems are political. They must be  resolved by politicians. Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov was  absolutely right when he said politicians, instead of resolving  the problems...[pauses]. I have dozens of agreements signed by  the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. In fact, these agreements  are not being implemented by either side. To a larger degree,  they are not being implemented by -- I don't want to attack the  Ukrainian side now -- they are not being implemented by the  Ukrainian side, in fact.    "I agree the present problem has been whipped up by the  current political struggle in Ukraine. Because Ukrainian  politicians were frightened by the fact that socialists and  communists were coming back to take part in the parliamentary  elections. And under the circumstances a new spur of  nationalism is needed -- I would put it that way -- and to stir  up nationalism, especially in western areas, the Crimean factor  is being used, instead of resolving the matter in the interests  of the Black Sea Fleet sailors, in the interests of Russia and  Ukraine.    ``Moreover, and I would like to stress it again, it is  impossible to find a single person in Russia who would admit  that the Crimea is part of Ukraine. But this does not mean in  any way the problem should be resolved by strong-arm methods  destroying the integrity of the existing Ukrainian state. I  would like to stress again that people and, above all, the  military, become hostages of politicians. These people should be  released.''    Emil Pain adds:    "I have been studying conflicts for a long time. It happens  practically every time that there cannot be one side in a  conflict. If there is a conflict brewing, both sides are adding  gunpowder to it. Therefore the rule that says look at yourself  first and ask yourself whether you are doing everything right  should be addressed to the Crimean leaders and the Crimean  parliament."    Meshkov says:    "What circumstance cannot be changed by anyone? The  circumstance that geographically the Crimea is connected with  Ukraine and Russia. Nobody can change the geographical position  and, as far as I know, nobody is going to encroach upon it.    ``But there is another circumstance that does not depend on  politicians and that cannot be changed by anyone. The  circumstance that before 1954 [when the Crimea became part of  Ukraine following a decree by Nikita Khrushchev] and after 1954,  the people of the Crimea were and remain part of the Russian  people. It is another matter that administrative redivisions  inside the Soviet Union have introduced new circumstances, and  it would be wise to take these circumstances into account.    ``From the start, from the moment the Crimean president was  elected, our moves, I mean, the moves of the government, and  they were fully approved by the Crimean people, were aimed at  achieving economic prosperity. And with this aim, economic  reforms have been and are being implemented, economic relations  are being established, and treaties are being signed with the  subjects of the Russian Federation.''    He adds:    "In the same way we can and must resolve the mutual problems  arising in our relations with the Kiev administration. There is  no other way. And we don't want any other way. Our only desire  is to solve all problems causing tension in our relations.  There is a way and a method of resolving problems by treaty.  And it has been tried and approved by Russia already. It is a  solution to the problem, and it has already been confirmed that  it is possible. It is necessary and it produces positive  results.    ``We put forward the same proposal to the administration in  Kiev. In return, you have already heard what has been taking  place and what is artificially being whipped up to implement  narrow individual political aims.    ``I don't share the optimism of my colleagues in the Russian  studio that the Ukrainian president will keep his word. You  know, we have had so many opportunities to see the exact  opposite. Evidently the efforts of public opinion should be  mobilized to alleviate the task of the Ukrainian president in  keeping his word.''    Yevgeniy Saburov says:    "First of all, misunderstanding around the Constitution  should be explained. Some disinformation is being spread that  this is an act of secession, so to speak. This is absolutely  wrong. The constitution states plainly that the Crimea is part  of Ukraine. In fact, only one clause is at issue -- the treaty  question. We have been exhausted by the fact that we cannot  understand what we can and cannot do."    Back in Moscow, the announcer reads out messages from  viewers  who express concern over the future of the Black Sea Fleet.  Marshal Shaposhnikov says:    "All these processes began at the end of 1991 and are still  going on now. In practice they have not been resolved because  of political ambitions. What can I propose? The navy of the  former USSR consisted of four constituent parts: the Pacific,  Northern, Baltic, and Black Sea. As regards the first three,  there are no problems. They belong to Russia and nobody else is  laying claim to their constituent parts.    ``As for the Black Sea Fleet, there are three sides at  present which, in my opinion, are legally aspiring to some part  of it -- Russia, Ukraine, and Georgia. As one knows, there are  11 states in the CIS. Most of them signed the CIS collective  security treaty. Ukraine did not sign the treaty. Consequently,  one-eleventh of the Black Sea fleet should be given to Ukraine.  As for the remaining parts of the fleet, ten-elevenths of it  should be subordinated to the CIS combined armed forces, which  would ensure collective security in the Mediterranean region  where, as one knows, there is an American presence with nuclear  missiles. This part, the main part of the Black Sea fleet,  could watch moves by our partner -- we hope it will be our ally  one day but at present peace is fragile, as one knows -- in the  interests of the whole of the Commonwealth and not one  individual side. With financial quotas and so on. If it is  difficult for some CIS states, even members of the CIS security  system, to support their one-eleventh of the fleet, they can  delegate their part to a third party; for example, in exchange  for oil, gas, coal, metal, grain, for anything in fact."    Abdulatipov says:    "It is a very serious problem. More than 50,000 Ukrainian  troops are concentrated in the Crimea at present. Literally a  few days ago special purpose troops were redeployed there. The  Berkut, Sokol, and other groups have been redeployed there. I  received this information from Sevastopol this morning. The  situation is that any provocation might lead to a wide-scale  conflict. Therefore, it would be a good thing for our  politicians to start negotiating and implementing the agreements  that have already been signed."    Emil Pain adds:    "I am ready to admit and I think one should admit that the  Russian media are biased in their coverage of the problem. For  example, our TV link today is between Russia and the Crimea.  Yet we are talking of Ukraine all the time. It would be  perfectly reasonable if Ukraine were taking part in the program.    ``I don't think we should go into details about the origin  of  the word Ukraine. It is an independent state at present  recognized by the UN. The Crimean constitution says the Crimea  remains part of the Ukrainian state. I think certain complaints  should be made to the Crimean leadership. And if we are talking  here about how to help the Ukrainian president to keep his  promise not to use force, to a large degree this depends on the  actions of the Crimean leadership. You are talking of  negotiations, but unilateral actions are a very bad condition  for any negotiations. I am not talking here of the content of  the constitution adopted by the Crimean parliament, but it is an  absolute fact that the parliament adopted it unilaterally."    In return, Meshkov says:    "I would like to remind you that the most acute issue, the  problem of the Black Sea Fleet, was excluded from the competence  and involvement of the Crimea by a decision of the Kiev  administration. Ukrainian Defense Minister Radetskyy, he was  perhaps the first official in the Kiev administration who  isolated the Crimea from Ukraine when he categorically refused  to allow the Crimean Republic, representatives of the Crimean  president, to participate or at least to be present silently at  the talks on the Black Sea Fleet. This situation is unthinkable  for any sensible person, and it is quite difficult to understand  it from the political point of view, since the problem is being  resolved on Crimean territory. This problem concerns the  citizens of Crimea and directly touches upon our interests. And  not to take them into account is physically impossible, but it  seems it is possible politically."    He adds:    "Our intention is to reach an agreement, to resolve all  points at issue, not to walk away from them but to resolve them  on mutually beneficial and mutually acceptable conditions. And  a treaty would make it possible to define the range of problems  and solve them. And I would like it very much if first of all  there could be a treaty between the Crimea and Ukraine to  stabilize the situation and define and create preconditions for  a treaty between Ukraine and Russia, which is inevitable and  necessary, I think. But only that way round -- no other way at  all -- since otherwise we should be prevented from resolving the  points at issue.    ``I don't think our non-participation will have a beneficial  effect on the results of the talks. We realize our  responsibility to the people of Ukraine and to the people of  Russia since we are part of it. We are aware of possible  consequences of preserving and implementing a tripartite  agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. But  we would also like, and, I think, we are entitled to expect,  that our wishes to reach an agreement will be supported and  guaranteed by all the parties.''    Yevgeniy Saburov says:    "The Crimea can make no claims whatsoever on Ukraine and the  Ukrainian people. We Russians and Ukrainians are fraternal  peoples. We have a lot of Ukrainians here. We do not really  make any distinction by nationality. What is under discussion  here is a particular Kiev administration that has appeared at a  particular time and seems to be a temporary one, rather than  confrontation between the Crimea and Ukraine, which is being  whipped up artificially."</p>

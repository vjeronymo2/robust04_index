			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (6): Unpalatable gossip on the drugs trade - Finance UNDUE INFLUENCE by David Margolick William Morrow Dollars 23 FOR Dollars 23 - the cost of David Margolick's Undue Influence - you could buy about six months' subscription to the tackiest tabloid of your choice. It is a toss-up which 'read' would prove more edifying. For, at heart, Mr Margolick's weighty tome on the battle over the Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceuticals fortune is a tawdry tale padded out by a lot of legal manouevres. The plot could be summarised in four simple clauses. Rich, ageing womaniser marries pretty Polish maid; rich, ageing womaniser dies; family disputes maid's right to inherit; lawyers get involved and everyone settles. This unappetising scenario actually unfolded in the early and mid-1980s, and was only ever engrossing because of the personalities involved. Even today, they command attention. For example, Basia, the one-time maid who became the second Mrs Johnson, used Dollars 100m of her Dollars 350m inheritance to buy the Gdansk shipyard - not quite the typical action of an airhead blonde. But Mr Margolick's excuse for rehashing the story is to examine the legal minutiae and the impact which the case had on some prestigious New York law firms. Accordingly, he splits the book into two distinct parts. The first is a relatively objective account of how Basia met Seward Johnson, how their 12-year marriage progressed, and some background on the murky antics of the Johnson offspring. The second centres on the US law firms involved in the tussle over Seward's will, and then on the trial itself. The reader's response may follow similar lines. Part one has moderate entertainment value. But when the same facts are batted to and fro at inordinate length by a lot of overpaid legal professionals, tedium sets in. Students of US trial practice may glean something; the rest of the world can probably pass. Matters are not improved by Mr Margolick's conviction that the more trivia a reader is offered, the more fascinated he or she will become. Attempting to flesh out the character of one lawyer involved, for example, he gives the details of a totally unremarkable commute home, remembering to explain what model of car took the individual from his station to his house, which supermarket he shopped at, what he bought for supper, and so on. Even then, the poor man does not escape. ' . . . The inside of his refrigerator was austere, a bare light bulb shining on the bottles of imported beer and splits of champagne he served to guests and the Perrier he kept for himself.' For heaven's sake, has anyone seen a refrigerator light that wasn't bare? Only once does this painstaking approach pay off - and that, ironically, is during the three chapters which deal with Seward Johnson's death. Here, Mr Margolick's hour-by-hour account of how an extraordinarily egocentric but vital individual surrenders his grip on life, becomes both powerful and poignant. It only serves to demonstrate how little the lawyers matter.</p>

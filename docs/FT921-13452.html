			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BT to sell alarms offshoot BRITISH Telecommunications plans to sell Telecom Security, its alarm systems offshoot, as part of a programme of getting back to its basic business of running telephone networks. The company has been in discussions with several possible buyers for its 90 per cent stake during the past few weeks. There is speculation that BT has been talking to other leading suppliers of alarm systems, such as Chubb and Group 4 Security as well as Mr Pedar Kolind, the Norwegian businessman who established Telecom Security and still owns 10 per cent. The business, which has 40,000 residential and business customers, is estimated to be worth about Pounds 20m. BT expects to complete a sale within three to six months.</p>

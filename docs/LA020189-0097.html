			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DWP RECEIVES BAD NEWS FROM SNOW READING  </P> <P> The two water surveyors pushed the hollow aluminum tube vertically into the  snow, pulled it out and read the bad news for Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "That's not much," said Terry Beitler of the city's Department of Water and  Power as he looked at the tube filled with snow.  </P> <P> Beitler and his partner, Chuck Maurer, were measuring the snowpack on the  eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, which provides Los Angeles with much of its  water.  </P> <P> Their findings confirmed that the pack was smaller than it has been since the  drought of 1976 and 1977. And there was more bad news.  </P> <P> Inside their hollow pole they also found the wrong kind of snow. It was powdery  snow with much less water than the wet, heavy snow -- called Sierra Cement --  that usually hits the mountain range.  </P> <P> Beitler and Maurer were participating in the first of the three major snow  surveys that will be made in the Sierra Nevada before the spring thaw. Other  crews began similar measurements Tuesday throughout the mountain range.  </P> <P> All confirmed what every skier knows: Not much snow yet this winter. A dry  January in the Sierra has raised fears California may suffer a third year of  drought.  </P> <P> Tuesday's DWP survey, 10,000 feet up Mammoth Mountain, showed that the snowpack  on the eastern side of the Sierra was only 70% of normal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Water for Aqueduct  </P> <P> From these mountains flows the water for the aqueduct from nearby Owens Valley  to Los Angeles. This is Los Angeles' cheapest, most plentiful and purest water  supply.  </P> <P> The rest of the city water comes from wells in the San Fernando Valley, some of  which are polluted, and from the Colorado River and Northern California sources  of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.  </P> <P> While Los Angeles' rainfall has been about 85% of normal so far this winter,  making the drought seem remote, around Mammoth Lakes 285 miles northeast of the  city precipitation has been 37% of normal, a DWP official said.  </P> <P> "We have seen a lot of rain in Los Angeles, but it has no correlation with how  much water we have because we get our water here," said Randy Neudeck, a DWP  engineer.  </P> <P> Without a sharp increase in snowfall, officials said, DWP reservoirs will be  below capacity at winter's end. At present, they said, DWP reservoirs are at  70% of capacity; Northern California reservoirs at 65% and Colorado River  reservoirs at 100%.  </P> <P> Complicating the situation is the powdery nature of the eastern Sierra snowpack  caused by atmospheric conditions, according to Duane Buchholz, assistant  aqueduct engineer.  </P> <P> That was evident when Beitler and Maurer pulled out the tube after pushing it  more than 40 inches into the snow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Snow Course'  </P> <P> They did their work on a snow course, a flat area where snow has been measured  the past 52 years to provide an accurate record of snow patterns.  </P> <P> Underneath the snow was a snow pillow, a large rubber sack filled with  antifreeze.  </P> <P> As the snow presses down on the pillow and the antifreeze, instruments are  activated, telling the depth and weight of the snow. These pillows are placed  throughout the Sierra, some capable of sending their information to satellites  and then to laboratories.  </P> <P> But every pillow must be checked by surveyors. Some must snow-shoe or ski to  remote survey points.  </P> <P> After weighing the snow-filled tube, Beitler said it contained enough water to  reach a level of seven inches in the tube if it were melted.  </P> <P> In past years with the snow heavier and wetter, a similar amount of snow would  have contained about three times as much water.  </P> <P> Buchholz said this means that the runoff from the eastern Sierra into the  creeks and the natural underground reservoirs of the Owens Valley will be below  normal again this year unless February and March are especially stormy months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nothing Normal for Sierra'  </P> <P> Nobody up here is ruling that out. After swapping stories with other DWP  workers on the Sierra's eastern slope, Beitler said, "The longer I live up  here, I realize there is nothing normal for the Sierra."  </P> <P> However, the Department of Water and Power, like other water agencies around  the state, are preparing for a third year of drought.  </P> <P> They intend to continue to sell the city's conservation program, which  generally is voluntary.  </P> <P> And they intend to launch a three-year program of cloud-seeding along the  eastern Sierra.  </P> <P> DWP officials said tests and cloud-seeding operations in 24 countries over the  past 30 years have shown that precipitation can be increased from 5% to 20%.  </P> <P> It costs $100,000 for a year of cloud seeding in this area, they said.  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Monarch Resources plans to raise Dollars 30m Fed up with London investors' lack of interest in smaller mining companies and the fall in research coverage of the sector, Monarch Resources is to raise Dollars 30m (Pounds 20.5m), principally from Canadian investors, so that it can apply to be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Monarch's shares reacted favourably to this news yesterday and rose from 251p to 262p. The company, which has gold mining and exploration operations in Venezuela, intends to keep its London Stock Exchange quotation 'for the foreseeable future'. Present shareholders, of which about 70 per cent of the 550 holders are based in the UK, will be able to take part in the cash-raising exercise via an open offer for up to Pounds 7m. Monarch also reported substantially reduced losses before tax, down from Dollars 4.72m to Dollars 2.81m for the year to the end of December. There was an attributable loss of Dollars 2.8m for losses of 10 cents a share, compared with Dollars 4.72m or 32 cents. Turnover was Dollars 7.37m, against Dollars 6.97m. Mr Michael Beckett, chairman, said he wanted Monarch listed on the Toronto exchange partly because price-earnings multiples for smaller gold mining companies were on average twice those in London, but also because London was becoming more restrictive. 'Companies like ours need more flexibility,' he said. Monarch's biggest shareholder, Mr August von Finck, a German businessman, will take up the shareholder offer and suffer a 'modest' dilution from his present 22.9 per cent. Most of the new funds raised will be used to finance Monarch's exploration programmes this year and in 1995. These will be stepped up substantially, mainly at the Venezuelan concessions but also in other parts of central and south America. Mr Beckett said the Revemin processing plant was now generating cash - there was a net Dollars 190,000 gain last year compared with a net cash loss of Dollars 1.08m - and the La Comorra mine was scheduled to start operating in June. The offer to North American investors will be at or near the prevailing price after a preliminary prospectus is issued on about May 10. ScotiaMcLeod is leading a syndicate of underwriters to the offer.</p>

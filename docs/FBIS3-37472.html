They agreed that a corresponding agreement  may be signed already next week.    The power plant, which was shut down after a major  earthquake  shook Armenia late in 1988, may resume operations already this  year if Russia supplies the necessary equipment and personnel.  Armenia pledged to bear all expenses and Soskovets advised that  Armenian diaspora abroad could render financial assistance as  well.    It is expected that the Russian personnel at the plant will  number 560 experts and the plant will produce 800 megawatts of  electricity. The restart of the Armenian nuclear power plant is  opposed by Germany and Turkey, according to Bagratyan.</p>

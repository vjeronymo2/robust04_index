			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Business and the Environment: Rough time for birdies - Are golf courses an ecological hazard and a waste of scarce resources Golf courses should be built like billiard tables, with buffers around the fairways to prevent balls and spiked shoes from damaging the environment. This rather extreme suggestion was made by a Dutch ecologist who evidently knows more about the countryside than the role of the rough in golf. But the growing number of courses around the world has caused alarm among many environmentalists, conservationists and local communities. Critics have a long list of complaints. Highly manicured courses ruin the look of the countryside. Chemicals used to keep the grass perfect cause pollution and damage wildlife. And the water needed to fill the traps and keep the grass green constitutes an inappropriate use of a scarce resource. 'Most courses use the spray irrigation system, which is an inefficient way of watering because most of it evaporates,' says Liana Stupples of Friends of the Earth. But FoE is not flatly opposed to golf courses. It acknowledges that some provide an ideal habitat for wildlife and indigenous plants. This is especially true when courses are built on land that was previously used for intensive crop farming. Nevertheless, there is often strong opposition to new golf courses and criticism of green-keeping standards. In the US the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides has highlighted the case of a 30-year-old naval officer who died as a result of an allergic reaction to fungicide on a golf course. The Tokyo-based Global Network for Anti-Golf Course Action accuses Japanese leisure companies  - which lack suitable land at home and are expanding overseas  - of exporting environmental destruction. The network's main complaint is about the over-use of chemicals. In Hawaii, a favourite destination of Japanese holidaymakers, chemical run-off from courses has been blamed for killing coral. And a local action group is aggrieved that the Japanese are planning to build fairways on the burial ground of the Hawaiian royal family. In the UK, applications to build courses  - from large companies, such as Legal &amp; General, to local farmers  - have also spawned protests. A report published last year by Greene, Belfield-Smith, the leisure industries arm of Touche Ross Management Consultants, predicted that the pace of development of European golf schemes will soon overtake that of the US. Europe would become the world's fastest growing golf market. The UK already has more than half of the Europe's 3,687 courses. The Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews  - the spiritual home of golf - warned in the late 1980s of an acute shortage of courses. It said about 700 were needed to satisfy rising demand in the 1990s. This was good news for farmers who were under pressure from the EC to withdraw land from agricultural use. It was also greeted enthusiastically by property developers. They saw big potential profits by buying the newly available land and building facilities to satisfy golfers who, they believed, were willing to pay handsomely for the pleasure of bashing a ball. But the recession has ruined the swing of many golf entrepreneurs. People can no longer afford big premiums to join new expensive clubs. And the slump in the property market has killed the expected profits from associated hotels and housing. Scores of golf projects are on hold and many new courses have gone bankrupt. Nevertheless, 60 courses are expected to open in the UK this year and 2,000 are planned. Environmental concern about golf courses can be divided into three issues: Course design. The image of the perfect golf course has been created by television coverage, especially of big US tournaments. These are played on lush man-made landscapes of minutely manicured lawns that depend heavily on chemicals to maintain the effect. 'Some designers change the landscape altogether,' says Tim Forrester-Muir, owner of the Forrester Park course in Essex. 'They mould the course of their dreams, but others use the existing landscapes.' It is the television-style courses that antagonise the environmentalists most. They destroy existing ecosystems and demand a heavy chemical input. For example, the Moatlands course near Tonbridge, Kent, which is owned by a Japanese company, is built entirely on shipped-in sand rather than soil. Course management. There are no recognised environmental standards for maintaining courses but greenkeepers are becoming aware of the increased concern about chemicals and water use. 'Greenkeepers see themselves as saviours rather than sinners. They will move heaven and earth to preserve the flora and fauna,' says David White, editor of Greenkeeper International. Jeffrey Collinge, a management and engineering consultant working in the Netherlands, is developing a model management programme for the Dutch Golf Federation. 'The problem on a golf course is not limited to pesticides, water and fertilisers. The largest area of a course  - 40-70 per cent  - is the rough. The way this area is managed will play a major role in the total environment impact.' Collinge says course management needs a standard to which all greenkeepers can adhere. He is looking at the suitability of the new British Standard on environmental management (BS7750), which should soon become the basis of an internationally agreed standard. 'In the Nethlands an environmental impact report is mandatory for permission to build an 18-hole course. But then there is no compulsion to manage it in an environmentally friendly manner,' he says. Development scale. The development debate is coloured by the prevailing view of what the countryside should be used for and, consequently, what it should look like. Golfers argue that a course which is sympathetically designed and includes areas that provide a habitat for animals and plants is far more acceptable than, say, a field of rape, linseed or wheat. But local protest groups, who view golf courses as the trojan horse of developers, want developments that are sympathetic in scale and cater for locals. Forrester-Muir thinks courses such as his act as ambassadors for the environment. 'This is a great introduction for the general public. It is often their first step from the pavement to the grass. People suddenly start taking an interest in the land when they walk around a course.'</p>

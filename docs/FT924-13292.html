			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson shows heavier loss OWEN &amp; ROBINSON, the jewellery and sports footwear retailer which brought in new management in April, yesterday announced doubled pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.44m for the half-year to July 31. Both the preferred and the ordinary dividend (0.15p) are being passed. The deepening losses from last time's Pounds 1.23m were struck on turnover up 29 per cent at Pounds 10.2m (Pounds 7.9m). The 16 per cent sales rise in Gold Centre, which increased the number of its shops by 22 to 59 during 1991, was entirely accounted for by those new shops, the company said. Like-for-like sales, however, were down. Foothold, which lifted the number of its sports footwear shops by 5 to 13 in 1991, lifted sales 66 per cent, though on a like-for-like basis sales only rose 10 per cent. The new management team started the group rationalisaimmediately - some 110 posts, or 25 per cent of the workforce, had been lost. The savings from this and the other cost reduction schemes would come through in the second half, Mr Smith said. Operating losses were Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 450,000) and, though interest payable was down at Pounds 405,000 (Pounds 778,000) on borrowings of Pounds 6.1m, there were exceptional costs of Pounds 300,000 relating to the departure of senior management. Mr Smith said gearing was 'awful'. Losses per share emerged at 5.7p (7.8p) reflecting the full effect of the 1991 rights issue.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> While Japanese stocks remain in the doldrums, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  continues to advance and is only 47 points shy of its Jan. 2 all-time high of  2810, said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San Diego  Securities.  </P> <P> But San Diego stocks remain lethargic, with a few exceptions. HomeFed Corp.,  the parent of HomeFed Bank, gained $1.625 after reporting excellent earnings in  the first quarter of $1.48 per share, versus $1.31 for the corresponding period  last year.  </P> <P> The stock is still down 40% from its 1989 high of $47.50 and is selling at a  30% discount from tangible book value, which is more than $40 a share.  </P> <P> "Can the expectations of doom in California real estate be so horrendous that  HomeFed stock should be selling at these levels?" Katz asked.  </P> <P> Five San Diego stocks managed new highs this week.  </P> <P> Among them was Cubic Corp., also undervalued on a book value and earnings  basis. The stock gained $1.75, reaching a new 1990 high of $20.875.  </P> <P> Mission West Properties made a new high of $9.50 on trading volume of only  2,200 shares.  </P> <P> The company, which is controlled by Intermark, last week announced the sale of  its High Bluff Del Mar office building that will result in an after-tax gain of  $2.2 million.  </P> <P> DH Technology, which was favorably mentioned in last week's Barron's magazine,  continued to move up, reaching a new high of $16.875. The largest gainer of the  week was Magma Power, which gained $3 to a new high of $37 a share.  </P> <P> Smith Laboratories, which is merging with closely held Columbia Hospital Corp.,  hit a new high of $3.81.  </P> <P> The proxy statement recently mailed to shareholders for the May 16 meeting to  approve the merger has 332 pages.  </P> <P> Other good gains last week included Molecular Biosystems, up $1.875, and Price  Co., gaining $1.50 after rebounding from its 1990 low of $34.50.  </P></p>

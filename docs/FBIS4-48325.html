			<p>BFN     [Text] According to information, far right wingers were  planning a massive bomb explosion at Jan Smuts Airport on the  day of President Nelson Mandela's inauguration six days ago.    This information was revealed in the Johannesburg Regional  Court during a bail application by 32 right wingers detained in  connection with last month's bomb explosion in the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] province. The head of  the Witwatersrand Crime Intelligence Service, Col. Neels van  Wyk, testified that up to 5 tonnes of explosives would have been  used in the second Jan Smuts attack. The police seized 80  firearms and 60 kilograms of explosives, and since the arrest of  the men there has been no further similar incident.</p>

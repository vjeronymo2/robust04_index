			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN TEAMS DO WELL ENOUGH;  </P> <P> COLLEGE TRACK: MEN, WOMEN RACK UP VICTORIES IN UNSPECTACULAR FOUR-SCHOOL MEET.  </P> <P> Sometime in the spring -- early April, perhaps -- a California Collegiate  Athletic Assn. quadrangular track and field meet that included Cal State  Northridge, Cal State Los Angeles, UC Riverside and Cal Poly Pomona would shape  up as an exciting, high-quality affair.  </P> <P> It is only late February, however, and predictably, the majority of the  performances in Saturday's meet were lackluster. It was, in fact, the first  competition of the season for many of Northridge's athletes.  </P> <P> Although nobody threatened any records, the day was far from a complete loss:  Northridge won both the men's and women's meets easily.  </P> <P> In the men's meet, Northridge totaled 90.5 points, followed by Cal State L. A.  (74.5), Riverside (20) and Pomona (16).  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors scored 106 points, while Cal State L. A. (53), Pomona (nine)  and Riverside (seven) finished second, third and fourth.  </P> <P> "It was a decent start," Northridge Coach Don Strametz said. "I think we showed  that we have a solid dual-meet team. We'll know more next week."  </P> <P> That's when Northridge travels to UC Irvine for a triangular meet against the  Anteaters and Stanford, both NCAA Division I schools.  </P> <P> Paul Albers was Northridge's top performer Saturday, winning the hammer throw  and placing second in the discus.  </P> <P> His toss of 186 feet 10 inches in the hammer easily qualified him for the  Division II championships in Hampton, Va., in May.  </P> <P> Albers placed sixth in last year's Division II meet.  </P> <P> Lolita Pile, second in the triple jump in the 1989 Division II meet, won that  event along with the long jump, and she also anchored the victorious 400-meter  relay team.  </P> <P> Pile leaped 18-2 1/2 in the long jump and 39-3 1/2 in the triple jump, then  teamed with Shawnette Sapp, Charlotte Vines and Laural Isles for a 47.79  clocking in the relay.  </P> <P> Isles, runner-up in the 100 meters in last year's Division II meet, was second  behind Vines (12.04-12.06 seconds) in that event Saturday but came back to win  the 200 convincingly in 25.20. Vines was second in 25.72.  </P> <P> The other top Northridge performance was turned in by Sasha Vujic, who won the  men's 1,500 in 3:56.1.  </P> <P> Vujic, eighth in the Division II cross-country championships in November, ran  away from a field that included Shannon Winkleman of Riverside, who placed  third in 3:59.4.  </P></p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Pechiney groups unveil sharply higher earnings PECHINEY Group, the French state-owned aluminium company, and Pechiney International, its separately listed can-making subsidiary, both reported sharp increases in first-half net profits yesterday. Net earnings at Pechiney Group rose from a restated FFr429m (Dollars 83.5m) to FFr782m in the first six months of the year, thanks to one-off gains from a complex asset re-organisation and injection of fresh capital carried out in May and June. Operating profits fell from a restated FFr2.44bn to FFr1.79bn, due to low aluminium prices and technical problems in starting-up extra capacity. Sales fell from FFr36.36bn to FFr34.06bn on the same basis. Under the asset reshuffle, Pechiney Group took over its subsidiary's aluminium and trading businesses, to leave Pechiney International as a packaging and turbine component company. The aim is to make Pechiney International more attractive to investors by reducing its exposure to volatile aluminium prices. Pechiney International saw a more than five-fold increase in its earnings, from a restated FFr266m to FFr1.41bn over the same period, reflecting heavy exceptional gains. Net sales fell from FFr18.66bn to FFr18.29bn over the same period. It forecast a full-year profit of more than FFr1bn, excluding exceptional gains, as against the FFr890m Pechiney International recorded on a comparable structure in 1991. This is based on a forecast that earnings from packaging - 85 per cent of operating profits in the first half - should rise about 10 per cent in dollar terms this year, while debt payments have fallen due to the asset reorganisation. Excluding exceptional items, Pechiney International's net earnings were roughly static in the first half, while operating profits fell by 8.9 per cent to FFr1.37bn, reflecting falling demand for turbine components from the depressed aircraft industry. Its packaging division lifted operating profit 3.7 per cent to FFr1.17bn. Spie-Batignolles, the troubled French construction group, expects a net loss of between FFr150m and FFr200m this year, but will break even at the operating level, said Mr Claude Coppin, group president.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, May 23 (AFP) -- Rwanda's Army and rebels  began a truce Monday [23 May], after a night of fighting, for  the visit of a special UN envoy who is to prepare the ground for  the planned arrival of thousands of peacekeeping troops, UN  officials said.    "We haven't heard gunfire all morning," said a UN official  contacted by telephone in Kigali.    Both sides pledged to observe a two-day truce starting  Monday  to allow special envoy Iqbal Riza, expected in Kigali later  Monday, to open discussions with rebels and Rwanda's interim  government, holed up in Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles)  southwest of the embattled capital, UN spokesman Abdul Kabia  said.    The truce brought calm to Kigali after a night of heavy  shelling following the capture of Kigali airport and a big army  base by the rebels Sunday.    The capture of Kanombe Barracks, Kigali's most heavily  fortified army position, was seen by military analysts as the  biggest achievement by the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) in  six weeks of fighting since the April 6 death of President  Juvenal Habyarimana threw Rwanda into turmoil.    RPF secretary-general Theogene Rudasingwa, however, said  there was no truce, but pledged that rebel guerrillas would  "hold fire as much as possible" to allow Riza to travel safely.    Rudasingwa told a news conference in Nairobi that reports by  UN officials that both sides had agreed to a 48-hour truce were  "exaggerated."    Up to half a million people, mostly members of the minority  Tutsi tribe that dominates the RPF, and Hutu opposition  supporters, have been butchered in a six-week-old bloodbath.  Extremist Hutu militias have been blamed for much of the  killing.    Riza, the personal representative of UN Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali, was due to arrive in Kigali by road from  Uganda later Monday for talks with both sides about plans to  boost the number of UN soldiers in Rwanda from 400 to 5,500 to  end massacres of civilians and help displaced people.    The Security Council authorised the deployment after the  United Nations came under heavy criticism for withdrawing most  of its 2,500 ceasefire monitors as bloodletting engulfed the  small central African country last month.</p>

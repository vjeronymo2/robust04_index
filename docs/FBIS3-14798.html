In an  interview with Interfax on Friday he noted that the speaker of  the parliament's lower chamber Ivan Rybkin insisted on taking  this decision, and, in Gorbachev's opinion, "this decision is  too serious not to have been discussed with the president  beforehand."    Gorbachev says that the fact that in his speech to the  Federal Assembly on the following day Yeltsin did not mention  the subject of amnesty confirms his version.    Gorbachev pointed out that he had always favored that the  coup plotters face a trial, a trial which would be open and  complete, "otherwise we will not learn the lessons of the August  1991 events."    At the same time, he said, if the State Duma's resolution  really promotes national accord, he is ready to understand and  accept that.    Gorbachev noted that he is ready to support the decision if  the State Duma, all political movements of the country and  Russian society will act jointly for the sake of accord, for the  rescue of Russia, as it was declared after the adoption of the  amnesty resolution.    "Even though all this concerns me directly, because the  creation of the State of Emergency Committee inflicted a  unrepairable damage to the country and to me personally, I put  the interests of Russia higher," he stressed.    However, Gorbachev did not rule out that the State Duma's  decision would finally lead to further confrontation. (The full  text of the interview given by M. Gorbachev to Interfax will be  published in one of the next editions of "Interfax-Exclusive").</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Flashpoint of fraternal feelings: A look at the potential clash over the Crimea peninsula With a reckless hand, it seems, the conditions for a civil conflict in Crimea are being piled one upon the other. So far, the will to fight appears lacking, but graceful and low-cost exits from confrontation grow narrower by the day. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Crimean peninsula has been seen as the epicentre of a potential clash between Ukraine and Russia. It is the benchmark for how Moscow grapples with the issue of the Russians abroad, a test of its commitment to observe in spirit and in letter the borders of the newly independent state of the former Soviet Union. Crimea is an acid test, indeed, transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 by Nikita Khruschev as a mark of Russian-Ukrainian friendship. It is Russian by majority of its 2.7m people, by culture and language, strongly felt to be so by most people in Russia and economically more linked to Russia than to Ukraine. Cossacks, the traditional guardians of Russia's frontiers, have revived since the collapse of communism. In their brown and blue uniforms, boots and peaked caps, the officers with ornamental whips, they stroll about the square before the Crimean Supreme Soviet (parliament) - their age-old task of keeping order apparently restored to them. 'We are against the separation of Slav brothers,' says Captain Yuri Gagalo, commanding a unit from Bakhchiserai near Simferopol. 'There should be no border between Ukraine and Russia; we do not recognise them.' Signs on the fence in front of the Supreme Soviet building read: 'Crimeans decide their own fate. Crimea - Russia]' and 'Radetsky (the Ukrainian defence minister) wants to shed our blood.' One poster shows a map of Crimea with an angel flying up from Russia to hold back threatening figures looming in from the north, with the slogan: 'Help and save us.' Last week the Supreme Soviet passed a resolution which brought into force a constitution of the Crimean republic drawn up two years ago. It claims autonomy for the peninsula and, in the view of the Ukrainian government in Kiev, establishes independence prior to rejoining Russia. A flurry of negotiations followed: Crimean deputies went to Kiev this week to talk over the demand that they rescind their constitution by Monday (they refused): while the Crimean deputy premier, Mr Yevgenny Saburov, joined talks (so far inconclusive) in Moscow on the division of the Black Sea fleet - the 300-ship navy based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, under uneasy joint Ukrainian-Russian command. The security situation is tragi-comic opera. Mr Yuri Meshkov, Crimean president, last month named Valentin Kuznetsov, a retired Soviet army general, as his interior minister, and General Ivan Kolomitsev as head of the Crimean KGB. Gen Kuznetsov effectively took command of the interior ministry; Gen Kolomitsev could not establish his authority over the KGB officers, who remain loyal to Kiev. Gen Kuznetsov, professing himself relaxed, reckons there are 100,000 men under arms in the peninsula - 50,000 Ukrainian troops, 35,000 Black Sea fleet sailors and marines, 15,000 militia and 2,500 Ukrainian National Guards - the latter reinforced with armoured personnel carriers. 'There is a danger,' he says, 'that the Ukrainian intervention will split the militia. If the Ukrainians were to try to take Simferopol, they might have initial success - but it would be a hollow victory. We must go on talking, and try to get agreement.' Mr Valentin Nedrehaylo, Ukrainian deputy interior minister, also talks peace, disclaiming the use of force. His job in Crimea, he says, is aimed at the reconstitution of the militia to control the criminals flourishing in the political crisis. He has a point. On Thursday, a smart Audi with four young men wearing sunshades and cropped hair drew up before a new restaurant. One crooked a finger to a waiter who ran over and pointed within the restaurant. A militia man, lounging on the patio, disappeared. The driver got out, ambled into the restaurant and came out a minute later, his pocket stuffed with the Ukrainian coupon now exchanging at about 50,000 to the dollar. It was an almost cinematic display of a protection gang on their rounds. 'There will be a planned implementation of Ukrainian command,' says Mr Nedrehaylo. 'Ukraine is a unitary state and Crimea is part of it.' But Kiev is weak. The parliamentary elections in April yielded a split parliament with a dominant socialist-communist wing hostile to reforms and distrusting President Leonid Kravchuk. Mr Kravchuk should be preparing for elections next month, but has called for a postponement because of the lack of a constitution. In the Crimean crisis he sees a reason, possibly, to declare presidential rule. The growing pressure upon the peninsula is causing cracks in the Crimean political facade, too. Mr Meshkov, a former lawyer elected on a ticket of unity with Russia, has been essaying caution. He admitted this week he had been against the vote on the constitution, preferring to wait in the hope that a new president in Kiev with pro-Russian leanings - Mr Leonid Kuchma, a former Ukrainian premier, is the favoured candidate - would bring the two Slav states together. Mr Meshkov is in danger of being pulled by, rather than leading, the political process. Mr Mustafa Djemilyev, leader of the 200,000-strong Crimean Tatar community and loyal to the Kiev government, confirms this view. 'We had hoped Meshkov would become moderate after his election. But he has become a hostage to his party (the Russia bloc) and to his campaign promises.' Not only the Tatar deputies were heated in a debate in Simferopol this week. Many deputies appeared angered by Mr Meshkov's appointment of Mr Saburov - a former Russian finance minister - as effective head of the government (though the president is the titular premier) and his intention to appoint a group of Mr Saburov's colleagues from Moscow to the main ministerial posts. 'Saburov is trying to become God,' one deputy snorted. The unease appeared to be roused more by resentment over young Muscovites coming to Crimea than by ideological splits. The programme which Mr Saburov is struggling to get past the parliament goes to the root of the Crimean crisis. He is trying to revive the peninsula's economy even as it remains within Ukraine, with a currency prone to hyper-inflation and with ever-tighter central control, which is ineffective in regulating business or collecting taxes but effective in deterring domestic and foreign investment. Crimea lacks attraction not because it could not be rich. Its climate, offshore oil and gas reserves, its agriculture, its shipyards - all could contribute to a standard of living higher than the hand-to-mouth, post-Soviet lifestyle to which its citizens have become accustomed. But it is trapped, politically. Presidential decrees on abolishing the Ukrainian fixed rates on currency exchange and on attracting foreign banks (while Ukraine repels them) are largely inoperable. While the three-cornered struggle for state power goes on between Ukraine, Crimea and Russia, there can be no confidence and no way out paved by firm investment. Thus the pressure mounts, in the lazy heat of late spring, as the Cossacks step smartly to and fro, whacking their whips gently on their boots. The politicians argue and rival militias glower across a common courtyard. Whatever outcome emerges, it is the signpost for how Russia conducts itself in the former Soviet Union, and how far Ukraine can succeed in establishing a statehood still fragile and contested.</p>

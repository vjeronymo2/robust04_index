			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Liberation tries to break free of revenue decline: John Ridding examines the spate of relaunches in the French press French newspaper vendors will have to clear some extra space and strengthen their stalls this morning. Liberation, the left-leaning daily, is launching a radical redesign, with a new typeface, a separate metro section, colour illustrations, and approximately double its usual 40 or so pages. Libe III, as it has been dubbed in reference to the newspaper's third redesign since its first edition in 1973, has ambitious objectives. 'It is a sort of a revolution as far as the French press is concerned,' claims a spokesman for the paper. 'The aim is to broaden the appeal of the newspaper and increase the number of readers.' Liberation is not alone. Its redesign is part of a broader upheaval in the French newspaper industry. The staid Le Monde is preparing an ambitious redesign, to be unveiled at the beginning of next year, as is Infomatin, the jazzy tabloid which heralded the upheaval with its cut-price, colourful format when launched in January. Regional newspapers such as Ouest-France have also been back to the drawing board this year to sharpen their presentation. In some cases, such as Le Monde, the redesigns coincide with the 50th anniversaries of their formation, which often followed the liberation of Paris in the second world war. For all, however, the motivation lies in a need to respond to the increased competition in the industry, depressed sales and reduced advertising revenue. Sales of national dailies have contracted by more than 15 per cent over the past three years, while advertising income has suffered an even sharper decline. As a result, many newspapers have gone into the red. Le Monde suffered a loss of FFr44m (Pounds 5.3m) last year, compared with a profit of FFr6m in 1992, while Infomatin expects a deficit of about FFr40m this year. Others have fared still worse. Le Quotidien, for example, went into receivership this year. Liberation has remained in profit, but admits its sales have stagnated over the past few years at about 170,000 copies a day. Economic recovery promises some improvement in revenues, but the industry remains beset by deeper problems. A reform of the advertising laws under the previous Socialist government prompted a shift towards television. As a spokesman for Liberation points out, daily newspapers must also contend with a raft of weekly news magazines. 'In France, these magazines are much more widely read than in other countries. It limits the readership for dailies.' He said sales of Le Figaro, Le Monde and Liberation, the principal national newspapers, were less than 1m copies. Hence the relaunches. 'What Liberation and the others are trying to do is to create a new readership, to expand their market and break a vicious circle of declining readership and advertising expenditure,' says a media analyst at a French merchant bank. He sees a trend towards more accessible presentation, broader coverage and the introduction of separate sections, as in the British press. At Le Monde, for example, Mr Jean Marie Colombani, the editor, promises a new format with easier access, and more contemporary and international coverage. Such overhauls, however, are not cheap. Liberation plans to invest more than FFr200m, of which it has so far raised about FFr75m. Although the national dailies have largely escaped a price war, the new formats amount to something similar. Libe III will cost the same FFr6 for twice as many pages. It is a gamble which raises the survival stakes across the industry.</p>

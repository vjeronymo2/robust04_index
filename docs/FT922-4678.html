			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recession cuts deeply into earnings AN ANALYSIS of the 1991 financial results of 180 large base and precious metals producers world-wide shows severe damage was caused by the recession in most industrialised countries and the consequent fall in metals prices. There was also a sharp rise in extraordinary losses and write-downs arising from mistakes metals companies made during the boom in the late 1980s, according to the latest financial review from the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy organisation. Pre-tax extraordinary losses of the companies sampled reached a record USDollars 2.41bn, equivalent to 22 per cent of 1991 operating profits. MMRS says pre and after-tax extraordinary write-downs were commonplace among metals producers. It suggests these were necessary because some companies either paid too much for assets or acquired assets with little connection to their core businesses. The other set of write-downs identified by MMRS came from companies forced to sell non-core assets below book prices simply to stay in business. Drawing on its computerised financial data, MMRS says that the aggregate turnover of the 180 metals companies fell last year by only 3.2 per cent from the 1990 level to Dollars 166bn. Given that base metals prices fell on average by 18 per cent last year and gold prices were 6 per cent lower, MMRS believes 'this was quite a creditable result'. However, this fall in revenue removed one quarter of 1990's operating profits and operating costs, up 2.9 per cent, took away another 20 per cent. Pre-tax profits fell by nearly two-thirds to Dollars 6.54bn after the write-downs and a 7.5 per cent rise in net interest payments. The pre-tax result was 75 per cent below the 1989 peak. After-tax profits fared even worse and at Dollars 3.44bn were 70 per cent below those for 1990 and little more than 20 per cent of those for 1989. After-tax write downs, a record Dollars 1.3bn, left net earnings of Dollars 1.71bn. Operating profit margins across MMRS's sample of companies averaged 6.6 per cent last year compared with a recent peak of 18.2 per cent in 1988 and a healthy 17.1 per cent in 1989. Margins were well below the 10.3 per cent recorded in 1986 in the depths of the previous recession. Pre-tax profit margins were 3.9 per cent compared with 1988's peak 17.5 per cent. Return on capital employed was only 5.7 per cent, the lowest MMRS has recorded since it started collecting the data 16 years ago. In 1988 the return was 18.5 per cent. Return on shareholders' funds was only 1.6 per cent but better than that achieved in 1985. The 1988 peak was 19.2 per cent. MMRS suggests that producers can draw some comfort from the fact that aggregate gearing (debt as a percentage of issued capital) in 1991 rose by less than 2 percentage points. However, the level of 41.4 per cent was 'still uncomfortably high and a level exceeded only on four occasions since 1976'.

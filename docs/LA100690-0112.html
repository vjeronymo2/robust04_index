			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AD GROUP HOPES TO SHOW HOW TO SELL TO BLACKS;  </P> <P> MARKETING: A NEW TRADE ASSOCIATION SAYS MADISON AVENUE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO GET  ITS CLIENTS' MESSAGE ACROSS TO MINORITIES.  </P> <P> Problem: Many of the ads created to appeal to black consumers come from Madison  Avenue agencies with no clue about black attitudes.  </P> <P> Evidence: Several missteps in marketing products to blacks have caused  nationwide controversy this year -- the last thing advertisers want.  </P> <P> Solution: Why not ask blacks how to market to blacks?  </P> <P> That is the rallying cry of a newly formed trade group, the African American  Marketing &amp; Media Assn.  </P> <P> The neophyte organization -- several of whose founding members are visiting Los  Angeles this week -- hopes to eventually become to black advertising what the  powerful lobby and trade group the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies is to  mainstream marketing.  </P> <P> "The black market has suffered from media anemia," said Ken Smikle, president  of the group, which plans to open its doors in Chicago in February.  </P> <P> "You see very little information on black consumers except how many of us are  living below the poverty level."  </P> <P> Blacks in America will spend an estimated $263 billion this year on everything  from toothpaste to automobiles, said Smikle, who also publishes Target Market  News, a Chicago-based newsletter on marketing to blacks.  </P> <P> American marketers are expected to spend only $705 million this year directly  advertising to blacks, he said.  </P> <P> That is small change compared to the $34 billion that the nation's top 100  advertisers spent last year to reach all consumers.  </P> <P> "We want the black consumer to be accurately portrayed," Smikle said. "And we  want black-owned agencies to be included in the considerations of companies  marketing to blacks."  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, there were fewer than a handful of black-owned advertising  and promotion firms in the nation. Today, there are upwards of 35. Their  combined annual billings are believed to exceed $275 million.  </P> <P> One top black agency owner says America's mainstream ad agencies -- which  generally have few black employees in high-level jobs -- are a big part of the  problem.  </P> <P> "There would be no need for black agencies if general agencies did their jobs,"  said Caroline Jones, president of the New York-based minority ad firm Caroline  Jones Advertising. Jones, who played a role in creating Kentucky Fried  Chicken's original "We Do Chicken Right" campaign, is a founding board member  of the new organization.  </P> <P> The head of the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies is the first to admit  that the industry has failed to do enough to attract minorities.  </P> <P> "It is a problem we are still trying to address," said John E. O'Toole,  president, who says he can appreciate why the new minority ad group has formed.  "They're fulfilling specific needs that our organization cannot."  </P> <P> The new group's board also includes such black media-industry heavyweights as  Clarence O. Smith, president of Essence Communications, which publishes Essence  magazine; and Thomas J. Burrell, whose Chicago agency, Burrell Advertising, is  regarded as one of the top minority-owned ad shops in the country.  </P> <P> At issue, however, is much more than a newly formed trade group. At issue is  how American companies speak to black consumers.  </P> <P> "It's really no mystery how blacks feel about products," said Jones. "All you  have to do is ask them."  </P> <P> But many Fortune 500 companies still don't.  </P> <P> And because of that, 1990 was a year when target marketing to blacks suddenly  became front-page news in some American cities.  </P> <P> In January, tobacco giant R. J Reynolds abruptly cancelled the planned  introduction of a new cigarette, Uptown, after various black groups complained  about the targeting of a group whose members already disproportionately suffer  from a number of cigarette-related diseases.  </P> <P> This summer, after some angry minority representatives painted over certain  billboards in Chicago and New York, the billboard industry's trade group  recommended that its members become more sensitive in their placement of  tobacco and alcoholic beverage ads in minority communities -- particularly near  schools, hospitals and places of worship.  </P> <P> And in late August, Operation PUSH called for a boycott of Nike products.  </P> <P> The Chicago civil rights group claimed that while Nike targeted black  consumers, it had no black board members and no black-owned ad agencies or  public relations firms helping it to promote the shoes.  </P> <P> Although Nike has agreed to speed up its hiring of black executives, the group  has yet to call off its boycott.  </P> <P> Minority ad executives say all of these public relations snafus could have been  avoided if the companies had only talked with them first.  </P> <P> "It's incredible," said Byron Lewis, chairman and chief executive of the  minority-owned Uniworld Group.  </P> <P> "But its seems like the leaders of black agencies are rarely consulted unless  there's some overriding issue in the news."  </P> <P> As a result, many companies also fail to consult with black consumers.  </P> <P> "Much of it goes against the grain of everything you learned in Marketing 101,"  said Samuel J. Chisholm, president of a New York minority-owned agency, the  Mingo Group.  </P> <P> "Companies need to figure out how to be more sensitive to this marketplace,"  added Chisholm, who is also a founding member of the African American Marketing  &amp; Media Assn.  </P> <P> Executives point out that marketing effectively to black consumers is not as  simple as placing TV spots on "The Cosby Show," or running print campaigns in  Ebony and Jet magazines.  </P> <P> "Too many companies take the black consumer for granted," said Chisholm.  </P> <P> "You can't just go out and tell black consumers that some new product is for  them. Before you do anything, you have to show the black community that you  care."  </P></p>

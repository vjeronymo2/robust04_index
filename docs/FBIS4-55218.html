			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks between the Bosniak and Croat delegations  concerning the implementation of the Constitution of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation are continuing in Vienna today.  The Vienna talks yesterday centered on the cantons, that is, on  their territory and borders. No agreement was reached on the  territory and borders of the cantons in Herzegovina and central  Bosnia, but new ideas were introduced and these formed the basis  for the expert teams to propose new solutions. The proposals in  question propose a smaller number of cantons that would have  more territory and would contain approximately the same number  of Bosniaks and Croats.    As for the Federal Government, it was agreed in principle  that it would consist of all together 15 ministries, 11 regular  ministries and four without portfolio. In addition to the prime  minister and deputy prime minister, the government would consist  of 17 members. Five ministries would be headed by Croatian  ministers, while the rest would go to the Bosniaks, but every  deputy minister would be from the ranks of the other nationality.    It was concluded that it was necessary to reach an overall  agreement, rather than a partial one.</p>

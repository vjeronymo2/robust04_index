			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Books: Personal portrait of a president BROTHER WOODROW: A MEMOIR OF WOODROW WILSON by Stockton Axson, edited by Arthur S. Link Princeton University Press, 297 pages It is hard to remember that in 1918-19 Woodrow Wilson was the toast of Europe. Streets, boulevards and squares were renamed in his honour. Even the defeated Germans pinned their hopes to the American president's 'Fourteen Points'. After decades of intense and acrimonious debate, Wilson is now mainly of interest to the academic establishment. This unique portrait of the president, written by his brother-in-law and friend of 40 years, is of general interest and should appeal to anyone interested in the 'human side' of American politics. It is a warm and affectionate yet frank and critical study of a reserved and introverted man. This collection of descriptive, anecdotal and analytic essays is brilliantly edited and annotated by the doyen of Woodrow Wilson studies, Arthur Link. What makes the Axson memoir so important is not only the sense of intimacy conveyed by one of the very few of Wilson's contemporaries in whom this reticent man confided but the sharpness of insight shown by the author, a life-long bachelor suffering from recurrent bouts of depression and who lived on and off in the Wilson household. Wilson was mentor, friend and companion to his younger brother-in-law. The affection between them was deep and long-lasting. The highlight of the book is the account of Wilson's presidency of Princeton University and his battle to reform not only its curriculum and lecture system but the special position of the socially devisive Princeton 'dining clubs' still in existence today. Axson was professor of English at Princeton during this time and his essay is the best and fullest record we have of this key moment in Wilson's pre-political life. In the ensuing campus battle, Wilson showed many of those same traits that made him one of the great American presidents but led to his ultimate defeat over the League of Nations, for which he had sacrificed so much. A natural leader, highly intelligent and administratively gifted, Wilson was also dogmatic, stubborn and inflexible. At the height of the Princeton conflict, passionately engaged in the pursuit of his educational goals, the university president rejected any possibility of compromise and turned his back on colleagues who opposed him. Wilson proved insufficiently politic to complete his reform programme, too unwilling to take advice and too aloof from his colleagues to outplay his conservative opposition. As Axson describes his own and others' efforts to moderate Wilson's unyielding approach, one has a foretaste of what happened in Washington in 1919. Wilson has been a favourite subject for the psycho-biographers. Axson's study of the president's father and his picture of Wilson's familial life is as, if not more, perceptive than the best of these accounts. Axson's shrewd character studies of Theodore Roosevelt, William Jennings Bryan and other contemporary politicians, his evocation of key political events, many of which he witnessed, and the rich collection of personal and political stories, comical as well as serious, convey a sense of immediacy no historian can match. The fond but sharp assessment of Wilson's personality in a final chapter is a beautiful piece of writing that seems to catch the essence of a strangely elusive man. There are few personal memoirs of Wilson; this is an exceptionally rich one. To have such a valuable addition to the vast corpus of Wilsoniana, presented in such a handsome and well-illustrated volume, is double bonus for the reader.</p>

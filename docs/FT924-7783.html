			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Australia boosts job creation THE Australian government yesterday reshuffled spending plans for the next 18 months to add ADollars 182m (Pounds 83m) to job creation schemes. However, delays in other planned spending will reduce the net impact to ADollars 8m this year and ADollars 31m in 1993-94. The announcement follows an increase of 0.5 percentage points in the number of registered unemployed, to a post-war record of 11.3 per cent, equivalent to just under 1m workers. Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer (finance minister), said the extra spending was expected to produce about 20,000 jobs in the financial year to the end of June. The effect of the revision is to increase spending on job subsidies this year, at the expense of investment in transport and energy infrastructure announced in the government's One Nation economic statement in February. A number of One Nation projects have progressed slowly, mainly because of disagreements between the federal and state governments and drawn-out staffing negotiations with trade unions. Mr Dawkins said ADollars 150m earmarked for a proposed National Rail Corporation and ADollars 24m for electricity grid projects would be deferred until 1993/94 because it was unlikely to be spent by the end of June. The savings will help to finance an extra ADollars 77m for job subsidy programmes, ADollars 20m for sporting, heritage, community and cultural projects, ADollars 55m for local capital works and ADollars 30m for small-scale road improvements. Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, said the government was 'on track' to achieve its target budget deficit of ADollars 13.4bn, but was 'probably under' its target for job creation. The government forecast in the August budget that unemployment would fall to 10 per cent by June, the last date for the next federal election.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Final installment of two-part article by Colonel Georgiy </F> Kostenko, academician, under the heading "Organizational  Development of the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Experience,  Problems, Prospects"; "Fundamentals of National Military  Doctrine: Structure, Content, Strategy"]    [Text] A general influence on the sum total of both  classical and specific doctrinal precepts is exerted by the form  of military doctrine. Five basic forms, in accordance with which  states' military doctrines are devised, are known at the present  time.    The first contains military-political aspects, in the main.  Thus a coalition military doctrine of the Warsaw Pact countries  was devised in 1987. With this content the document lays claim  to being more a doctrine of the allies' foreign policy than a  military doctrine in its classical understanding. The second  encompasses only military-technical aspects of the doctrine. For  this reason the document is called a "strategy" or "concept."  The national military strategy of the United States has been  devised in accordance with this form, for example. The third  form incorporates two groups of aspects: military-political and  military-technical. The requirements of such a doctrine are set  forth in textbooks on the art of war, but its practical  realization has proven impossible. As we have learned, this  structure of military doctrine has been abandoned in the Russian  Federation also. The fourth form consists of three sections:  Military-political, military-technical, and military-economic.  This form was adopted for the Military Doctrine of Ukraine  because of the high sensitivity of the military organization of  the state to the condition of its economy. The fifth form  contains doctrinal precepts in the form of a military  declaration. On account of incomplete information, this is the  path that has been taken in certain European states.    What has been said enables us to maintain that the first  military doctrine in the history of the Ukrainian state  corresponds to its purpose in form and content. Its progressive  nature is to be found in the fact that it is already connected  with the doctrine of foreign policy and could in the future be  linked with the economic doctrine of Ukraine and coordinated  with the military doctrines of contiguous and other states.    The basis of the first section of the Military Doctrine of  Ukraine is composed of precepts of military-political content  aimed at the prevention of war by nonmilitary means, and the  basis of the second section, of precepts for ensuring military  security by military means proper. The sum total of doctrinal  precepts provides for the organizational development of armed  forces capable of fighting the wars of the future, termed by  modern military theory sixth-generation wars. The creation of  the material basis of qualitatively new armed forces is the main  content of the third section of the Military Doctrine of Ukraine.    It has become obvious that the full-nomenklatura production  of modern and prospective arms systems is not only economically  inexpedient but also practically impossible. For this reason the  doctrine contains the precept of supply of the troops (forces)  in three ways: through national production; thanks to production  in cooperation with other states; thanks to purchases overseas.  Priority is given to dual technology here making it possible to  manufacture output for military and civilian purposes, and in  the competitive reviews of arms systems combat hardware making  it possible to enhance the qualitative component of the troops  (forces) and their fire and maneuver possibilities is considered  the priority hardware.    The strategy of ensuring military security and the use of  the  armed forces has always been, is now, and will continue to be a  sphere of special attention on the part of the country's  military-political leadership, since there continues to be the  theoretical possibility of the invasion of troops and forces on  the part of a state laying claim to some territory and not  considering its borders final. In this connection the military  doctrine reveals the purpose of military policy, which consists  of guaranteeing the national security of Ukraine against an  external military threat, preventing war, maintaining peace at  the national, regional, and global levels, and endeavoring to be  in the future a neutral and nuclear-free state. Proceeding from  the main purpose, the strategic mission consists of the defense  of state sovereignty and political independence and the  preservation of territorial integrity and the inviolability of  the borders. For the accomplishment of this mission it is  essential that Ukraine have its own armed forces. The precepts  of the military doctrine proceed here from the fact that the  border with contiguous states is established conclusively and  that Ukraine itself is not an enemy for any state.    It is not hard to see that the strategy of the state is  based  on the principles of defensive actions. For this reason the  military doctrine contains precepts of the use of the armed  forces exclusively in cases of armed aggression and  encroachments on our territorial integrity and the inviolability  of the border and also in fulfillment of its international  obligations. Ukraine's rejection of first use of its armed  forces is sometimes erroneously confused with passive strategic  defense. This is not the case. The military doctrine provides  for active defense, which is expressed in the doctrinal precepts  of preparation of the armed forces for a possible war. This  preparation of the troops and forces consists of their  assimilation of all the types, forms, and modes of military  operations with regard to the laws of war and the principles of  the art of war.    Considering the strategic purpose of the state in peacetime  and in war and also taking account of its strategic mission, it  can be seen that the main type of strategic use of the armed  forces of Ukraine under the conditions of peacetime is  premeditated active defense on all salients. Under the  conditions of a possible war this initial state of the army and  navy predetermines the possibility of the use of all known forms  of strategic operations of the armed forces. The modern art of  war attributes to such forms: strategic deployment, the repulse  of a strike from the air and space, a strategic defensive  operation, a strategic offensive operation. The precise  concordance of the combat operations of heterogeneous forces and  assets of different branches of the armed forces and combat arms  is possible only within the framework of a unified purpose and  strategic plan with the strict centralization of command and  control on the part of the supreme commander. This is why the  Military Doctrine of Ukraine contains the precept of joint  operations with the armed forces in wartime of the Border  Troops, the National Guard, the Security Service, the Internal  Troops, and the Civil Defense Forces.    Summing up, I would like to emphasize that for the  organizational development of armed forces capable of fighting a  war of the future, military science of the future is essential.  It is very important, therefore, that the first particular  concept approved by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine following  the adoption of the military doctrine was the Concept of the  Organization of Research in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpts] Kigali, May 11 (AFP) -- Rebels battled  government soldiers in Rwanda's capital Kigali on Wednesday [11  May] as rebel leader Paul Kagame welcomed proposals for a bigger  UN force provided its role remained "humanitarian." But Kagame  said the 5,500-strong force suggested by UN Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali "to stop the genocide" was too big.    The United Nations was strongly condemned by aid agencies  for  withdrawing all but 400 of its 2,500 soldiers days after the  death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspicious April 6  plane crash hurled Rwanda into an epic bloodbath that has  already cost 200,000 lives.    "We've done most of the work of the UN," Kagame told  reporters in Byumba, northern Rwanda, after talks with UN force  commander General Romeo Dallaire and UN High Commissioner for  Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso. Kagame said he had assured them  that the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) would not attack a  humanitarian force but stressed that it was too late for  military intervention "because the genocide has already been  carried out."    The United Nations, he said, had left "the Rwandese facing  the tragedy." "We have no problem with a force that will come  to assist us on a humanitarian basis," Kagame said. "We are only  opposed to an intervention force."    The RPF had earlier warned that it would treat a foreign  intervention force as hostile invaders.    Kagame also renewed his call for the resignation of UN envoy  to Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, who has denied accusations by  the rebels that he supported the government.    As dawn rose over Kigali's hills, covered in banana trees,  rebel and army gunners pounded each other's positions with  intense artillery and mortar barrages for about two hours, a UN  military spokesman said. The fighting then subsided, but small  arms fire persisted in different areas throughout the day, the  spokesman said.    The proposed UN force would escort food and medical convoys  to more than a million people displaced by the fighting and  risking famine. Up to half a million Rwandans have fled to  neighbouring countries. The UN force would also establish a  neutral zone around Kigali airport, a vital lifeline if mass  starvation is to be averted.    Fighting between rebels and government soldiers encamped  around the airport has repeatedly prevented relief flights  landing. The new UN troops would be allowed to fire back if  attacked. But they would not be empowered to shoot first in  offensive "peacemaking" operations as they did in Somalia.  [passage omitted]    UN military officials have described the current fighting in  Kigali as the rebels' final onslaught against battered  government forces, many of whose soldiers have deserted.    But General Dallaire told reporters that the battle for  Kigali could last a long time.    "It would be unreasonable to say that the Rwanda Patriotic  Front will take Kigali in three days," he said, explaining that  "both armies are small" and neither side could sustain a big  offensive.    The rebels brought in munitions and evacuated casualties in  small trucks or "on their backs," he said. Some army soldiers  fought well, though the government has lost the military  initiative to the rebels, who now control two-thirds of the  country, he said.</p>

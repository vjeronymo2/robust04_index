Syria, through the head of its delegation,  reiterated its firm stand toward the bases of a just and  comprehensive peace. It reaffirmed that the full return of the  occupied Syrian Golan Heights to the homeland is a basic  condition for the success of ongoing efforts. In fact, Syria's  stand from now on does not need any explanation or  reaffirmation. It has been the same stand since the launching  of the U.S. peace initiative that led to the Madrid conference.  It is the same stand expressed in the Syrian working paper  presented during the sixth round of the Washington talks, which  is still the only acknowledged working paper on which the talks  are conducted. It is also the same stand embodied by President  al-Asad at the Geneva summit when he called for the peace of the  brave--a peace that removes Israeli occupation and restores  usurped rights to their owners.    During the Geneva summit, Syria, represented by President  al-Asad, categorically, unequivocally, and clearly expressed its  commitment to achieving a just and comprehensive peace and its  response to all the requisites of such a peace. Meanwhile,  Israel so far has not taken the anticipated and necessary step  to push the peace process forward, that is, through an  announcement of its full willingness to withdraw from the  occupied Arab territories. Indeed, what we heard from Israeli  officials does not foster optimism. These officials sought to  cast doubts on Syria's intentions and on the use of the Geneva  summit. They proposed holding a referendum in the Golan, as if  the occupiers have the right to hold a referendum on territory  that has been Syrian since time immemorial and that remains an  inseparable part of Syria. About 150,000 Syrian evacuees are  waiting for peace to prevail in order to return to the Golan and  live normal lives in their homes and territory.    The head of the Israeli delegation to the Washington talks  said that the atmosphere was positive and encouraging. This is  because Syria affirmed its absolute commitment to an honorable  peace in the Middle East. However, it also affirmed its  adherence to a comprehensive solution on all the conflict's  fronts and to the return of the Golan Heights to its people. In  fact, it is impossible to talk about positive and encouraging  atmospheres without an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal  from the Golan and without Israel's actual involvement in the  peace process by fully responding to the Security Council  resolutions and showing willingness to meticulously implement  these resolutions. Israeli officials so far have not promised a  full withdrawal, but instead have talked about a form of  withdrawal. Syria, as everyone knows, will not relinquish an  inch of its territory or any of its rights. It will never accept  a compromise solution in the Golan that leads to sharing this  Syrian territory and rewarding the aggressor for his aggression.    Syria responded to the U.S. request to resume the Washington  talks on the level of chief delegates. This is because the  United States is absolutely and clearly committed to the  comprehensiveness of the solution, to the Security Council  resolutions, and to the land-for-peace principle. U.S.  President Bill Clinton reaffirmed these commitments. He said  that a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East is a  first priority for his government and that the United States  will exert every effort possible to achieve the desired  honorable peace. Here, we should recall that during the Geneva  summit, President Clinton supported President al-Asad's call to  achieve the peace of the brave and considered it the only way to  achieve stability in the region.    The United States is playing a major role in pushing the  peace process forward and rendering it a success. Hence, the  positive results people are eagerly anticipating depend on  Israel. When the latter abandons its policy of evasion,  prevarication, and procrastination, puts an end to its useless  maneuvers such as the idea of holding a referendum on the Golan,  and pledges to implement the Security Council resolutions and to  end the occupation, only then will peace be at hand.    Peace serves the interest of all. It serves the interest of  the countries in the region, the world community, and the United  States itself. The stability of the world stems from the  stability of the Middle East. It is no coincidence or  complement that peace in our region is at the top of the U.S.  Administration's list of priorities.</p>

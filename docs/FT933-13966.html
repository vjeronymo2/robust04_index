			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Observer: Blame's familiar A crumb of comfort for John Major. While the Brits rank him the most unpopular premier in memory, at least the bulk of them know who he is. Indeed, according to a new EC survey, more of his fellow citizens are aware that he is the present occupant of 10 Downing Street than know where 10 Downing Street is. The 98 per cent naming Major as prime minister compared with 94 per cent able to identify London as their country's capital. His only two European counterparts better known to their electorates were Germany's Helmut Kohl and Spain's Felipe Gonzalez at 99 per cent apiece. The obscurity prize went to Edouard Balladur of France with a dismal 80 per cent.</p>

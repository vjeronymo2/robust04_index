			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michel Moutot] </F>   [Text] Zenica, Bosnia-Hercegovina, June 14 (AFP) -- Two  Russian helicopter pilots serving with the Bosnian Serbs have  defected to the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, bringing their  helicopter with them. In the first defection of its kind since  fighting began in Bosnia over two years ago, the two pilots  landed here near the headquarters of the Bosnian army's Third  Corps last Wednesday at 3:00 pm (1500 GMT), according to a  senior officer who wished to remain anonymous.    Their Russian MI-17 "HIP" helicopter, painted in the Bosnian  Serb colours of red-blue-white, was quickly repainted in Bosnian  army colours and is still making test flights at a Zenica  barracks. An AFP journalist saw it in flight, two days after  its arrival. The story was confirmed to AFP by western military  sources in the sector. The motive of the defectors remains  unknown.    An officer at the barracks, speaking to two western  journalists Monday morning, confirmed the presence of the two  Russians but said it was "impossible to see them or speak to  them without the agreement of the Third Corps command." The  corp's press service refused to confirm or deny the story and  said the command was not informed about the affair.    Another Bosnian Army officer said the two Russians did not  plan to stay and fight with the mainly Moslem army, which in any  case "needs arms rather than men to defend itself." He said the  two had brought "presents to prove their good intentions," but  did not specify what the gifts were.    The MI-17 is a heavy transport or assault helicopter, a  valuable catch for the badly equipped Bosnian airforce. A  western military source said the pilots -- whose motives for  defecting were not revealed -- arrived from the east, apparently  from Serb lines in the Mount Vlasic area. They first flew over  the outskirts of Zenica for a long time, probably to allow time  to negotiate their defection over the radio, he said.    There have been many cases of Russian soldiers fighting  alongside Bosnian Serb forces, either as mercenaries or  sympathisers. On May 5 IZVESTIYA interviewed a Russian  mercenary who said he had served for three years in Bosnia for  200 deutschmarks (120 dollars) per month.</p>

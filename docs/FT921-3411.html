			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: Elf share offering declared successful THE flotation of a 2.3 per cent stake in Elf Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil group, was a success, with subscriptions for 3.22 times the number of shares on offer, the Societe des Bourses Francaises announced yesterday. The rush for shares in the second in the government's programme of partial privatisations came despite the fact that the issue was offered earlier this week at FFr360 (Dollars 63.90) - only a small discount to the market. The market price even fell slightly below the issue price, to recover yesterday afternoon to FFr362, up FFr1.80 for the day. By the time subscriptions had been counted, there were applications for 10.9m shares, against 3.38m on offer. The government managed to add another 360,000 shares to the offer by buying back shares which had earlier been placed abroad. Accordingly, investors will receive around 34 per cent of the shares they applied for. The international tranche of the offering was swallowed up on Wednesday, the first day of subscription, with French investors slower to apply for stock. The Elf sale initially got off to a false start last December, when the government was obliged to postpone the offer because of the poor state of the stock market. The bourse has recovered strongly since then, with the CAC-40 index showing in a 10.5 per cent rise since the beginning of the year.</p>

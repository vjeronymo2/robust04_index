			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUBLIC ENEMY LYRICS REKINDLE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> The acclaimed but controversial New York rap group Public Enemy is again  drawing accusations of anti-Semitism with its new single, "Welcome to the  Terrordome."  </P> <P> The song, released this week by Def Jam Records under a distribution agreement  with Columbia Records, addresses the controversy that swirled around alleged  anti-Jewish statements made in interviews last spring by the group's "minister  of information" Professor Griff (real name: Richard Griffin). Public Enemy's  records had earlier expressed support for Louis Farrakhan, the controversial  Nation of Islam minister who has called Judaism a "gutter religion."  </P> <P> Griff was fired by Public Enemy, but then rehired in the role of community  liaison and forbidden to give interviews. But group leader Chuck D (Carlton  Ridenhour) continued to be criticized by many in the Jewish community,  particularly Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of Los Angeles' Simon  Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.  </P> <P> Among the lines in the new song: "Told the rab, get off the rag," "So-called  chosen, frozen" and "Apology made to whoever pleases / Still they got me like  Jesus."  </P> <P> Cooper said this week that he believes the rab reference is to him -- a  development which he finds particularly disturbing in the wake of a visit which  he says Chuck D paid to the center's Holocaust museum two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "Chuck spent an hour (at the museum) with me and a survivor of the Holocaust,"  Cooper said. "He went out of his way to say (then and in earlier conversations)  he was not anti-Semitic, but this song crosses the line. So my message to him  is, 'Will the real Chuck D please stand forward?' "  </P> <P> Chuck D could not be reached for comment Friday, but was quoted in the New York  Daily News as insisting that "Terrordome" is not anti-Semitic -- that the lines  are about the media "crucifying" him. By the "chosen" he said that he meant  Jews and Muslims.  </P> <P> Cooper is not appeased. "The song is definitely anti-Semitic," he said. "The  people who wrote it, who produced it and the record company that released it  know it. We had the problem with Griff before. Now they've institutionalized  it."  </P> <P> Along with Cooper, the Anti-Defamation League is also holding the record  company accountable and has sent a written protest to CBS Records president  Tommy Mottola. In the letter, Jeffrey Sinesky, ADL Civil Rights Division  director, said the lyrics revived the "repulsive and historically discredited  charge" that the Jews killed Christ. Mottola was said to be on vacation and  unavailable for response.  </P> <P> Public Enemy's last album, "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back,"  sold more than 500,000 copies and was named best album of 1988 in a Village  Voice poll of more than 200 U.S. pop critics.  </P> <P> Los Angeles rap radio station KDAY-AM began playing "Terrordome" even before it  was released this week and the station's Michael Palmer, who often fields calls  from people requesting various songs, suggests that most KDAY listeners respond  to the beat rather than to the lyrics.  </P> <P> But Cooper believes the lyrics cannot be ignored.  </P> <P> "It's a tip-off that the impact of Farrakhan with this group and with young  blacks in general is more profound than we want to recognize," he said.  </P> <P> Chuck D, however, says the lyrics are being over-interpreted. "I'm not saying  the Jews killed Christ," he said in New York. "I'm commenting on the way the  media came after me at the time. I'm telling the story from my perspective; my  message is that we have to look after ourselves."  </P></p>

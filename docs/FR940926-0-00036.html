			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has decided not to adopt the one percent circumferential deformation requirement. In proposing this criterion, NHTSA tentatively concluded that it would be an appropriate indicator of the fuel container's durability characteristics. However, as the comments note, it is not an appropriate criterion because of the differing construction and materials used for CNG fuel container applications. After reviewing the comments and other available information, the agency now believes that limiting the circumferential deformation is not a meaningful way to determine a container's strength or impending failure, since the larger deformation experienced by some materials does not necessarily represent these characteristics. Instead, the agency believes that the no-leakage requirement, by itself, is the appropriate criterion to define a container failure, after being subjected to the pressure cycling test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Brunswick further commented that some container designs, such as full-wrapped composite containers, would deform in the axial direction in addition to the circumferential direction. To account for axial deformation, Brunswick recommended allowing a maximum five percent volumetric expansion of the container. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Brunswick stated that this test is used to assure that the container material exhibits elastic behavior at expected operating conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Both RSPA's standards and NGV2 incorporate the concept of volumetric expansion. In these standards, the volumetric expansion is measured when hydrostatic testing is performed on the container at 1.50 to 1.67 times the service pressure. This test is a non-destructive one, i.e., the container may be put into service after it is tested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA agrees with Brunswick's statement that some container designs deform in the axial direction. Nevertheless, the agency believes that measuring volumetric expansion would not provide an appropriate measure of a container's impending failure in a destructive test (i.e., where the container cannot be used again). In addition, the NPRM provided no notice to amend the standard to measure such expansion in the axial direction. Since the pressure cycling and burst tests being adopted in this rule are capable of evaluating a CNG container's durability, the agency believes that another non-destructive test would be redundant and therefore is not needed. The agency further notes that the five percent maximum level of expansion would not provide a meaningful measure of a container's impending failure, since this level is based on a container's performance under less stringent test conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Burst Test <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Safety Factor <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to the burst test, NHTSA proposed that a CNG fuel container would have to withstand an internal hydrostatic pressure of 3.50 times the service pressure for 60 seconds, without any leakage or circumferential deformation over one percent. The multiple of the internal hydrostatic pressure, 3.50, is known as the safety factor. The agency tentatively concluded that the burst test, together with a pressure cycling test, would be sufficient to assure adequate levels of safety performance for both the strength and durability of CNG fuel containers used in motor vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal of a burst test with a safety factor was based in part on NGV2. NGV2 specifies several sets of detailed material and design requirements. For each set of those requirements, NGV2 specifies a unique safety factor for calculating the internal hydrostatic pressure that the container must withstand. The safety factors range from 2.25 to 3.50, depending on the material and design involved. To satisfy this aspect of NGV2, a container must meet both the material and design requirements as well as the burst test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGV2 specifies four types of container designs. A Type 1 container is a metallic noncomposite container. A Type 2 container is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a hoop wrapped pattern over the liner's cylinder sidewall. A Type 3 container is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire liner, including the domes. A Type 4 container is a non-metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire liner, including the domes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency did not propose adoption of the material and design requirements of NGV2. Instead, the agency proposed a single safety factor of 3.50 for all containers, regardless of their materials or design. It tentatively concluded that the factor would not impede technological development, yet would assure an acceptable level of safety for all containers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG container manufacturers, CNG trade associations (NGVC and AGA), utility companies, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) and other commenters addressed the issue of the safety factor. Most commenters disagreed with the agency's proposal to require that all containers meet the same safety factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGVC, AGA, and the CNG container manufacturers generally believed that the material and design of the fuel container need to be taken into account in establishing an appropriate safety factor, if safe, cost-effective, and light-weight containers are to be produced. Establishing an overly high factor for a given combination of material and design could result in unnecessarily over-designed, heavy containers, according to these commenters. They believed that some materials, such as fiberglass, need a higher safety factor because they degrade faster over time. In contrast, a material such as steel maintains its strength for a longer time, and therefore containers made of it could be made safely with a lower safety factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of these commenters recommended that NHTSA adopt the safety factors specified in NGV2. They stated that compared to the regulations proposed by NHTSA, the NGVC voluntary industry standard provides a more appropriate level of safety, given the need to specify safety factors based on the design and materials used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Brockhampton hits Pounds 3.43m Profits at Brockhampton Holdings, parent of Portsmouth Water, advanced from Pounds 1.87m to Pounds 3.43m pre-tax for the six months to September 30. Turnover of Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 11.8m) reflected an 8 per cent lift in charges. Earnings rose to 30.5p (15.5p) and the interim dividend is boosted to 3p (2.2p). Profits benefited from a surplus on the disposal of a site at Bognor, a temporary shortfall in the annual investment in mains renewals (which will be rectified in the second half) and control of operating costs. A weaker second half was expected, but the group still looked for a 'satisfactory outcome' for the year. The shares rose 15p to 408p.</p>

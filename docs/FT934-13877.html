			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Argentina to pay creditor banks Dollars 7bn this month ARGENTINA is to issue Dollars 7.23bn (Pounds 4.78bn) in bonds to creditor banks by the end of this month to securitise unpaid interest on its foreign debt and so bring to a virtual close the restructuring of its commercial bank debts. Earlier this year Argentina signed an agreement with its bankers to cut its Dollars 32bn external debt by a third by issuing concessional 'Brady bonds' which stretch out maturities and cut both principal and interest. As part of this agreement, Argentina also agreed to pay Dollars 8.5bn interest arrears accumulated up to December 1991 by issuing more bonds. Until then, Argentina paid banks only Dollars 70m a month in token interest payments. It will now begin paying the arrears with 12-year bonds that pay  13/16 per cent over Libor. Payment will come in two stages. Mr Daniel Marx, financial secretary, said yesterday that bonds worth Dollars 7.23bn would be issued this month. A second batch, worth Dollars 1.28bn, would be issued by December. Mr Marx said the delays were due to difficulties facing bankers, auditors and government officials in establishing the precise amount of unpaid interest due. Once the process is complete, Argentina will have Dollars 25.4bn-worth of Brady bonds outstanding. These bonds offer creditors the choice between maintaining the value of loan principal but accepting a low fixed interest rate, or accepting a 30 per cent cut in principal in exchange for floating interest rates. Banks took Dollars 12.6bn-worth of par bonds that preserve principal and Dollars 4.3bn in bonds that pay floating interest. These bonds are backed by Dollars 3.2bn-worth of zero coupon US Treasury bonds.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: The true-life corporate soap opera at Astra - William Keeling traces the likely fate of Indonesia's second-largest company ASTRA International, Indonesia's second-largest company which dominates the country's motor vehicle sector, has for two months been the subject of a true-life corporate soap opera. With the Soeryadjaya family, the company's founders, selling shares to raise funds for their privately-owned, bankrupt Bank Summa, the sires of Indonesian business have been publicly fighting for a stake. The battle, involving multiple back-stabbing of the highest order, has undermined investor confidence in the country, raised the cost of offshore borrowing for Indonesian companies and damaged the government's reputation for crisis management. 'It's interesting, but it's frightening as well. There's no damage control we can do,' noted one despondent government official. Until November 13, the Soeryadjayas owned 178m Astra shares, or 73 per cent of the company. With the suspension of Bank Summa, and its subsequent order of liquidation with outstanding obligations of Rp1,600bn (Dollars 767m), the Soeryadjayas began to dispose of Astra shares. To date, 20m shares have been sold to the pension fund of state-owned Bank Dagang Negara and 26m shares to state-owned mutual trust Danareksa on behalf, brokers say, of a second state-owned bank. A further 20m shares have been purchased through Danareksa by Newark Ltd, a Honk Kong shelf company, to be held in escrow while negotiations continue for their purchase with Toyota, Astra's main joint-venture partner. By authorising these deals, the government has done a swift U-turn from its position in November. Then, officials stressed they wished to avoid bailing out Bank Summa, even by the indirect means of using state institutions to purchase Astra shares. The December 15 liquidation order on Bank Summa also placed the Soeryadjayas in default on a Rp500bn loan from a three-bank consortium - state-owned Bank Exim and Bapindo, and Bank Danamon - against which 100m Astra shares were pledged. The banks may now claim these shares, which would place a majority Astra holding under government control. Perhaps, for this reason, the Soeryadjayas have been given the breathing space to negotiate the sale of up to 108m shares to a consortium led by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a well-connected timber tycoon. Mr Pangestu was a key-figure behind the 1990 rescue of Bank Duta, owned by three charitable foundations chaired by President Suharto, when it suffered Dollars 419m in foreign exchange losses. His consortium reportedly includes the Salim group, led by Mr Liem Sioe Liong, a shareholder in Indomobil, Astra's main competitor; the Sinar Mas Group, headed by Mr Eka Widjaya; and Mr Sofyan Wanandi's Gemala Group. Negotiations between the Soeryadjayas and Mr Pangestu have not gone smoothly. In mid-December, an agreement was signed but then blocked by Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo, Astra's chairman, who said Toyota and banks with exposure to Astra opposed the make-up of the consortium. Mr Djojohadikusumo has since resigned and an Astra official has confirmed a second deal has been struck and is awaiting government approval. Bankers say the deal involves the purchase of at least 100m shares at Rp10,000 a share. The funds would be used to repay the Rp500bn Exim-Bapindo-Danamon loan, and to help clear the debts of companies in the Soeryadjayas' Summa group, mostly involved in international property, which government officials say owe Bank Summa over Rp500bn. The Soeryadjayas equity in Summa group companies is likely to be passed to the consortium. The consortium would then create a new bank, with a capital injection of Rp100bn, to which Bank Summa depositors' accounts would be transferred. The deal, however, faces serious obstacles. Astra's financial security - it owes more than Dollars 900m to foreign banks, two-thirds of which is to be rescheduled within the next 12 months - depends upon the support of its bankers. In turn, this depends upon Toyota backing the consortium. According to an Astra official, Toyota have demanded conditions for its approval, such as the management of Astra and its big subsidiaries remaining intact. Bankers say other conditions include consortium members buying shares as individuals, not as a group, and a cap on an individual's shareholding. But confidence in Astra has already been damaged and, as one foreign bankers explained, the company must expect a 'huge difference in pricing' when its loans are rescheduled. If the sale is completed, the consortium must persuade Bank Summa's depositors to maintain their accounts with the new bank. Any run on deposits would demand the injection of more funds. While finance could be raised by selling Summa group assets, brokers say this is complicated by the Soeryadjayas not holding a majority interest in many of the related companies. Nor are Bank Summa's liabilities clear. Bankers say that by November its 1991 accounts had yet to be finalised. Brokers suggest the consortium is paying too high a price for the shares, valuing the company over 30 times estimated 1992 earnings against a market average of 15 times. Bankers are concerned, therefore, the consortium, although not holding a majority stake, will look to Astra for a quick return on what is a high-risk investment. This is unlikely to come from Astra's net profits which are estimated to have fallen 66 per cent in 1992 to about Rp75bn. Brokers believe 1993 will see Astra's profits rise but differ on the scale. But they note other means to raise money. While Astra's automotive sector accounts for 80 per cent of its bottom line, it also has timber, agribusiness, financial services and electronics divisions. As one foreign broker noted: 'Astra may be ripe for an asset strip.'</p>

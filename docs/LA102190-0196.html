			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Andre Waters of the Philadelphia Eagles was fined "a substantial amount," by  the NFL for hitting Minnesota quarterback Rich Gannon below the knees after  Gannon released a touchdown pass Monday night.  </P> <P> League spokesman Greg Aiello said the fine was levied by Commissioner Paul  Tagliabue after a review of tapes of Monday night's game, won, 32-24, by the  Eagles.  </P> <P> Aiello did not divulge the amount of the fine. It was believed, however, to be  about $10,000.  </P> <P> Waters, Philadelphia's free safety, was blitzing on the play, a 78-yard  touchdown pass to Cris Carter, and hit Gannon below the knees -- in violation  of a rule enacted in 1989 after Waters did the same to Jim Everett of the Rams  in 1988.  </P> <P> There was no penalty called on Waters for hitting Gannon.  </P> <P> Waters previously had been fined for late hits and also met with  then-commissioner Pete Rozelle in April 1989 to discuss what some considered  dirty play. Waters has maintained he plays within the rules.  </P></p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories postpone new curbs on unions THE government yesterday postponed the bill containing further measures directed against the unions - even though the legislation covered pledges made in the Conservative general election manifesto. Ministers had originally planned to bring the bill before parliament in the autumn but do not now expect to introduce it until early next year. The delay to the bill follows the massive show of public support for the mining unions over the pit-closures programme. The Trades Union Congress has been prominent in the campaign which led to the government's U-turn over the collieries. The bill was expected to threaten union finances by outlawing the automatic deduction of dues from salaries. It was also due to contain measures to force unions to give seven days notice of strikes and to give workers greater freedom of choice over which union to join - a move that is seen as a further threat to the TUC. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, denied that the legislation proposed by Mr Michael Howard, her Thatcherite predecessor, had been delayed because of its political sensitivity. She said at the Institute of Personnel Management's annual conference in Harrogate the postponement was due to difficulties in drafting additional clauses to implement a European Community directive on maternity benefits agreed at a meeting of EC employment ministers last week. Mrs Shephard said that drafting the legislation should not take 'too long' and confirmed that the bill would be considered in the current session of parliament. That means it should be enacted by this time next year at the latest. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, urged the government to use the extra time to think again about whether the bill was necessary. 'It would be better never than late,' he said. Mrs Shephard also confirmed that the government does not believe wages councils, the statutory bodies which set pay rates for more than 2.5m workers in low-paid jobs, have a permanent place in the labour market. The delay in bringing the bill forward gives ministers a further opportunity to decide whether to include the abolition of wages councils in the legislation. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said the proposals would make the government 'even more unpopular' at Westminster. The measures might well, however, be an issue that could unite Tory backbenchers.</p>

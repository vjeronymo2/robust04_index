			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Travel: Cote d'Azur of the Arctic - Nicholas Woodsworth drives through dull Lapland to the dazzling Lofoten Islands Home of rivers, lakes and virgin forests, home of the hardy Lapp and vast herds of reindeer, Lapland, I have to admit, sounds like an interesting place. Do not believe a word. The attractions of Lapland are for the most part as imaginary as its most famous resident, Santa Claus, who each year leaves the Finnish postal service holding 500,000 letters addressed to him. I had spent two long summer days driving across arctic Scandinavia and was ready to scream with boredom. There may well have been all sorts of fascinating things out there. Lapp folk music contests and endless boggy back-packing trails are highly considered locally. Whatever their qualities, they were hidden in drizzle behind the thick curtain of trees that, mile after mile, hour after hour, hemmed in both sides of the highway. It was not long before I began accepting any little diversion with gratitude: small villages lost in the forest, their wooden houses sodden in the rain, their pale-faced womenfolk grimly planting potatoes in muddy plots; a contingent of the Finnish army, camouflaged in spruce branches and clouds of mosquitoes, engaged in some sort of field drill; an electronic pool game in a Swedish small-town take-away, intoning 'Stop talkin' and start chalkin'' in a Clint Eastwood voice. So endless, unchanging and empty were the forests of the north that, listening to Maria Callas and dreaming of the Mediterranean, I missed a turn and drove 100km to a dead end before I realised my mistake. Great was my wonder and anticipation when, not far from the Norwegian border at the end of the second day, I noticed the land beginning to lift and the forest to thin out. Snaking between hills now, the road rose higher and higher. In an hour I was above the tree-line; in another I was lost in a chilly snow-covered desert of tall mountains. Then, without warning, I was over a high pass and the road fell precipitously to warmth and greenery. I took a deep breath of surprise. Spread out in a jigsaw puzzle below me were the spectacular islands, sea and fiords of the Norwegian far north. Fly, take ship or, if you can stand it, drive. One way or another, the coasts around the Lofoten Islands are worth any kind of effort. Wholly surprised by their beauty, I realised where generations of European holiday-makers may have gone wrong. Instead of working in grey northern cities and massing each summer on hot, smelly beaches to the south, we should do the opposite - live and work in the south and travel to the cool, green north for holidays. The Lofotens are the Cote d'Azur of the Arctic. Looking about as I motored down towards the water, it was not hard to understand their attraction. People love mountains and people love the sea, but rarely do they get them together, or in such generous proportions. Wherever I gazed were steep peaks, their summits snowy and ragged-toothed, their bases plunging into the deep indentations of the arctic sea. Nor was this any ordinary arctic sea. Other places in the world at the same high latitude - northern Alaska, Baffin Island, upper Siberia - are virtually unlivable. But here, dwarfed by this huge and untamed background, were snug seaside villages, neat homes and barns and boat-houses painted bright red and surrounded by green fields and flower gardens. The Lofotens are as full of life as Lapland is barren. When the rest of Scandinavia is shivering in sub-zero winter, there are parts of the Lofoten Islands that remain above freezing point. It is all due to that gigantic but invisible natural heat source, the Gulf Stream. On this particular day, though, not even the Gulf Stream was having an effect on the gale blowing in from the open ocean. It spanked up white-caps on the milky-blue fiords, lay dandelions flat against the ground and tugged at the cod-fish hanging by their thousands from wooden racks near the shore. Clouds rolled in and out, the sun advanced and fled. In the distance shifting fields of light played on sea and mountain snow. It made for a splendidly savage, wind-whipped day. Five of the seven islands that make up the twisted string of the Lofoten group are connected by bridge, tunnel or short ferry ride. Ahead of me lay 400km of superb scenery. I took my time; in the arctic summer, when the sun never sets, there is plenty of time. In the town of Svolvaer I bought an island guide at a bookshop and asked the attendant what people did through the long dark months of winter when the sun never rises. There are not that many possibilities, it seems. 'Shovel snow, drink beer, watch football and make babies,' she replied without a moment's reflection. In Sortland I spent a sleepless and sun-filled night in a hotel room where the curtains failed to keep out the light. Confusion continued when I came down to a vast Norwegian breakfast that was more like dinner: cheeses, meats, sliced vegetables and more kinds of herring - in brine, in vinegar or with curry or spicy tomato sauce - than I knew existed. In the village of Eggum on the 'outside' - the term islanders use for the rough unprotected waters of the open ocean - I spent an afternoon strolling the pebble beach to the sound of great arctic combers rolling in. In Nusfjord on the 'inside,' by the calm waters of West Fiord, I watched fishermen taking cod down from the drying racks; they may look like inedible slabs of timber but, rehydrated, they end up on the plates of southern Europeans who judge them a delicacy. The further out I went on the islands, the taller became the mountains, the wilder the landscape. Finally, on Moskenes, I stopped at the fishing huts of Sivert Sivertsen. Barrel-chested Sivertsen went to sea when he was 14 and has been fishing ever since. Arctic fishing, most of which takes place in the winter, is a gruelling, merciless profession and today, at 57, Sivertsen has slowed a little. In his 32ft boat, the Nyboen, he used to catch 40 tonnes of cod a year and more. Today, with a cod quota in force, he is only allowed to take 17 tonnes, and spends fewer weeks at sea. He fills in the extra time looking after guests in his rorbu and taking them out sports fishing. Rorbu are found in almost all seaside Lofoten villages. Small wooden huts built on piles over the water, they are used by fishermen in winter. In summer they are let out to tourists, and make some of the most comfortable and picturesque accommodation on the islands. I stayed a couple of days in one of Sivertsen's snug self-catering rorbu in the village of Reine, and found myself not wanting to leave. Outside, against the backdrop of the black mountain that hangs over the village, water lapped against the rocks, gulls cried and boats came and went. Inside, I sat in my little kitchen trying to figure out a way to cook a 6lb cod. When we set off in the Nyboen that morning, Sivertsen had told me that fish were not as numerous as they used to be. I had difficulty imagining how it used to be, for we had no sooner put a line over the side and begun jigging it up and down than we had a cod. I fried it in batter, and for the first time in my life found out how fish and chips should taste. I began thinking of ways to get fresh cod off the Lofoten Islands, out of Scandinavia and down to the little chippy at the end of my street in London. Information on the Lofoten Islands can be had by contacting the Lofoten Tourist Board, Svolvaer, Norway, tel: 7-60- 73000, fax: 7-60-73001. Rorbu accommodation can be difficult in high summer and should be booked beforehand. Sivert Sivertsen can be contacted in Reine on 7-60-92239.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Teen-age actress Drew Barrymore got into drinking because she wanted to imitate  relatives in the legendary Barrymore theater family, some of whom drank  heavily, she says in an interview to be broadcast Monday on ABC's "Good Morning  America." Barrymore, who was released just before Christmas from an alcohol  abuse rehabilitation center, says: "I wanted to be just like them so badly for  so long. They were all famous people of the theater and they were respected and  they were talented and, you know, they drank. Little did I know that it was  cool not to do it. . . . It became like a fashion and that's what I wanted to  be part of." The star of "E.T." says she started drinking at age 8, when she  downed a glass of champagne on a dare, then started using drugs at 11. "It was  easy to sneak out to night clubs and drink with friends. I really was a party  girl." Her advice to children tempted by drugs and alcohol: "Listen to other  people because I didn't and those people, a lot of those people, were right. No  matter how many times people would tell me or my friends, I did not want to  believe it until I had hit bottom, which I did." Barrymore claims her mother  didn't notice her alcohol problems partly because she used her acting talents  to hide it, and because her mother "didn't want to believe that I was doing it,  either."

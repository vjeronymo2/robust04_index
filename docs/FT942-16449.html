			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Japanese power struggle over new leadership: Impasse increases likelihood of another general election Japan's seven-party coalition government was yesterday close to breaking up, as it failed to resolve a bitter power struggle over the successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The impasse, over the policies and composition of the next government, increases the likelihood of another general election. This would paralyse the government as trade disputes with the US approach a critical juncture and as it struggles to implement an economic stimulus package, which is needed to pull Japan out of its worst recession since the second world war. Mr Hosokawa will stay on as a caretaker leader until a successor can be found. Coalition leaders did agree to try to form a new cabinet by mid-week, allowing the new prime minister to deliver a policy speech to parliament before the weekend. But a senior official of one party warned that any such administration would be transitional. Mr Hosokawa's decision to quit, announced on Friday, unleashed a new struggle among Japanese political parties, thrown into flux by last summer's defeat of the Liberal Democratic party. It has intensified the growing split between the coalition's right and left wings. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the conservative foreign minister, remained the most likely successor, with the apparent backing of Mr Hosokawa and three conservative parties giving a majority within the coalition. But left-wing coalition members voiced suspicion that Mr Hata would be the puppet of his powerful colleague Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist. Mr Ozawa's dominance over Mr Hosokawa has enraged the Social Democratic party, the alliance's largest member. Mr Ozawa and Mr Hata jointly lead the Japan Renewal party, or Shinseito, the second-largest coalition member, which has dominated foreign, trade, and economic policy, despite Socialist opposition. 'There is a lot of resistance to the idea of Shinseito taking control . . . If we are unable to form a strong government, then we let the people decide,' said Mr Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDP. Mr Hosokawa started the latest political realignment, shortly after announcing his resignation, by confirming the end of his own Japan New party's plans to merge with another coalition member, the New Harbinger party. He launched, instead, a new JNP-led group, called Reform, which was over the weekend positioning itself as the heart of a new right wing alliance, to embrace Mr Ozawa's JRP and the Buddhist-backed Komeito clean government party. About 10 members of parliament from Mr Hosokawa 's JNP - less than a third of the total - said they would defect because they did not like Mr Ozawa. The JHP, the JNP's former partners, led by Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and a fierce rival of Mr Ozawa, has meanwhile joined the left. Mr Hata called on sympathetic LDP members to join the alliance amid growing speculation that Mr Michio Watanabe, an LDP faction leader and former foreign minister, could lead such a defection and emerge as an alternative leader of a new conservative coalition. Mr Watanabe said he might consider 'playing a role'. Coalition members ended their weekend meetings as divided over the operating rules of a new government as over the party line-up. Mr Ozawa and his supporters want coalition members to agree common policies on the most important matters - like relations with the US, the threat from North Korea and tax reform - before choosing a new prime minister, to avoid the policy U-turns which have crippled the current government. This idea is anathema to the left. The Socialist party wants its members to be free to follow their own views. Skeleton in Hosokawa's cupboard may be a dummy, Page 6</p>

According to  Tshisekedi's government, the incursions are allegedly being  carried out with the complicity of Marshal Mobutu's Special  Division. This has caused a sudden rise in tension in this  region. Here is Christian Obadi Bangi, the deputy minister of  external relations in Tshisekedi's government, who comments on  the military maneuvers in the region.    [Begin Bangi recording] The legal government deplores this  military cooperation between the Zairian Armed Forces and units  of the Sudanese Government Army. This cooperation, which  typifies this association of evildoers, must be condemned by the  international community. The government notes that soldiers of  the Zairian Armed Forces visited the districts of (Nasco), Koya,  (Mori Boye), and Yambio in southern Sudan. Escorted by their  Sudanese counterparts, the Zairian soldiers looted livestock --  cattle, goats, and sheep -- in the zones under the control of  southern Sudanese People's Liberation Army.    In turn, the Sudanese soldiers were authorized to penetrate  into Zairian territory at Iri, (Botiama), Malembo, Owele, Rumu,  (Kargai di Baze) and (Kpori) in the Ituri District. They stole  foodstuffs from businessmen in the Haut Zaire Province and  kidnapped young girls to Sudan under the escort of their  accomplices from the Zairian Special Presidential Division.    The legal transitional government of the Republic of Zaire  vehemently condemns this barbarous behavior and calls on the UN  High Commission for Human Rights to form an international  commission of inquiry to establish the responsibility of each  side in this case.

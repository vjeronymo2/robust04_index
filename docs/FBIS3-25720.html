			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Talks in the Central African Republic between the  Chadian Government and the opposition rebels of Moise Tchiete  broke off yesterday without any spectacular breakthrough having  been achieved. No firm cease-fire has yet been signed. The two  parties have, however, agreed to meet again and keep their guns  under wraps for the time being. The government side is  relatively satisfied with the outcome. Earlier, Christophe  Boisbouvier spoke to Abderamane Izzo, the leader of the  government delegation in Bangui. In spite of the absence of a  cease-fire, he does not expect fighting to flare up again in the  south of the country.    [Begin recording] [Izzo] No, no, no. There will not be war.  There will not be war for the simple reason that we have  declared a unilateral cease-fire. On the other hand, there will  not be war because, as everyone heard yesterday, the president  of the CSNPD [Committee of National Revival for Peace and  Democracy] solemnly declared that his troops would not attack  the positions of the Chadian national army.    [Boisbouvier] There nevertheless remains a major stumbling  block with the issue of the referendum on federalism demanded by  the rebels and, it seems, rejected by you.    [Izza] Yes, listen, there is no way that having held just a  meeting here in Bangui we can sign a document here with a  minority, a tiny minority I would say, of the Chadian people on  such an important issue. We expect them to examine their own  consciences. [end recording]    As you heard, the question of federalism was not solved in  Bangui. Moise Tchiete, the leader of the southern rebel  movement, is nevertheless satisfied that the issue was discussed:    [Begin Tchiete recording] We are satisfied that the  fundamental problems, which had always been fudged, were  actually raised during these roundtable talks. I mean above all  the problem of federalism. The fundamental problem in Chad is a  above all a structural problem, a problem of cohabitation  between the different groups that make up the Chadian  population. You cannot forget the fact that we have been at war  for 34 years, and we cannot carry on fighting like this. We are  not closing the door to other groups, be they political,  political-military, or other. We expect that these groups might  also want to raise problems that are equally fundamental.

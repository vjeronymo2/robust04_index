			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President of the Presidency of the Republic </F> of Bosnia-Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic by an unidentified  correspondent for Croatian Television on 9 March; place not  given -- recorded]    [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, gave an interview to Croatian  Television today in which he spoke about the Washington  documents, the creation of a federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and the confederation with Croatia.    [Correspondent] There have not been any, or rather, there  have been very few reactions from Sarajevo to the Washington  preliminary agreement. How would you personally comment on  this, as it is of great interest to us?    [Izetbegovic] I believe that this was a good agreement.  Naturally, I was in contact with Dr. Silajdzic throughout the  entire duration of the negotiations in Washington -- I talked to  him two or three times a day. Therefore, the general agreement  that was created there was created with my full approval. So,  if you ask me for my comment, it is positive.    [Correspondent] It is often being said that the agreement  reached in Washington was extorted from you and President  Tudjman. Was the agreement truly reached out of political  interests or is this agreement a result of pressures and threats  from U.S. policy and the Islamic countries?    [Izetbegovic] In any case, this concerns our interests,  naturally, and I would not say that it was extorted. I would  like to remind you that I put forward almost an identical  proposal sometime last year; I believe that your press noted it.  On that occasion I proposed a joint state for the Muslims and  the Croats, stretching from the Sava River to the sea, without  borders, and perhaps with cantons. This agreement was not  extorted as regards myself and we saw our interest in it, of  course.    [Correspondent] We are facing the signing of an historic  agreement, as we perceive it here in Croatia, namely on the  federation of Croats and Bosniaks in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and on  the confederation of such a Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Republic  of Croatia. Is this a just end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Izetbegovic] I would be very happy if this were the end of  the war. It might be that it is the end of the war and I  believe that this is the end of the war -- I want to believe so  -- on those territories inhabited by Muslims and Croats.  However the end of the war now depends on the Serbian side.  You have used the expression, the attribute, federal. Well, I  would say that this will be a just end to the war. However, as  I have said, the end of the war on Bosnia-Herzegovina territory  now depends on the Serbian side.    [Correspondent] Before we touch upon the problem of the  relations [word indistinct] in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would like  to ask the following: Central Bosnia, Mostar, and the access to  the sea were the main problems. Are these issues resolved by  the preliminary agreement or [words indistinct] the problems  that could endanger the entire agreement?    [Izetbegovic] They have not been entirely resolved yet. To  my knowledge, their resolution is imminent, and perhaps this is  being discussed there [in Vienna] today. However, I do not  believe that they could threaten the agreement. You have  mentioned three problems -- Mostar, Central Bosnia, and the sea.    I think that Mostar has been temporarily resolved with the  concept of the European Union [EU] administration, and  therefore, by the EU administering the town temporarily. I  believe that this solution is good even though it is, of course,  not a final solution.    The issue of access to the sea has been resolved, too, I  believe, with the concept of confederation, by which the  federation would have access to the sea in Neum and would have  the use of the port of Ploce. Reciprocal arrangements have been  made here that envisage the free movement of goods and people  from Croatia via the territory of the federation, and naturally,  the free movement of goods and people from the federation toward  Ploce. This situation would be as though there were no borders.  I believe that this issue is resolved.    The very delicate issue of central Bosnia, however, remains.  As I understand it, there are some ideas that this issue be  resolved by establishing sub-cantons within the central Bosnian  canton. In any case, I believe that this is the most sensitive  question left. I think that it will be discussed today and  tomorrow and [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] What seems the biggest problem to you and  what makes you the most optimistic?    [Izetbegovic] I can say that with this agreement with the  Croats here in Bosnia-Herzegovina and with the agreement between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia as states -- naturally they have  not been signed yet [words indistinct] but we are on the best  way to sign them -- we have definitely made a giant step toward  peace. However, an (?open) issue of the behavior of the Serbs  remains. I can not forecast their behavior no matter how hard I  try, and therefore, I could not answer whether peace is a matter  of a month or two. However, I have a sort of premonition that  [passage indistinct].</p>

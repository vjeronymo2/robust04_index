			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Jiang set to raise profile with tour When President Jiang Zemin of China arrives in Moscow today at the start of a four-day visit, his purpose will be twofold: he will be seeking to promote a closer commercial and strategic partnership with Russia and at the same time boosting his own stock on the international stage. With China in a transitional phase in preparation for a new generation of leaders (Mr Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, is in failing health), it is important for Mr Jiang to assume the aura of an international figure. His visit to Moscow, and subsequently to Ukraine and France, is part of attempts to bolster his appeal. It follows his appearance at the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum in Seattle last November, which was also aimed at enhancing his credibility at home and abroad. Mr Jiang is due to initial a document on border demarcation in the remote western region of China and sign an accord in which the two countries agree not to target each other with nuclear missiles. All this is a far cry from the tension between the communist giants in the early 1960s, which led to a brief border war and frequent skirmishes. When Mr Jiang initials the border agreement, 99 per cent of border disputes will have been resolved, according to an official Xinhua news agency despatch. The two sides will also sign a communique aimed at providing a framework for development of political and commercial ties into the next century. While two-way trade at Dollars 2.245bn (Pounds 1.46bn) for the first six months of this year is down 39 per cent on the same period last year, Beijing and Moscow envisage the continued development of a substantial trading relationship. Two-way trade reached Dollars 7.68bn last year, an increase of 30 per cent over the year before, making Russia China's seventh largest trading partner. Exchanges this year have been hit by a 50 per cent slump in the first six months in border trade because of disagreements over customs and immigration issues. Russia is proving sensitive to a flood of Chinese traders moving across the border into its far-eastern regions. Russian officials fear this is a form of 'colonisation', with the Chinese over-staying their visas. 'This situation is not good and should be corrected or stopped,' Mr Jiang told Russian reporters in Beijing this week, but he added, using a Chinese idiom: 'These are only problems in the course of development. We should not give up eating for fear of choking.' Mr Jiang's visit to Moscow follows increasingly frequent contacts between Chinese and Russian officials in the past year or so. Russian visitors to China this year included Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister. China's foreign minister, Mr Qian Qichen and the defence minister, Mr Chi Haotian, both visited Moscow this year. China and Russia are seeking to extend their defence co-operation, with the Chinese pressing the Russians to supply technology for a fighter aircraft. China has also been a big purchaser of Russian defence equipment, with orders for 26 Su27 fighters, and plans for another squadron.</p>

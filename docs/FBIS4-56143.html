			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 26 May (MTI) -- Five of the six parties  that qualified themselves for the next parliament in the first  round of the general elections on May 8 have published electoral  manifestos for the May 29 second round, urging all eligible  voters to turn out for the vote.    Such manifestos have been published by the Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP), the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ),  the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the Independent  Smallholders Party (FKGP), and the Christian Democratic People's  Party (KDNP). The sixth parliamentary party, the Federation of  Young Democrats (Fidesz), did not disclose such a document.    The MSZP, front-runners in the elections with 32.96 percent  of party list votes, states in its manifesto, "on May 8  Hungarians voted for a change and a new government because the  right-wing coalition failed to properly utilize the  authorization it received four years ago. The coalition was  unable to solve the country's economic problems, which were  aggravated over the past few years.    "The MSZP champions social peace and general consensus, and  strives to form a coalition government. It is convinced that  the governing parties should implement their programs and fulfil  their promises as equal partners. To this effect, the  Socialists are prepared to accept all reasonable compromises.  They propose continuous coordination and cooperation between  the next government, and the employer and employee organizations  to lead the country out of the crisis," the manifesto says.    The Alliance of Free Democrats, which finished in the first  round in second place, with 19.76 percent of party list votes,  says in its manifesto, "the SZDSZ presses for a multi-party  government to be formed whose policy attracts all political  forces committed to civil democratic values and helps form  balanced political power relations.    "Should the party's prime ministerial candidate Gabor Kuncze  be in the position to form a government, expertise may come to  power. The Free Democrats wish to put an end to squabbling and  to the political and emotional division of society. The SZDSZ  is a centrist party which is able to integrate differing  interests. The Free Democrats wish to eliminate corruption and  lavish central spending in order to boost economic growth,  create new jobs, and guarantee independence of the press,  education and churches."    The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the senior governing  coalition party which won 11.73 percent of party list votes in  the first round, says in its manifesto, "on May 8 the majority  of voters decided that the MDF should play the role of  parliamentary opposition during the next four years. The stake  of the second round is whether the MDF will be in a strong or a  formal oppositional position. Preparing for the role of the  strongest opposition party, the MDF seeks to preserve the values  and results created in the past four years, and represent the  interests of those who received compensation for their past  grievances and those who acquired property, to ensure that  private property should not be threatened in the future by  nationalization or expropriation."    The Independent Smallholders Party, which received 8.85  percent of votes cast for party lists in the first round of  elections on May 8, puts down its aims in the following points:  No more policy seeking to exploit the people; humanity,  security of existence, legal security; a pact-free policy  resting on national bases, democracy based on guarantees; a  president of the republic directly elected by the people; an  unbiased and authentic press, radio and television committed to  the nation; a Hungary free from corruption and mafias; education  based on Christian morals, universal values, and domestic  intellectual traditions.    According to the FKGP's appeal, Hungary's economic and  cultural renewal may only begin when it is also possible for the  smallest village to develop.    The document stresses crossable borders instead of border  disputes, as well as peaceful political diplomacy between  Carpathian nations.    The Christian Democratic People's Party, with 7.06 percent  of  party list votes, points out in its appeal: Most electors going  to the polls in the first round of this year's parliamentary  elections decided not to choose the current ruling coalition but  the opposition parties whose situation is easier and can,  therefore, promise more.    Quoting successes achieved by European Christian Democratic  parties over the past 50 years in setting up social market  economies, the KDNP says this is the only road that can lead to  Hungary's economic, social and cultural rise.    The second round of elections will decide whether Parliament  continues with balanced power relations, and whether the  opposition is able to exercise effective control over the ruling  parties. This can be ensured by Conservative-Christian forces  over the next four years, the KDNP appeal states.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Letter: Incentives for private rented housing sector Sir, A revitalised private rented sector providing good quality, secure accommodation, with an expanding social housing sector and the provision of more varied access routes to owner-occupation, could help solve Britain's housing crisis. Your review of the options that the government may pursue so as to encourage a revival of private rented sector is thus timely ('In search of the private landlord', June 1). Private investment into private renting will not be forthcoming unless investors are assured of an adequate return. The mechanisms by which such a return could be offered to potential investors should, however, be designed so as not to divert public resources away from the core social housing programme. If private landlords were able to bid for capital grants, the likelihood would be that housing association provision of new accommodation for the homeless and other priority groups would consequentially diminish at great human and financial cost. Thus, taxation concessions rather than grants should help provide a net return sufficiently attractive to potential investors who may be interested in investing index-linked and other long-term funds in the tenure. Landlord returns should also relate to a long-term rental income stream, not short-term capital gains. A reliance on a return from capital gains presupposes lack of security for tenants. Any successor to the Business Enterprise Scheme should, therefore, reward investors looking for a long-term return rather than wishing to exit after five years. The first combined expenditure and revenue Budget in November would be a fitting backdrop for the new chancellor to announce targeted taxation concessions designed to encourage financial institutions to invest in private rented accommodation. A process of learning and doing through pilot demonstration projects rather than abstract conjecture will aid progress.

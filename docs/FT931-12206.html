			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers try to calm fears over army cuts SENIOR ministers were yesterday working to calm fears among Conservative backbenchers that British armed forces are dangerously overstretched worldwide, stressing that there is no need to review the planned Options for Change programme of defence cuts. With speculation rising that the UK will be asked formally to police any United Nations ceasefire in Bosnia, Mr Malcolm Rifkind has privately told Tory MPs that the UK has the resources to meet its current commitments without reversing the cuts. The defence secretary, working to allay fears of further British involvement in the crisis, is letting it be known that the UK cannot envisage taking on a major peacekeeping role without a parallel commitment of US ground forces  -a development thought highly unlikely at present. However, in an effort to placate opponents of the cuts in the army's infantry strength, the defence secretary is also insisting that both the timetable and exact prescriptions for Options for Change have always included a measure of flexibility within the Pounds 24bn defence budget. Meanwhile, pressure is mounting from critics of the document for a government rethink. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence committee which is preparing a report on the issue, yesterday urged the government to reverse at least some of the cuts. Under Options for Change, the Army would be reduced by 40,000 to 116,000, and the number of infantry battalions from 55 to 38.</p>

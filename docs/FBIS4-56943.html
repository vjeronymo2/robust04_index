			<p>BFN     [Text] (DYN) -- The balance of trade in the first two  months this year produced a massive deficit of 1.11 billion  dollars, an almost ninefold increase over the same period last  year, the INDEC census bureau reported yesterday.    Exports during the period totalled 1.89 billion dollars, a  4.4 percent increase over the same period last year. Imports  however grew by 55.2 percent and totalled just over three  billion dollars.    The trade imbalance with the United States shot up by 132.3  percent while the only surplus of note was achieved in trade  with the Netherlands (117 million dollars).    Although there were small surpluses on trade with individual  countries, in most cases these didn't exceed 10 million dollars  as was the case with Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru,  Venezuela, Denmark, Greece, Portugal and China.    Trade with the Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  southern-cone common market went from a 5.1-million-dollar  surplus in January-February 1993 to a deficit 152.8 million  dollars in the same period this year. Trade with NAFTA followed  the same trend and shot up 135 percent to 638 million dollars.    Exports of primary products continued to decline in the  first  two months, falling 19.6 percent with respect to the same period  last year, although exports of value-added agricultural goods  grew by 7.1 percent and industrial goods by 27.6 percent.    Percentage increases in imports by product grouping were  114.7 for capital goods and 38.6 percent for their spare parts  and 30.5 percent for consumer goods, almost five times the  growth rate of the gross domestic product.    Capital goods accounted for 40 percent of imports in January  and 47.4 percent in February while consumer goods accounted for  18.7 percent of imports in the first month of the year and 15.6  percent in the second. Imports of semi-processed goods also  increased by 34.4 percent as did buses, up 37.2 percent and  fuels up by 178.4 percent.    Most of the imported goods, or some 838.2 million dollars  worth, came from the United States although Argentina's sales  there were only a quarter of this. The deficit with Brazil, at  175 million dollars, was up by a whopping 501.4 percent.</p>

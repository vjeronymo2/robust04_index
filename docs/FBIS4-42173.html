			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Colin Brown and Patricia Wynn Davies article: "Labour Will </F> Pick Its New Leader in July"]    [Text] An early election for the Labour leadership will be  ordered on Wednesday [25 May] by the party's national executive  committee (NEC) to preserve John Smith's "legacy" of party unity.    The successor to Mr Smith, who was buried on Saturday on the  Scottish island of Iona, will be "crowned" in late July. The  party leadership will face protests from left-wingers who want  to delay until the annual party conference in October, but it  believes a swift election will unite Labour for its summer  offensive on the Government.    The campaign will officially begin on June 10, immediately  after the European elections, but the campaign teams are already  in action. Gordon Brown yesterday put down a clear marker for  the leadership with a speech in Wales setting out his own vision  for the future of the Labour Party. It was coupled with a  strong plea for party unity.    ``We have too much to do together in the service of our  country for us to hesitate or fail now in our task. We have  journeyed, climbed, struggled and worked together too long for  any discord to come between us and our goal.    ``Labour is the party that, itself united, is ready to unite  this country,'' Mr Brown said at the Welsh Labour conference in  Swansea.    Some on the left suspect a leadership fix. Activists in  Wales feared the party was being bounced by the media support  for Tony Blair. They believe a early contest will help Mr Blair  or Mr Brown, and leave candidates from the left, such as John  Prescott and Robin Cook, too little time to campaign on the  issues, such as full employment, which John Edmonds, the GMB  [General, Municipal and Boilermakers] union leader, put forward  as a litmus test for leading Labour.    Sources said a July election is supported by David Blunkett,  this year's party chairman; Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader;  Larry Whitty, the general secretary of the party; and key trade  union leaders on the NEC.    "We have to preserve John Smith's legacy of unity and  strength. We want a short and effective leadership contest. We  don't want to break up the unity in the party," said one senior  Labour source.    Party unity may be put to the test amid growing signs that  Mr  Brown and Mr Blair may be forced to fight each other in the new  transferable-vote ballots. While Mr Brown left trade unionists  and party activists in no doubt of his leadership qualities.  there were few signs it would stop the momentum behind Mr  Blair. Support for him has steadily grown in the Shadow Cabinet.    Mr Blair's hopes were boosted yesterday by a poll in THE  SUNDAY POST which put him ahead even in Scotland, Mr Brown's  political base. The poll showed 37.3 per cent of voters  favoured Mr Blair against 32.7 per cent for Mr Brown.    Calls to delay the Labour contest were led by The Campaign  Group of left-wing Labour MPs.    Mr Blunkett, speaking on BBC radio, rejected warnings by  John  Evans, the Labour MP, who had told fellow members of the NEC  that a July election may risk a legal chalenge, because of the  practical difficulties in balloting thousands of constituency  members and trade union levy payers.    "We will not be putting forward options that cannot be  carried out, which do not fit the constitution of the Labour  Party. We will all know what the issues are and above all, the  style of leadership which will pull us together," Mr Blunkett  said.    The bookmakers William Hill made Mr Blair the 2-5 favourite;  Gordon Brown 3-1; John Prescott 4-l; Robin Cook 14-1; Margaret  Beckett 25-1; Jack Cunningham 50-1 and Neil Kinnock 100-1.</p>

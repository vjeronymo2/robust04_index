			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram expected to lose Rooney and advisers SPRING RAM, the bathrooms and kitchens group, is expected to announce today sweeping changes to its advisers. The accounting firm Price Waterhouse is likely to take over the audit from Arthur Andersen, while Barclays de Zoete Wedd are set to replace Panmure Gordon as brokers. These moves anticipate the climax in the group's long-running crisis expected to be reached later this week with the exit of Mr Bill Rooney, one of the founders of the company and its biggest shareholder. On Wednesday the group will announce interim results. Unofficial market estimates of the loss have grown from Pounds 25m a few weeks ago to as much as Pounds 40m. Such a result could trigger Mr Rooney's departure, along with other senior directors. At the same time Mr Roger Regan, who was appointed chairman at the end of July, is due to unveil his promised operational review, alongside a full financial review from Price Waterhouse. Mr Rooney, who still holds a 16 per cent stake, lost his job as executive chairman to Mr Regan, a building industry veteran. Mr Regan was approached by investment institutions, led by Prudential Corporation, after the West Yorkshire-based company issued three profit warnings within eight months, causing a collapse in the share price. Although Mr Rooney has continued as chief executive working alongside Mr Regan on a trial basis, the new chairman has enough votes on the board to sack him. Inconclusive bid talks last month, were followed by growing tension at board level.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Markets: Inflation puts Fed back in the spotlight - Wall Street ALL EYES are back on the Federal Reserve after this week's worrying inflation numbers. It seems a long time since Wall Street has had the Fed in its sights. The last time the central bank fiddled with monetary policy was September last year, when it lowered the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 3 per cent. And the last time the Fed made anything like a meaningful move was back in July 1992, when it cut the discount rate by half a percentage point to 3 per cent. In the intervening months, the stock and bond markets have had little reason to think about the Fed. Instead, the presidential election, rebounding corporate earnings, an increasingly muddled economic picture, the Clinton fiscal stimulus package and first budget, the restructuring of the Treasury debt, even the war in Bosnia, have all grabbed the attention of the markets at one time or another. In fact, since last autumn, the only time the Fed has really captured the markets' imagination was when its chairman, Alan Greenspan, sat next to Hillary Rodham Clinton at her husband's first State of the Union address to Congress, an extraordinary sight that thoroughly confused Washington DC and Wall Street alike. The markets get nervous enough when they see the President and the Fed chairman together, for a politicised central bank is the last thing Wall Street needs. But the First Lady and the Fed chairman together, in apparent harmony? Many minds boggled. Now, however, the Fed is back in the spotlight, and sweating uncomfortably under an inflationary glare that suddenly and unexpectedly intensified this week. On Wednesday the April producer prices index was released, and it was up 0.6 per cent on the month. A day later came the consumer prices index - it was up 0.4 per cent. Not only were both sets of headline data stronger than analysts' had expected, but the 'core' measures of producer and consumer price inflation, which exclude the volatile food and energy components, were also above Wall Street's estimates. The figures sparked heavy selling in the bond market, where the 30-year bond yield jumped from 6.81 per cent to 6.97 per cent in just two days. Although the stock markets managed to shrug off the producer prices number, and even pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record high on Thursday, they could not ignore the rise in consumer prices. It was the third report out of the last four that has shown monthly consumer prices rising faster than expected. Last year consumer prices rose 2.9 per cent - so far this year, they are rising at an annual rate of 4.3 per cent. This should worry the Fed, which in its annual report to Congress in February predicted that the CPI would rise somewhere between 2.5 per cent and 2.75 per cent this year. With a third of the year already out of the way, and an economy that is still growing (albeit at a sluggish pace), it now appears unlikely that the Fed's target range for the CPI will be reached. This means that the Fed either will have to come up with a new, higher target, or it will have to tighten monetary policy to slow the pace of economic activity and bring the rate back to within its current range. Greenspan and other Fed chiefs have in the past talked of getting inflation down to near zero, so the latter course is the one more likely to be pursued. All of this is important for the stock markets. Low interest rates have been the single most powerful factor at play in the markets over the past two years. They have sustained stocks when the state of the economy and corporate earnings have not justified prices at their high valuations. Low rates have worked wonders by lowering the cost of capital for corporations, and by squeezing investors out of low-yielding short-term financial assets such as certificates of deposit and money market funds, and into equities. If interest rates go up, the flow of investor funds from fixed-interest assets into stocks could reverse. Higher rates would also force investors to revise their expectations of economic growth and corporate profitability. With prices struggling to hold their ground at or near their all-time highs, the markets' fall could be precipitous. The big question is: will the Fed have the courage to raise interest rates this year, especially now that the chairman and Hillary Clinton are such good chums?  ------------------------------- Monday     3443.28  +   6.09 Tuesday    3468.75  +  25.47 Wednesday  3482.31  +  13.56 Thursday   3447.99  -  34.32 Friday     3443.01  -   4.98  -------------------------------</p>

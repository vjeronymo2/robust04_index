			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Energy contract accepted by eastern Germany THE partial privatisation of east Germany's electricity sector has been brought a step nearer following the removal of the last remaining obstacle to the Stromvertrag, or energy contract. Boizenberg, a small town in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, has decided to accept the Stromvertrag, signed in August 1990 between the then two German states. It was the last of 164 local councils to hold out against implementation. The agreement ends a two-year-old battle by eastern councils to challenge the contract, which in effect creates an energy monopoly in the five new states. The acceptance of the Stromvertrag by eastern Germany's municipalities will allow the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising east German industry, to press ahead with the partial privatisation of the region's 15 regional utilities. But the Treuhand's ability to use privatisation to introduce more competition in eastern Germany's electricity sector is restricted by the contract. The Stromvertrag allows local councils to own 49 per cent of all eastern Germany's regional utilities. The remaining 51 per cent is divided between western Germany's eight utilities, which are currently negotiating the purchase of that stake from the Treuhand. The Stromvertrag also gave western Germany's eight utilities a 100 per cent stake in Veag, east Germany's high voltage grid. Veag will be privatised by the Treuhand later this year. The eight western utility companies have insisted that the east's regional utilities must buy 70 per cent of their power from Veag over the next 20 years in order to cover the large investments. They are only free to generate 30 per cent of their local energy needs. Several councils challenged the monopolistic implications of the Stromvertrag. Constitutionally, they argued they had a right to a full 100 per cent access to the assets of the regional utilities - or else compensation - because they owned them until they were expropriated by the east German communist state in 1952. The compromise allows the councils to sell their 49 per cent stake in the regional utilities in return for access to their assets. Other cities, and then the eight west German utilities will have first option to obtain the shares.</p>

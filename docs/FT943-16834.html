			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Claes may face court Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, could be summoned to the high court to answer questions in the Inusop affair, involving the alleged secret funding of political parties, writes Emma Tucker from Brussels. Mr Charles Nothomb, speaker of the parliament, said a committee of deputies would decide whether the Inusop evidence was serious enough to merit lifting Mr Claes' parliamentary immunity. Mr Philippe Moureaux, a former socialist minister, and Mr Guy Coeme, former deputy premier, may also face questioning.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Bolivia plans far-reaching privatisation Bolivia yesterday set in motion one of South America's most ingenious privatisation programmes. The new government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada sent to congress a bill to authorise the transfer of six state companies to private investors and to Bolivia's 3.2m adults, in a scheme inspired by eastern Europe's mass privatisations. Mr Ramiro Ortega, the official overseeing the programme, said it would 'generate an investment shock for Bolivia, generate jobs and double-digit growth within two years'. Bolivia is South America's poorest country but has been in the vanguard of economic reform since it defeated hyperinflation in 1985, when Mr Sanchez de Lozada, a millionaire businessman, was finance minister. Mr Ortega said that, under the scheme, long-term investors selected through an international bidding process would take up to half the equity in each company without payment. They would, however, have to agree to invest heavily in them and sign a long-term performance agreement. Ownership of the remaining shares will be divided among the population free of charge, but will be held in private pension funds. These funds are meant to provide a minimum retirement income as well as to galvanise Bolivia's rudimentary capital markets and improve access by private companies to long-term finance. Electricity and telecommunications companies are the first candidates for the scheme, followed by the state railways, an ironworks, the YPFB oil and gas corporation, and the international airline LAB. There will be no restriction on foreign investors. Companies will be transferred free of debt and environmental and labour liabilities. They employ about 3,000 people and management could sack staff, with severance charges paid by the government. The draft law sent to Congress yesterday will be followed by further measures to create regulatory frameworks, abolish legal monopolies and specify each company's privatisation mechanism. The government is confident its majority in Congress will ensure the bills' rapid passage. Mr Ortega says the scheme will draw Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) into Bolivia over three years, an annual capital inflow equivalent to about 20 per cent of GDP. He forecast this would treble the growth rate to 10-12 per cent a year and cut unemployment and underemployment by two-thirds, from 30 per cent now.</p>

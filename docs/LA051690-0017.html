			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE OFFICIALS CONTINUE AERIAL SPRAYING AGAINST PESKY MEDFLY  </P> <P> You say you don't like being sprayed with malathion? There is a solution to the  problem: move into the Crystal Cathedral or masquerade as a giant kangaroo rat.  Both have been exempted from spraying.  </P> <P> You resent paying for the spraying and paying again for the fruit when it comes  to market? Never mind, chalk it up to another bureaucratic bungle that has  turned out to be expensive, ineffective and ironically, unscientific.  </P> <P> You ask why haven't we taken the advice of top entomological experts on how to  control the Medfly? It seems that fruit growers and the State Department of  Agriculture would rather go "by guess and by golly."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back at the ranch, there are no ladybugs, no bees, etc.  </P> <P> GERD ABEGGLEN  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

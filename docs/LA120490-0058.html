			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIFEGUARD HIT BY BOAT WHILE DIVING  </P> <P> A 39-year-old San Clemente lifeguard suffered a severe cut in his left arm  Monday morning when a boat struck him as he was skin-diving off San Clemente  State Beach.  </P> <P> Michael Edward Brousard underwent emergency surgery at Samaritan Medical  Center-San Clemente to repair a 10-inch cut that pierced an artery and veins in  the tricep, said Richard Stone, the hospital's nursing supervisor.  </P> <P> Brousard was struck by a 22-foot outboard motor boat driven by Philip Edwards,  52, of San Clemente, according to the Sheriff's Department. Edwards told  deputies he was traveling south about 300 feet from shore about 9:45 a.m. when  he felt a bump that turned out to be Brousard.  </P> <P> Edwards pulled Brousard aboard the boat and took him to lifeguards at San  Clemente Pier.  </P> <P> Brousard said he heard a boat approaching while diving in about 15 feet of  water and was hit after he surfaced so he could be seen.  </P></p>

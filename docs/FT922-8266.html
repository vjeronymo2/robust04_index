			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Work on Edinburgh opera house starts WORK started yesterday on a Pounds 16.6m project to create an opera house in Edinburgh. It is expected to be ready in time for the 1994 Edinburgh International Festival. The project involves the conversion of the large Empire Theatre, last used as a bingo hall. Mr George Younger, chairman of the Empire Theatre Trust - which is leading the project - said sufficient finance from the public and private sectors was in place. Bovis has been awarded a Pounds 12m contract as managing contractor. Mr Younger, who is also chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, said the opera house would cost about Pounds 20m, including the Pounds 3.5m which Edinburgh District Council had paid for the Empire Theatre. The public sector is contributing Pounds 15.6m through councils, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise, the Scottish Tourist Board, Historic Scotland and the Scottish Arts Council. About Pounds 2.4m towards a Pounds 4m target has so far been raised from the private sector, with contributions coming from banks and United Distillers.</p>

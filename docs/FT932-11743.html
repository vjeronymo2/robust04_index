			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Speaker ponders Maastricht course MISS Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the Commons, will consider over the weekend which amendments to the Maastricht legislation should be chosen for debate and vote on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week when MPs resume their detailed discussion of the bill. She will announce her decisions on Tuesday. The most contentious question is whether she will allow MPs to vote on an amendment, which has attracted wide support from opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics, to exclude from the bill the social protocol, which contains both the social chapter and the UK's 'opt-out' from it.</p>

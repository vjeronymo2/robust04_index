			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] is busily  making behind-the-scenes efforts to help China join the General  Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at an early date. The  agreement, which was reached at the new multilateral talks (of  the Uruguay round) last December, was originally scheduled to be  put into force in July 1995; however, moves to put the agreement  into effect six months earlier than scheduled have been noted.  Thus, when the factor of time is taken into consideration, it  will be difficult for GATT to approve China's membership.    China regards its participation in GATT as an important step  in joining the framework of economic regulations of the  international community. And, in a bid to win membership, China  has started making preparations. For example, it is busily  engaged in talks on tariff cuts with various nations and in  trying to work out a unified exchange rate for the Yuan. Once  the agreement reached at the Uruguay round becomes effective,  GATT will be changed into the new WTO (World Trade  Organization). However, if China's membership is not approved  before the WTO's inauguration, "China will be forced to start  its membership application over again after the WTO's  inauguration and would fall behind schedule by a wide margin in  obtaining GATT membership," (as stated by a MOFA source).    The United States has proposed putting the Uruguay round  agreement into effect six months earlier than originally  scheduled because it believes there will be no problem in  getting ratification from Congress. Moreover, the EU (European  Union) intends, in principle, to agree to this proposal. China  will hold bilateral working-level negotiations in Geneva as  early as 20 March in a bid to win GATT membership. However, if  the agreement should be put into effect earlier than originally  scheduled, it is expected China will have difficulties in  obtaining approval for membership.    As far as Japan is concerned, it believes: "If China's  participation in GATT is delayed, Taiwan, which is scheduled to  join GATT at the same time as China, will also be affected",  (according to the same source). Therefore, Japan is concerned  over the possibility that China and Taiwan, which now impose a  serious influence on economic activities in East Asia, will be  kept out of the GATT system. Japan plans to make greater  behind-the-scenes efforts to urge European countries and the  United States to cooperate in giving their approval -- as early  as at the ministerial conference to sign the agreement to be  held in Morocco in mid-April. Moreover, Japan is studying the  possibility of indicating its stance of opposing the plan to put  the Uruguay round agreement into effect earlier than originally  scheduled.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Premier Lien Chan with foreign and </F> domestic correspondents at the Government Information Office in  Taipei on 4 February]    [Text] Yesterday, Executive Yuan President Lien Chan held  a year-end news conference at which he answered 17 questions  raised by domestic and foreign correspondents; the news  conference lasted 65 minutes.    In response to relevant questions, Premier Lien noted: To  develop cross-strait relations, the two sides should assume a  pragmatic and rational attitude and seek common ground despite  the fact that the country is divided and administered  separately; otherwise, it will be hard for the hope for  favorable interaction to materialize. On the Chiao-Tang talks  currently underway on the mainland, Premier Lien emphasized:  Instead of merely stating their positions, the two sides should  adopt a problem-solving approach during the talks. At present,  we must patiently confront differences that may arise, maintain  our basic positions, and continue our efforts.    Lien Chan, who has been in office for nearly a year, also  fielded questions raised by correspondents on the mainland,  internal affairs, foreign affairs, financial affairs, and  constitutional reforms. The following is what happened at the  news conference:    Accompanied by Li Hou-kao, secretary general of the  Executive  Yuan, and Hu Chih-chiang, director general of the Government  Information Office, Lien Chan entered the site of the news  conference at 0830 GMT. He first extended New Year's greetings  to the correspondents present and thanked the people in all  circles for their efforts to encourage and supervise his cabinet  over the past year. Thereafter, he began the hour-long news  conference.    [Correspondent] Building Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific  business hub is currently the government's major plan. Planning  is quite complete in this regard. Mr. Premier, would you please  explain all the specifics? Moreover, Taiwan cannot possibly  exclude Communist China if it becomes a free trade area as a  result of this plan. The question of direct shipping and air  services between designated areas on the two sides of the Taiwan  Strait will also be raised. Mr. Premier, what are your views on  this matter?    [Lien Chan] The Asia-Pacific region achieved an average  economic growth rate of 4.5 percent in recent years, which was  the fastest economic growth in the world over the past few  years. Its total output of goods and services represented about  half the world's total output. The region is bound to become  the focus of the world economy in the future.    The Republic of China [ROC] on Taiwan has the following  advantages to become an Asia-Pacific business hub: 1) an  excellent geographical environment; 2) excellent economic  conditions; 3) ample and high-quality manpower; and 4)  abundant capital markets. The government hopes to complete  planning as soon as possible. It is expected that planning will  be completed by the middle of this year.    Why should we so actively promote the ROC as a business hub?  This is because, aside from the two traditional Asian business  hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore, Japan's Osaka, Shanghai's  Putung [Pudong] in Mainland China, Australia's Sydney, and New  Zealand all are making similar preparations and attempts. Even  Subic in the Philippines hopes for a piece of the action. We  must work against time; otherwise, we will lose our development  opportunities in three to five years. To be sure, we must also  strengthen local construction. For example, our public  facilities are still inadequate. That is why we proposed the 12  construction projects to beef up our public facilities. Also,  we should make great efforts to supplement our financial and  legal systems with legislative work.  <H3>  We Cannot Consider Things on Purely Economic Grounds; the  Time Is Not Ripe for Direct Cross-Strait Shipping and Air  Services </H3>   With regard to direct air and shipping services between  designated areas on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the  government has always placed importance on the question of the  three cross-strait exchanges [mail, shipping and air services,  and trade], listing them as long- and medium-range goals in the  National Unification Program. We hope to attain these goals to  facilitate economic and social development on both sides of the  Taiwan Strait. Politically speaking, however, we must reach a  common understanding with Communist China on treating us as an  equal political entity, renouncing the use of armed force  against us, and allowing us room for developing international  relations before we can further discuss the question of three  exchanges. Otherwise, the time is not ripe for solving complex  problems within a purely economic context by initiating direct  air and shipping services between designated areas on the two  sides of the Taiwan Strait.    In reality, Communist China, in its white paper on Taiwan  released last year, maintained that we should obtain their  consent prior to signing any agreements on shipping and air  rights with other countries. If cross-strait shipping and air  services can be considered on purely economic grounds, why did  Communist China's white paper contain such a statement?  Personally, I do not think the time is ripe for direct shipping  and air services between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.    [Correspondent] A final decision on the plan for  readjusting the pay of military, government, and educational  personnel in 1995 is imminent. People are very concerned.  Premier, would you please give us a clear explanation in this  regard?    [Lien] This matter is to be settled at a final meeting  scheduled for Saturday [5 February]. However, I would like to  take advantage of this rare opportunity to offer some specific  explanations.    Pay readjustment for military, government, and educational  personnel is a policy matter about which the government is very  concerned. We have to take into consideration the government's  financial capacity, inflation indexes, the competitiveness of  the private-sector, and the material well-being and morale of  government employees. The consumer price index, which rose 2.9  percent last year, is expected to rise 3.4 percent this year.  Therefore, a raise of about 3 percent should be appropriate.  The Personnel Administrative Bureau has submitted two plans.  Personally, I am inclined to adopt the 3-percent raise in  drafting the budget.    [Correspondent] What are your expectations of the ongoing  talks in Peiking [Beijing] on routine affairs between the  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] and  the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF]? If the two sides are  unable to reach agreement on some routine issues after extended  discussions, will the government consider modifying its mainland  policy? Will this lead even to a reduction in cross-strait  exchanges?    [Lien] SEF-ARATS discussions on routine affairs constitute a  link of our overall policy toward the mainland. Today,  development of cross-strait relations depends on the two sides  taking a pragmatic and reasonable approach toward the reality of  a divided nation and divided rules and seeking a common ground  from this reality. Without such an understanding, a relation of  constructive mutual engagement [liang xing hu dong 5328 1840  0062 0520] between the two sides will remain unattainable.    The current SEF mission left for the mainland in the hope of  following up on the five understandings reached at the Ku-Wang  talks and reaching an agreement. We will certainly welcome any  agreement on fishing disputes or repatriation of hijackers and  people who illegally enter Taiwan that is reached at the ongoing  talks in Peiping. Certainly, some of these issues require us to  tackle them with patience.    [Correspondent] Presidential adviser Li Kuo-ting  recently questioned the feasibility of the plan for building an  east-west superhighway. What do you think of such  criticism?    [Lien] We should indeed care about government finances. Not  only those in the government but people at large should show  concern. When I assumed office last year, the government debt  stood at NT$1,060 billion [new Taiwan dollars] and the balance  in the annual budget was a mere NT$100 million; the situation  was extremely difficult. We took a variety of emergency  measures, and, as a result, the budget deficit has dropped to  NT$84.9 billion and the balance in the annual budget has risen  to NT$23.3 billion. However, because the universal health  insurance services that will come into effect this year, the  budget for public welfare spending for 1994 will double that of  last year. This, plus a pay raise of military, government, and  educational personnel, increased budgetary spending on education  and science and weaponry purchases; there probably will be a  NT$400 billion shortfall in this year's budget.    The government must also take the whole situation in  consideration. On one hand, it must reduce spending, halt  inappropriate public investment, and reduce waste; on the other  hand, it must seriously consider all projects -- such as those  for developing towns and cities and for regional balance -- that  have a direct bearing on the people. Therefore, the east-west  superhighway was given emphasis in the Six-Year National  Development Plan. Often, only 60 percent of six-year plans are  completed. Therefore, proper emphasis on priority projects will  have a positive impact on national development and economic  growth.    In response to calls from various quarters, the provincial  government undertook, seven or eight years ago, a study and  adopted the highway project. A feasibility study of the  east-west superhighway project was conducted in 1990 and a  project assessment was made in 1993. There is a thick file of  materials about the two studies. Everyone is welcome to look  through it.    More assessment will be needed in regard to the project's  environmental impact and financing. When all the conditions --  environment, financing, technical capability, and private-sector  participation -- are in place, we should push forward with this  project.    [Correspondent] The idea of "two China's as a phase"  forwarded by Economics Minister Chiang Ping-kun at the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] meeting has won  widespread approval. I would like to know how would you, the  premier, advance this policy in the future?    [Lien] The one-China policy is the nation's fundamental  policy, but China is currently divided. The ROC is a sovereign  nation founded in 1912, but currently the ROC holds the power of  rule only over Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu, and Chinmen. This is the  general environment, the fundamental reality. We believe that,  realistically speaking, discussion of the sovereignty issue  should be put aside at the present stage when considering the  issues relating to foreign affairs and mainland policy. What  should be done is to move forward step by step in the light of  reality.    The APEC meeting was an economic occasion, not a government  occasion. Therefore, no politically sensitive question should  be broached there. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communists had  the impudence to call our Taiwan a PRC province. Minister  Chiang's statement was a tactical explanation to tell people  that the reality is not what Chinese Communists claim. That was  a tactical explanation made at a given circumstances and  occasion.    [Correspondent] In the past, we said that politics  should be separated from economics in our policy toward the  mainland. Will this policy be continued? If a policy of not  separating politics and economics is adopted, what chips does  the government have to make the businessmen abide by such a  policy? Thank you.    [Lien] Separating economics from politics -- I do not know  whose idea this is. In regard to the overall situation  vis-a-vis the mainland, I believe we should continue to take the  National Reunification Guidelines as the supreme guidance and  policy. It is a fact that our businessmen are investing in all  sectors of the mainland's economy and we are trading indirectly.  The mainland has seen rapid growth in the past few years,  registering economic growth rates from 9 to as high as 14  percent. However, can such high rates be sustained for long?  This is a question that merits consideration. Shortages of  public facilities and strong inflationary pressures are, in  particular, factors that we should consider from an economic  angle. In addition to economic risks, there is no denying the  fact that all economic activities in the mainland carry some  political risks, even high political risks. Nowadays, with  regard to economic activities in the mainland, the government is  more inclined to give guidance than issue prohibitions.  However, we do not encourage such activities. Our approach is  an incremental and indirect one. We do not want to place all  our economic strength in one basket; the preservation and  development of Taiwan's economic strength should be the guiding  principle governing all our economic activities. I made a trip  to Southeast Asia recently. Economics departments have also  come up with the so-called southern policy. Our investment in  Southeast Asia stands at about $15 billion today; imports from  that region accounts for about 11 percent while exports account  for 32 percent of the ROC's total exports. It is a very  important region.  <H3>  The Southern Policy Is Based on Pragmatism; More Efforts  Will Be Needed To Break Out of Our Diplomatic Predicament </H3>   [Correspondent] What is your view of the practice of  "vacation diplomacy"? Are there plans for overseas trips for  other cabinet members?    [Lien] The primary consideration behind my visit to  Southeast Asia and the subsequent announcement of the "southern  policy" is the fact that the ROC has an investment of $15  billion in that region, which also accounts for 32 percent of  the ROC's exports. With the exception of Thailand, we have  signed agreements with all countries in that region on  investment protection and protection against double taxation.  We have close ties with them. We hope to participate more in  Southeast Asian organizations meetings and activities. All in  all, we must not look at only the regional and functional  aspects in considering issues related to the "southern policy."    I made a trip to Southeast Asia not long ago primarily  because it was New Year's and I had some days off. I went to  Malaysia and Singapore and met their government leaders. The  trip to Honduras was an official diplomatic mission ordered by  the president. The government is facing great difficulties in  diplomacy. I always feel that we should make our voice heard by  our friends and the world at large. We also hope to make our  strength, good will, contributions, and ideas heard and seen by  all the people.    As long as resources permit, I am all for the idea that  relevant government personnel should turn up more frequently in  different locations and at different international occasions to  publicize our nation. That is what you reporters call "show up  faces." As a matter of fact, we have to show up to let  everybody know that we did not vanish; rather we are growing in  strength with each passing day. I think it is very important.    [Correspondent] Where do you think our mainland  policy will go in a post-Teng Hsiao-ping [Deng Xiaoping] era?  Hsu Chia-tun [Xu Jiatun], former director of the Hong Kong  branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said that under Li Teng-hui's  strong leadership, the chance of peaceful reunification of China  seems to be dwindling. What is your view?    [Lien] I have said many times that people across the strait  are, fundamentally speaking, compatriots and siblings related by  blood and flesh. There are no deep seated hatred or absolute  irreconcilability between people of the two sides. What we are  trying to do today is to create for the entire Chinese nation a  free, stable, and prosperous future. Such a basic standpoint is  accepted by all.    We can look forward to the nation's future, including  unification. As a matter of fact, a politician's life is short,  but a nation's life is forever.    I believe cross-strait relations should not be based on the  ideas of a life-or-death struggle, or on the big consuming the  small, or suffocating the other side at every turn. This would  not be unification but annexation. A unification should be the  merging of two to work together for the development of the  nation.    The present Chinese Communist leader should, while he still  commands tremendous authority, make a historic decision with a  historical vision and lofty sentiments. That would be positive  to the development of the nation.    [Correspondent] You have been premier for almost a  year. Can you tell us the policies you are most and least  satisfied with?    [Lien] In the past year, myself and the heads of the various  ministries have worked in unity and devoted ourselves to public  service. We have worked very hard to implement administrative  renovation and economic rejuvenation. All these policies  involve fundamental and structural issues. We do our best to  reach a consensus. I have had the office for just 11 months.  These policies were announced only last June or July. They  have been implemented for a short time. However, all the signs  indicate that all these policies are moving efficiently toward  their goals and targets.    We have also done a great deal of work with regard to public  security, environmental protection, agriculture, communications,  and so forth. Administrative departments always want to  accelerate the pace of implementation. We hope that legislative  organs will support us by enacting relevant laws. When the laws  are in place, administrative departments will be able to take  bold and resolute actions to implement them.  <H3>  The Cabinet Will Be Partly Reshuffled After the Lunar New  Year; the Question of Candidates Cannot Be Determined Now </H3>   [Correspondent] The "Chiao-Tang talks" somehow show  that the higher the level of talks, the greater the efficiency.  Communist China apparently wants to upgrade the talks. What  are your views on this development and what are our future  policy directions?    [Lien] In my opinion, the five joint agreements reached  during last year's "Ku-Wang talks" should be implemented  quickly. Regrettably, no progress was made on implementation  after that, whether during the talks in Amoy, Peiking, or Taipei.    I am very doubtful that this problem can be solved by  upgrading the talks. Basically, I think crucial problems remain  between the two sides. We must patiently solve fishing disputes  and the problem of repatriating airplane hijackers and illegal  immigrants across the Taiwan Strait.    I have a demand, though: We should proceed while maintaining  the nation's basic positions. As for matters other than those  affecting our basic positions, we can make readjustments or  adopt a flexible approach.    [Correspondent] Recently, there have been many reports  that the cabinet may be partially reshuffled. Can you explain  or clarify the matter?    [Lien] As I said before, everybody has been serving the  country faithfully, contributing wholeheartedly, and remaining  on good terms in the 11 months since I began serving in the  cabinet. However, a few colleagues will not be able to continue  their service for personal reasons or for reasons of family. I  think we will make proper readjustments after the Lunar New Year.    As for candidates, since the Law on Provincial and County  Autonomy, the Law on Autonomy for Cities Directly Under the  Central Government, and the Law on Election and Recall have been  submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation after  Executive Yuan approval, we will hold gubernatorial and mayoral  elections toward year's end if the legislative process is  completed by the end of June. Perhaps there is a lot of  guesswork out there. I do not think we can make specific  decisions before the legislative process is completed.    [Correspondent] Judging by the property declarations  filed by public servants, we understand that you have 17 types  of stocks. The Executive Yuan has decided to collect a capital  gains tax. Since some other government leaders also possess  stocks, will this policy of collecting a capital gain tax affect  the stock market or even smack of serving one's own interests?  Will this lead to a situation where the "referee is also the  ball player"?    [Lien] With regard to the stock transaction and capital  gains taxes, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution in 1992 in  which it urged the government to make a decision at the earliest  possible date. After hearing a briefing on the Finance  Ministry's bill of amendments and the opinions of other  ministries and commissions, the Executive Yuan concluded that  the collection of such taxes would mark progress in terms of tax  revenue, fairness in taxation, and simplified auditing and  taxation procedures. It held discussions and adopted the bill  accordingly.    A rapidly developing country will inevitably incur several  problems in implementing financial, taxation, banking, land, and  housing policies; and timely reviews of those policies are in  order. Nevertheless, the government's policies are primarily  based on national development and the interests of all people.    [Correspondent] The Presidential Office and the  Executive Yuan appeared to be on very harmonious terms during  the past year. What do you think were the reasons? Was it  because of institutional or individual factors? Since direct  presidential elections are the main purpose of the third round  of constitutional reforms, how do you think the duties of the  president and the premier should be divided after the  introduction of popular elections of the president?    [Lien] The duties of the president and the premier are  specified in very explicit terms in our Constitution. Because  the president is the head of state, his guidance and leadership  should be respected, especially on major national security  policies such as foreign affairs, national defense, and mainland  policies. During the past year, the Executive Yuan implemented  many policies after they were discussed and assembled at high  levels of the government.    Constitutional reforms will temporarily come to an end. The  National Assembly will meet in April to decide on outstanding  constitutional matters. In my opinion, what happens to the  presidential duties will depend on how such duties are designed.  Direct presidential elections will lead to presidential systems  in some countries, but the presidents of some countries are  still not responsible for actual administrative duties despite  the introduction of direct presidential elections. Our  constitutional system is based on the division of power among  five branches. The best way is to introduce necessary  amendments to this system. I believe that experiences and  precedents in constitutional rule over the past 40 years will  serve as a guide in the future.    [Correspondent] Lawmakers from the Kuomintang recently  urged the government to allocate lawmakers' shares of budget  funds for infrastructure construction. What are your views on  this proposal?    [Lien] I used to serve in local government. My basic  position is that the government does allocate some part of its  annual budget for local construction projects. For example, the  provincial government has different budget plans, such as those  for local construction projects and for coordinating local  needs. These are all for the benefit of local construction.  People's representatives may make suggestions. Relevant  ministries and commissions will give full consideration to these  suggestions and decide whether they fit into the overall plan.  This is our basic approach. It was how things stood during the  three years I was with the provincial government. Suggestions  made by people's representatives should be considered in order  of importance and urgency. The right to decide whether or not  to adopt those suggestions rests with the executive branch  because it will be responsible for implementing budget plans and  spending in the future.  <H3>  We Have Conducted an Overview of Malpractices in Arms  Purchases; We Will Focus on Tightening Budgetary Control </H3>   [Correspondent] Yin Ching-feng's murder has revealed  many problems regarding arms purchases. Do government  departments have overall plans for reforming the practice of  buying weapons?    [Lien] The problems with our arms purchases have caused  widespread concern. Relevant departments have made timely  reports in this regard. The Defense Ministry and other relevant  units have begun to conduct an overview of problems stemming  from purchasing malpractices. An arms purchase improvement  package will be unveiled in the near future. We will focus on  tightening control over budget utilization and on eliminating  thorny problems in the process. However, we can only say this  much because the Yin case has entered the judicial and  investigative stage. The government will draw lessons and gain  experience from this incident, and it will study the best  methods for bringing about improvements.    [Correspondent] Along with presidential election  methods, the premier's countersigning right is also one of the  main subjects of the third round of constitutional reforms. You  once said that the National Assembly's decisions on  constitutional reforms should be respected. Aside from  deferring to the National Assembly's opinions, do you think the  premier's countersigning right should be readjusted? And how  should we readjust it?    [Lien] I think the premier's countersigning right could and  should be readjusted because it is indeed unreasonable in some  respects. For example, the premier still has to countersign  decrees that affect him personally, as well as personnel matters  involving administrative officers over which the National  Assembly has already exercised its right of consent. It is all  the more unreasonable when formality requires the premier to  countersign the appointments of civil servants at the  grass-roots level, although he does not know whose appointment  he is countersigning because there are thousands of them. While  the premier should have the right of countersigning things, this  right should be clearly defined, either by outlining matters  requiring his countersignature or by eliminating those that do  not require his countersignature. The right of countersigning  things should not extend without limits, as it does now. We  should be able to readjust it.    [Correspondent] In the 1995 administrative guidelines  you submitted to the Legislative Yuan, you described this year  as crucial for bridging the past and the future. You expressed  your hopes that Taiwan would take an active part in  international activities or bid for hosting international  events. Do you have concrete plans for realizing these hopes?  Also, there has been a steady stream of criticisms against our  country for engaging in "checkbook diplomacy" at a time when it  is actively expanding its niche in the international community.  What are your views on these criticisms?    [Lien] This matter involves several issues. Only a few of  the international conferences we plan to host this year are of  an official nature due to our country's status. However, we can  host many nongovernmental international events. For example,  the International Rotary Club's plan to hold a large-scale event  in Taipei, to be attended by 30,000 people, will afford us  excellent opportunities because participants will be given to  understand the ROC's progress. Other international events  include our bid for hosting the East Asian Games and the Asian  Games. However, these events require the host cities to  undertake some obligations in advance, and the central  government is prepared to cooperate fully. For this reason, most  of our national construction plans concern the construction of  sports facilities. With regard to so-called "checkbook  diplomacy," Minister Chien has made our stand very clear over  the past few days: Our approach toward developing bilateral  relations is based on the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual  benefit, and reciprocity. Criticism by people outside the  government that the latter is engaging in "checkbook diplomacy"  is very unfair.    In reality, economic, agricultural, and technical  cooperation  is our bargaining chip for expanding our diplomatic activities.  This is something all countries can do openly. Why do people  not criticize what the Chinese Communists do? Our situation is  already difficult enough. I feel great sympathy for Foreign  Minister Chien and his subordinates. They are really working  hard, and people should encourage them.</p>

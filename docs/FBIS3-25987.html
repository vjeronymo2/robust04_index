			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     ["Political Forum": "It Goes Against Legal Principle To  Advocate 'Two Countries, Two Systems'"]    [Text] Last December, 23 Taiwan organizations including the  Taiwan Presbyterian Church issued a so-called white paper on  "Peaceful Coexistence of Two Countries, Two Systems." To  express the so-called "aspirations of the Taiwan people," they  also wanted to deliver the white paper to members of the  mainland's Associations for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  who went to Taiwan to hold talks with the Taiwan's Straits  Exchange Foundation.    Regarding the two sides of the strait as "two countries,"  the  "white paper" said: "The two countries must respect each  other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, refrain from  invading each other, treat each other as equals, benefit each  other, and establish normal diplomatic relations," and so on and  so forth.    Obviously, this is a farce instigated by a handful of  "Taiwan  independence" elements who have made use of the "nongovernmental  organizations" to attempt to split the nation under the banner  of "Taiwan people deciding for themselves."    In reply to reporters' questions in Seattle last year, State  President Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: China means the  PRC, and Taiwan is a province of China. In a white paper  entitled "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification," which was  published on 31 August last year, the Chinese Government  systematically and in great detail expounded the Chinese  Government's principled stand and basic principle and policies  on the Taiwan issue. It was firmly opposed to any words and  deeds aimed at splitting state sovereignty and territorial  integrity.    With the founding of the PRC in 1949, the old regime's  ruling  power over China as a whole was replaced. There was a  succession of governments. The succession did not bring about  any changes in China's territory and Taiwan is still an  inalienable part of China's sacred territory.    The present state of affairs between the two sides of the  strait constitutes only a split of jurisdiction; the sovereignty  is still that of a unified state.    This fact is not only confirmed by the international law,  but  is also a common understanding of the people of the whole China.    In ancient China, over the past thousands of years there  have  always been three factors in the founding of a state, namely  "territory, sovereignty, and people." In its history, wars on  the Chinese territory have created chaos, and there have been  many regimes. In spite of this, there have never been "several  Chinas" as a result of "sovereign states not subordinated to one  another." It is sheer daydreaming on the part of a small handful  of "Taiwan independence" elements to attempt to found another  "sovereign state" on the Chinese territory of Taiwan.    As a commentary of SHIH-CHIEH LUN-TAN PAO [WORLD TRIBUNE] in  Taiwan pointed out: To pursue their own selfish interests,  these people have willfully trampled upon the dignity of the  "Taiwan people" in the face of the people of the world as if it  was a joke. They are indeed guilty of the most heinous crimes  and make all "Taiwan people" feel ashamed!    From the overall political and economic situation of the  world, we can discover that all separated countries belonging to  a nation will eventually be reunified.    The compatriots on both sides of the strait come from the  same roots and origin. Our spoken and written language,  customs, and blood relationships can be traced to the same  origins. There is no reason whatsoever to be separated for a  long time. Regarding themselves as Chinese, all the people on  both sides of the strait need only one China. The "Taiwan  independence" elements, however, do not recognize themselves as  Chinese, and they vainly try to cut away a piece of Chinese  territory and found another state. How can the 1.2 billion  people of China, including Taiwan, sit by idly and remain  indifferent?    The "Taiwan independence" elements vilify the Chinese  people's consistent stand on safeguarding state reunification  and territorial integrity as a "distortion of the international  law and international treaties" and, at the same time, describe  their attempt to split the country as a "principle of modern  international law." Their so-called "principle of modern  international law" means allowing this scum of the nation, out  of their selfish interests, to willfully cut a piece of land  from a sovereign state and found another state.    Even some democratic countries in the West will never  tolerate this open act of splitting state sovereignty. Just  think. It would be strange if some people would not be  immediately condemned if they attempt to found another country  in a U.S. state.    According to the white paper, which advocates "two  countries,  two systems," "it is necessary for Taiwan to join the United  Nations and other international organizations as soon as  possible." This is only daydreaming. In 1971 the UN General  Assembly overwhelmingly passed Resolution 2758, "recognizing the  PRC as the only legitimate representative of China in UN  organizations" and stating that, as a part of China, Taiwan is  not qualified to "join the United Nations." This is something  known to all. In whatever name Taiwan joins the United Nations,  it is tantamount to creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one  Taiwan." This is absolutely out of keeping with the principle  of China's reunification.    Since state reunification is the common aspiration of the  people on both sides of the strait, the Taiwan independence  forces on the island should not play with the fire of the  principled issue of state reunification or they will have only  themselves to blame.</p>

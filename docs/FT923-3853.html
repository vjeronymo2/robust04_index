			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Crash blamed on property snags THE director of the East Anglian tourist board, Mr Procter Naylor, said yesterday that the collapse of Mowat was brought about by difficulties with property concerns rather than with its three holiday centres in the region. Mr Naylor expected that the sale to Broads Tours of Pennant Holidays, Mowat's boat hire business, would still go ahead. Pennant Holidays' 175 cruisers and 38 day launches make up about 10 per cent of all hire boats on the Norfolk Broads, where there are about 70 boat hire yards. Mr Naylor, who said he was 'very sad' about Mowat's demise, said bookings for its chalet and caravan sites had held up well in spite of the recession, and receivers should have little difficulty in finding a suitable buyer. Mr Len Funnell, chairman of Broads Tours, said he had held discussions with Mowat's receivers yesterday and hoped the deal would still go through. Boat hire bookings on the Norfolk Broads this summer were about 20 per cent down on last year. Tourist operators estimated that Pennant Holidays' bookings dropped even lower, in spite of a 30 per cent discount, partly because it acted as its own boat holiday booking agent. 'I don't think it was the bad season that brought Mowat down,' Mr Funnell said. The Mowat group's Peerglow division had built homes primarily in Staffordshire and Cheshire, with commercial and industrial developments around the M25.</p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Cauldron in the Caucasus: The wider ramifications of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict Last Saturday, a couple of young Armenian soldiers stood outside a mosque in Shusha, a town in Nagorno Karabakh just captured from Azerbaijani forces. One of the soldiers raised his Kalashnikov, and began firing at the crescent on top of a minaret. He missed. His comrade tried and missed too. Laughing, they gave up. The Armenian church above the mosque, part restored, is now a shrine. Outside, boxes containing rockets were piled up high; the church had been an Azeri arsenal, and had just been cleared by the victorious Armenians. The conflict in the Transcaucasus, in particular that between the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, is not explicitly religious. It is about territory. But the conflict is now increasingly legitimised by being set, by the combatants, in a religious and racial setting. The Christians (Armenians) against the Moslems (Azerbaijanis). The dishonouring of each other's religious shrines is a matter of pride. Thus the conflict, inevitably, draws into its vortex the surrounding states  -Russia, Iran, Turkey and Georgia on the borders; the Moslem Central Asian states of the former Soviet Union; even states further off, such as Ukraine to the west and Pakistan to the south. Plus, of course, those countries with large communities of the Armenian diaspora, such as France, the US, Syria and Lebanon. Of these Turkey has emerged as the leading player. Turkey shares a border with Armenia and - for only 12km on its south-east wing - the Nakhichevan region of Azerbaijan. Istanbul has accused Armenia of aggression against Nakhichevan and Mr Turgut Ozal, Turkey's president, even threatened - from his hospital bed in Houston, Texas - to send in the Turkish army. This threat brought a sharp reaction from Russia, which sent a delegation headed by Mr Genady Burbulis, President Boris Yeltsin's chief aide, to the Armenian capital of Yerevan last Thursday to pointedly begin talks on the continued stationing in Armenia of the Seventh Army, now under Russian control. A week previously Armenia had signed a mutual security pact with Russia and four other former Soviet republics. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, head of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), warned of war between Turkey - a Nato member - and the CIS. Suddenly, the obscure little Armenian-Azeri war had become very important. Following the Soviet collapse, the countries around the ex-superpower's borders have sought to increase their influence on its former republics. None more so than Turkey. Its diplomats and traders have been especially active in Azerbaijan (the Azeris and the Turks are ethnic kin), and in the Moslem Central Asian states, which have been offered Turkish aid. Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkey's foreign minister, currently in Mosocw with his premier Mr Suleyman Demirel for talks with Russian leaders, proposed last week the convention of a regional initiative to solve the Armenian-Azeri dispute - an apparent bid for regional hegemony. Ukraine, increasingly of the opinion that anyone who challenges Russia should be treated as a friend, sees Turkey as an ally in its struggle with Russia over possession of the Crimea (till the mid-19th century part of the Ottoman empire). Ukraine is willing to resettle the (Moslem) Tatars back in their Crimean homeland; Turkey, with an influential Tatar minority, is supportive. Throughout what were the Moslem areas of the former Soviet Union, parties speaking in the name of Islam are growing in strength. Last month, Moslem militants making common cause with a democratic movement forced the Tajikistan government to form an uneasy coalition with their representatives. Two of the autonomous republics within Russia itself - Tatarstan and Chechen Ingushetia - have Moslem-oriented governments. The more Armenian militants present their conflict with Azeris as one between Christian and Moslem civilisations - as they increasingly do - the more this provokes a hardening response from Moslem nationalist-religious forces. The Caucasian conflict has the power to send shock waves through the crumbling fabric of the former Soviet Union, and far beyond. At the epicentre is Nagorno Karabakh, the beautiful little mountain enclave which contains no more than 150,000 people, the bulk of whom are Armenian. In the Soviet period, Karabakh's status was that of an autonomous region within Azerbaijan, a fact which has always been deeply resented by Armenians. In 1988, a group called the 'Karabakh Committee' started agitating in Yerevan for the return of Karabakh to Armenian control. Today, the Karabakh Committee forms the leadership in the Armenian state. Since 1988, as Moscow's control weakened, the Armenian-Azeri issue has slipped beyond compromise. In 1988-89, there were massacres of Armenians in the Azeri cities of Sumgait and Baku; Armenians living in Azerbaijan streamed into Armenia (and into Karabakh) from Azerbaijan, while Azeris fled revenge in Armenia. The Soviet army occupied Karabakh in 1990 and tried to impose calm. When it began a pull-out early this year, hostilities became open. In March, the government of Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, the communist president of Azerbaijan, fell. The Armenians immediately went on the offensive. They expelled most of the remaining Azeris from eastern Karabakh - leaving Azeri forces controlling only one centre, Shusha, a few kilometres from the enclave's present capital, Stepanakaert. From Shusha, the Azeri garrison kept up a bombardment against Stepanakaert. Many of the buildings in the central area of Stepanakaert have been either destroyed or damaged. The town's inhabitants have lived in cellars for months; their ration of food is down to a kilogramme of flour a month - supplemented with what they can get from the barely functioning markets. There is no electricity, no gas, no running water. In the central hospital, Dr Mesrop Makaryan said medical care could only deal with the wounded. Other illnesses are unattended. Faced with such an onslaught, the Karabakh Praesidium decided on May 7 that the only defence was attack, according to Mr Levon Melik-Shakhnazarian, the head of the committee on foreign affairs in the Karabakh Supreme Soviet and a member of the 11-strong Praesidium. After making a feint at the Azeri-held position of Janhassan behind Stepanakaert (which succeeded in diverting Azeri forces), the Armenians launched their main - and successful - assault on Shusha. Today, Shusha, now even more destroyed than Stepanakaert, is held by Armenian soldiers - and Armenians are returning to the Armenian quarter in the town. The capture of Shusha has made possible the realisation of a long-held Armenian aim - the opening of a corridor from Armenia to Karabakh across the narrowest part of Azerbaijan, separating the two by only a few kilometres. Shusha, while under Azeri control, had once commanded this road; now it is in Armenian hands. On May 17, Armenian forces from Karabakh and Armenia launched attacks on the town of Lachin on the western Azerbaijan-Karabakh border. The town, in a valley, was an easy target. At the weekend, a few days after the battle for Shusa, the town was again being looted and burned by the Armenians. Lorries, vans, private cards and oil tankers roared up the narrow mountain road, hauling back the spoils of war to Armenia. In the town centre, Karabakhers piled provisions from the shops onto carts to take back to Stepanakaert. A body so burned as to be recognisable only by a hand lay pounded into the garbage on the road. Dead farm animals lay decomposed at the entrances to flaming (Azeri) homes, the unlooted possessions strewn about. None of the Armenians spoken to believe the corridor is secure. Mr Oleg Yesoyan, the Karabakh prime minister, said: 'I hope other nations will understand our need for the corridor - without it we lose our land.' After the corridor was established, a new front was opened up on the borders of Nakhichevan. This strip of land, nestling against the Iranian and Turkish borders, is part of Azerbaijan - though separated from it by Armenian territory. It is a matter of dispute who began hostilities on the borders of Nakhichevan; but it is probably academic now, for last week the Armenians were shelling the town of Sadarak just inside the Nakhichevan border and the Azeris were returning fire, hitting Armenian villages. In Sadarak, Mr Halil Gajiev said his two grandchildren had been killed by a rocket. On the Armenian side, in the village of Sevakavan, the family of Knyazyan live in the dirty basement of their house, itself holed by a shell. This theatre seems to have won a respite. Mr Gaidar Aliev, the Nakhichevan president, has agreed with Armenia's President Levon Ter-Petrosian to the creation of a security zone along the border. Indeed, at the end of last week, Mr Aliev was on the phone to Mr Ter-Petrosian begging for a ceasefire. For this Mr Aliev has been criticised by the new government in Baku. And in this criticism is a clue to the depth of the dispute. For in Baku, the Popular Front which now governs is an exact counterpart to the Karabakh Committee ruling in Armenia. In short, it is the militants who now command in Baku and Yerevan. Real peace is unlikely. Overtures from the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and from the UN, to mediate between the mutually contradictory responses from Karabakh (backed by Armenia) that it be accorded the independent statehood it seeks, and from Azerbaijan that Karabakh be treated as an integral part of the republic of Azerbaijan, seem unlikely to yield fruit. Mr Demirel, the Turkish premier, will today report on his two days of talks with the Russian leaders, which last night culminated in the signing of a new treaty of co-operation between the two states. It is a safe bet that he will seek to blur the recent outbreak of enmity which sprang up like a flame. But his sphere of influence is expanding. His interlocutors in Moscow are struggling to contain the shrinking of their own formerly undisputed suzerainty of the region. The collapse of the Russian empire has so far had  -in the historical scale - few casualties. But its consequences are only just beginning, and the ethnic and religious cauldron of the Caucasus is an early and frightening test.

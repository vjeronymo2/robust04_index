			<p>BFN     [Text] Pale, 5 May (TANJUG) -- Representatives of the  international "contact group" for former Bosnia-Herzegovina this  evening wound up a second round of talks with the leadership of  the republic of Srpska. Members of the group talked to republic  of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic and assembly president  Momcilo Krajisnik. Following the meeting the participants  briefly talked with reporters, without disclosing any details.    "We talked with Mr. Karadzic and his team and now we are  first going to Sarajevo and then to our capitals to report on  the results of the talks," said French diplomat Jacques-Alain de  Sedouy, the representative of the European Union in the contact  group. Asked about the specific results of today's meeting, de  Sedouy replied that the group's members would submit a report  about this to their governments. Republic of Srpska assembly  president Momcilo Krajisnik said that the day is still far away  when it will be possible to express optimism, but he stressed  that today's talks were "very useful."    "We exchanged opinions and proposals, and these issues  certainly deserve a thorough debate. The leadership of the  republic of Srpska will have detailed consultations about all  issues. We still believe that the talks is a way to find a  solution to the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik  said.    The contact group, which is trying to revive the peace  process for former Bosnia-Herzegovina in Pale, consists of U.S.  envoy Charles Redman, Russian envoy Aleksey Nikiforov, European  Union representative de Sedouy, UN representative Paul Saso,  Germany's Michael Steiner, and Great Britain's David Manning.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Argentina beats IMF targets ARGENTINA has bettered stringent economic targets set by the International Monetary Fund for the final quarter of last year, opening the way for fresh loans from the IMF and other lenders this spring. Officials reported yesterday the government had a Dollars 1.74bn (Pounds 970m) budget surplus in the final quarter of 1991, against a Fund target of Dollars 1.43bn. Earlier, independent economists had cast doubts on the government's ability to meet the surplus without including windfalls from larger than expected privatisation receipts or by delaying payments. In the previous quarter the budget surplus was only Dollars 989m. The budget operating surplus, which excludes privatisation receipts, rose by 206 per cent over the third quarter to Dollars 1.1bn. Privatisation revenues of Dollars 635m were hardly changed. However, the surplus was only attained by a one-off inflow from a tax amnesty and by deferring Dollars 360m-Dollars 380m in public sector Christmas bonuses to January. The improved budget figures will strengthen the position of Argentine officials now in the US negotiating with the IMF and commercial banks. Argentina wants to convert the Dollars 1.04bn standby loan it obtained from the IMF last July to a Dollars 3bn, three-year extended fund facility loan. This would unlock other loans from the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and - officials hope  - from the Japanese government. The loans would help finance a reduction in Argentina's Dollars 35bn foreign bank debt under the aegis of the Brady debt reduction scheme. Argentine officials are holding preliminary talks with bank executives in New York on refinancing more than Dollars 8bn in interest arrears before discussing reduction of the bank debt. The budget figures are coming under intense scrutiny because they are a key to economic stability.</p>

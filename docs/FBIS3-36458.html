The Agro-Industrial Complex Will Cost  Russia 10 Times the Food Import"]    [Text] In yesterday's session the Council of Ministers  Presidium approved the Russian Federation Government resolution  "On the Functioning of the Russian Federation Agro-industrial  Complex in 1994" and issued orders for it to be finalized within  10 days. The draft was prepared by Zaveryukha's department with  the participation of representatives from the Foreign Economic  Relations Ministry, the Russian State Fishing Committee, the  Central Bank, the Fuel and Energy Ministry, and was then  approved by the Economy Ministry practically without comment.  The sole department that strongly criticized this "lobby  allowance" was the Finance Ministry. This must be why two days  before the session Zaveryukha sent a letter to the presidium  accusing the Finance Ministry of sabotaging the program for  revitalizing the agricultural sector, and yesterday he stated:  "Russia must feed its peasants."    In addition to the measures of state support for the  agro-industrial complex (an investment credit of 1.3 trillion  rubles and 2.8 trillion rubles of centralized capital inputs for  the first quarter of 1994), it was proposed to preserve  subsidies for centralized food imports and establish subsidy  coefficients for imported technological equipment. Furthermore  it is envisioned to compensate 30 percent of expenditures for  fertilizer purchases and to impose restrictive custom duties on  the import of "white sugar, wool, flax and hemp fibers, and  industrially harvested fur and pelt materials."    According to Economy Ministry estimates, 24 additional  measures to support the agricultural sector will call for an  additional 14 trillion rubles of budget funds. The aggregate  cost of the program for the state budget, however, will amount  to 34 trillion rubles ($22 billion at the current exchange rate)  which exceeds the volume of agricultural imports 10 fold. "It  must be remembered that in Russian agriculture, the sowing  season is immediately followed by harvesting," Sergey Vasilyev,  head of the Working Center for Economic Reforms, which has not  yet been dissolved, said at a press conference yesterday.</p>

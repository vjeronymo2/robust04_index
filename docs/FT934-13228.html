			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Safeland seeks Pounds 1.6m for expansion Safeland is raising Pounds 1.58m net through a 1-for-3 underwritten rights issue. The property development and investment group also announced an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 36,000 to Pounds 345,000 for the six months to September 30. The company, a subsidiary of the Panama-incorporated Safeland Holdings, said there were signs of improvement in the property market and the proceeds would be used for acquisitions mainly in the retail sector. Safeland Holdings will not be taking up its rights entitlement resulting in its holding falling from 55.93 per cent to 41.95 per cent. The Lipman directors, who include Mr Ray Lipman, chairman, and Mr Larry Lipman, managing director, will be taking up half their shares, leaving their aggregate holdings at 9.06 per cent, down from 10.35 per cent. A total of 6.28m shares are being offered at 28p each. Safeland's shares closed at 44p, down 1p on the day. Directors were optimistic that progress would continue. Turnover was Pounds 4.78m (Pounds 5.99m). The pre-tax result was a 42 per cent increase on the total for the whole of the previous year. Earnings per share were 1.25p (0.13p) and the interim dividend is raised to 0.6p (0.06p).</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Iranians recall envoy in Argentina Iran is recalling its ambassador to Argentina, further raising tensions between the two countries after an Argentine judge last week accused Iranian diplomats of having played key roles in bomb attacks against a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires last month and against the Israeli embassy there in 1992. However, Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentine deputy foreign minister, yesterday tried to defuse the crisis: 'There are no such things as drastic measures in diplomacy. We are not recalling our ambassador.' Mr Mario del Castillo, Argentine ambassador in Tehran, 'was called back to Buenos Aires for consultations after the bombing. He is in Tehran now but will be returning to Buenos Aires in a few days.' Staffing at Argentina's embassy would be halved to two diplomats, Mr Petrella said. Judge Juan Jose Galeano last week issued international arrest warrants for four former diplomats at the Iranian embassy in Buenos Aires, saying they had provided support for the 1992 bombing, which killed 30 people. He also said three diplomats based in Buenos Aires had helped prepare the attack last month, which claimed 96 lives. Intelligence officials blame the Lebanon-based Hizbollah organisation for both bombings. Iran said it would begin legal action against Argentine officials for implicating the four diplomats. State-run Tehran Radio said Iran was 'determined to appeal to international judicial organisations to follow up the accusations brought against the Iranian citizens.' Israeli and western diplomats in Buenos Aires say that, although Judge Galeano's evidence against the seven diplomats is weak, they are convinced that Tehran had indirectly backed both bombings through its sponsorship of Hizbollah. The judge's main informant was an Iranian now seeking political asylum in Ecuador. Diplomats suspect he is inflating his knowledge of the affair to improve his chances of winning asylum. Argentine President Carlos Menem appealed for calm at the weekend, after admitting that officials had over-reacted to intelligence reports from Israeli and US sources warning of the risks of a third bomb attack. On Friday, the government issued public statements, warning that an attack was imminent.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: International financiers spark off gold price surge A CONCERTED effort by some of the world's high-profile financiers to focus investors' attention on gold paid off yesterday when the price moved up by USDollars 7.35 troy ounce in London to close at a six-month peak of Dollars 351.50. This followed weekend revelations that Mr George Soros, renowed for making more than Dollars 1bn profit in the currency markets in September by betting against sterling and the Italian lira, had bought Dollars 400m-worth of shares in Newmont Mining, biggest of the North American gold producers. The Newmont shares were sold by Lord Rothschild, the UK investor, and Sir James Goldsmith, the international deal-maker. Sir James revealed he had used the cash to purchase more than Dollars 300m of options to buy gold in the London and New York markets. The news 'had gold bugs coming out of the woodwork left, right and centre' yesterday, according to one trader. Mr Jon Bergtheil, analyst at James Capel, the financial services group, heralded the involvement of Mr Soros in the gold market as 'a fascinating development. I have felt for some time that the negative impact of central bank selling (of gold) would soon be countered by the entry of specialised investors. There is now a very definite shift in market psychology, and the gold market is all about psychology'. Some other commentators were more cynical. One pointed out, unkindly, that 'Goldsmith has made a song and dance ahead of buying 700,000 to 800,000 ounces of gold - that alone should stimulate some buying by other investors'. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland, speculated that the deals and the accompanying publicity might be part of a much grander strategy as far as Mr Soros was concerned, perhaps connected with his rumoured bond market positions. (Rumours suggest Mr Soros has been shorting US bonds or selling bonds he does not yet own in the expectation that he will be able to buy them later at a lower price.) He said that the timing of the gold deals was perfect because 'troubles in South Africa and Russia (the biggest and third-biggest gold producers respectively) are coming to a head at the same time and the (German) Bundesbank has cut its interest rates'. Analysts said the gold price surge yesterday was helped by producers resisting the temptation to do some forward selling. 'But they will start to sell again when the price rise shows signs of stalling,' suggested Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. He added: 'To put the market in perspective, gold might be at a six-month high, but a few weeks ago it was at a seven-year low'. Mr Arnold said the market was being driven by professionals, investment funds and the like, and 'there has been no wave of physical buying by the man in the street, Asians are not falling over each other to buy at these prices and the Swiss banks are still not putting their private clients into physical gold. And if the physical buying is not there, it will be difficult to sustain a high price'. Both Mr Smith and Mr Arnold said that market professionals would now be looking at chart points and setting targets. Mr Smith suggested Dollars 360 an ounce was probably the next target. Mr Arnold said it was difficult to judge where the price would peak but many people were targetting Dollars 360-Dollars 370.</p>

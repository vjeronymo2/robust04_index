			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / German inflation eases: Economic watch West Germany's inflation rate fell to 3.3 per cent in February from 3.5 per cent the month before, helped by falling goods prices and lower real wages, though hopes of a fall below 3 per cent this year still depend on developments in rents, import prices and public and private sector services. Nonetheless, the Bundesbank repo rate fell to 5.97 per cent this week, from the 6 per cent rate seen since early December. Prices for goods rose only 2.3 per cent in 1993. Gross pay for west German industrial workers fell by a real 1.6 per cent - the first fall since 1983 - while white-collar pay stagnated. The government warned, however, that west German basic hourly pay was still growing too quickly. Between 1985 and 1992, wages rose a real 20.6 per cent, compared with 12 per cent in Japan, 5-6 per cent in France, Italy and the Netherlands and an 8 per cent fall in the US. Spain's industrial production rose 6.2 per cent in December from a year earlier, but declined 7.6 per cent from November 1993, leaving industrial production for the year down 4.6 per cent on the 1992 figure. Swedish new car registrations rose by 12 per cent last month to a preliminary 10,714 units, from 9,549 in February 1993. New registrations in January and February were up 20 per cent, to 21,111 from 17,568 the same two months in 1993.</p>

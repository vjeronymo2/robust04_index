			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: United Meat Packers in receivership UNITED Meat Packers (UMP), the Irish Republic's second largest meat processor, was yesterday placed into receivership. The collapse of the company, which processes an estimated 30 per cent of Ireland's annual sheep output and 15 per cent of its beef, follows the failure of a High Court examiner, appoint-ed last month, to raise IPounds 7m (Pounds 6.5m) in working capital from the company's creditor banks to keep it in business. UMP has debts in excess of IPounds 50m, and ran into a liquidity crisis following a fire which devastated its most modern abattoir and cold store last January at Ballaghaderreen, causing damage estimated at IPounds 15m. The receiver, Mr John Donnelly of the chartered accountants Deloitte and Touche, said that 'while the future ownership of the company may be in question, the survival of the business and its operations has to be achieved'. Ireland's two main banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, were yesterday reported to be interested in supporting UMP following the announcement. The family-run company, headed by Mr Sher Rafique, originally from Pakistan, has been a classic 'rags-to-riches' success story. Having studied in the UK in the 1960s, and worked on the London underground and buses, he came to Ireland in the early 1970s, and established his first sheep abattoir in the west of Ireland to sell meat slaughtered under Moslem rites for sale to the Middle East. He now ranks as one of Ireland's wealthiest men. Things began to go wrong for the company in the late 1980s, first with cancellation of export credit guarantees and the loss of sales to Iraq, and then the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) scare which lost it markets in Libya and Iran. Mr Rafique, however, successfully built up new supermarket outlets in France, Italy and Spain and 70 per cent of UMP's exports now go to continental Europe. It is expected that there will be considerable interest by Irish and European meat processors in buying UMP's five main plants in Ireland, as well as its smaller plants in the UK.</p>

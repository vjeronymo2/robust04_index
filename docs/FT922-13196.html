			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / International Bonds: Investors become sceptical with primary market THE international bond market went through another torrid week, with a only a handful of new issues launched into the primary market and most failing to generate sustained buying interest. The simple explanation is that investors are facing deep uncertainty about the prospects for bond yields and are unwilling to commit new funds. However, syndicate officials at leading underwriting firms are concerned that institutional investors are also losing confidence in the ability of the primary Eurobond market to deliver paper at fair value. A striking feature of the primary market over the past two months is the number of new issues which have traded below issue price. Similarly, the yield spread of new issues over government bonds - the benchmark measure of value for non-government paper - has widened in the days after launch. A rational investor will only buy a new issue if it believes that the primary market price is solid. The subject is emotive. Many of the changes in new issue procedure introduced since the late 1980s were designed to restore the confidence of investment institutions in the primary Eurobond market. For example, the practice of offering bonds to investors at a fixed price during the initial stages of syndication was introduced to prevent underwriters from 'dumping' bonds at a discount and depressing the price of new issues. Some syndicate officials now argue that the fixed price re-offer has been abused. They argue that too many deals are being re-offered to investors at a price which is too aggressive and can not be sustained. Firms are bidding for new issue mandates at impossibly tight yield spreads in order to win market share and have abandoned the 'discipline' sometimes evident last year. But recently even issues which were considered well priced and well handled by rival firms at the time of launch have had a tough ride. For example, Norway's Dollars 1bn five-year issue was launched on March 31 at a yield spread of 25 basis points over US Treasury paper - considered fair by most participants in the deal. By the end of last week the yield spread had widened to around 29 basis points. Even borrowers willing to compromise have suffered at the hands of sceptical investors. On Thursday, Finland launched a cautious Dollars 500m five-year issue lead managed by Morgan Stanley International. Many syndicate officials were expecting a Dollars 1bn deal of up to 10-years maturity. The issue was priced at a yield spread of 45 basis points, rather than 40-43 basis point spread initially favoured by the borrower. At the close of trading on Friday, the deal was trading at a yield spread of around 50 basis points. Such examples pose the question: is aggressive pricing driving investors from the primary market, or is the unwillingness of investors to commit funds making it very difficult to price new issues correctly? In defence of new issue underwriters, several factors have combined to make primary market pricing more difficult than usual this year. In particular, secondary market yields have become a less reliable guide to the level at which new issues can be sold. There are several reasons for the dislocation of primary and secondary market yields. Following the fall in US interest rates and bond yields last year, many outstanding bond issues are trading well above face value in the secondary market. Investors are generally unwilling to buy paper trading above par, knowing that they will take a capital loss when the bonds mature. These bonds appear to offer a generous return. For example, European Investment Bank Eurodollar bonds maturing April 1997 are trading below par on a yield spread of around 13 basis points over Treasuries. Yet EIB bonds maturing November 1997 trade on a spread of 45 basis points, primarily because the issue is old and trading at about 108 per cent of face value. Equally, a number of liquid bond issues launched earlier this year - potential benchmarks against which other new issues could be measured - were never fully sold to investors and remain on the books of the lead manager. Again, this distorts the yield at which the bonds are quoted in the secondary market. 'It is cheaper for firms to hold unsold inventory rather than mark down prices to off-load the bonds,' commented one new issue manager. 'Secondary market spreads are not sustainable at current levels but no-one wants to admit it.' In a more liquid market, secondary market yields would adjust to reflect institutional investors' assessment of fair value rather than levels dictated by market-makers. However, secondary market trading volumes are currently very low. There are few buyers, but also very few sellers. This uncertainty may continue until secondary market yields adjust to match investors' current perceptions of fair value and intermediaries sell inventories of unsold bonds. Until then, issues will probably continue to be mis-priced and levels of inventory held by intermediaries will swell. 'You can't make a science out of pricing a new issue. There are so many dynamics at work within each deal, secondary market levels are just one factor,' said Mr Jim Pelgrift, executive director and syndicate manager at Morgan Stanley.</p>

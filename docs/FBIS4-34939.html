			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paulo Sotero] </F>   [Excerpts] Washington, 24 Jun (AE) -- Argentine President  Carlos Menem, who two weeks ago caused an incident with Brazil  in attempting to obtain Latin American support for the candidacy  of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari as chairman of  the World Trade Organization (WTO), today said in Washington  that the final decision on the subject will be made by the  European Community.    His statement will probably exasperate the Brazilian  Government, which is annoyed at Menem's attempt to undermine the  candidacy of Brazilian Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero as WTO  chairman during the Ibero-American Summit that took place in  Cartagena, Colombia. [passage omitted]    Following a 30-minute meeting today with U.S. President Bill  Clinton -- which was obtained after three months of negotiations  -- Menem tried to explain his government's position regarding  the WTO candidacy during a news conference. He did not confirm  his support for the candidacy of Ricupero, whom he wrongly  described as a "successful economist." The Argentine president  said that when he arrived in Cartagena he did not know about  Ricupero's candidacy, and that he suggested the name of Salinas  "following a proposal made by the Colombian Government."    "Right now," Menem said, "there are two candidates from this  continent, one from Mexico and the other one from the Federative  Republic of Brazil." After saying this Menem got mixed up, and  said: "Supposedly the candidacy will be defined by the members  of the European Commission, and the candidate could be a  European."    A reporter asked Menem for a better explanation. "The WTO is  an organization from the European Community, it is not an  international organization," the Argentine president said. "Or  better yet," he corrected himself, "it is an international  organization but it is an organization from the European  Community."    Menem traveled to Orlando, Florida, this evening, where he  will watch the soccer match between the Argentine and Nigerian  soccer teams. As he is known for bringing bad luck, he will  apparently comply with a petition by the Argentine soccer  players, and will watch the match on television "for reasons of  superstition," he said.</p>

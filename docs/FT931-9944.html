			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Bonn gloomier on outlook for west Germany THE German government yesterday produced its gloomiest annual economic report in a decade, forecasting a decline in gross domestic product of up to 1 per cent. It was promptly attacked by the opposition for excessive optimism. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the newly appointed economics minister, said all the economic indicators for west Germany were negative at the turn of the year, including industrial orders, production levels, investment activity, capacity utilisation and - above all - unemployment. In the east, however, there were a few hopeful signs, especially in construction activity and the service sector, although the economic recovery was still decidedly hesitant, he said. The other element of extremely cautious optimism to emerge from the report, presented to both cabinet and parliament yesterday, was the forecast that wages will grow by less than the rate of inflation in the coming year. Gross wages would rise between 2.5 and 3 per cent, compared with price rises of about 3.5 per cent, it suggests. Mr Rexrodt said the priority for the German government must be to avoid slipping into an all-out recession, although Mr Otto Lambsdorff, his own party leader in the Free Democrats (FDP), says the economy is already in its sharpest post-war recession. The minister stressed the importance of the solidarity pact under discussion between the central government, the 16 Lander and the opposition Social Democrats, as well as employers and trade unions. He said he had been instructed to produce by September a report on how to improve the attractiveness of Germany as an investment location, reducing the high cost structure and increasing labour mobility. The key figures in the government's forecast for the year are a decline in GDP of between zero and 1 per cent for west Germany, an expansion of 5 to 7 per cent in the east, with an all-German forecast of zero growth. Average unemployment in the west is predicted to rise by some 450,000 to 2.25m, or a rate of 7.5 per cent, and to increase only marginally in the east to about 1.2m, a rate of 15 to 16 per cent. The national unemployment average would be 9 per cent, the report says. It forecasts a growth in exports of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent in the west (8 to 10 per cent in the east, where exports to eastern Europe have collapsed), based on the assumption of a steady revival in world trade, especially in the US economy. It is based on important assumptions: of a successful conclusion to the Gatt round of trade liberalisation talks, gradual easing of international interest rates, a slight depreciation in the D-Mark's value, substantial efforts to restrict public spending, and wage moderation (including a slowdown in the rate of equalisation of eastern and western wages). It particularly criticises the 'blatant disproportion' between unit wage costs in east and west Germany, with the former now 60 per cent higher than the west, in spite of the collapse of the eastern economy. Mr Wolfgang Roth, SPD economics spokesman, said there was no clear indication where the 5-7 per cent growth rate in east Germany would come from, given the collapse of east German industry. A zero overall national growth rate would require an immediate reversal of a steady contraction. He sharply criticised the Bundesbank for its failure to cut its lead interest rates more aggressively. He said last week's cuts - half a percentage point of the Lombard rate, from 9.5 to 9 per cent, and a quarter point off the discount rate, to 8 per cent - were a 'mincing step' which was 'pure poison for the economy'.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Energy commissioner sets light to a slow fuse THERE IS no doubt about the destination of the European Commission's energy policy, however slow the journey, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. 'Our aim is to transform the energy market in Europe - which is fundamentally national and based on administrative focusing of prices - and replace it with a European unit in which cross-border trade could be significant and prices would react according to negotiations between buyer and seller,' Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, energy commissioner, said in an interview last week. Open access to gas and electricity networks is the legacy which the Portuguese commissioner would like to leave to his successors when he gives up the post at the end of this year, even if full third party access, as it is known, has to wait until 1996. Mr Cardoso e Cunha took up the quest in 1989 when the French government complained it was being prevented from exporting electricity to Germany. Ironically, France - together with Germany, the Netherlands and most national energy producers - is now one of the principal opponents of the plan. Faced with such opposition, and the scepticism of some of his fellow commissioners, Mr Cardoso e Cunha has toned down the original proposal to break up energy monopolies using special legal powers. This has 'relieved the tension", he says, but he is still a firm believer in the value of liberalisation and increased transparency in the sector, particularly for the largest producers. 'The unbundling concept (separating the management and accounting of production, transmission and distribution operations) could help the management of companies the size of Electricite de France,' he says. The British attempt to increase competition in the sector is one important model for a pan-European system. However, the Commission cannot force member states to change the ownership structure of their energy industries and is adopting a phased approach to the problem. 'The idea is to test the system with a reduced number of actors,' says Mr Cardoso e Cunha.</p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Kohl will sign pact with Prague CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will travel to Prague at the end of next month to sign a controversial co-operation treaty with Czechoslovakia, in spite of strong conservative opposition in Germany. The treaty was approved by the German cabinet yesterday, along with a similar treaty with Hungary - but only after the chancellor had given the assurance that he would raise the question of property rights for former Sudeten Germans on his trip to Prague. Properties once owned by Germans in the former Sudetenland are currently being sold off, according to reports in Germany, and the former owners are demanding a right to participate. The issue has caused an embarrassing delay in ratifying the friendship treaty. Mr Kohl has already agreed to support a joint resolution in the Bundestag backing the property claims of the Sudeten Germans, but has refused to agree to any changes in the treaty itself.</p>

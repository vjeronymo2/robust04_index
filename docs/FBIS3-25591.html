			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>   [Text] Right-wing plans for civil war are far advanced. It  can be put into operation within weeks. Excerpts of a top  secret Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] "war"  document, which came into RAPPORT's possession this week, even  contain guidelines for the treatment of prisoners of war.  Reputable sources close to the Volksfront told RAPPORT this  week that the coming parliamentary sitting early in March will  be the possible signal for the launching of the so-called V-day.  On this V-day ("V" stands for Volkstaat [homeland]), incidents  of violence could take place. Plans for war have been underway  for weeks, under the leadership of a group of approximately 50  retired, but relatively young, senior officers of the South  African Defense Force. These are mainly brigadiers, colonels,  and commandants. These officers have been consulting with  elements in the Inkatha Freedom Party for a long while.  Meanwhile, Volksfront leader, General Constand Viljoen, is busy  chasing every negotiation option for a peaceful settlement.    Planning for the armed resistance is being done under the  greatest cloud of secrecy by planners who work independently of  each other in small groups. Even influential leadership figures  in the Volksfront, apparently including nearly the entire  so-called "transitional government," are still totally unaware  of the plans. Senior officers involved in drafting these war  plans apparently have little patience with politicians. They  "can continue with their useless actions." Even General Tienie  Groenewald, one of the leadership figures in the Volksfront, is,  according to RAPPORT's information, in the dark about plans for  an armed struggle. Gen. Groenewald, a former senior officer in  Military Intelligence, is not trusted by influential people  within the Volksfront. It is interesting to note that the AWB  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has played no part in the  drafting of these war plans. One of the reasons is that the AWB  is regarded as being fully infiltrated by agents in the state  Intelligence service.    It appears that planners are careful to avoid the armed  resistance from becoming a form of so-called "ethnic cleansing,"  where blacks are shot at random. This issue is strongly  stressed by senior army officers heading the operation.    In the Volksfront document in RAPPORT's possession, marked  "Top Secret," there is repeated reference to "the pending  confrontation": "As a result of the composition of the SADF  [South African Defense Force] and SAP [South African Police] the  pending confrontation will undoubtedly result in the capture of  large numbers of prisoners of war that will have to be  controlled and managed by own forces. It is of cardinal  importance that members be fully informed about action expected  of them in this regard. It is in the interest of future  relations between the various groups, as well as the Christian  duty of each individual and military unit, to be sympathetic in  the exercising of their duties."    Thereafter, broad guidelines are given for the handling of  prisoners of war. Among other things, it stipulates that they  must be treated according to the rules of the Geneva Convention,  and if a criminal act should lead to the death of a prisoner,  then the person responsible will be charged with murder and will  be court martialed. The court will have to reach a decision  within 24 hours and sentence will also have to passed in this  time. Another instruction is that the "transporting" of  prisoners will be the responsibility of "area commanders," who  will have to identify collection points before 24 January 1994.  RAPPORT has determined that this instruction has already been  carried out and that the so-called collection points are farms  in the northern Transvaal. The document does not mention Gen.  Constand Viljoen. At time of going to press he could not be  reached for comment.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / East Midlands adds to surge Regional electricity companies in England and Wales saw a second day of strong share price growth after East Midlands Electricity unveiled a 19 per cent dividend increase on the back of pre-tax profits up 13 per cent at Pounds 64m. Helped by an announcement that it was splitting the role of chief executive and chairman, East Midlands was among the main beneficiaries. Its shares rose 15p to 631p. Other gains were Manweb, up 17p at 716p, and Norweb, up 15p at 703p. East Midlands pushed up its interim dividend from 5.72p to 6.8p. The rise was slightly less than the 20 per cent bestowed by two other regional companies, but analysts saw scope for East Midlands to match others for the full year. Mr Norman Askew, recruited from TI in July 1992, will become chief executive from April, replacing Mr John Harris in that role. Mr Harris will remain executive chairman. His dual role has been one reason why the company's shares have been among the least favoured in the sector. Apart from East Midlands, only two regional electricity companies, Northern and Norweb, have chairmen who are also chief executive. Immediately after privatisation three years ago the role was combined in virtually all regional companies. East Midlands' pre-tax profits of Pounds 64m in the six months to September 30 compare with Pounds 56.5m last time, restated to reflect new coal contracts which are weighted towards the second half of the year. Turnover was Pounds 666.2m, against Pounds 681.5m, and earnings per share 22p, up from 18.9p. East Midlands said it was on target to reduce costs in the core electricity business by Pounds 15m a year. The programme, costing Pounds 8m to implement, involves cutting 500 jobs, leaving it with 4,100 against about 4,850 at privatisation. The reduction in the current year is about 300. Mr Harris said the cost cutting would give the company a strong position to enter negotiations with the industry regulator in the forthcoming distribution business review. 'We will do as well as anyone because of our cost base,' he said. Of the non-core activities, Ambassador in security made standstill profits of Pounds 900,000, and WJ Furse in lightning protection was 26 per cent up. People, Page 20 Lex, Page 24</p>

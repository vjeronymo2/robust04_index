			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Air France in plan to pool aircraft orders AIR FRANCE is planning to pool aircraft orders with Sabena, the Belgian airline, and CSA, the Czechoslovakian state carrier, two airlines in which it has taken large stakes this year. The scheme would allow recession-hit Air France and Sabena to transfer surplus orders to CSA, which is trying to revamp its largely Soviet-built fleet. It would take collaboration between the three far beyond previously announced deals on computer systems and aircraft maintenance. Mr Jiri Fiker, acting director-general of CSA, said the order pooling would allow the airline to take delivery of four Boeing 737 aircraft a year earlier than otherwise. He expects to take delivery of nine Boeing 737 medium-haul narrow-bodied aircraft over the next 18 months. Five of these orders are already secure, the result of a deal between Sabena and CSA in which the Belgian airline waived delivery of five new Boeing 737-500 aircraft worth about Dollars 200m (Pounds 108m). CSA took them instead, with the first being delivered to Prague last weekend. The remaining four consist of two 737-300s, which should be delivered next year as a result of the order pooling, said Mr Fiker, and two 737-400s, the largest in the range, which would be delivered in 1994. Mr Fiker added that the airline planned to order Airbuses, probably increasing its complement of Airbus A310 wide-body aircraft. Mr Ron Woodard, general manager of Boeing's 737 and 757 manufacturing division, said that CSA could eventually take up to fifteen 737s. In April, Air France and its Belgian financial partners injected BFr6bn (Pounds 100m) into Sabena in return for a 37.5 per cent stake. Earlier this year, Air France led a consortium of investors to take a 40 per cent stake in CSA in a Dollars 60m deal. Boeing is preparing to show its customers plans for a complete revamp of its best-selling 737 model. Changes will include new wings and new engines, where three consortia, Rolls-Royce, GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney, are in the running as supplier. Airlines will be consulted on the changes by the end of the year.</p>

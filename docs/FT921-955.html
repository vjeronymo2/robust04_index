			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Parties steer clear of a traffic jam - The Issues, Transport IT IS such a blindingly simple idea that it is a wonder no one has latched on to it. Why is none of the main parties promising to end road traffic congestion and make the trains run on time? A sure-fire vote winner it may be, but it is some tribute to the intractability of Britain's transport troubles that no one can give such an undertaking without testing the credibility of their policies to destruction. Panaceas, then, are thin on the ground in this campaign. Take the Conservatives. It is less than a year since Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, declared himself 'enthusiastically and unequivocally' in favour of getting more freight and passenger traffic on to the railways. Just how that was to be achieved was never altogether clear, but one departure from previous policies was Mr Rifkind's initiation of a study into road pricing - charging motorists for use of roads on a pay-as-you-go basis. This last idea was a nod towards the unpalatable fact that the proportion of passenger and freight journeys undertaken by the railways today is so small that even to double it would produce only a small hiccup in the rate of road traffic growth. With further road building heavily constrained by environmental considerations, the implication is that traffic congestion will eventually have to be tackled by pricing people off the roads. To say that that notion went down badly with Mr Rifkind's ministerial colleagues would be an understatement. Road pricing was struck off the political agenda as suddenly as it had appeared. Not surprisingly, the Conservative manifesto makes no mention of it, instead emphasising government plans to spend Pounds 6.3bn on road building. It is a similar story with railways. Mr Rifkind's ambitious plans to break up and privatise British Rail raised too many fears of higher fares and cuts in services to risk putting before a fickle electorate. Thus the Conservative manifesto retains the promise to sell off BR's freight trains because they do not carry voters, but privatisation of the passenger services has given way to more modest plans for allowing private-sector operators to run trains on BR's tracks. Even so, one significant change has survived the emasculation. In the next parliament, we are promised, the Tories would start franchising out the operation of existing BR services to the private sector. The attractive notion underlying the plan is that the private sector will turn out to be much better at running trains than state-owned BR. The bad news is that the record of the private railway companies in the pre-nationalisation era does not convincingly support that view. Would a Labour government do better? Like the Tories, Labour ducks the crucial issue of how to ration available road space among rapidly rising numbers of users. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, construes road pricing as an attack on the poor, and has taken to embarrassing Mr Rifkind by reminding him of his erstwhile enthusiasm for the idea. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour does not attempt to suggest that road building offers an alternative. Indeed, it says it will put a moratorium on road building until it has compiled a list of transport priorities. That will mean levelling the playing field between road and rail schemes by requiring both to be assessed on environmental, social and economic impact. Further investment, Labour's manifesto suggests, will be ploughed into the railways by freeing BR from the straitjacket of the public-sector borrowing requirement and allowing it to borrow from the private sector. How that is to be achieved without drastic changes to national accounting rules is not explained. Superficially, it is an attractive picture. Experience, however, has shown that improvements in public transport have little or no effect on traffic growth: so without pricing to discourage it or building to accommodate it, congestion could turn into paralysis. That is one bullet that the Liberal Democrats are prepared to bite. Like Labour, they are against the privatisation of BR and advocate similar means of shifting the balance of investment from road to public transport. But they promise to accompany the policy shift with road pricing in urban areas and phased increases in petrol prices. The Liberal Democrats, too, show a keen awareness of political realities with a whole raft of exemptions and concessions for motorists in rural areas  -the communities from which they draw their greatest support. Probably a hung parliament would find little to divide them from Labour: and, whatever the outcome of the election, the transport revolution may be a long time coming.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound closes at record low STERLING dropped to its lowest ever close against the D-Mark yesterday, after better than expected retail sales figures failed to convince foreign exchange markets that the government would not cut interest rates again in the near future, writes Emma Tucker. Mr Rob Loewy, a foreign exchange dealer at Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking, said: 'The scenario is that in spite of the reasonably optimistic numbers we saw today, stimulation of the economy will still be put ahead of the exchange rate.' Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency economist at UBS Phill-ips &amp; Drew, commented: 'The economic situation here still warrants lower interest rates. The markets have reassessed the economy and believe that, although the retail sales figures are better, the industrial sector is still very depressed.' A substantial amount of institutional selling of the pound for the French franc was reported in late trading and the strength of the D-Mark added to pressure on sterling. It closed in London at DM2.3500, down 1 1/4 pfennigs on the day. Against the dollar the pound was mildly lower at Dollars 1.4440, but later in New York it finished at Dollars 1.4455. The US currency continued to drift downwards, with the market still uncertain about President Clinton's State of the Union speech. Dealers were concerned that zealous reduction of the budget deficit through higher taxes would impede economic recovery. The dollar ended at DM1.6280, compared with the previous night's close of DM1.6315. It slipped further in New York to close at DM1.6235. The morning saw strong buying of the D-Mark, mainly at the expense of the Italian lira and the Danish krone. Enthusiasm for the German currency stemmed from a perception in the market that German monetary policy remained on course and that there would be no easing of rates at today's Bundesbank council meeting. The lira continued to be plagued by rumours of political corruption and economic weakness. Analysts said it was likely to remain under considerable pressure until it became clear whether or not the Italian prime minister intended to reshuffle his cabinet. The lira finished in London at L951.1 per D-Mark, against a previous close of L943.3. The French franc was slightly weaker against the D-Mark, with the market unable to make up its mind about the currency's direction. Some believe further pressure on the franc, in the wake of a right-wing parliamentary election victory, would lead to a fixed-rate link between the franc and the D-Mark. Yesterday Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr Michel Sapin, his French counterpart, ruled out such a mini-monetary union. Others believe that monetary easing in Germany will come early enough to rescue the French franc from devaluation. Mr Chertkow said he did not think investors were building up short franc positions.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN-CONTROL LEGISLATION  </P> <P> In response to John Paul's letter on the stand of the NRA as outlined in its  March full-page ad in The Times:  </P> <P> The five changes in the law called for by the NRA are an attempt at (in Paul's  words) "stopping criminals" from further violations -- but largely after a  crime has been committed. Proponents of gun control want to prevent crimes from  being committed. Too many guns are being purchased by people without any  criminal record who then go on to maim and kill innocent people. Citizens don't  need assault rifles and hunters don't need semiautomatic weapons to pursue  their sport (how sporting is it for their targets?)  </P> <P> NRA members are "zealots" and "gun fanatics," and no apology is due them.  </P> <P> TERRY FISHER  </P> <P> West Los Angeles  </P></p>

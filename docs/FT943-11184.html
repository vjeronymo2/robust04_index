			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Arts: Peacocks not penguins - Jeremy Isaacs defends laissez-faire dress codes at Covent Garden Lord Deedes leaned languidly against the wall of my retiring room at the Royal Opera House in the interval of a performance recently, and said: 'I believe the last time I was here, we wore white tie.' 'Really, Bill. Was it a grand gala?' 'Oh, nothing like that.' With a pleasant jolt, I realised we were back in another era; dances every night of the season; the bright young things; dressing for dinner; white tie and tails for the opera. Ah, halcyon days] England has moved on since then, and at Covent Garden all are welcome. Some come straight from the office; some straight in from the street. Black tie in the Royal Box, galas and important first nights. But normally, no dressing up. And as far as I can remember, since the gala for the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977, not a white tie to be seen. Clement Crisp, his collar and cuffs as immaculate as his commas and colons, has on this page (July 18) deplored current standards of dress at his favourite theatre, and even claims to detect signs of a national malaise in what he sees. Others take a different view, remarking favourably on the wide range of attire worn nowadays at the Met in New York, or at the Coliseum compared with business suits in the Royal Opera House stalls. The point is worth addressing, but it is not a necessarily a simple one. In Munich the other night at the festival, everyone seemed to have dressed up; the men in variegated finery; some of the women in frocks. But there was nothing formal about it. People come to ballet or opera to enjoy themselves and should dress as if they expect to do so. I am not for any formal requirement to wear particular clothes on an ordinary evening, but I love to see anyone on pleasure bent, even if it is only a dress or an eye-catching tie that sends the signal. Two factors in London militate against peacocks of the sort one constantly sees at Bayreuth or at Salzburg. Most of our patrons are not on holiday; they come to the opera directly from work and few have time to change before doing so. And then, when folk do dress, when a generous sponsor hosts a party, the men wear black tie. Anything less like a party than 50 men in identical, predictable black and white I cannot imagine; penguins are not peacocks. Come dressed for a party, I would sometimes like to say, in anything but black tie. Some visitors to the Royal Opera House, particularly in sweltering weather, come very informally dressed. Should we let people in in shorts? Some patrons think not, and occasionally write to me to say so. 'I didn't pay Pounds 100 for my stalls ticket, to sit next to a sweaty fellow in T-shirt, shorts and sneakers.' Now, everyone who pays taxes contributes to our funding. Everyone who buys a ticket does so also. We are the only publicly-funded opera house in Europe, after all, that earns as much at the box-office as we receive in grant. So all are welcome. We prefer, rather than instituting strict rules or issuing formal warnings about appropriate attire, to leave it to the discretion of our sensitive house management to exclude anyone whose dress will offend. (So far, the right of exclusion has not been exercised.) Not content with censuring the dress codes, Clement Crisp also thinks that there is too much eating and drinking going on. I cheerfully plead guilty to catering to our customers' needs. What is true is that we are cramped for space to serve them in. The Opera House was built in 1858. If you compare a plan of Barry's building with that of any other great lyric house in the world, it is striking to note how much of that space the auditorium itself occupies, and how little is left over for the public, to chat, saunter, eat, drink, even - why not? - see and be seen. The Crush Bar is not called that for nothing. And, although there is more demand than we can cope with, we all know that it is less than ideal to seat tables for supper in the crowded pit lobby or Crush Bar. But we need more space to serve our customers in, not a ban on their appetites. When the house is redeveloped, as it will be by the millennium, amenity for the public will be vastly improved. New spaces will be added, with restored Floral Hall serving as a great salon and a loggia looking out over the Covent Garden piazza higher up the House. Those who come to the Royal Opera House are entitled to a whale of a time. We shall not rest content until, in every respect that makes an evening happy, they can be certain of doing so.</p>

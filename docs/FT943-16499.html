			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: News round-up - Venezuela Venezuela's equity market gave a negative reaction to the new economic and monetary measures announced by the government last week, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. The Caracas stock exchange lost more than 10 per cent in the days following the announcement, which included controls on foreign exchange transactions and prices as well as the executive's assumption of extraordinary powers. Further bad news for investors came last Thursday when the administration of President Rafael Caldera assumed direct control over the country's financial system. A 47 per cent devaluation of the bolivar since the start of the year has pushed prices of strong Venezuelan industrials down to the level of 'penny stocks'. Over the first half of the year the Caracas stock index rose nominally by 24 per cent, however inflation remains a problem and could reach well more than 60 per cent by the year end.

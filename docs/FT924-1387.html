			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Management: Fashionable federalism - Christopher Lorenz casts a critical eye over new theories of how businesses should be organised Ever since the Maastricht treaty was negotiated a year ago, federalism has been a thorny subject in the world of European politics. At last week's Edinburgh summit, 'success' was achieved by evading the issue. But it will bounce back on to the British and Danish agendas in the new year, to universal consternation. In the world of business, however, federalism is suddenly in high fashion virtually everywhere. On the academic front, the latest issues of two of the world's leading management journals, California Management Review and the Harvard Business Review, contain long articles by top scholars extolling federalism as the only effective way for companies to be organised. Countless companies, from ABB to Benetton and BP, and from Coca-Cola to beleaguered IBM, have adopted a variety of new structures which academics - and sometimes the companies themselves - are dubbing 'federal'. But how federal, as opposed to just fashionable, are they? And is there anything that corporate practitioners can teach Europe's sparring politicians about the realities of international federalism? First, the sore subject of definition. To Charles Handy, Britain's premier professor of business organisation and the author of a 'new federalist paper' in HBR*, federalism is the best way to combine the autonomy of individual countries, states or business units with the scale benefits of co-ordination. The principle of federalism, says Handy, implies that power resides fundamentally with the constituent parts. They cede some of that power to the centre for the benefit of all. As such, federalism is distinct from decentralisation, which implies a delegation of power from an all-powerful centre. Californian professors James O'Toole and Warren Bennis, authors of 'Our Federalist Future' in the latest issue of the California Management Review**, make a similar point. The ideal federation is non-centralised, they say, rather than decentralised: power is withheld from the centre by constituent units, not handed down from it. It is not surprising that federalism is now the trend in business, say the duo. For it allows constituent units to maintain their own integrity while they unify for common purposes. They can reap the advantages of smallness and independence on some issues (such as sales and service) with the benefits of scale and integration on others (such as finance and purchasing). Hence the flood of business organisations which are breaking themselves down into small units. At the same time, their corporate head offices are giving up many of the powers they used to yield when, as at IBM, they treated 'their' whole company as a unitary organisation. Which brings us to the first of several limitations to the federal metaphor as applied to business. In most corporate cases cited in both articles, the process of 'federalisation' - if such a word exists - is occurring through the very process of decentralisation that is disparaged by the Californians. How could it be otherwise when the centre of an established, centralised company hands power out to the periphery? In the case of a newly-designed entity, such as ABB, the Californian duo's preferred notion of non-centralisation could, in theory, apply. But Handy and the Californians - specially the latter - underrate the degree of power held by the ABB centre in Zurich. Percy Barnevik, the group's Swedish chief executive, may make a point of talking about central 'reporting', rather than 'control', but the fact remains that his central 'business segment' heads have tremendous muscle to coax, mould and, if necessary, control people elsewhere in ABB. A different type of new, supposedly 'federal', organisation cited by the Californians is Benetton, the Italian clothing combine. This consists partly of subcontracted production (by suppliers) and retailing (by franchisees), plus centralised finance, design, development, purchasing and planning. In current management jargon, such a structure is certainly a 'network'. But can it really be called a federation when the main task of the suppliers is to serve the centre? Most franchisees are also controlled with iron authority by the central organisation. Is that 'federal'? O'Toole and Bennis also weaken their case by confusing federations with confederations. Handy avoids this studiously. He points out that in confederations, unlike federations, individual states yield virtually no authority to the centre. A further limitation of the federal metaphor as applied to business is in the degree of clarity and constancy of the separation of powers between centre and periphery. Most political federations have written constitutions, which are hardly ever changed. So do some companies. But this does not mean that, as business conditions alter, the balance of power cannot shift informally between the central authority and the units. It must be able to do so, within outline parameters, if a company is to be capable consistently of striking the optimum balance between integration and autonomy. In business, power-sharing with the centre will need to vary not only over time, but also as between business units, depending on their changing competitive, technological and financial circumstances. Even within a business unit, different value-adding activities - such as design, development, purchasing, production and marketing - will need, over time, to have different degrees of international integration or national differentiation (and semi-independence). As Handy says, federalism is a complex mix for a complex world: 'federalism is and must be flexible; it can never be static'. The list of distinctions between business and political 'federations' does not end there. Another, at least between a model business federation and the sort now envisaged by some European politicians, centres on the core federal concept of 'subsidiarity' - what sensible US academics prefer to call the principle of 'localness'. Unlike all the advocates of business federations, and some of their corporate practitioners, few European politicians outside Germany are prepared to apply the federal principle consistently right down their 'organisation'. The British government is the prime example, but there are others. Such inconsistency in a business organisation would render it ineffective, according to Handy, O'Toole and Bennis. For a company to be able to act quickly in today's climate, responsibility and power really do have to be kept at the most 'local' (lowest) level possible. As the foregoing makes clear, the meaning of federalism in a business context is at least as hotly argued as it is in the world of European politics. Depending on your point of view, it is either a pure term which is applied far too loosely, or a broad one which comes in various forms. Either way, the most sensible approach is to define exactly what one has in mind. Some academics distinguish, for instance, between 'decentralised federations' (such as Unilever for many years) and 'co-ordinated federations' (typified traditionally by Procter &amp; Gamble). The final point must be a highly practical one: that federations may be the best (or least bad) form of business organisation for the future, but that they are 'devilishly hard to manage', as O'Toole and Bennis aptly put it. Barnevik at ABB recognises only too well that though power-sharing is a very necessary act within today's organisation, this does not make it a natural one. It has to be worked at - hard. Barnevik clearly has plenty to teach the British and Danish governments. Perhaps, despite Swiss voting proclivities, the next summit should be in Zurich. * Balancing Corporate Power.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 3 (CTK) -- In reaction to the  Slovak-introduced import surcharge the Czech Republic will this  afternoon devalue the Czech crown by three percent within the  clearing ECU [European Currency Unit] which is used in payments  between the two countries, Premier Vaclav Klaus has announced.    Speaking after an emergency meeting of economic ministers,  Klaus said the Czech Republic expected the 10 percent surcharge  introduced as from Thursday to be in force only until July 1.    Klaus said that with the devaluation of the Czech crown by  three percent within the clearing ECU, the Czech crown would  return to the level existing before February 8, 1993, when new  payment relations with Slovakia were introduced.    He said the Czech side was disappointed that it had not been  sufficiently informed of the Slovak measure beforehand, at least  on the level of premiers or finance ministers, adding that he  had only verbal information about the Slovak step.    On the information available so far, the Czech side believes  the Slovak import surcharge is to last only until July 1, Klaus  said. Cabinet ministers believe that the newly introduced import  surcharge is identical to that existing in the latest stage in  the former Czechoslovakia. "The 10-percent import surcharge is  applicable primarily to goods designated for final consumption,"  Klaus said.    The Czech cabinet believes that the introduction of the  import surcharge de facto means "half-devaluation" of the Slovak  crown. "Devaluation concerns imports but not Slovak exports,"  Klaus said. He said the Czech side considered the Slovak step to  be fully legitimate and as an economic measure more acceptable  than the recent administrative measure by the Slovak Government  which complicated exports of Czech foodstuffs to Slovakia.    He said the Czech cabinet did not expect any general or  significant negative impact on the Czech economy due to the  Slovak measure. "It will rather have an impact on individual  regions, economic sectors and especially on individual firms,"  Klaus said, adding that for some Czech exporters it might mean a  temporary halt in exports or decrease in profits.    In view of the import surcharge, the Czech side intends to  ask Slovak authorities to abolish different administrative  measures which, Klaus said, have started to penetrate the  Czech-Slovak trade. He mentioned the measures recently  introduced by the Slovak customs which hampered exports of Czech  foodstuffs to Slovakia.    Klaus said the Czech Government would announce its readiness  to discuss the abolition of the old bloc of the clearing account  which is used for payments between the two countries for deals  carried out before February 8, 1993. He said the finance  minister will submit a material proposing the abolition of this  account to the government. The Slovak Government has approved a  similar material some time ago.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE COMEBACK KID  </P> <P> An unfortunate error in Pat H. Broeske's intriguing article about the ageless  writer Charles Bennett ("Now Here's a Real Comeback," Sept. 30): Scratch "Anna  Ondry." She never existed.  </P> <P> Hitchcock's choice for leading woman in "Blackmail" was the well-known German  actress Anny Ondra.  </P> <P> Ondra's private life was highlighted by her marriage to German heavyweight  boxer Max Schmeling. Schmeling is remembered as the fighter who knocked out Joe  Louis, only to be cut down himself in the first round of their rematch.  </P> <P> All that may be far less significant than the revelation long after the end of  World War II that Schmeling risked his life during the horrors of Nazi Germany  to hide and help save countless Jews who otherwise would almost certainly have  perished during the Holocaust.  </P> <P> ALAN HARVEY  </P> <P> Arleta  </P></p>

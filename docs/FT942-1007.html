			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / US 'blacklist' worries world shipowners: Dangers and confusion arising from listing sub-standard ships A crackdown on substandard shipping by the US Coast Guard is provoking concern among the world's shipowners. Some are worried that the 'blacklist' of companies whose vessels have been targeted for special safety checks when they enter US waters does not distinguish between serious offenders and those caught for minor problems. They are also concerned that the list, compiled for internal use by the coast guard but available to any inquirer under the US Freedom of Information Act, could be commercially damaging. Shipowners not on the list see it as a means of gaining competitive advantage. The International Chamber of Shipping, based in London, said that the principle of targeting substandard ships had been accepted in many countries but that publicly naming offenders had to be undertaken carefully when it could have commercial repercussions. 'It's a bit like reporting a road transport company because one of its lorries had a puncture,' said Captain John Joyce, marine manager. The coast guard's initial list was compiled in May and comprised 120 companies whose ships were to be targeted for special checks. A revised list, which with 137 names, became available last week. Fears about the threat to the marine environment following the grounding of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez off the coast of Alaska in 1989 prompted the tougher action by the US authorities, and a number of other countries have plans to introduce 'blacklists'. The coast guard's current list includes several well-known shipping companies as well as many smaller owners, managers or operators. One of the companies to appear on the list is Shell International Shipping, which has a fleet of about 70 gas carriers and oil tankers. Shell was put on the list because one of its gas carriers was found to have two four-inch cracks in its deck after a rough Atlantic crossing. 'This was very minor stuff,' said a spokesman. 'It was not structural and we repaired it in situ. Our vessels are maint-ained to a very high standard and we would say we are extremely responsible owners.' The similarity of many names in the shipping industry has also led to confusion with Worldwide Ship Management, a South American company which appears on the list, being mistaken by some readers of the list for World-Wide Shipping Agency, a Hong Kong group, which does not. The coast guard uses a unique identifying number for every company but this does not appear on the published lists. 'This was intended to be an internal document to help our marine safety officers use their resources better,' said Commander Peter Popko, a senior US coast guard official. 'We should not be boarding vessels with a good history. Because of the Freedom of Information Act the list is available to the public.' The coast guard believed its list was based on sound information but, if new evidence emerged, it would be willing to adjust its programme, he said. 'This has been running for less than two months and we are getting more information and feed-back from the industry.' Some companies on the first list had been taken off the second if they had been able to show they were not the owner or manager of the vessel when the infringement occurred.</p>

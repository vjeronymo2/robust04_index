			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Tokyo bribery scandal claims leading politician AN INFLUENTIAL Japanese politician, Mr Kiyoshi Kaneko, the governor of Niigata prefecture, resigned yesterday, prompting the country to wonder who will be the next to fall in a scandal over alleged bribes by a parcel delivery company. The resignation followed a confession last week by Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, that his political secretary had received Y500m (Pounds 2m) from Tokyo Sagawa Kyukyo, a parcel company. Mr Kanemaru stepped down as party vice chairman and said he would resign as leader of the LDP's largest faction, though the faction's members voted unanimously on Monday for him to retain that post 'to prevent confusion in the party'. The downfall of Mr Kaneko, aged 60, apparently came after a tap on the shoulder from Japanese prosecutors investigating Tokyo Sagawa, alleged to be behind Y500bn in illegal payments to senior politicians. Money was donated to win friends in high places, and prosecutors suspect that legislative favours were sought by the rapidly expanding company. Mr Kaneko has denied illegally receiving Sagawa donations to support his 1989 election, though his campaign workers have admitted taking at least Y100m and Japanese newspapers suggest that his office received Y300m. The governor said it is 'not appropriate' to comment on the allegations until the investigation is completed. 'For several days, I contemplated my future actions and decided to take political, ethical and all responsibilities for the confusion incurred in prefectural politics,' Mr Kaneko told prefectural officials in Niigata, on the western coast of Japan. Under the Political Funds Control Law, an individual can donate a maximum of Y1.5m to a politician, while companies capitalised at more than Y105bn are permitted to donate as much as Y100m to a party or politician over a year. Mr Kaneko's resignation is another stain on the LDP, as he was supported by the ruling party and had frequent contact with Mr Kanemaru, regarded as the party's power-broker because of his ability to raise campaign cash. Tokyo Sagawa was able to cultivate ties with senior politicians because of the enormous cost of Japanese political campaigns, and lists are circulating in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political district, naming a dozen politicians said to be under investigation for receiving Sagawa money.</p>

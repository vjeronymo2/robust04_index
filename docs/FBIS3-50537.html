			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Osvaldo Martinez, director of the Cuban </F> World Economy Research Center and chairman of the Permanent  Commission of Economic Affairs of the Legislative Assembly, by  Barbara Betancourt; date, place not given; from the "Evening  Information Review" newscast--recorded]    [Text] [Betancourt] At the end of the ordinary winter  session of the Cuban parliament, during which important economic  topics were discussed, I had the opportunity to talk to Mr.  Osvaldo Martinez, director of the World Economy Research Center  and chairman of the Permanent Commission of Economic Affairs of  the Legislative Assembly. Visibly satisfied, Martinez evaluated  the parliamentary meeting.    [Martinez] I believe I can tell you with conviction that the  expectations of the session were met. I believe we produced  what we wanted and what is fundamental: a collective reflection  of all deputies regarding important and difficult issues.    Given the level of the deputies' participation, obviously  the  speeches by the commander in chief, the amount of information  and ideas expressed during the meeting--and even the agreement  to hold a special period of sessions to continue the  discussion--I believe that the Cuban parliament has demonstrated  a formidable lesson of democracy. This stems from the fact that  generally these kinds of measures are taken suddenly,  clandestinely in some countries, and are not discussed in  parliament or later returned to parliament for further  discussion, as it will take place.    [Betancourt] I asked prominent economist Osvaldo Martinez  what he thinks of the statements by many deputies who are not  economists.    [Martinez] I think that this reveals our progression  regarding what we could call our people's economic culture. It  is a difficult and complicated matter that obviously has many  technical components. I believe, however, that our deputies, as  part of our people, have such a keen political sense and a sense  of defense of the revolution and its most vital interest that  this helps them extraordinarily; in addition, I believe the  deputies have seriously prepared for this period of sessions and  studied the state of the country's internal finances. I also  believe that I was pleasantly surprised by the level of  understanding and manipulation of the issues broached during the  debates.    [Betancourt] When certain deputies mentioned the  implementation of such measures as price increases, policies of  gradual taxation, the elimination or reduction of subsidies to  companies that do not yield profits as ways to resolve this  internal financial imbalance, may someone think these measures  respond, for instance, to IMF recipes?    [Martinez] These measures in no way respond to IMF  principles. I believe that during the discussion a principle  that was stressed throughout was that no one will be left  unsupported. No honest Cuban must be afraid of any measure that  may be implemented. I think these would be logical measures  that would be implemented due to the pressing need to achieve a  balance in internal finances as an important step to improve our  economy. Such measures would be aimed at the supreme objective  of saving the revolution and overcoming the special period; that  is why I believe that these measures can in no way be  considered--neither from their discussion methods or contents  --IMF-type measures.    [Betancourt] I pretty much know the answer to my next  question. What perspectives.... [pauses] What do you expect for  the 36th year of the revolution, which is about to start?    [Martinez] I expect a year of work, a year that will also be  difficult in economic terms. It will require a great working  and capacity of sacrifice from our people. I strongly believe,  however, that the worst part is now over. I believe we can  reasonably argue that the future will be better. We are  beginning 1994 not only with a greater ?apacity to resist but  also with more consolidated accomplishments and better economic  perspectives than those we had at the outset of 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marina Denisova: "The Uncertain Future of </F> Parliamentary Television" -- from IZVESTIYA-TV section]    [Text] Last week the State Duma decreed the setting up of  its own television and radio service. It was a difficult  process, it took a number of votes, and was passed by 10 votes  in the end. Viewers have not yet forgotten "Parliamentary Hour,"  which for the people was synonymous with a very boring and  biased political program imposed from on high. Will history  repeat itself and replicate a failed experiment? The days when  parliamentary spectacles replaced shows for the people are past.  The State Duma deputies are probably aware of this.  Nonetheless...    Yuliy Nisnevich, chairman of the parliamentary Subcommittee  on Computer Science and Communications, commented on the State  Duma decree at the request of IZVESTIYA-TV:    [Nisnevich] Among deputies there are two entirely different  approaches to the creation of a State Duma television and radio  service. One group believes that it must form its own  full-fledged television and radio company. This is clear from  the adopted decree and from the amendments to the law in  preparation "On Coverage of the Work of State Organs of Power in  the State Media." For example, amendments of the following kind:  The State Duma press service must have direct access to the  airwaves.    But there are deputies who hold a directly opposite view:  This television and radio service should be a department of the  Duma press service dealing with such technical matters as  television and radio recording of sittings of our parliament and  its committees and commissions and compilation of archive  material so that any journalist or interested organization can  obtain these materials to work on.    All is not straightforward. The thing is that there is  nothing in the Constitution entitling the State Duma to make  decisions like the creation of its own television and radio  company. Legally any state company can ignore this decree.    We have encountered manifestations of a public struggle for  the airwaves. Some deputies believe that television provides  insufficient coverage of their activities and their attitudes  are unknown to society. So they want to have their own airtime  and say what they see fit.    A draft decree was submittd by deputies from the Democratic  Party of Russia -- Travkin's party. It is actively supported by  the Communists and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia], which periodically organizes actions in the State Duma  in connection with the fact that the party is not being given  airtime.    "Russia's Choice" and "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy bloc] are of the  opposite view. The PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and  "12 December Alliance" partly share the same platform. The  democratic factions believe that the task is not to create their  own television and radio company, but to be given the  opportunity to talk about events taking place in the State Duma  in proportion to the coverage of the activities of the  government and the president. Unfortunately, the balance is  actually upset at the moment. The State Duma's work is not  reflected objectively enough and in sufficient detail on  television. For example, the Duma took a very significant step  when it adopted on first reading part of the Civil Code. This  is effectively the "foundation" of legislation, but our  television and radio companies somehow pass by such significant  matters without informing viewers and listeners of them.    If there is an important event taking place in the Duma,  society must be kept informed, perhaps with comments by the  leaders of various factions. We need programs that promote the  inculcation of the ideas of parliamentarianism within society.  We can manage without rigid, fixed airtime for  parliamentarians. But a clear understanding is needed. All  deputies and factions must be treated fairly.    We believe that all deputies with different views must have  equal opportunities to appear on television, regional as well as  central.    The decree on creating the television and radio service was  put to a vote repeatedly. When the LDPR faction stormed out of  the hall there were obviously not enough votes. But the "Women  of Russia" faction then played its part: First the deputies  wavered, but in the end they voted for the motion.    Our committee has now been instructed to elaborate a  blueprint for television coverage of parliament's activities.  Of course, the Duma will now seek to create its own television  and radio company. But it will cost an enormous amount, millions  of dollars! The Duma is unlikely to be allocated that kind of  money.    Will "Parliamentary Hour" return on the "Rossiya" television  channel? That depends on how the All-Russian State Television  and Radio Company conducts itself. As I said before, according  to the legislation, it need not play these games. Most likely  some compromise will be found.    In my view, this decree is another excuse for speculation by  representatives of the various factions, for another political  spectacle. [Nisnevich ends]    The deputies' wish to have their own television company is  understandable, although it looks to the public like a strange  caprice. They will probably want to take the money to set it up  out of the state purse. But the government has failed of late  to find sufficient funds to finance existing state television  companies. Television is being called "destitute." In this  situation the creation of a television and radio service to  satisfy the deputies' vanity is another piece of political  nonsense. Unfortunately, we have gotten used to this kind of  thing, grimly waiting for the moment when sober-mindedness and  common sense prevail.</p>

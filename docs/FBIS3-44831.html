			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Xiao Rui (5618 3843): "Industry </F> Sector of China's Economy Reenters the `Fast Lane'"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The State  Statistics Bureau has recently disclosed that in December 1993,  the industrial sector of China's economy rebounded rapidly. The  growth rate reached as high as 29.8 percent, nearly 11  percentage points over the previous month, and was close to the  highest point before macroregulation and control were exercised.    The main causes of the rapid growth rate in industrial  production in December 1993 were: First, the implementation of  the easy money policy beginning in November injected working  funds into many enterprises which were experiencing difficulties  caused by the shortage of funds so that these enterprises were  able to speed up their production; second, at the end of last  year, various localities tried all means to accelerate the  production progress in a bid to increase the base figures in the  upcoming tax sharing reform.    The super high speed operation of the industrial sector of  the economy last year was a necessity but it also caused people  to worry that the excessive growth in industrial production  would inevitably bring about various tense economic relations  again and cause a deterioration in the tense supply-demand  situation in "bottleneck" sectors.    According to reports, the annual growth in industrial  production in 1993 was 23.6 percent higher than the previous  year and was the highest level in the 15 years of reform and  opening up. Nongovernment owned enterprises continued to occupy  a leading position in the economic growth and their increased  output value accounted for 77.7 percent of the total newly  increased output value. The production development of coastal  areas was markedly faster than that of the hinterland. The six  provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, and  Hainan, whose annual growth rate exceeded 30 percent, are all  located along the southeast coast.    Viewed from the cycle of economic development, 1994 will  undoubtedly be a year with a medium to high rate of growth. The  domestic demands remain high, the investment scales in projects  under construction and carry-over investment are big, and the  readjustment in workers' wages will also give impetus to the  consumer goods market. On the other hand, various localities  will double their output ahead of schedule and this, together  with their strong aspirations to push the economy to a higher  level, will promote the industrial production to continue to  glide forward on the platform of a high speed growth rate in the  fourth quarter of 1993. It is estimated that the production  growth in the first quarter of this year will reach over 15  percent.    Authoritative people in economic circles have already  predicted that China's economy will have a relatively vigorous  rise again in the first few months of 1994 and hold that it is  necessary to implement, at the proper time, a relatively tight  financial policy to prevent the economy from becoming  "overheated" again.    The year 1994 is a "year of reform" in China. In order to  prevent some hidden unstable factors from being intensified and  from becoming obstacles in the process of reform, economic  specialists have warned against blindly seeking an excessively  high growth rate and have called for making greater efforts in  structural readjustment so that the industrial sector of the  economy can develop appropriately and healthily.</p>

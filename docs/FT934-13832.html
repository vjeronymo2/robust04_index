			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Orange juice goes on VAT list CUSTOMS &amp; EXCISE yesterday squeezed value added tax out of orange juice sellers after conflicting results in appeals by manufacturers last year. The 1993 Valued Added Tax (Beverages) Order, which was introduced in parliament yesterday, extends from the end of this year standard-rate VAT to all beverages except milk and other named exemptions. Customs said the change would provide up to Pounds 5m in additional VAT revenues, but stressed that it had introduced the change to introduce consistency to the rules. Its decision followed 'representations from UK apple juice producers' who were keen that their products, which are VAT-rated, should be treated in the same way as similar juices.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Waters sold Utilities attracted further selling across the board. Water shares were notably weak after Kleinwort Benson, the stockbroker, reaffirmed its bearish stance on the sector, in spite of steep falls over the past month. Kleinwort said it remained concerned about the sector's performance, primarily because of the economic recovery but also because of the regulatory review due to be published in 1994 and diminishing hopes of further UK interest rate cuts. The water companies' preliminary results season starts on May 26, with figures from North West Water. Over the sector Kleinwort expects profits to rise by 5 per cent, earnings by 7.8 per cent and dividends by 8.8 per cent. Of the water stocks in the FT-SE 100 Index, Thames was the worst performer, losing 7 at 500p, after 499p, following the death of the chairman, Sir Roy Watts. Anglian shed 6 to 488p, while Severn Trent dipped 5 to 480p and North West the same amount to 481p. Kleinwort told its clients to continue to switch into companies with strong financial ratios, such as Welsh Water and Southern.</p>

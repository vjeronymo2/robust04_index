			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, May 1 (XINHUA) -- The first vocational  school for criminals in China opened last week in Fuzhou,  capital of southeast China's Fujian Province.    Zhonghua (China) Vocational School of Fujian, which covers  an  area of 33 ha [hectares] in Minhou County, in Fuzhou Proper, was  jointly sponsored by the Provincial Reform-Through-Labor Bureau  and the Zhonghua Vocational Education Society of Fujian.    The school is aimed at reducing the rate of criminal  recurrence through helping offenders who will soon be released  to grasp an occupational skill so that they can stand on their  own when they return to society.    At present, the school teaches five vocations, including  repair and maintenance of motorcycles and of household  electrical appliances, cookery, cake-making and decoration.    For the first term it has enrolled more than 300 criminals  in  the province who have remaining sentences of less than half a  year, have good performance records and are willing to go to  school.    Three to four terms are scheduled for this year, each  lasting  for three to five months. About 1,000 will undergo training.    The curriculum will be renewed and expanded in line with  economic development, according to school officials.</p>

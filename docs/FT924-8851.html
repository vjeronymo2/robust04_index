			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Continental Airlines bid decisiondue today THE outcome of a bidding contest for Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection since late-1990, is expected to be announced today. Board members met over the weekend, and are due to present the winning proposal to the bankruptcy court today. Only two groups are known to have submitted proposals in the final round of the auction: Air Canada, in conjunction with Air Partners, a Texan investment partnership, and Mr Charles Hurwitz's Maxxam consortium, which includes Aeromexico, one of the largest Mexican carriers. By late yesterday, Air Canada and representatives of Air Partners were still waiting to learn of Continental's decision. 'We haven't heard anything,' said Mr John Ricketts, Air Canada's finance director. He said the airline expected to know the outcome this morning. Air Partners also said there had been no word from Continental. The Maxxam-led offer opened the bidding for Continental in early July, when the chairman of the Houston-based natural resources group, Mr Charles Hurwitz, presented a Dollars 350m (Pounds 225.80m) investment plan to the airline, giving his consortium a 72 per cent stake in the carrier once it emerged from bankruptcy. In October, this offer was improved when Aeromexico and other Mexican investors joined the consortium.</p>

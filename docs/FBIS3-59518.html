			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [UK Press Release from the Office of Public Service and </F> Science: "Technology Foresight Programme: The Search Is On."]    [Text] The Technology Foresight programme tomorrow takes  another step forward as we invite several thousand top technical  and market experts to become involved, announced William  Waldegrave, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister  for Science. Mr. Waldegrave was speaking at the Chemical  Industries Association annual dinner in London.    Mr. Waldegrave announced that he was writing to over 900 key  people in industry and the Research base. He said: "These  people represent the first step in recruiting a pool of several  thousand top technical and market experts who will together work  to identify the priority markets and technologies of the future."    Those experts identified by a process of co-nomination and  invited to contribute to this important programme, will be asked  to participate in workshops and share their views on markets and  technologies. This process will start in Spring 1994 with final  reports due to emerge early in 1995.    Mr. Waldegrave went on to say: "The main aim of Technology  Foresight - a key initiative announced in the White Paper  `Realising our Potential; a strategy for Science, Engineering  and Technology'- is to increase wealth creation and improve the  quality of life through a close partnership between scientists,  industry and government. As a result we hope scientists and  industrialists will come together to forge new networks and  contacts, to identify market trends and technological  opportunities, from which we will all benefit."    Mr. Waldegrave concluded: "Full involvement by scientists  and  industry will be crucial in making Technology Foresight a  success."  <H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>   1. Co-nomination is the technique being used to identify the  experts. It has been used successfully in the past to identify  key, active researchers in particular scientific and technical  fields. Co-nomination relies on individual experts identifying  others whom they regard as experts. They are in turn asked for  their own nominations in an iterative approach.    Feedback from the OST [Office of Science and Technology]  consultative seminars emphasises that equal weight needs to be  placed on market needs (market pull) and technological  opportunities (technology push). The co-nomination technique is  attempting to identify people with knowledge about markets as  well as technologies. Every effort will also be made to  identify people working in Small or Medium sized Enterprises  (SMEs) and encourage them to participate in Technology  Foresight. If the co-nomination process does not yield enough  people in these groups we will consider alternative methods to  ensure that they are adequately represented.    The co-nomination process will also encourage respondents to  identify `maverick' thinkers, as these may be particularly  useful in the Technology Foresight programme.    Participants are asked to categorise their expertise in one  of 19 areas, some market based, others technology based. The  final decision on how to divide the work into expert panel  sectors has yet to be taken by the Foresight steering group.    2.The consultation phase of the Foresight programme is  drawing to a close with the last `Focus on Foresight' seminar  being held at the University of Birmingham on 23 November 1993.    3.Media copies of the questionnaire and further information  on the co-nomination process and the Technology Foresight  programme are available from the OPSS press office.

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 YOUNG BOYS HIT BY CAR IN BUSY STREET;  </P> <P> ACCIDENT: SIX-YEAR-OLDS WERE RETURNING TO THEIR PRIVATE SCHOOL FROM A NEARBY  PARK AND WERE CROSSING THE THOROUGHFARE SINGLE-FILE WHEN THE LAST THREE IN LINE  WERE STRUCK.  </P> <P> Three young boys returning from an outing in the park with their schoolteacher  were seriously injured Thursday evening when they were struck by a car while  crossing a busy street near their school, police said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m. as nine first- and second-graders were  returning to Fairmont Private School, at 4757 Valley View Ave., from Valley  View Youth Park, a small area within Hurless Barton Park, across the street,  Brea Police Lt. Cliff Trimble said.  </P> <P> The unidentified teacher was at the head of a single line of students and had  just crossed the southbound lanes of Valley View Avenue in a section of the  street not marked by a crosswalk when the last three children in line, all  6-year-old boys, were struck by a car.  </P> <P> Two of the children were taken by paramedics to UCI Medical Center in Orange  and were being treated for "critical trauma" injuries, according to Michele  Palmer, a dispatcher for the Orange County Fire Department.  </P> <P> The third child was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana and was listed in  serious condition, Palmer said.  </P> <P> None of the victims were identified.  </P> <P> The driver of the vehicle, a late model Camaro, was taken to police  headquarters for questioning and then released.  </P> <P> Trimble said the accident was under investigation but would not say whether the  driver might be charged.  </P> <P> The accident shocked teachers and students at the school, a private academy  that offers preschool through second-grade education.  </P> <P> School director Lynn Thatcher said it is a part of the daily school regimen for  teachers to take their students to the park for a play period.  </P> <P> Thatcher said students are commonly escorted across the street to the park,  which is directly opposite the school, even though there is no marked  crosswalk. The closest crosswalk is about 100 yards north of the school near  Orange Avenue.  </P> <P> Some residents and business owners near the school said traffic conditions can  be hazardous at dusk because vision is obscured by a glare from lights on  playing fields at the park.  </P> <P> "It's a difficult time to see, and cars are always speeding through here," said  Michael Castillo, who owns a video-production business near the school.  </P> <P> Castillo, a Corona resident, said his 3-year-old son attends the private  school.  </P> <P> "I've seen them cross the street before. They look like little ducks all lined  up behind the mother duck," he said. "They are very careful; it's a routine."  </P> <P> However, Castillo's wife, Jettie, said many residents have worried that an  accident might occur.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, something will be done because of this to make it more safe," she  said. "We all walk across that street and I know that cars go too fast."  </P></p>

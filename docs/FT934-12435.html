			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Doubts over German nuclear industry: SPD rejects plans for new generation of extra-safe reactors GERMANY'S opposition Social Democrats yesterday rejected plans to allow development of a new generation of extra-safe nuclear reactors in the country, throwing into doubt the future of the German nuclear industry. The decision by the national executive of the SPD was immediately condemned by leaders of the governing coalition as undermining the fundamental development prospects of the German economy. It throws into doubt the year-long efforts to negotiate a cross-party 'energy consensus' intended to provide a clear framework for the investment plans of the energy industry, including both domestic coal mining and nuclear power. It also calls into question the long-term future of the German coal industry, which has survived so far on a mixture of direct subsidy paid by electricity consumers and cross-subsidies from nuclear power paid by the electricity generators. The SPD, which controls the governments of several key states in the federal republic where nuclear plants operate, also declared its determination to switch from reprocessing nuclear waste - in Britain and France - to direct disposal. However, the party leadership has left open the question of how long the present generation of nuclear plants may be allowed to operate, thus giving Germany's electricity generators a chance to plan the gradual abandonment of nuclear energy. It also set no timescale for the switch from reprocessing to direct disposal, for which there are no sites currently available in Germany. In spite of its decision, the SPD remains divided on the nuclear issue. While the environmental wing of the party is fiercely opposed, those who come from coal-mining areas, like the Ruhr, are sympathetic. They believe that Germany's expensive domestic coal industry can only be guaranteed a long-term future if its high cost can be offset by the much cheaper supply of nuclear-generated power. The SPD decision was announced after the party's national executive rejected a compromise put forward by Mr Gerhard Schroder, the prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony, allowing a continuing 'nuclear option'. The decision amounts to a severe blow to Germany's nuclear power plant manufacturers, led by Siemens KWU, but a compromise with which the two main electricity generators, RWE and Veba, can live. The third main power generator, the Munich-based Bayernwerk, is heavily committed to nuclear energy, and therefore strongly opposed to any non-nuclear option. Without a cross-party compromise on energy, the power generators say they have no clear framework for their long-term power station planning. Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, who negotiated the compromise with Mr Schroder, expressed his regret at the SPD decision. 'I cannot see how, under these circumstances, a energy consensus can still be achieved,' he said. Negotiations scheduled for tonight will still go ahead, he said. 'Failure of the talks would be a bitter setback for Germany's economic base, for which the SPD would be responsible.'</p>

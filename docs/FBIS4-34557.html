			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Daly Valet; passages within </F> quotation marks in French]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] U.S. officials continue to  surprise us as the Haitian political crisis continues.  Following reports that some republicans plan to move President  Aristide to La Gonave Island, the latest news is that U.S.  officials intend to move a ship that is carrying propaganda  against the military putschists into Haitian waters. The  propaganda reportedly aims to force noncommissioned officers and  soldiers to take up arms against Generals Cedras and Biamby and  Michel Francois.    Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde is not  pleased. The deputy says it would be immoral for the U.S.  Government to stir up trouble inside the Army and a civil war in  Haiti. Frantz Robert Monde asks: Can we ask straight Marines to  rise up against their gay colleagues?    [Begin recording] [Monde] This is like those men planning to  have Aristide go to La Gonave, like those men saying that there  must be intervention in Haiti. "Those men want to  sensationalize." Can you imagine a radio station (?being set  up) in the harbor, calling for soldiers to rise up? The  soldiers want to destroy them, as well. I will take the  hardline position whenever they take such a position.    [Valet] They say they guarantee that nothing will happen to  those who rise up against the generals, that they will do  nothing to the police or soldiers.    [Monde] They know they are lying to the little soldiers.  They know they will destroy the little soldiers because they  know that the little soldiers staged the coup d'etat. They know  very well that it was not the generals. "They go through the  generals to get to the little soldiers." I have never discussed  my position on Cedras, but "I am opposed to getting rid of the  entire Army high command in favor of Aristide. It is out of the  question." [passage omitted]    "Can we ask a Marine who has more or less morality to rise  up  against his president?" It would be immoral for the United  States to do that. They do not have this right. "Stirring up  trouble and civil war in Haiti and arousing army against army is  not a responsible position. Can we ask straight U.S. Marines to  rise up against gay Marines? No, it is out of the question."  [end recording]    The Chamber of Deputies president says that Duly Brutus and  Datus Milcent have gone to Washington to discuss the Haitian  political crisis with the Republicans and the Democrats. Bob  Monde says these legislators will denounce the U.S. invasion  plans and William Gray's behavior during the Haitian crisis:    [Begin Monde recording] I asked them to denounce and fight  the intervention issue. Second, I asked them to stress Gray's  negative influence on U.S. policy toward Haiti. Gray left  Congress for shady reasons and is not credible enough to  negotiate a crisis today. Gray has managed to secure the job of  President Clinton's representative. Unfortunately, he only  remains under Aristide's table. He listens to and only repeats  all that Aristide says. We do not have many options with Gray.  The only option is intervention. You see, "this is the  reaction of the negro who has not yet freed himself from the  influence of his environment." I think this is very grave. We  have no chance of emerging from this crisis when a man like this  is involved. [end recording]    As for the upcoming 25 June deadline, the Chamber of  Deputies  president says Haitians must resign themselves to the economic  sanctions. he asks them, however, to cope with the embargo. He  also wants negotiations to resume. Apparently, this call for  negotiations will not have (?the desired results) since all the  protagonists are preparing to (?fight). The de facto family's  song is: Grenadiers, to the assault! We do not care about  those of us who might die! [grenadye alaso, sa ki mouri zafe a  yo]</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA JOLLA  </P> <P> A woman accused of shooting a worshiper in the back at a church was committed  to a state mental hospital Friday after a judge declared she was mentally  incompetent to stand trial.  </P> <P> Patricia Perrellis, 41, a transient, is charged with shooting Michelle  Gallagher, 40, a La Jolla real estate agent, at the Mary Star of the Sea  Catholic Church in La Jolla on March 2.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge Charles Hayes ruled that Perrellis is mentally  incompetent to stand trial. He relied on the opinion of court-appointed  psychiatrists.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Collins said Perrellis must prove she has regained her  competency before she can be released from Patton State Hospital and put on  trial.  </P> <P> "It's pretty clear by the reports that she's not competent," said Collins.  </P> <P> Perrellis talked in gibberish and could not understand what her attorney was  trying to tell her, said Collins.  </P> <P> Gallagher told police she was in the church foyer when a woman approached her  and asked where the confessional was. Gallagher said she was walking out of the  church when the woman fired a single shot at her from a small-caliber  derringer.  </P> <P> Perrellis faces a second attempted-murder charge stemming from another incident  the same day, several blocks away, in which Colette Cholaki, 24, of La Mesa,  said Perrellis pointed a gun at her in a parking lot. The gun misfired.  </P> <P> A Municipal Court judge ordered that Perrellis be examined by psychiatrists  March 9, after she staged several outbursts in court.  </P></p>

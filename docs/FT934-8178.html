			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / OFT blocks alarm companies' licences THREE COMPANIES selling burglar alarms lost their consumer credit licences yesterday after complaints about high-pressure selling and customers being frightened into buying. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said some of their business practices were 'abhorrent'. The Office of Fair Trading said Advanced Security Systems - which previously traded as Property Watch UK - as well as Vector Security and Vector Homelinked Security, were not fit to hold the licences. The three companies are all run from the same office in Manchester, and have overlapping directors. The two Vector companies are to appeal. Advanced Security Systems, the only one of the three companies to employ salespeople, closed voluntarily six months ago after the OFT had investigated evidence from the local trading standards department following complaints. The OFT said salespeople would tell potential customers that burglars would throw boiling fat or water over anyone who disturbed them. Some salespeople were found to have offered householders a security survey which was then used to persuade them to install alarms, the OFT added. Some presentations were dragged out - in one case for more than nine hours - to wear down resistance. Mr Alan O'Brien, co-owner and manager of the companies, said yesterday there had been only 26 complaints in more than 11,000 sales over four years. Advanced Security Systems had employed salespeople on a basic wage, plus car, with the bulk of earnings coming from commission. He had been 'horrified' to hear of 'sales misdemeanours', which he said were confined to 'five or six salesmen only'. Sales training had never included the methods described by the OFT.</p>

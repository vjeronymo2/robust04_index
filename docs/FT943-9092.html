			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Accountant's employee monitoring 'failed' A leading accountant failed to make sufficient inquiries into the private activities of an employee later convicted of forgery and deception, his professional body has concluded. Details of proceedings by the disciplinary committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales against Mr Brian Worth were revealed yesterday. The committee found that Mr Worth, former chairman of Clark Kenneth Leventhal (CKL), an international network of accountancy firms including Clark Whitehill in the UK, knew that Mr Nicholas Young was conducting private business from the firm's offices but received only imprecise responses to inquiries about this business. Mr Young, a former executive director of CKL, was convicted at the Old Bailey three years ago and has since been released from jail. While claiming to invest money in offshore trusts offering high rates of return he was actually spending it on a system of horserace betting and on sustaining his lifestyle. The proceedings of an appeal by Mr Worth against disciplinary action show that Mr Young paid CKL several thousand pounds each year - a significant proportion of CKL's total income - in connection with his private activities, which the committee says he described to Mr Worth as 'certain clerical services to unidentified overseas clients'. After the original hearing in November Mr Worth, former head of the institute's investigation committee, was 'admonished' and ordered to pay Pounds 1,000 in costs. The appeal hearing upheld this ruling and Mr Worth was ordered to pay a further Pounds 1,000 in costs. The committee said he had failed to make adequate inquiries into Mr Young's work and that he had responsibilities as chairman of CKL and as a chartered accountant to supervise and monitor all Mr Young's activities. It concluded that he was not entitled to rely without further inquiry on the 'inadequate' explanations given to him by Mr Young on the source and nature of payments. It said his failure to make further inquiries 'would have caused concern and surprise to most right-thinking members of the public'. The committee stressed that Mr Worth was of good character, had always acted honourably and had been genuinely misled by Mr Young. There was little chance further inquiries could reasonably have led to the detection of the fraud.</p>

He said that  that "falls under the powers of the court, to which all  publication issues are referred."    Expressing his eagerness not to disturb relations between  Kuwait and Arab states by publishing reports insulting them,  Shaykh Sa'ud al-Sabah, who is visiting London today, said:  "Just as we do not accept the publication of articles or topics  insulting Kuwait and its people, it is natural for us to  appreciate the position of the states which are not satisfied  with what our newspapers are publishing about them."    Shaykh Sa'id, who was Kuwait's ambassador to London and  Washington before his appointment as information minister in the  current Kuwaiti Government, said that "the Gulf region is  experiencing critical conditions caused by the Iraqi regime."  He stressed "the need to reorganize our Gulf priorities and  seek to unite the Gulf Cooperation Council states, including the  military strategy."    Speaking about Iran's role, the Kuwaiti information minister  said that Iran is one of the states which should "join us in  safeguarding Gulf security and stability."    Shaykh Sa'ud stressed that "we are thinking about the  region's conditions now but are working and planning for  posterity." He emphasized that "Kuwait is ready for all  possibilities that may arise from a change of conditions in Iraq  and the downfall of Saddam Husayn's regime."</p>

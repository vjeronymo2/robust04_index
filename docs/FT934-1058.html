			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Bonds: GECC injects life into quiet CDollars sector ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market was quiet in the run-up to Christmas yesterday, apart from a last-minute attempt by Wood Gundy to narrow the gap with ScotiaMcLeod in the Canadian dollar sector. ScotiaMcLeod, which has lead-managed CDollars 5.3bn worth of Canadian dollar-denominated Eurobond and global bond offerings this year, has wrested the number one slot from Wood Gundy. Before yesterday's CDollars 125m offering for GECC, Wood Gundy had underwritten just over CDollars 5bn worth of business. GECC's Eurobonds, which had a maturity of just under six years, were priced to yield 15 basis points over Canadian Treasuries. Wood Gundy said the yield spread on the bonds was comparable to or slightly more generous than spreads on GECC's outstanding Canadian dollar paper. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly to 14 basis points. Wood Gundy added that the borrower wanted to raise funds with a maturity of more than five years where its funding targets were less aggressive. The bonds appealed mainly to investors in Switzerland and the Benelux where GECC has a strong following. Elsewhere, European Sovereign Investments, a bond-arbitrage company based in Luxembourg, launched a SFr150m issue of three-year floating-rate notes which are secured by European Union government bonds. Lead manager Credit Suisse said the notes, which carry a coupon equal to six-month Libor, were targeted at money-market and short-term funds. The notes had an issue price of 100.50 and in the early afternoon they were quoted at less 0.60 bid, which Credit Suisse said was inside undisclosed fees. Credit Suisse has set up a Dollars 1.5bn Euro-medium term note programme which will be used as a shelf for the bank's future public and private borrowings in the Eurobond market. Credit Suisse is expected to start using the programme in the new year. The programme, which was signed late last week, was arranged by CS First Boston, CSFB Effectenbank AG and CS First Boston France SA. The notes can be issued for any maturity between one month and 30 years and in a broad range of curren-cies. NatWest Capital Markets and N M Rothschild have arranged a Pounds 150m five-year credit facility for T&amp;N, the UK motor components and engineering group. The annual margin on the syndicated revolving facility is 47.50 basis points over Libor for the first three years and 50 basis points over Libor for the last two years. The participation fee for managers is 12.50 basis points and 7.50 basis points for participants.</p>

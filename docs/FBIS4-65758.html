			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Umit Sezgin report: "Nine Militants Killed, 1,000 Others </F> Wounded in Zalakh Camp"]    [Text] Al-Sulaymaniyah--BIRAYATI [as published], the organ  of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan, reported yesterday that  nine militants from the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] were  killed and 1,000 others injured when several Turkish military  aircraft attacked the PKK camp in Zalakh two days ago.  Meanwhile, the PKK, which recently established close relations  with Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan  [PUK], has issued a statement on the attack through that party.  The PUK official in Irbil said that Kala Dizeh, commander of  the Zalakh camp, informed his office that "the attack by the  Turkish military planes was completely unsuccessful. No one was  killed or wounded."    The air attack on the camp created a shock wave in northern  Iraq. Many of the PKK militants, who did not expect another  attack after the air raid in February, had already returned to  the camp. With the return of the militants, the military  officials in Turkey ordered several F-4 and F-104 aircraft to  take off from their bases in Malatya and Diyarbakir to attack  the camp for the second time. It has been reported that all the  buildings and other constructions in the camp were destroyed.  Meanwhile, it has been learned that groups of PKK militants  have begun to leave the vicinity of the camp.</p>

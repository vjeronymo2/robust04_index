			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / AT&amp;T wins Dollars 4bn Saudi telecoms contract AT&amp;T of the US has won one of the largest contracts in telecommunications history with a deal worth more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) to modernise Saudi Arabia's telecommunications. The contract, announced last night, marks a significant advance in AT&amp;T's drive to expand outside North America. The company said that the project was 'a big boost to our globalisation efforts'. The order is also in part the fruit of intensive lobbying by the US administration. President Bill Clinton wrote to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia urging that AT&amp;T be chosen ahead of international rivals, which included Siemens of Germany and LM Ericsson Telephone of Sweden. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, welcomed the contract as an example of the effectiveness of the Clinton administration's promotion of US business. 'This intensely competitive process and the size of the contract has commanded top priority from this department and this administration over the last eight months,' Mr Brown said in Johannesburg, where he was attending the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. Mr Brown has shuttled backwards and forwards to Saudi Arabia over the last year as part of efforts to cajole the kingdom into picking US suppliers not only for the telecommunications contract but also for Dollars 6bn of aircraft orders secured by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Mr Alawi Kayyal, Saudi minister of Post, Telegraph and Telephone, said: 'AT&amp;T was the best, both technically and in cost.' The seven-year Saudi plan includes the installation of digital switching and fibre-optic equipment for 1.5m new phone lines. The project includes a new wireless network, aimed initially at providing cellular phone and wireless data services to 200,000 subscribers. When completed, the project will nearly double the country's fixed-wire telecommunications capacity. The order builds on AT&amp;T's existing base in the Middle East, which includes a contract to supply half a million phone lines to Egypt and a new cellular mobile network to the United Arab Emirates.</p>

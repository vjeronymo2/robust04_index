			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Stress helpline is launched WORKERS suffering from stress are to be offered instant help on where to find Tai-Chi exercise sessions or even juggling classes to help them relax, following the launch yesterday of a one-stop anti-stress service for companies. The service by Mind, the mental health charity, will tackle more serious emotional problems with a 24-hours-a-day counselling service. Stress management courses will also be provided by the charity. Mind expects more than 1,000 organisations to join the Pounds 600-a-year programme. Companies will get extra peace of mind from the fact that the covenanted fee to Mind will count as a charitable donation and can therefore be offset against tax. Stress and other emotional difficulties are estimated to cost Pounds 7bn a year - at least half of which is calculated to be a direct cost to industry through reductions in productivity. A total of 80m annual working days are lost, according to Department of Health figures.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADITIONAL KOSHER PRODUCTS APPEAR POISED TO COMPETE WITH 'IN' FOODS;  </P> <P> TRENDS: THE STRICTLY PREPARED FOOD IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR WITH A  LARGER NUMBER OF NON-JEWISH CONSUMERS.  </P> <P> Can it be that kosher food has become trendy? Can traditional Jewish cooking  that depended for oh-so-many years on brisket, blintzes and borscht really  compete with the likes of such bona fide "in" cuisines as Southwest and Thai?  </P> <P> Sounds improbable, but the word from those who deal in kosher foods is a  qualified yes.  </P> <P> Product variety and availability have exploded, kosher mavens note, gourmet  kosher restaurants now serve top quality Continental, Oriental, Mexican, Indian  and other non-traditional dishes, and upscale hotels are investing big money to  compete for kosher catering dollars.  </P> <P> Even kosher wines, long-disdained by connoisseurs as far too sweet and syrupy,  now compete with premium non-kosher wines. The 1986 Alexander Valley Cabernet  Sauvignon produced by Gan Eden, a small, kosher winery located in Sebastopol,  Calif., has just taken top honors in its category in Wine&amp;Spirits  magazine's 1989 American Wine Champion competition. The award is one of  three-dozen medals won by the label over the past five years.  </P> <P> "The last decade has seen kosher go from relative obscurity tucked away in a  corner of the market to the level where often more than one-third the products  on a market's shelves are kosher," said Menachem Lubinsky, president of New  York-based Lubicom, a leading kosher marketing firm.  </P> <P> However, only a small fraction of that amount -- about $1.5 billion -- is  actually spent by Jews who follow their faith's complex set of dietary laws  known in Hebrew as kashrut, Lubinsky pointed out. "That's an indication of how  much the kosher market extends beyond observant Jews," he said.  </P> <P> "It's like sushi," added Marvin Pearlman, president of A1 International Foods  in Los Angeles, the largest kosher food distributor west of New York. "Non-Jews  eat kosher food because they think it's exotic."  </P> <P> The Northeast, with its large Jewish population, is the nation's prime kosher  market. Southern California, however, has quietly slipped into second place in  the kosher sweepstakes.  </P> <P> There are now nearly 40 kosher restaurants in Los Angeles scattered over the  area from downtown to the west San Fernando Valley (these should not be  confused with kosher-style restaurants, such as Canter's on Fairfax Avenue).  </P> <P> One of Los Angeles' better-known kosher restaurants is the Milky Way run by  Steven Spielberg's mother, Leah Adler, on West Pico Boulevard. Just down the  street are China on Rye and Pepe Tam, which offer kosher Chinese and Mexican  dishes.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, such upscale hotels as the Beverly Hilton and Century Plaza are  finding that a larger proportion of their catering is kosher.  </P> <P> "Thirty-percent of our total catering business is kosher, and it goes up every  year," said Carlo Karim, food and beverage director at the Beverly Hilton  Hotel, which recently spent $600,000 to install a kosher kitchen complete with  its own dish-washing area, refrigerators, ovens and food preparation tables.  </P> <P> At the Century Plaza Hotel, catering director Jim Ries said that as much as 50%  of the hotel's non-convention catering is now kosher and that "it has increased  dramatically in recent years."  </P> <P> "Eating kosher has become a fad in Los Angeles," said Rabbi Aryeh Weiner, who  keeps tab of the West Coast kosher scene for the Union of Orthodox Jewish  Congregations, the largest of the many rabbinical watchdog groups that certify  products as being kosher. "Because of that, kosher consumerism in Los Angeles  is far ahead of anywhere else in the United States."  </P> <P> Perhaps the strongest indication yet that Southern California is now big time  in the kosher world came last weekend with the staging of the International  Jewish Festival at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Previous festivals have  been held the past few years in New York and Miami, but this was the first time  the kosher foods expo was staged on the West Coast.  </P> <P> The festival, which ended Monday and drew more than 20,000 people, according to  event organizers, featured more than 40 kosher food producers. Included were  such food industry giants as Borden's, Post Cereals and H.J. Heinz, which  became the first national brand to cater to kosher consumers when it introduced  canned, kosher vegetarian baked beans in the mid-1930s.  </P> <P> Other booths touted kosher restaurants and caterers and one firm that builds  kosher kitchens complete with three sinks to insure that meat, dairy and  neutral, or parve, foods do not unintentionally come in contact with each other  in violation of kosher guidelines.  </P> <P> Kosher regulations, which are based on biblical passages and later rabbinical  interpretations, are extremely complex. A quick rule-of-thumb to remember is no  pork, shellfish or the mixing of dairy and meat no matter how minute the  quantity. Also, to be kosher, fish must have scales and wine or grape juice  must come from Jewish sources.  </P> <P> A visit to the convention center provided a convincing lesson into the changing  nature of kosher foods. Goat cheese, frozen pizza, Middle Eastern spicy salads,  Chinese fortune cookies, Italian wines, Mexican-style sauces and dips and even  a chocolate-flavored desert pasta competed for attention. Just a few years ago,  none of these items were available to kosher consumers.  </P> <P> One of the more dramatic signs that kosher food has changed was the booth  manned by Alan Kapalinsky, president of Mendel's Haymish Brands of Brooklyn,  N.Y.  </P> <P> There to be sampled were what appeared to be three of the kosher world's  best-known no-no's: crab, lobster and shrimp. To avoid any possible confusion,  however, Kapalinsky markets the products (made from pollack fish seasoned and  shaped to resemble the real thing) under his "It's Not Crab," It's Not  Lobster," and "It's Not Shrimp" brand names.  </P> <P> "Just the thought of this being the real stuff is too much for some religious  Jews," said Kapalinsky. "This is a very emotional product for those that keep  kosher. Some feel they are happy to have the taste. Others feel they shouldn't  even like the taste."  </P> <P> Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the controversy, Kapalinsky said the "It's  Not . . ." line has doubled its sales volume each of the past three years. He's  also done well enough to attract the attention of competitors.  </P> <P> Empire Kosher Poultry, the nation's largest supplier of kosher chicken and  turkey products, is about to come out with "Tovafish," which will also taste  like shrimp.  </P> <P> A major reason for the broadening of the kosher palate epitomized by the  introduction of "It's Not . . ." and "Tovafish" is the growing number of  younger Jews who have become kosher after years of eating non-kosher foods. A  second factor is that greater exposure to the non-kosher world has prompted  even some people who have always kept kosher to try more exotic tastes.  </P> <P> "I think the kosher market is simply reflecting the general market," said Gil  Marks, editor and publisher of the Kosher Gourmet Magazine, a 4-year-old,  bi-monthly magazine with a national circulation of 10,000. "The general  American consumer is less xenophobic, more willing to try other ethnic cuisines  and more concerned about taste and quality.  </P> <P> "The same holds for the kosher consumer."  </P> <P> Aside from Jews, Muslims and Seventh-day Adventists also regularly buy kosher  foods because their religions have dietary codes that are in some ways similar.  Additionally, vegetarians and people with allergies to dairy or shell fish seek  out kosher brands because they know by-products that are often hard to trace to  their source will be clearly identified in processed kosher goods.  </P> <P> And despite traditional kosher cuisine's reliance on fatty and sweet  ingredients, health food aficionados also gravitate toward products market  kosher.  </P> <P> "The perception is that kosher foods are so carefully watched that the  heckhsher (kosher certification symbol) is like a Good Housekeeping seal of  approval. People equate this close supervision with quality control and  healthier ingredients," said Lubicom's Lubinsky.  </P> <P> Pepperidge Farms public relations executive Ann Davin agreed. "Non-kosher  consumers see the kosher symbol and think quality. That symbol alone carries  weight, and because it does it often gives a product an edge in the fight for  supermarket shelf-space," she said.  </P> <P> Since Pepperidge Farms "went kosher," as Davin puts it, two years ago, the  company has upped sales by as much as 15% in areas where Jews are concentrated  and where non-Jews tend to be familiar with kosher products, she said.  </P> <P> Whether adherence to kosher standards insures a healthier product is  debateable, however. Rabbis concerned with monitoring kosher products say their  priority is Jewish law, not health concerns.  </P> <P> "A label that says something is kosher doesn't make it healthier," noted Weiner  of the Orthodox Union. "What it does mean is that what the label says is  absolutely accurate, be it junk food or whatever."  </P> <P> The only kosher foods -- aside from specially prepared low-calorie,  low-cholesterol or low-salt products -- that are generally healthier than their  non-kosher competition, Weiner and others said, are meat and poultry raised,  slaughtered and processed according to kosher guidelines.  </P> <P> Alan Katz, vice president of sales and marketing for Pennsylvania-based Empire  Kosher Poultry, said that unlike much of the non-kosher poultry industry, his  birds are never fed growth stimulants, hormones or artificial ingredients to  avoid internal organ defects that would render them non-kosher.  </P> <P> Rabbi Yale Butler, who writes a kosher food column for his Los Angeles weekly  newspaper, the B'nai B'rith Messenger, explained that soaking and salting  kosher meats using only cold water and the draining of all blood also insures  that kosher meats will have lower bacteria counts, a safeguard against  salmonella and other food-related diseases.  </P> <P> "The rabbis reject what the government often passes as safe, healthy meat,"  Butler said.  </P> <P> Of course, the extra level of supervision required for kosher foods also means  higher prices. Jack Kotlar, the owner of Kotlar's Kosher Market in the  Pico-Robertson area, said meat, poultry, cheese and other products that need  special handling or ingredients to be certified kosher can cost twice as much  as their non-kosher competitors.  </P> <P> Still, he said, the number of kosher consumers in Los Angeles has increased  tremendously. "In 1975 when I opened, there was nothing here. Now at least  seven kosher markets have opened up within blocks of me in the last half-dozen  years," he said. "The competition has become fierce."  </P></p>

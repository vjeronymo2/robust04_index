Answers to the call on Slovak constitutional officials by  the  meeting of ethnic Hungarian representatives would legitimize the  demands expressed at the meeting, he said.    Miskovsky also said that the issues of two official  languages  and ethnic autonomy for the Hungarian minority in Slovakia were  unacceptable for the SNS.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Arts: Today's Television On Channel 4 Dispatches tells the story of how a British based company sold land mines to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war, some of which, it is claimed, were later responsible for British casualties in the Gulf war. The company, the Casalee Group, is also said to have supplied heavy artillery, ammunition and anti-aircraft guns to Iran. The programme asks whether the British government could have remained ignorant of these activities (9.00). BBC2 has another story to tell of bombings and injuries: Aftershock looks back to the Birmingham pub bombings of 20 years ago in which 21 people were killed and 162 injured and finds 'No counselling for them, no memorial, small compensation, and now no chance of justice: police recently announced they had abandoned the hunt for the killers' (9.25). It is no doubt the sign of a trivial mind, but more than either of those I have a hankering to watch Counter Culture which promises the lowdown on one of those shops for computer freaks in Tottenham Court Road, London (9.45 C4).</p>

"But this is huge. It's something  we always wanted, a big title, and it kind of moves us up a notch.  </P> <P> Said Leach: "It feels great to hold that trophy up."  </P> <P> It was Leach's and Pugh's third Grand Slam doubles title. They won the  Australian Open in 1988 and '89. THOMAS BONK  </P></p>

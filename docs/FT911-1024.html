			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / CDU battler Volker Ruhe fights on many fronts: David Marsh talks to the German party secretary who has his sights set on the Foreign Ministry DURING HIS frequent trips to east Germany, Mr Volker Ruhe, general secretary of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is regularly addressed as 'Herr Generalsekretar' by devoutly respectful east Germans. This anecdote illustrates the excessive respect for authority of Germans east of the Elbe - and their difficulties in facing up to post-unity economic upheaval forcing them take the initiative themselves. 'I have to tell them I am not Erich Honecker,' says the 48-year-old Mr Ruhe, recalling the former Communist party general secretary who led East Germany for 18 years before he was deposed in October 1989. 'They think everything has to be decided by people at the top, and not by levels further down.' Cajoling people in the former Communist state to come to terms with market forces is just one of the battles the pugilistic Mr Ruhe has on his hands. He also faces the task of rallying the party after recent defeats in regional polls in Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate, caused by disarray in the Bonn coalition and the breaking of Mr Kohl's promise not to raise taxes to pay for German unity. Mr Ruhe has a front-line role in trying to soothe passions in the coalition, where renewed squabbling has broken out with the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP). Finally, and most intriguingly, he has launched a campaign to raise the CDU's profile in foreign affairs. Before he took over, in September 1989, the Number 2 job in the CDU behind Mr Kohl, this was Mr Ruhe's main specialty, built up during years on the international conference circuit. In an interview on Tuesday, shortly before flying with Mr Kohl for a meeting with CSU leaders in southern Germany to bury the hatchet after recent recriminations, Mr Ruhe declared that he had no wish to engage in 'fratricide' with the Bavarians. But he highlighted the potential for strife with the Free Democrats, who have held the Foreign Ministry portfolio for 22, and for three-quarters of this time in the hands of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, foreign minister since 1974. 'We have to reconquer the field of foreign affairs,' Mr Ruhe said. The clear implication is that, when Mr Genscher eventually bows out, the CDU wants to move in - and that the main candidate for the job will be Mr Ruhe himself. 'The Foreign Ministry is tied to the person of Genscher - but not the FDP,' said Mr Ruhe. He pours barely-concealed scorn on the idea that Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the live-wire FDP Economics minister, would eventually succeed Mr Genscher. Mr Ruhe has never made any secret of his ambition to become foreign minister. But he is also prepared to be patient, saying he did not think he would move to the job directly, but by a 'circuitous route'. He appears likely to be brought into the government in the expected autumn cabinet reshuffle, promised by Mr Kohl to put new people into key positions. He has been tipped several times in the past to take the Defence Ministry job, at present held by Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg. He views such a prospect as a highly thankless task, but one which could launch him into the job he really wants. Under questioning, Mr Ruhe can also be encouraged to vent some spleen over his own party. The Christian Democrats, he said, made 'a big mistake' before the December general election in ruling out tax increases to cope with unification - a pledge reneged on spectacularly by Mr Kohl three months ago with one of the largest tax raising packages in German history. Defiantly, he added that the FDP should take share the blame for its 'destructive role' last year in adamantly refusing any question of an increase in taxation. Mr Ruhe also criticised the government's initial lack of response to the Gulf war in mid-January. 'We were caught wrong-footed.' Mr Genscher, he said, was so preoccupied with his lobbying for lower taxes in east Germany that the impression gained hold 'that there was no government at all.' Mr Ruhe supports proposals for the Bundeswehr to be deployed outside the Nato area in 'intervention forces' which could be operated with Britain and France under the auspices of the Western European Union. This would be in line with Germany's new responsibilities as a sovereign country. However, he is against a hasty parliamentary decision on whether to amend the constitution accordingly. In view of strong antipathy in the opposition Social Democrats towards a wider role for the Bundeswehr, as well as misgivings among parts of the FDP (including Mr Genscher), Mr Ruhe said: 'It would be better to make no decision than a wrong decision.' The country's chief task, he believes, is 'bringing about the internal unity of Germany'. The financial expense of east German restructuring, he said, as well as the psychological challenges associated with it, had been increased by the speed with which the process was taking place. 'We underestimated the extent of the change. Previously, we thought that living standards between east and west would be equalised within 6-8 years - now we are talking about 2-3 years.' Mr Ruhe, born in Hamburg, and with a strong affinity to the depressed region of the east German Baltic coast, ranks as a forceful advocate of welding the two halves of the country together again. But he can scarcely claim foreknowledge of the speed at which it was going to happen. In October 1989, a month before the breaching of the Berlin Wall, he forecast, somewhat daringly at the time, that reunification would take place 'within a generation'. Now, he says, economic recovery in east Germany will have ironed out the main social differences between east and west by 1994. Naturally enough, he believes this will also enable the CDU to win the next general election, due in that year: 'By 1994, I am sure we will have made the decisive steps.'</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / S Korea offers pre-summit meeting: Response by North will prove sincerity of President Kim Il-sung's offer South Korea yesterday proposed a working-level meeting with North Korea on June 28 as the initial step in arranging the first summit between the leaders of the divided Korean peninsula. In Washington, President Clinton said yesterday there were 'hopeful signs' a clash over North Korea's nuclear programme could be averted, but cautioned that Pyongyang's offer to freeze the programme had to be verified. North Korea's response to the South's proposal will provide an early indication of the sincerity of last week's offer by the North's President Kim Il-sung to meet President Kim Young-sam without any preconditions. The working-level meeting will discuss the time and place of the summit. 'Results should be produced in the near future so that this preparatory contact does not drag on or pose problems in procedure and agenda-setting as in past contacts,' Mr Lee Hong-koo, the South's deputy prime minister for unification, said. 'The sooner the summit occurs, the better.' But other government officials cautioned it could take at least several months to make preparations for the meeting. The Seoul bourse reacted positively to the summit proposal, with the general share index rising by 1.76 per cent to 942.50. A summit would guarantee that South Korea will have a role in resolving the North Korean nuclear dispute and complementing possible North Korean talks with the US and the International Atomic Energy Agency on international nuclear inspections, the foreign ministry in Seoul said. The South Korean president said his main summit goal will be to secure agreement on mutual nuclear inspections between the two Koreas as promised in their 1991 non-nuclear pact. 'It is very important for the South and North to make mutual inspections in the end,' Mr Kim said. Disagreements over the issue led to the collapse of contacts between Seoul and Pyongyang in late 1992. The North refused the South's demand for inspections of suspected nuclear facilities, which would be more intrusive than those requested by the IAEA. Foreign ministry officials predicted that inter-Korean talks leading up to the summit will progress in tandem with proposed discussions between North Korea, the US and the IAEA. This would prevent the North from using the summit as an opportunity to disrupt Seoul's close co-operation with Washington on the nuclear issue. The South is expected to offer economic co-operation to the North in return for its agreement on nuclear inspections.</p>

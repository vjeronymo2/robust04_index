			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Remember, the taxpayer picks up the tab Sir, American taxpayers are currently paying some billions of dollars to cover the losses incurred when their savings and loan institutions (building societies) were deregulated. British taxpayers, therefore, would be wise to be vigilant about the goings on between Lloyds Bank and the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society because they will have to pay depositors if anything goes wrong. To protect taxpayers governments have always insisted on prudential financial practices at building societies. It is this conservative financing that appears to have created the Pounds 2bn plus which Lloyds Bank is proposing to divide between itself and the voters of the C &amp; G. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s British clearing banks, by improvident lending, lost many billions of pounds and there was a serious danger of financial collapse. In a quiet conspiracy the Bank of England, the government and the other regulators agreed that the banks should repair their balance sheets by exerting their monopoly powers over small and medium-sized business by sharply raising their charges. This process was described by John Plender as 'leveraging' (The Long View, February 19). The banks have now mostly recovered their capital but Lloyds Bank, which made smaller losses than the others, has built up a cash pile of Pounds 1.8bn which it is seeking to spend on the C &amp; G. When all the banks have bought themselves a building society and the societies have made some improvident loans, who will pick up the tab - the bank shareholders, the depositors or the taxpayer?

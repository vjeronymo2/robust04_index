			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Me'ir Shalev: "'Arafat's Kanafah"] </F>   [Text] It is really a joy. The pathetic buffoon 'Arafat  spews out nonsense, and a chorus of fools here vigorously takes  his words as if they were the gospel. In view of the recent  deluge of learned theological studies about the chairman's  absurdities, I am surprised that nobody paid any attention to  yet another of the man's utterances. Well, a week ago, Yasir  'Arafat was overheard telling his wife during breakfast: "Suha  darling, please pass me a piece of kanafah" [an Oriental pastry].    On the face of it, this would seem to be the type of  innocuous sentence that could be heard at any Arab breakfast  table. In fact, it was another sly manifestation of the weak  legs on which the agreement with the PLO stands. After all, any  Muslim child will tell you what the "kanafah massacre" was. In  the course of his fight over the creation of the Koran, Caliph  al-Mamun with his typical cunning invited his opponents to a  reconciliation banquet and beguilingly offered them kanafah for  dessert. As is known, kanafah is the heaviest element on earth.  (For example, the specific gravity of kanafah is four times  that of lead and twice that of cholent). His opponents ate the  kanafah and could not get up from their seats. Caliph al-Mamun  slaughtered them in their chairs. Incidentally, this was not  the only time this happened: In the 19th century, Hamad, the  mahdi of Khartoum, eliminated his adversaries by tying a piece  of kanafah around their necks and throwing them in the Nile.  There is no doubt that when 'Arafat asked Suha to pass the  kanafah he was hinting at a massacre of the Jews.    However, what Chairman 'Arafat really had in mind when he  mentioned the word kanafah was the "Allah's Hand Controversy" in  Baghdad in the year 400 of the hegira between the Kharijites and  the Qadiris. The Kharijites argued that only the hand of Allah,  at his will, can determine what happens in the world. In  contrast, the Qadiris believed in the people's right to choose  and act. The analogy is clear: 'Arafat believes that Suha's  hand, not just Allah's, can move the kanafah from one end of the  table to the other. All this leads to the conclusion that the  man has the right to choose and to act and cannot be stopped  from violating the agreement he signed with Israel.    I hope I have made my point quite clear. I hope Israel will  put 'Arafat in his place and will unequivocally inform him that  if he utters the word "kanafah" once again we will return to our  Gaza.</p>

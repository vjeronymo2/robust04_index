			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--Any move of the type,  contemplated by Pakistan at the U.N. Human Rights Commission,  for the despatch of a fact-finding commission to Jammu and  Kashmir would be totally unacceptable to India, a senior  External Affairs Ministry official said today.    India had launched a major diplomatic operation to counter  Pakistan's plan and, as such, there could have been no ambiguity  about New Delhi's stand. But a categorical statement was  considered necessary to reinforce the argument about the  futility of such a move.    At this stage, a clear picture of the measure of support--or  opposition--to Pakistan's move is not available. But there are  two significant indications--Russia will oppose the resolution  and China will remain neutral.    The points made by the official were known, too, but a  reiteration was intended to convey a message, loud and clear.  The draft resolution, circulated by the Pakistan Government  among some diplomats in Islamabad, contained its version of the  situation in Jammu and Kashmir, with an overdrawn picture of  excesses by the security forces and alleged repressive measures  by the State administration, and called for a visit there of a  fact-finding mission. This was also the purport of the  resolution Islamabad wanted to move at the U.N., (but was not  pressed in the absence of assurances of adequate support).    India, according to the official, was opposed to the  proposed  Pakistani move because of its dubious character. There was  nothing to be investigated, he said, as Jammu and Kashmir was  not a closed State, and a large number of visitors, including  tourists, jurists and media personnel, had been there. The  Government would be prepared, according to him, to discuss the  plan for visit to the State by any group provided its purpose is  transparent and objective honourable.    The draft resolution, in his view, had a political purpose  (behind the cloak of human rights)--to maximise the advantage  gained by Pakistan through its instigation and support of  terrorist violence in the Kashmir Valley. "We oppose the  resolution in letter and spirit," he said. The resolution was  seen as marking a deviation from the Shimla Agreement, that  committed the two sides to a bilateral approach, and running  counter to the process, that had begun with the resumption of  the Foreign Secretary-level dialogue. India, he stressed, was  for continuing negotiations as was evident from its action in  submitting six proposals to Pakistan for a smooth working  relationship.    Pakistan had embarked upon a major diplomatic drive to  secure  support for its move. It had sent formal notes, held extensive  briefing sessions, despatched special envoys to various  capitals. It had sought to make full use of the sensitivities of  the industrialised countries on the human rights issue.</p>

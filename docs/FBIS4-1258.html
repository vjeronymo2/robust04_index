			<p>BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama has said that the candidate  receiving the second highest vote total in the presidential  elections must be appointed vice president of the Republic.  With regard to the legislative elections, the party receiving  the second highest vote total should have ministerial  representation in government. The Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] has said that it does not plan any type of interparty  government, but it stresses that the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] had rejected such a political solution as  far back as 1984, after the Nkomati Accord was signed.    "I have not yet presented this proposal to my brother,  President Chissano, but that is my dream, and I have already  talked about it with diplomats. Many people ask: What does the  president dream, and I say that is the dream I have, not because  the country is completely ravaged, but rather because in Africa  it is very difficult to find victors and vanquished working  together in the first years after elections," Afonso Dhlakama  said.    According to the Renamo leader, "the party (candidate) that  comes second ought to be appointed vice president of the  Republic and, in terms of government itself, the party that  comes second should also have some ministers in it. That is the  government I dream of."    These and other details concerning a proposed government of  national unity, GNU, were not discussed when Chissano and  Dhlakama met last week, but the Renamo leader says that "some  diplomats with whom I have met have talked a great deal about  it."    In his meeting with the president of the Republic, "we  discussed the GNU issue, but there was no agreement. I simply  told him that all wars in Mozambique have had their own  histories: The war against Portuguese colonialism had its  history, Renamo's war for democracy had its history, and  democracy itself will have its history."    As the Renamo leader explained, this means that "the party  which wins the first multiparty elections in this country must  not seek to govern alone, so as to avoid attacks, acts of  revenge, and so forth."    Renamo leader Dhlakama added: "I have said before that we  must make use of experiences of others, because any democracy  has its own history. We do not believe that Frelimo, Renamo,  the Mozambique Democratic Party (Pademo), or the Mozambican  National Union (Unamo) can govern the country alone. With those  conditions in mind, if we look at the history of the United  States, or of Portugal, we will see that in Portugal 16  governments fell in the wake of the 25 April 1974 revolution,  after which the Portuguese learned their lesson. So we cannot  just proceed to copy what the Americans or the Italians are  doing today."    An African diplomat who noted that it was strange that  democracy should be demanded for Africa said: "It is immediately  clear that it is not Dhlakama's idea. When the moment of truth  comes, people turn around and say that Africa is not ready for  democracy, so they start coming up with any number of formulas  to alter the people's wishes, the outcome of the vote.  Elections should be held for useful purposes. They should not  be held for nothing, as though no elections had taken place. If  elections are held simply for there to be no difference between  victors and vanquished, then you might as well save millions  upon millions of dollars and spend them more wisely on  rebuilding our nations."    Afonso Dhlakama also said that he will compete in the  presidential elections, should the Renamo special congress  endorse his candidacy. He added that, if he were to win, "I  shall indeed be president of the Republic, no matter what my  previous experience. The decision will be the people's, and I am  going to present my government program to the country." (In  Maringue a few days later, the Renamo special congress confirmed  him as Renamo's candidate in the upcoming presidential  elections).    The Renamo leader believes that 12 or 20 parties can govern  the country together during the first five years after  elections, "learning, being courageous, agreeing to being  self-critical, and all the rest. In the next election, five  years hence -- that is when there should be victors, and the  vanquished will join the opposition and will not touch the  government."    Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana reacted on behalf of the  government: "That there should be neither victors nor vanquished  was a phrase we used, from a military viewpoint, to say that war  produces neither. That was said in terms of the General Peace  Accord about the end of the war. In terms of political  governance, though, we said there should be a multiparty system  and elections. Thus, elections must produce a winner."    Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana disclosed that, in the wake  of the Nkomati Peace Accord between Mozambique and South Africa  in 1984, the Mozambican Government had held Pretoria-mediated  talks with Renamo. There was the admission at those talks that  the war might be settled with political accommodation for  Renamo. The South African Government even proposed the opening  of schools to train Renamo members in the border areas of  Namaacha and Milange.    "It was in that spirit that the famous Pretoria Declaration  was made in October 1984, with great protocol and pomp, but then  Renamo pulled out and reneged on what it had signed. There was  the famous phone call to [late Renamo member] Mr. Evo Fernandes,  who pulled out of that plan. Political accommodation for Renamo  was the plan, meaning a cessation to the war and reintegration,  which would naturally have led to a Frelimo-Renamo government,  but Renamo rejected it in full," Minister Teodato Hunguana said.    He also revealed that later, well before the Rome peace  talks  had begun, the government took up once again the proposal to  reintegrate Renamo. That proposal, meanwhile, had been rejected  by Renamo, which demanded a multiparty system and elections as  the only way to settle the problem.    The government's position continues to be that the party  that  wins elections has the responsibility to find solutions that  will guarantee peace, stability, and a balanced government in  the country, but, in Teodato Hunguana's words, the winning party  must not be told what or what not to do. He added that "we can  defend our ideas. We are free to do so, but no one should ever  defend his ideas by resorting to the blackmail of warfare, armed  violence, or the threat of armed violence to try to get others  to agree."    Hunguana described the Renamo leader's demands as predating  the Rome talks and added that he was not clear about the GNU  concept. He said, however: "Let there be no confusion. Neither  Frelimo nor the government are saying that they are brushing  aside any type of interparty government. Such a government  could very well result from the search for correct solutions.  It is perfectly imaginable that as a result of the elections a  government will be formed that will reflect such tendencies, but  that will not be an automatic development."    The labor minister described as strange Afonso Dhlakama's  idea that the vice president should come from the party  receiving the second highest vote total, because that is not  written into the Constitution. He affirmed, however, that a  political argument -- rather than a legal one -- could be used,  as long as it also recognized the problem of proportion: A party  can come second with 40 percent of the vote and a party can come  second with 5 percent.</p>

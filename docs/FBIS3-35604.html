			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ruslan Maisigov] </F>   [Text] Nazran January 28 TASS -- Ingush President Ruslan  Aushev on Friday made a request to Russian President Boris  Yeltsin urgently to replace chief of the interim administration  in the territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, Vladimir  Lozovoy who "is incapable of enforcing decrees of the Russian  president, government and parliament".    Aushev believes that the chief of the interim administration  deliberately thwarted the implementation of the Russian  president's decree of December 13, 1993 on the procedure of the  return to places of permanent residence of refugees and enforced  resettlers in territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia". The  Ingush president stated in his address that Vladimir Lozovoy  more than once misled the Russian media, and, moreover, the  Russian leadership and the Russian president by informing them  that the return of refugees to places of permanent residence  began on time and proceeds successfully. The Ingush president  also noted that Lozovoy's being chief of the interim  administration does nothing to stabilise the situation in the  region, leads to its aggravation and to a new interethnic  conflict.    Similar addresses were sent on Friday to Russian Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Chairman of the Federation  Council Vladimir Shumeyko.</p>

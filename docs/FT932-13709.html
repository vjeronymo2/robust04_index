			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Technology: Consultant's Critique - Software at Work 'Beauty may be only skin-deep but ugly goes right down to the bone.' In computer systems, an unattractive front - end usually indicates that the underlying design is poor. The whole maintenance and future development of the system relies upon good design. Many executive information systems could be defined as 'a method of presenting information which you already know, together with data you do not want, in a form that you cannot understand'. I was pleasantly surprised by the EIS system at ICI. It was simple to use, elegant in design and flexible enough to be extended in the future. Most MDs have a few key figures that they use to keep a handle on their business. In ICI's case, these are a number of specific goals decided by the senior management. The EISL consultancy worked with Scott Davidson to extract these and present them in an accessible and consistent form. I was especially taken by the 'On Time In Full' concept used in ICI Paints. Sales commission is paid in full only on orders that are completed on time with no defects. A single tin missing in a delivery of 10,000 counts as a failure. Sales personnel no longer make promises they cannot keep. For a big order that has been delayed, the staff can be seen loading the trucks themselves. This is a classic example of wedding reward structures to the goals of the company. Computers either cost you money or save it. Anyone can think of instances of the former while real savings due to IT are much rarer. The business benefits of ICI's system have been remarkable. Not only has Pounds 7m been saved, it has allowed Davidson to take a grasp on two new businesses in a short time. In a changing business environment, it is essential that targets are agreed and understood by everyone involved. Now all the managers are 'singing from the same hymn-sheet'. This may not guarantee success but it eliminates a potential cause of failure. The author is a consultant at Software Design and Construction, of Milton Keynes.</p>

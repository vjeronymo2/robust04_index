The main task of this enlarged plenary session was to  deliberate on the work report of the autonomous regional  advisory commission.    Advisory commissions are transitional organizations which  aim  to change de facto lifelong tenure of leading cadres to a system  of retirement. In accordance with the provisions of the party  constitution passed by the 12th CPC National Congress, the Third  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional CPC Congress elected the  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Advisory Commission in  February 1984.    Since its founding 10 years ago, the autonomous regional  advisory commission has continued to actively support and assist  the autonomous regional party committee's work in various ways  under the guidance of the autonomous regional party committee  and in line with the tasks prescribed in the party constitution  and with Comrade Wang Enmao's demand that the advisory  commission assist and support the autonomous regional party in  five areas. The autonomous regional advisory commission has  taken the lead in studying and implementing the party's basic  line, has maintained high political zeal and remains politically  sober-minded at all times. It has vigorously participated in  major decision-making discussions; enthusiastically offered  ideas to the autonomous regional party committee;  conscientiously accomplished the missions entrusted to it by the  autonomous regional party committee; supported the audacious  work of comrades at the first front; actively taken part in  community activities; gone deep into realities to conduct  investigations and study; strived to make itself more  revolutionary; and set a good example in carrying on the party's  fine traditions. The autonomous regional advisory commission  has achieved fruitful results in its work over the past 10 years  and has made great contributions to the social stability and  economic development of the autonomous region.    Chen Xifu [7115 6007 1133], vice chairman of the autonomous  regional advisory commission, presided over yesterday's plenary  session and delivered a work report.    At the plenary session yesterday afternoon, Song Hanliang,  secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, spoke  highly of the autonomous regional advisory commission's great  contributions to the social stability and economic development  of the autonomous region since its founding 10 years ago. He  pointed out: Over the past 10 years, the autonomous regional  advisory commission has closely centered itself around the  party's basic line; vigorously supported and assisted the  autonomous regional party committee; and done a tremendous job  in maintaining the party's unity and social and political  stability by safeguarding the national unity, upholding the  unification of the motherland, and accelerating reform, opening  up, and economic development. It has made new historical  contributions to the party and people of various nationalities  in Xinjiang. The party, the government, and people of all  nationalities in Xinjiang will never forget the historical  contributions made by veteran comrades.    On behalf of the autonomous regional party committee, the  autonomous regional people's government, and people of all  nationalities in the region, Song Hanliang conveyed their  heartfelt thanks and great respect to the veteran comrades. He  sincerely hoped veteran comrades would, as always, concern  themselves with and support the work of the autonomous regional  party committee; apply their wisdom and rich accumulated  experience to reform, opening up, and modernization; continue to  exert themselves; and make as many new contributions to the  party and people as possible.    In view of the fact that the autonomous regional advisory  commission has accomplished its historical mission, the current  plenary session will, in its work report, propose the abolition  of the autonomous regional advisory commission and submit the  report to the Sixth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Fourth  Autonomous Regional Party Committee, which will be held on 22  January.    Autonomous regional party and government leaders Song  Hanliang, Abulaiti Amudurexiti, Zhang Fusen, Jin Yunhui, Wang  Lequan, and Keyum Bawudun attended the (enlarged) plenary  session of the autonomous region advisory commission yesterday  afternoon. They joined the old and new members participating in  the meeting in having a group photograph taken to mark the  occasion.    Leading comrades Amudun Niyaz, Guo Gang, Zhou Shengtao,  Hailiqiemu Silamu, Pan Zhaomin, Li Fengzi [2621 6646 3320], Xie  Fuping, Wang Yousan, Aisihaiti Kelimubai, Zhang Heng, Mijiti  Nasier [4717 0679 2251 4780 2448 1422], and Feng Dazhen also  joined them for the photo session.</p>

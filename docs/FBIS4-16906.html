			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Leonid Kotov, Vladimir </F> Shvedov]    [Text] New Delhi 19 April TASS -- "Kiev pays major  attention to the development of good-neighbourly and friendly  relations with Russia and the Russian people," Ukrainian Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told a news conference here today. The  Ukrainian minister is currently on an official visit to India.    "The major aim of our policy is consolidation of  Ukrainian-Russian relations. The immediate elaboration of a  comprehensive bilateral treaty on friendship and cooperation as  it was agreed by the Commonwealth state and government heads  will help this consolidation," he said.    "Work on the document has been done since 1993.  Unfortunately, there was a delay in finalization of the  agreement on reasons not depending on Ukraine. Meanwhile,  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and me were instructed  by our presidents to boost the document's elaboration. The  treaty is expected to reflect new realities in the  Ukrainian-Russian relations and outline a way for the solution  of the current problems. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  invited Boris Yeltsin to come to Kiev on an official visit to  sign the document," said the foreign minister.    "Permanent negotiations with Russia enable solution of any  problems in bilateral relations. We are satisfied with  Yeltsin's readiness to help remove obstacles on the way of  development of our friendship and cooperation and his statement  saying Russia respects territorial integrity of Ukraine,  inviolability of its borders and sovereignty.    ``As for the division of the Black Sea Fleet, Kiev and  Moscow  are progressing step by step to the solution of this problem. A  new agreement on the Black Sea Fleet that is being elaborated  will focus on separate bases of the Russian and Ukrainian  navies,'' said Zlenko. However, this, in his opinion, will not  help to eliminate all problems related to the Black Sea Fleet's  future. Experts are still to analyze the division parameters.    Ukraine is ready to have 15-20 per cent of the ships it  received under the Moscow agreement signed in September 1993,  said the foreign minister. The rest of the fleet will be passed  over to Russia. The new document will give a fresh impetus to  the work on remaining problems of the Black Sea Fleet, said  Zlenko.</p>

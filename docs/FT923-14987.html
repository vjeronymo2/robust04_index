			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / International Company News: Banco del Gottardo has good first half BANCA del Gottardo reports an 11 per cent rise in cash-flow to SFr50.1m (Dollars 36.50m) in the first half, but warned that the unfavourable economic situation and the need for high loan loss provisions would make it difficult to do as well in the second half. The bank, in which Sumitomo Bank of Japan has a controlling stake, said the strong result was due mainly to a surge in foreign exchange trading. Also, in spite of a considerable contraction in new issue activity, commission business developed satisfactorily.</p>

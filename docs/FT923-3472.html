			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo volume climbs as Hong Kong shivers A LATE bout of futures-related selling pared earlier gains to leave the Nikkei average only modestly higher on the day, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained a net 32.92 at 18,908.47 after registering a day's high of 19,284.12, its best level for more than five months, and a low of 18,894.22. Turnover expanded sharply to 600m shares, while rises outpaced falls by 686 to 339, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks finished 1.45 up at 1,414.97, while in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was a slight 0.69 firmer at 1,142.22. After clearing the 19,000 mark with ease, the Nikkei was pulled down by futures-related selling ahead of today's expiration of September futures. The afternoon retreat from earlier levels contrasted with the previous day, when a late round of futures-linked activity pushed the index sharply ahead. A trader speculated that the financial authorities may be influencing trading behind the scenes to support the market until after the first half of the fiscal year account closes at the end of the month. The Finance Ministry is widely acknowledged to be putting pressure on companies not to sell shares before that date. The Bank of Japan is scheduled today to release its tankan quarterly economic survey. The results are expected to show further deterioration in the economy, but the market has already discounted this into equity prices. Speculative biotechnology and pharmaceutical shares, which have performed strongly in recent sessions, suffered a bout of heavy selling. Meiji Milk, the day's most active issue, was off Y70 at Y1,120 amid cross-trading, and Green Cross lost Y100 to Y1,780. Public works-related shares fared well, with Sumitomo Cement rising Y20 to Y559 and Osaka Cement Y7 to Y442. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 336.17 to 20,394.79 in volume of 32.2m shares. Aoyama Trading fell Y430 to Y7,190. Roundup POLITICAL worries in Hong Kong provided the main feature of the day elsewhere in the Pacific Rim region. HONG KONG finished sharply lower on worries about worsening Sino-US trade relations, the Hang Seng index recording a fall of 95.44, or 1.7 per cent, at 5,631.55 in turnover down from Wednesday's HKDollars 1.51bn to HKDollars 1.46bn. China's retaliation plan against possible US trade sanctions, with a list of US goods targeted for punitive tariffs, combined with uncertainties over President George Bush's political future, and leading blue chips, which had gained in a recent rebound, lost the most. HSBC topped the actives list and ended HKDollars 1 off at HKDollars 54.50, while Cheung Kong, 40 cents down at HKDollars 22.40, came second. NEW ZEALAND was dragged lower by continuing weakness in Fletcher Challenge (FLC). The NZSE-40 index declined by 6.18 to 1,453.78 in turnover of NZDollars 31.8m. News that FLC was about to sell a third of its stake in Natural Gas to Australian Gas Light for NZDollars 152m, and another third to the public, failed to improve sentiment in the stock, which closed 8 cents cheaper at NZDollars 2.14. AUSTRALIA reversed early falls and the All Ordinaries index was finally 5.1 up on balance at 1,484.0, after touching 1,462.3. Turnover amounted to ADollars 266.3m. Banks were generally higher, with Westpac advancing 13 cents to ADollars 2.88 after more than 33m rights to the bank's forthcoming share issue were traded. SINGAPORE ended firmer but sentiment was dampened in the afternoon by the Hong Kong performance. The Straits Times Industrial index recorded a net gain of just 3.53 at 1,372.07. KUALA LUMPUR weakened after Wednesday's holiday, although motor shares gained ground on news that the government will ease financing for the purchase of commercial vehicles. The composite index slipped 2.42 to 584.19 in volume of 56.4m shares. BANGKOK closed at a four-month high, with banks and finance issues among the day's main gainers. The SET index put on 8.35, or 1 per cent, to 791.20 in turnover of Bt12.68bn. Union Asia Finance, unchanged at Bt113, was the day's most active stock on turnover of Bt1.13bn. MANILA's composite index gained 5.53 at 1,412.00 in combined turnover of 195m pesos. TAIWAN saw very thin trade ahead of its closure for the mid-autumn festival today and tomorrow, but the weighted index finished 15.38 higher at 3,785.50.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Brussels EUROPE article: "East Europe -- </F> Steichen Outlines Guidelines for Effective Collaboration in  Agricultural Sector"]    [Text] "The main orientation of future agricultural  cooperation between the European Union and the countries of  Central and East Europe must aim to ensure a gradual convergence  of our policies," European Farm Commissioner Rene Steichen  stated in an address given last Friday [15 April] at the  University of Agronomy of Warsaw. According to Mr. Steichen,  such cooperation -- to be established on bases of reciprocal  confidence and not antagonism -- should enable setting into  motion two parallel processes by better using existing  instruments and improving them if necessary: One in the long  term which will have to "logically lead to the adherence of  countries of Central and East Europe to the Union" and the  other, in the immediate term, which would enable establishing  "now an atmosphere of trust." He regretted with regard to this  some of the criticism from the countries of Central and East  Europe which attribute the difficulties of their farmers to the  so-called protectionism of the CAP [Common Agricultural Policy].  This criticism underestimates in his opinion the extent of the  difficulties of an internal nature that many of the Central and  East European producers will encounter in the delicate phase of  transition from the old system to the new. Regarding the terms  of cooperation sought, the Commissioner suggested exploring in  Central and East Europe two major complementary directions:    1. A system ensuring the stabilization of agricultural  prices  (namely through a mechanism of support of certain primary  products). Nevertheless, in order to avoid repeating the  pitfalls of the former CAP, this system will also have to  encourage producers to sell on the market by calculating the  support, keeping in mind the interactions between internal  support and trade.    2. Reform of the credit system in order to help farming  concerns cope with their current financial difficulties, to  modernize their production apparatus and to improve their  international competitiveness. In this context, agricultural  banks should be created (as is already the case in Poland where  an agri-industrial bank was established) that are able to settle  the problem of the lack of liquid assets and the nonexistence of  a land market. For this purpose, the initial financial  contribution from private investors, local governments, the EBRD  [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], the World  Bank and the European Union could be combined.    According to Mr. Steichen, the Commission would be prepared  to make a more general contribution to guidance, education,  training and assistance, to the establishment of these banks and  even to examine more direct collaboration. Observing  nevertheless that "the Community will never be able to absorb by  itself all the exports from its East European neighbours," the  Commissioner suggested that the countries of Central and East  Europe seek in parallel to develop new trading links between  themselves, including if necessary on the financial level, and  to restore traditional export currents towards the States of the  former USSR. Mr. Steichen spoke of certain current concerns in  the EU's agricultural relations with Central and East European  countries, suggesting that these be remedied by:    (i) Improving the mechanisms in force in the Union for the  import of red fruit (minimum prices) and cherries (safeguard  mechanisms), that is to say by rapidly inserting an early alert  mechanism in the different systems;    (ii) encouraging the harmonization of veterinary legislation  in order to implement as soon as possible common norms and by  establishing equivalencies (an agreement for this purpose should  be concluded by the end of the year) which would considerably  reduce controls.</p>

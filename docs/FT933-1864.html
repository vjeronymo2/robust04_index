			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: The centre may not hold - Conference Notebook THE CENTRE of gravity in British politics is shifting. For most of the Thatcherite 1980s Labour and Liberal Democrats spent their time chasing the Conservatives to the right. The name of the opposition game now is to occupy and remodel the centre ground. The most striking feature of this week's Liberal Democrat conference has been the self-conscious shift leftwards. A party which fought the last general election on a set of market-driven economic assumptions scarcely distinguishable from those of Mrs Thatcher has suddenly re-discovered a role for government in determining the country's prosperity. Full employment - for long derided as the pipedream of unreconstructed socialists - is suddenly an at least half-respectable political objective. Liberal Democrats can again hold out the occasional olive branch to the trades unions. A couple of years ago the party leadership was as enthusiastic as the Conservatives about the privatisation of British Rail. Now the talk is of refusing to be driven by outdated ideology. You could say, of course, that Mr John Major started it all when he kidded the right of the Tory party that he was really one of them. Three years on Mr Kenneth Clarke is in command at the Treasury, Mr Michael Heseltine at trade and industry and Mr David Hunt at employment. There could be no more potent insult to the Thatcherite dispossessed. Manufacturing industry counts again, restrictions on public-sector pay have brought with them the whiff of 1970s-style incomes policies, the level of public borrowing has snuffed out talk of anything but the most transparently token cut in income tax this side of the next general election. Conservatives have once again been heard uttering such words as 'community'. There is more than that. The Conservative right is in ideological disarray. The rows over Europe and the exchange rate mechanism have sown as much confusion among the disgruntled on the Tory backbenches as in Mr Major's government. It is little wonder that the real thinkers on the right - Mr Michael Portillo the most prominent among them - are in a state of quiet despair. The shift should not be exaggerated. Much of the Thatcher revolution has been absorbed by the nation's political fabric. Weak unions, the replacement of state direction with a presumption in favour of competition and enterprise with state control, and disavowal of crude demand management have become part of the consensus. So much so, there is concern among both the Labour and Liberal Democrat leaderships that the Tories' troubles will tempt their parties back into their bad old ways. Mr Tony Blair, the most eloquent advocate of modernisation in the Labour shadow cabinet, is battling fiercely against a resurgence of the one-more-heave-tendency within his party at Westminster. Mr Paddy Ashdown also faces a growing mood among his party's activists to abandon the fiscal responsibility of the 1980s in favour of spending pledges for pensioners, schoolteachers and health-service workers. There is another dimension. The political scene is still suffering the aftershocks of a deep and unusually indiscriminate recession. It will take years of resumed growth before it is possible to judge whether the unprecedented disenchantment of the electorate with politics and its practitioners runs deeper than the disillusion invariably triggered by recession. Mr Ashdown is convinced it does. His premise this week has been that the mood of anti-politics reflects not only the failure by the nation's leaders to deliver the substance of politics - economic prosperity, decent public services and a fair distribution of wealth and income. Voters will not be reconciled with their representatives until the processes and structures of politics have been radically overhauled. Hence the Liberals' constant pre-occupation with constitutional change. It is an understandable - perhaps unavoidable - strategy for a third party which depends for power on change and has anyway to differentiate its product from that of two entrenched competitors. Changes in the political process though are no substitute for the more mundane but far more immediate issues on which the voters judge politicians. The right in British politics has lost its way. The opposition parties will never have a better chance to recapture the initiative. Whether they can seize the opportunity is another question.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LAFLEUR STINGS THE CANADIENS  </P> <P> It was literally adding insult to injury to the Montreal Canadiens Tuesday  night at Quebec City, Canada.  </P> <P> Guy Lafleur, one of the greatest players in Montreal history, scored a goal for  Montreal's bitter rival, the Nordiques, and led them to a 5-2 victory over the  crippled Canadiens.  </P> <P> After 14 seasons in which he helped make the Canadiens the power of the NHL,  Lafleur retired after the 1984 season.  </P> <P> It was bad enough when he came out of retirement to play for the New York  Rangers last year. But when he signed with Quebec last July, it was a bitter  blow to Montreal fans.  </P> <P> Lafleur scored the 546th goal of his career at 8:11 of the first period to give  the Nordiques a 2-0 lead. It was his first goal against his old mates since  joining the Nordiques. He scored 518 goals for Montreal.  </P> <P> The Canadiens, who have struggled all season, at least partly because of an  unusual rash of injuries, were without their best defenseman, Chris Chelios,  and top playmaker Bobby Smith.  </P> <P> Chelios, who didn't miss a game last season and won the Norris Trophy as the  outstanding defenseman, missed his first game because of a groin injury. He is  out indefinitely. Smith has a bruised shoulder.  </P> <P> The Canadiens have already had more injury problems this season than all of  last season.  </P> <P> Edmonton 3, Calgary 2 -- After losing at home Sunday night to the Stanley Cup  champion Flames, the Oilers went to overtime at Calgary to turn the tables.  </P> <P> Martin Gelinas, who went to the Oilers in the trade that sent Wayne Gretzky to  the Kings, scored at 2:11 of overtime to put the Oilers five points in front in  the Smythe Division.  </P> <P> Detroit 9, Minnesota 0 -- Shawn Burr had a hat trick, including two  short-handed goals, and added two assists in the rout at Detroit.  </P> <P> Six weeks ago, the North Stars were leading the Norris Division and were 18  points ahead of the slumbering Wings. The Wings have won four of five and trail  the slumping Stars by only seven points.  </P> <P> The Stars beat the Wings, 4-3, Saturday at Bloomington, Minn. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

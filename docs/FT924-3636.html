			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Uphill task to aid 'Triangle of Death': The need for swift action by US Marines In the midday heat yesterday, one of Bardere's 60 grave diggers dragged two small corpses wrapped in white cotton shrouds on a wooden harness along a dusty track. In the distance, in the middle of a vast field of freshly turned earth mounds, a colleague was busy with a pick-axe digging a shallow grave - his tenth before midday. Without ceremony or grief, the bodies of the children aged seven and nine were buried in unmarked graves along with thousands of others who have died in the past three months in Bardere, a tumble-down town which is the scene of some of the worse horrors in war-ravaged Somalia. Bardere is 300km west of Mogadishu, the capital. Throughout the country at least 300,000 people have died this year and a further 500,000 to 900,000 people are facing imminent death from starvation unless food is delivered to them within the next eight weeks. US Marines poised offshore to land in Somalia within the next 48 hours will have to move swiftly to deal with the appalling situation in Bardere and other towns if they are to achieve their humanitarian mission. The US military intervention, which will number 28,000-33,000 troops by Christmas, will set a precedent for massive foreign action in Africa to guarantee the delivery of food aid to starving people. Observers say it will be relatively easy for the US force to secure Mogadishu on the coast and the southern port city of Kismayo. Much more difficult will be launching a big relief operation to take food and relief workers by truck, aircraft and helicopter to the inaccessible south-western 'Triangle of Death' between Bardere, Kismayo and Baidoa and including the marginalised Bantu people living along the Jubba river. As an indication of the scale of security problems in the interior, according to Reuters news agency clan fighting in Baidoa yesterday killed 24 Somalis. The US-based charity Care was forced to evacuate most of its male staff from the town on Saturday. In an intensive feeding centre of sticks and plastic sheeting near Bardere's graveyard, at least a dozen skeletal children were yesterday sliding hopelessly and apathetically towards death from hunger and related sickness  -too weak even to get up and defecate outside. A Somali aid worker approached a mother holding her dead child and gently took the girl out of her arms. The loss of a third child in three weeks left the mother too stunned to weep. At another feeding centre nutritionists were yesterday registering severely malnourished children. A 14-year-old girl, her skin wrinkled over her bony body and ribcage with legs like match sticks, was weighed at 16 kilograms - just over a half of the average weight for a girl of her age and height. Aid workers say they have been fighting an uphill battle to save people from starvation. Death, disease, and hunger have gripped the district's 170,000 people in a tragedy of biblical proportions. According Care, 160 people, mostly young children and women, die in the town every day. A seemingly pointless civil war has inflicted remorseless suffering on the people around Bardere. The town has changed hands three times in the past 18 months and each time things have got worse as militia gunmen go on a rampage of looting and rape. Two months ago Bardere fell to the clan-based faction led by Gen Mohamed Said Hersi Morgan. Aid workers had to be evacuated and the death rate rocketed from about 35 a day to 307. Gen Morgan immediately mined the road from Bardere to Dinsor, the front line, preventing aid workers from reaching the villages. Since aid workers returned to Bardere in late October they have been hampered by looting, banditry, hijackings and endless negotiations with Gen Morgan's officials. Last Friday, at 2.30am, gunmen guarding a UN compound broke into the house, stole 3m Somali shillings (Pounds 770) and hijacked the UN's only four-wheel drive car. Aid aircraft flying food into Bardere have been shot at. The agency Care has been forced to pay SSh8m a week in airport fees and SSh18m a week in wages to armed guards supplied by Gen Morgan. The agency has also been forced to give the gunmen diesel. 'The security problems are beyond the ability of Gen Morgan's officials to control,' said Mr Robert Allan, Care's representative in Bardere. 'They don't have the capacity to control the looting and anarchy. 'There are young nomads and cattle herders who have lost everything to looters who have now taken up guns as a way of making a good living. It's become increasingly difficult to get food to those in need.' US forces will have to attempt immediately to confront these security problems which have defeated massive efforts by the international aid community to feed Somalia for the past nine months. People in Bardere have long ago lost their humanity, their dignity and, more importantly, any sense of hope. While many people feel the US effort is 'too much, too late' there is still a hope that tens of thousands of lives could still be saved in the 'Triangle of Death'. But the children, at best, face a life which will be permanently stunted physically and emotionally.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: US gloom hits drug sector THE PROFITS warning issued overnight by Merck, the world's largest pharmaceuticals group, the third such warning by US drug companies in the past week, brought an abrupt halt to the one-day rally in the UK drug sector. Drug shares in London rose strongly on Tuesday as institutions took the view that recent heavy selling of stocks such as Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, triggered by fears of a drugs price freeze in the US as well a series of damaging individual company stories, had been overdone. But yesterday's news from Merck was seen by UK market specialists as indicating fundamental problems with the drugs industry in the US. 'This really is bad news, Merck is the star performer in the world drugs business,' said one international analyst. Merck said first half earnings would be 'badly affected' by competition in the US, by healthcare measures expected there soon and by foreign currency pressures. Glaxo, buffeted in recent weeks by a series of worrying developments, including the resignation of Mr Ernest Mario, the former chief executive, and criticism of its claims for its Zantac anti-ulcer drug, dropped 17 to 597p, on heavy turnover of 7.8m shares. Newspaper reports of a much cheaper antibiotics ulcer treatment also affected the shares. SmithKline Beecham fell 12 1/2 to 416p with 3.7m shares traded. Wellcome, scheduled to report interim figures this morning, closed 20 lower at 890p.</p>

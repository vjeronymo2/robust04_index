			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Serb fighting undermines aid effort BOSNIA'S Serb forces yesterday stepped up their attempts to gain control of the main routes into Sarajevo, the capital, in an offensive aimed at consolidating their positions before winter. The international aid operation could be undermined, if Serb forces, led by Mr Radovan Karadzic, gain the suburb of Stup, western diplomats said yesterday. This would allow Serb forces to control a strategic route linking the airport to the city, and one of the main western road routes used by the aid convoys. 'This means that no matter what agreements are signed in Geneva, the Serbs, who are working hand-in-glove with Croatian forces in Bosnia, will be able to intimidate the aid convoys at any time, and will be able to maintain the pressure on forces loyal to the Bosnian government,' a western diplomat in Belgrade said yesterday. The Serb offensive coincided with new efforts by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees to resume humanitarian aid operations to the city. All flights were suspended after an Italian aid aeroplane was shot down over Croatian-held territory on September 3. In Sarajevo, the presidency building in the centre was alight with flames after heavy mortar attacks aimed from Serb-held areas on the hills around the city. Despite the heavy fighting an aeroplane carrying General Philippe Morillon and other senior UN officers, landed safely in the capital to start preparations for expanding the UN humanitarian relief operation in the republic. The current UN forces of 1,500, based in Sarajevo, will be increased by 6,000. They will then be deployed in four other cities in Bosnia to protect UNHCR aid convoys. But the success of the relief operation will depend on gaining secure access to the airport and its routes into Sarajevo. The Serb offensive, launched against Stup last week, confirmed that Mr Karadzic had not placed all his artillery under UN monitoring, despite his promises. The bombardment of Stup, and the continuous shelling of Sarajevo indicated that Serb forces retained large quantities of heavy ammunition. A statement issued by the Bosnian government said 53 people were killed and 285 wounded in fighting throughout the republic during the weekend. More than 10,000 people have died over the past nine months in fighting in the republic which broke out before the European Community recognised Bosnia's independence last April. Meanwhile, the UN Security Council recommended at the weekend that the general assembly deny the rump Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, a seat as legal successor to former Yugoslavia.

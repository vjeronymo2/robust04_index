			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DICKERSON, WHO HAS SOUGHT NEW PACT, SAYS HE WILL QUIT  </P> <P> Eric Dickerson, who has sought to renegotiate his contract with the  Indianapolis Colts or be traded, told an interviewer for an Indiana television  station that he intends to retire.  </P> <P> "I'm through with football, and (the Colts) know it.  </P> <P> So I'm telling you, I'm finished," Dickerson, 29, said in an interview  broadcast Monday on WFYI-TV's "Indiana Tonight" show.  </P> <P> Jim Irsay, the Colts' general manager and son of owner Robert Irsay, said  through a spokesman Monday that the team expected Dickerson to fulfill his  contract obligations.  </P> <P> Dickerson has said his contract expires after the 1990 season.  </P> <P> During the 20-minute interview, taped last Thursday at his Los Angeles home,  Dickerson, the seventh-leading rusher in NFL history, said he has lost interest  in playing football.  </P> <P> "Right now I really don't love the game that much," he said. "I don't love it  like I did at one time. But rather than stay in Indianapolis and take the  pounding that I'm taking, I'd rather quit.  </P> <P> "I mean, it's like taking a revolver and putting a bullet in it and spinning it  around and sticking it to my head, and sooner or later a bullet is gonna come  out and kill me. And that's the chance I'm taking," he said.  </P> <P> "I just can't do that. I like my health. I'll take my health, and no amount of  money in the world can buy my health."  </P></p>

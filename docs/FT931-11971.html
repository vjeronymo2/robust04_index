			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: IDV lifts Buton stake to 85% in Pounds 39m deal INTERNATIONAL Distillers &amp; Vintners, the drinks arm of Grand Metropolitan, is to acquire Buton, the Italian spirits and wines company in which it bought a minority stake two months ago. Through its Italian subsidiary, Cinzano, IDV has agreed to buy BIF, a family holding company which owns 50.1 per cent of Buton, for Pounds 38.6m (L85.7bn) cash. The deal, subject to the approval of the Italian anti-trust authorities, will give IDV control over 85 per cent of Buton's shares. A public offer will be made for the rest. IDV bought 33.8 per cent of Buton - which makes Italy's leading spirits brand, Vecchia Romagna brandy - for Pounds 19.7m from a group of minority holders last November. It has since acquired another 1.1 per cent from that source. The UK company originally intended to establish a worldwide trading partnership with Buton on the lines of those recently developed with Gonzalez Byass in Spain, and Jose Cuervo in Mexico. When acquiring the initial minority stake it arranged to sell back the shares to the vendors if an alliance proved impossible, but discussions with the majority holders quickly led to an agreed acquisition.</p>

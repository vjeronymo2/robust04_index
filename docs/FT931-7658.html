			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Nordstrom profit edges ahead in final term NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based retailer, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 49.96m in the final three months to end-January. The results were scored on a 9.3 per cent improvement in sales, at Dollars 1.07bn, and compared with a net profit of Dollars 40.86m in the corresponding period of 1991-92. The 1992-93 results would have been slightly higher, had it not been for a Dollars 4m charge related to the payment of certain plaintiffs' legal fees in Nordstrom's recent settlement of a labour class action lawsuit. Nordstrom's shares, listed on the over-the-counter market, rallied Dollars 1 7/8 on the news, to Dollars 38 3/4 . As with most retailers, the fourth 'holiday' quarter is the most crucial within the trading year. In the case of Nordstrom - a family-run, upmarket fashion retailer which grew rapidly in the late 1980s but where progress has stalled recently - the final quarter's figures take the full-year profits total to Dollars 136.6m after tax. In the previous year, the company recorded profits of Dollars 135.8m. Annual sales were Dollars 3.42bn, compared with Dollars 3.18bn in 1991-2.</p>

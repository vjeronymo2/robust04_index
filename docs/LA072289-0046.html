			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WITNESS SAYS HUNTER WAS ANGRY AT BEING EXCLUDED  </P> <P> Nancy Hoover Hunter complained about being shut out of a closed-door meeting  conducted in the office she shared with J. David (Jerry) Dominelli at  Dominelli's investment company, according to testimony Friday in Hunter's fraud  and tax-evasion trial.  </P> <P> Debra Hart, former executive assistant to Dominelli and Hunter, said that  Dominelli occasionally excluded Hunter from meetings in the year before the J.  David &amp; Co. investment firm collapsed.  </P> <P> Under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Marmaro, Hart testified  about a 1983 meeting attended by Mark Yarry, a top J. David salesman who faces  a 26-count indictment stemming from the firm's huge Ponzi scheme.  </P> <P> "The door slammed, and Nancy Hoover came out," Hart said. She "was angry,  visibly and vocally, about being excluded from the meeting."  </P> <P> Hart testified that her desk was outside the spacious office shared by  Dominelli and Hunter at J. David's La Jolla headquarters.  </P> <P> Hart said she could not remember Hunter's exact words, but "the substance was  that she had been excluded from a meeting and she didn't like Jerry doing that  to her when she was supposed to be a principal of the firm."  </P> <P> Hunter is on trial in the federal court of District Judge Earl B. Gilliam in  San Diego on a 234-count indictment that alleges she played a key role in the  Ponzi scheme. Dominelli is serving a 20-year prison term for his part in the  fraud.  </P></p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Leading Article: The liabilities of auditors It is more than a little ironic that while the senior partners of the UK's accountancy firms are calling for a limitation on their liability in lawsuits, the heads of their own insolvency practices are busy issuing writs against each others' firms for negligent auditing. A campaign backed by the largest accountants in the US and Australia has now been imported to the UK. It calls for auditors to be protected from vexatious legal actions by the shareholders and purchasers of companies in which the accounts turn out to have been misleading. The firms claim that plaintiffs seek disproportionate penalties from them for the losses caused, because their assets and insurance policies give them 'deep pockets' out of which to pay damages. Those who are responsible for the frauds and misstatements, notably the directors, tend to escape relatively unscathed. In principle, the argument for reform seems sound. It must be unreasonable for auditors to be held wholly responsible for corporate disasters when they have not been the direct cause of the problems. Their failure to detect or highlight shortcomings should make them only partly culpable. Yet reform would require radical changes in the law, overturning the principle of 'joint and several liability', so that auditors would only be liable to losses in proportion to their degree of blame. This would dilute plaintiffs' rights, and require the consideration of the Law Commission, which has indicated its lack of interest by telling the profession that it has no time to consider the issue in the foreseeable future. The firms' response has been to suggest a flawed alternative: to remove section 310 of the 1985 companies act - which expressly forbids auditors from limiting their liability in contract. They say no such restriction applies to other professions, such as solicitors. Important safeguards While this is true, lawyers have not in practice attempted to limit their liability in contract. They consider that they could still be found negligent and sued, making any limits imposed in the contract irrelevant. Removing section 310 would also eliminate one of the most important safeguards which stand behind an audit. This is the knowledge that, when a firm gives an independent, professional opinion, it is putting its reputation, livelihood and the assets of all its partners on the line. Self-regulation and tighter standards appear to have had some limited effect on improving the quality of auditing. But the threat of litigation must help to concentrate the mind when it comes to making sure that the audited accounts show a 'true and fair view', as the law demands. Unique benefit Accountants have the unique benefit of a government-guaranteed monopoly of auditing. This is designed to provide reassurance to shareholders but it also provides firms with lucrative fees and a ready platform to sell other services to companies. At the same time, they have shown themselves reluctant to go to court when sued for audit negligence. They have chosen instead to settle on the steps of the court rather than have their work scrutinised in public and run the risk of an award against them. These settlements are made without admission of responsibility, but they do not make it easier to establish the case for reform. The firms and their insurers have also not been above a little creative accounting themselves. They have chosen to highlight the enormous rise in the number of legal claims against them, while failing to reveal the far smaller size and number of awards that have actually been made. On the rare occasions when cases have been contested - such as the Caparo, Galoo and Berg cases - the courts have in practice demonstrated considerable sympathy for the profession, tightly restricting its duty of care, and limiting damages rather than awarding disproportionate penalties against them. While accountants refuse to disclose any details of their own profits and assets, or the extent of their professional indemnity cover, they will find it hard to persuade others that the case for reform is as soundly based as they claim.</p>

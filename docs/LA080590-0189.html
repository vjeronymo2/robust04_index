			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SPORTS ARE PUSHED TO THE EDGE;  </P> <P> BETTING: GAMBLERS' QUEST FOR INSIDE INFORMATION BECOMES MORE AGGRESSIVE -- AND  MORE SOPHISTICATED. THEY PREY ON VULNERABLE ATHLETES.  </P> <P> In the wake of Pete Rose's expulsion from baseball for betting and George  Steinbrenner's admission that he gave $40,000 to a gambler, sports and law  enforcement officials say they are concerned about the growing influence of  gambling on college and professional leagues.  </P> <P> While a sporting event being fixed remains their greatest fear, league  officials say they are grappling with a more everyday concern: that gamblers  and bookmakers -- some with ties to organized crime families -- are approaching  athletes to gather information that would be useful in formulating bets and  odds.  </P> <P> "Gamblers are more aggressive now," said Kevin Hallinan, security director of  Major League Baseball. "They're trying to get closer to the athletes and to  people who work within the game. I'm very much concerned about that trend. . .  . It is a very scary thing."  </P> <P> In some instances, unwitting celebrities have been used to gain access to major  league players and umpires, Hallinan said. One gambler lured a player to a  party by telling him a celebrity wanted to meet him, and in other instances  players have received gifts from gambling figures, he said.  </P> <P> "It's called 'the edge,' " Hallinan said of the gamblers' motives. "And the  edge is that little piece of information from somebody inside that locker room,  be it a player, a clubhouse guy, an umpire. Gamblers believe that, no matter  how small the information, that edge is going to put them over the top."  </P> <P> Said Warren Welsh, the National Football League's security director: "Gamblers  aren't only interested in injuries or learning the game plan. They want to know  if a player has financial woes or family problems because these can have an  adverse influence on a player's performance."  </P> <P> Pro and college sports personnel are forbidden by their leagues from  associating with gamblers and from betting on their respective sports. While  gambling has long cast a shadow over the sports world, the last 12 months have  been notably dark.  </P> <P> Rose, then-manager of the Cincinnati Reds, placed bets -- directly or through  intermediaries -- with bookmakers who had ties to organized crime families in  Illinois, Massachusetts and New York, according to Hallinan. In basketball,  former North Carolina State star Charles Shackleford has been accused in a  report on ABC-TV of fixing games, an accusation he has denied. In football,  former athletes at Texas, Arkansas, Florida and Mississippi State have been  investigated for alleged gambling activities.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner, the New York Yankees' principal owner, said he paid admitted  gambler Howard Spira to keep him from revealing damaging information about  former club employees. Spira said he accepted $40,000 from Steinbrenner in  return for detrimental information about outfielder Dave Winfield, with whom  Steinbrenner was feuding. Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent has ordered  Steinbrenner to relinquish his majority ownership of the Yankees.  </P> <P> Sports gambling is a flourishing business. In Nevada, $1.35 billion was wagered  legally on sports during the last fiscal year, and sources say as much as $100  billion is bet illegally in the United States each year. With more money than  ever at stake, gamblers and bookmakers have become increasingly adept at  gathering information about athletes and teams, according to league and law  enforcement officials.  </P> <P> "The bookmaker knows more about some teams than some of the coaches do when  they prepare for another team," said Tom French,  </P> <P> an FBI supervisory agent who works closely with college and pro teams. "The  bookmaker has a network. He can pick up the phone, and if he needs to know  what's going on in a locker room, he has somebody who can find out. Whether  it's a ballplayer who has a marital problem or narcotics problem, these are all  factored into the line."  </P> <P> Hallinan and Welsh said gamblers have long attempted to contact athletes at  bars and restaurants. "But now the approaches are more sophisticated," Welsh  said. Gamblers are "going into the nicer restaurants and nicer clubs, engaging  athletes in conversations, buying them drinks, buying them dinner, doing favors  for their girlfriends and wives."  </P> <P> When he became baseball's security director in 1986, after 25 years with the  New York Police Department, Hallinan said he was surprised by the "numbers of  people who were trying to infiltrate professional baseball and professional  sports" and by the "tactics they used to try to get close to athletes."  </P> <P> In the last several years, Hallinan said, gamblers and bookmakers have used  unwitting movie stars, television personalities, professional wrestlers and  country and western recording artists to establish relationships with players  and umpires.  </P> <P> After relationships were formed, gamblers and bookmakers invited the players  and umpires to dinner, even sent gifts to their children, Hallinan said. Most  of these gambling figures have ties to organized crime families, he said.  </P> <P> Typically, the athletes and umpires were questioned about injuries and players'  personal lives. "Some pretty far-out questions have been asked," Hallinan said,  declining to name the athletes and umpires he said have been approached.  </P> <P> Professional teams issue regular injury reports, partly to minimize the amount  of so-called inside information available to gamblers. But inside information  still is available because players do not report all of their ailments and  injuries to trainers and coaches, league officials said.  </P> <P> "You're looking at things like sore arms," Hallinan said. "Or a guy's got a  pulled muscle. He doesn't want to come out of the lineup. He's starting to go  downhill. His average is starting to drop. So nobody knows (about the ailment).  He's keeping it a secret."  </P> <P> "You just have a lot of players who are just very, very competitive, and  they're going to play with a great deal of pain," Welsh said. "And sometimes  those players playing in pain just aren't quite as effective as a well player  would be. That's not always going to come out on an injury report, but that  information certainly would be a key to somebody who is gambling on the game."  </P> <P> At the college level, player injuries are not routinely announced by football  and basketball teams. But college injuries rarely remain hidden from gamblers,  according to Michael Roxborough, a Las Vegas oddsmaker.  </P> <P> Roxborough said he often phones reporters to gather information on college  teams. "If I need to find out about injuries, beat writers are the best to  call," he said. "Sometimes I tip them off to stories they don't know, so I'm  doing them a favor, too."  </P> <P> Rich Levin, public relations director for Major League Baseball, said some  reporters are betting on games they cover. "It goes on a lot . . . reporters  talk about bets they've made, how much money they've won or lost," he said.  "And on occasion (they) call from a press box phone to a bookmaker."  </P> <P> Last year the baseball commissioner's office took the unusual step of revoking  the credentials of two news media representatives who were observed gathering  information in clubhouses, then using stadium phones to place bets, Hallinan  said.  </P> <P> "We caught them in the act (at ballparks), putting their action in," he said.  "They were extremely embarrassed about it. . . . They said they just got  carried away." Hallinan declined to name the reporters or specify whether they  are employed in the print or broadcast media.  </P> <P> Chet Forte, a former director of ABC-TV's "Monday Night Football," recently  acknowledged having an addiction to sports gambling. Terry O'Neil, NBC Sports  executive producer, said in his book, "The Game Behind the Game," that he once  observed Forte phoning a bookmaker from the ABC director's truck.  </P> <P> Nothing worries league security officials more than the threat of a fix. Dozens  of college basketball games were fixed during the 1950s and '60s. In 1981 a  Boston College basketball player was convicted for his role in a point-shaving  plot that was backed by the Lucchese crime family. In 1985 several Tulane  basketball players and students pleaded guilty to participating in a  point-shaving scheme.  </P> <P> In February, ABC-TV reported that an alleged New Jersey gambler Robert Kramer  III paid Shackleford and three unidentified former North Carolina State  basketball players to shave points in as many as four games during the 1987-88  season. Kramer and Shackleford have denied the allegations, which reportedly  are being examined by a New Jersey grand jury and the North Carolina State  Bureau of Investigation.  </P> <P> Scott Schettler, who directs one of the largest Las Vegas betting operations,  the Stardust Hotel Race and Sports Book, said he doubts a fix occurred because  no extraordinary amount of money was bet on the suspected games. "We would know  if something's wrong," he said. "There was nothing wrong. It's as simple as  that."  </P> <P> Shackleford is now a forward with the New Jersey Nets.  </P> <P> Gary Bettman, NBA senior vice president and general counsel, said his league  isn't particularly worried about fix attempts. "Relative to what our players  make, I don't know that there's enough money that could cause one of our  players to fix a game," he said.  </P> <P> But some sports and law enforcement officials said soaring salaries do not  eliminate the possibility of a fix, especially in view of increased drug and  gambling activity in the United States.  </P> <P> "The worst-case scenario is that an athlete who's a drug abuser becomes  indebted to his drug source and can't pay," said Welsh, a former FBI agent.  "The athlete then gets that little knock on the door at 2 some morning, and  he's told: 'Now you have two employers. One may be your football team but the  other is us.' "  </P> <P> "The biggest (gambling) concern of the FBI and probably all the professional  and college leagues is the potential use of bribery or extortion to compromise  an athlete," French said. "Three areas we concentrate on are money, narcotics  and women. These are the areas we feel an athlete could be most vulnerable."  </P> <P> Those in the Las Vegas gambling community disdain talk of fixes or  organized-crime involvement in their business. "The crap about bookmakers  breaking people's legs if they don't pay, that's all bull," said Billy Walters,  a self-described high-stakes bettor and former bookmaker. "That might have  happened 20 years ago. But it hasn't happened in the last 20 years that I've  been involved."  </P> <P> Some federal law enforcement officials disagree, and they point to recent court  cases. In December of 1988, for example, an alleged associate of the Genovese  and Gambino organized crime families, Vincent Matturro of Scarsdale, N.Y., was  arrested on charges he operated a multimillion-dollar football betting ring.  Several days later Matturro was found dead, hanging from a rope in the garage  of his home.  </P> <P> Last year, the alleged leaders of a New York sports gambling and loan-sharking  operation were indicted on charges they threatened bodily harm to bettors who  didn't repay loans. A representative of the defendants set fire to one man's  car and threatened to break another's legs, the indictment alleges.  </P> <P> Welsh said organized-crime figures have attempted to make inroads with NFL  players in "very limited situations." Horace Balmer, NBA security director,  declined to be interviewed, referring all questions to Bettman. Asked about  possible ties between gamblers and NBA club and league personnel, Bettman said:  "I don't want to comment. . . . The whole issue is sensitive. I don't want to  fuel speculation. . . . We have not had any gambling problems, and we're proud  of that."  </P> <P> In the aftermath of the Rose scandal, leagues have taken steps to distance  themselves from gambling. "The leagues realize gambling has the potential to  destroy the golden goose," French said. "Once the public's confidence is shaken  by a scandal or two, the game could go down the tubes."  </P> <P> Vincent flexed his muscles in Washington recently, warning that a proposed  sports lottery game could reduce the city's chances of getting an expansion  franchise. Several days after Vincent's statement, the D.C. Council voted to  block creation of a sports lottery game.  </P> <P> After learning Rose had placed bets from ballparks, Vincent ordered clubs to  log phone calls to and from clubhouses and umpires' locker rooms. Earlier, the  commissioner's office barred nonessential personnel from clubhouses. "Once you  get burned, you start closing the doors," Hallinan said.  </P> <P> The NBA has filed suit against the organizers of a state sports lottery in  Oregon. "Our players have been on record as saying they don't want to be bet on  like horses," Bettman said. And the NFL has notified five television networks  it does not want gambling-oriented information on game-day telecasts. Welsh  said the TV betting segments created a perception that "the NFL condoned  betting."  </P> <P> One apparent double standard remains: While NFL players are forbidden from  betting on games, even in Las Vegas, the league allows hotel owner Barron  Hilton, whose Las Vegas Hilton houses a sprawling sports bookmaking operation,  to remain a minority owner of the San Diego Chargers. Welsh said NFL  Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will review Hilton's ownership status.  </P> <P> Athletes and club officials can't plead ignorance to the subject of gambling.  Since 1982, FBI agents have been making annual visits to college and pro teams,  warning them of the pitfalls of this activity.  </P> <P> FBI agents have warned players repeatedly since the mid-1980s that a woman,  posing as a fashion model or portrait artist, has lured dozens of college and  pro athletes to hotel rooms and, in some instances, drugged and photographed  them in compromising positions, according to law enforcement sources.  </P> <P> Based on an unrelated case, a federal warrant has been issued in Cleveland for  the arrest of a man who has assisted the woman and who allegedly has had sex  with an athlete, sources said.  </P> <P> "They're hoping to blackmail athletes, trying to gain some benefits from them  down the road," said Frank Torpey, security director of the NHL. "The most  likely benefits would be to obtain inside information on teams or to eventually  alter the outcome of a game."  </P> <P> Said Welsh: "We're certainly aware of it, and (NFL) players' names have come  up. They had lists of people who were on their kind of hit list. Most of these  scams seem to be aimed at getting money from a person. But there's no reason it  couldn't be used -- attempted, at least -- to influence the outcome of a  contest."  </P> <P> Some associations between sports and alleged gambling figures seem inevitable.  For example, two newspapers and a Detroit television station reported in June  that a close friend of Piston guard Isiah Thomas is a target in an FBI gambling  investigation. The friend, Imad Denha, is a former neighbor of Thomas' and the  godfather of Thomas's son, Joshua. Thomas is not a suspect in the case.  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas's NCAA championship basketball players can scarcely visit a  fast-food restaurant without meeting a gambler. Not only is sports gambling  legal in Las Vegas, some of UNLV's most prominent boosters, including Steve  Wynn, owner of the Mirage and Golden Nugget hotels, operate legal sports books.  </P> <P> "If the kids are betting and stuff like that, you know, that's bad," UNLV Coach  Jerry Tarkanian said. "But to go out and have dinner with a guy who works in a  casino, what the hell. That's his livelihood. There's nothing wrong with that."  </P> <P> One gambler who seemed harmless to Tarkanian was Sam Perry, a New York  summer-league coach who gambled in Las Vegas. Perry helped support one Rebel  recruit, befriended at least two others and was seen in 1987 around the UNLV  basketball coaches' offices.  </P> <P> UNLV players later learned that Sam Perry was really Richard Perry, a  twice-convicted sports fixer. "We don't encourage our athletes to interact with  people with unsavory backgrounds," Brad Rothermel, UNLV athletic director, said  recently. "But how do you prevent it? You know, it's virtually impossible to  follow 15 student-athletes every hour of the day."  </P> <P> The NFL won't soon forget former Baltimore and Indianapolis Colt quarterback  Art Schlichter, who was suspended by the league in 1983 after he reportedly  totaled $750,000 in gambling debts. Schlichter underwent treatment for a  gambling addiction and was arrested on illegal gambling charges four years  later.  </P> <P> Schlichter, who entered another treatment center last fall, now quarterbacks  the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football league. At 30, he said he dreams of  returning to the NFL. This spring he was observed betting on sporting events in  Las Vegas hotels, according to Welsh and Nevada gambling sources.  </P> <P> "Somebody said if you're ever looking for Art Schlichter, all you have to do is  go to the Stardust," Welsh said. "With no mask or anything else, I guess he was  just hanging out there. Art's had his problems." Schlichter could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> This fall, FBI agents will return to NFL training camps for their annual  lectures. French said he will warn players of the federal penalties for fixing  games and of the scams being attempted by gamblers.  </P> <P> "When we go into the specifics of different (scams), it seems to ring a bell  with the athletes," French said. "The light goes on in their heads. They say,  'Geez, I remember that happening when I was on the road in Detroit or Cleveland  or Buffalo.' "  </P> <P> For those who cannot relate, or who believe his lecture is much ado about  nothing, French will display a newspaper clipping that appeared the day after  Rose was banned from baseball. "I think the headline sends a pretty strong  message," French said.  </P> <P> The headline reads:  </P> <P> THE SAD END.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ATWATER IS ACTIVE AFTER SURGERY  </P> <P> Lee Atwater, the Republican National Committee chairman, was up and talking a  day after surgery in which radioactive isotopes were implanted in his brain to  kill a tumor, a committee official said today.  </P> <P> Atwater, 39, was receiving numerous visitors in a New York hospital, though  they had to stand behind a lead shield because of radioactivity, committee  chief of staff Mary Matalin said.  </P> <P> She said Atwater came through the surgery "with flying colors" and his doctors  point to a number of positive factors that give hope for thwarting the tumor.  Those include his age and good physical condition as well as the size and  location of the tumor in the right frontal lobe of his brain.  </P> <P> His wife, Sally, who is expecting to deliver the couple's third child on  Monday, was in New York with him.  </P></p>

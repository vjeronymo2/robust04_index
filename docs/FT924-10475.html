			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Nowhere else to go: Major deserves total support in next week's Maastricht vote despite the treaty's flaws Whatever else may be said about the prime minister, and much of it has been said here, his determination to press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty is wholly to his credit. He deserves, on this matter, total support, starting with a Yes vote at the end of next Wednesday's debate. He is doing his best to achieve this, by using a combination of charm and whips' threats to reduce the number of Tory rebels. Mr Major's detractors might argue that he has no option, that his personal future depends on his being able to demonstrate that he can reassert his authority over the Conservative party. To that end he must get the wretched ratification bill through. Agreed, but there is a more noble reason for voting Yes. It is, simply, that Britain is in Europe whether it likes it or not. That means taking part in whatever games the big nations, particularly France and Germany, are playing at any given time. This perception has informed the policies of every prime minister since Harold Macmillan conceded, in July 1961, that the British-inspired European Free Trade Area, a ring of seven dwarfs around the then European Economic Community, was no substitute for the real thing. Yes, I did say 'every' prime minister. Lady Thatcher would doubtless oppose the Single European Act with all the force at her command were it to be introduced today. As Mrs Margaret Thatcher she whipped it through with a determination at least equal to the stubbornness of which Mr Major is accused by the Euro-phobes when it comes to the Maastricht bill. The prime minister's answer to a question in the House on Tuesday summarises his approach. 'I believe that we have had three historic mistakes over the last 30 years in European policy,' he said. 'The first was when we failed to join the Community at the outset.' In fact it was Anthony Eden, a failed prime minister to whom Mr Major has over recent weeks been compared, whose government declined to send even an observer to the Messina gathering of foreign ministers of the six in 1956. It was there that work began on the Treaty of Rome, while Britain dreamed on, tossing and turning as it relived its imperial past. The Rome treaty was signed on March 25 1957, 10 weeks after Eden's departure. Its signatories' mission, contained in the opening words of the preamble, was to 'lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe'. The other two 'historic mistakes' referred to by the prime minister on Tuesday were, of course, the French vetoes exercised in 1963 and 1967. 'Today,' said Mr Major, 'we have more of a chance than ever we have had before of building a European Community in the image that we in this country wish to see.' Had it not been a poor season in which to do so, he might have concluded with words penned in 1989 by the president of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine: 'The conditions which made it possible for Britain to be semi-detached from Europe for so long have vanished forever. There is no empire to sustain us; we are no longer an industrial super-power; we can no longer pretend that Britain is in any sense an equal partner of the US. There is nowhere for us to go except as part of a European consortium.' Mr Major is no wordsmith. But he did quite well yesterday, pointing out that 'people who work in Sony factories in Wales and Nissan factories in the north' would not regard it as sensible to call into question the UK's commitment to Europe. I suspect that it is this kind of thinking that led Mr Kenneth Clarke to accept the Maastricht deal without reading the fine print. The home secretary had no need to strain his eyesight. Having given negotiation its best shot, the government, including all its ministers, can only accept the deal that at least 10 of the 12 members of the EC are willing to sign. I have ploughed through the treaty and, like many others, wish that some of the things that are there were not. The dread Commission pops its prying head into every sub-clause that matters, including those from which it is asked, in this or that main clause or elsewhere, to exclude itself. Subsidiarity is a wonderful concept, but a proper definition remains elusive. This kind of thing greatly exercises the Euro-phobes, who have learned to quote chapter and verse at every stage of every argument. The threats thus conjured up certainly are frightening. Some government ministers attempt to soothe us by asserting that the Europeans take little notice of the legalities, so there is nothing to fear. Some pro-Europeans sigh and ask whether anyone has thought of the spirit of European integration. All of this is beside the point. There is one unanswerable argument for ratifying Maastricht: Britain has nowhere else to go. When even the Swiss knock on the door of the future European Union, opponents of British membership have lost their last rational objection. 'Very well, alone' was a brave and stirring battle-cry half a century ago; today it is the pathetic bleat of the self-deluded. We would be well advised to stay with our partners even if the Maastricht treaty had been expressly federalist in intent. If the exchange rate mechanism is seen to be still in working order in a year or so, we will be begging to rejoin that. In the highly unlikely event of a single currency being established, we will, sooner or later, be on our knees pleading to participate. It may be protested that if Denmark can reject the treaty, as they have done once and may do again, then Britain should have the same opportunity. But Denmark is not one of the great powers of Europe. It is not burdened by a long history of obstructive opposition to every step the others take. It does not need to prove its commitment. Britain does. If it rats on Maastricht now it will pay a high price. Mr John Smith is well aware of all this. He has been a strong European since at least October 1971, when he defied the whips and voted for entry. Yet the leader of the Labour party has chosen this week to hide behind quibbles over the Danish position in an effort to justify a No vote next Wednesday. Lest that be seen through, Labour is arguing that what will be on offer is a vote of confidence in Mr Major, which they feel obliged to oppose. Every vote these days is a vote of confidence in the prime minister, but Labour's position is pure humbug. It has moved from being the party of Europe to being the party of Europe-when-it-suits-us. If there really was a possibility of forcing a general election Labour's position might be defensible. Mr Smith knows as well as anybody that this is not on. Yesterday the prime minister promised a substantive motion to be debated 'on its merits'. That should retain the support of the Liberal Democrats while shaming Labour. Mr Major's personal position is primarily dependent upon how quickly the recession is conquered. A defeat next week might finish him. A Yes vote would boost his authority, and ease the passage of the ratification bill. It would not clear away the blizzard of misfortune which has struck the prime minister since Black Wednesday. That may run right through the winter.</p>

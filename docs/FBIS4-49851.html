			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Ordinary Work Shining With </F> Splendor of Dedication"]    [Text] "He stood upright in the manner of a Communist  Party member." The people in Tianjin gave their heartfelt  praise to Comrade Dai Chengjiang, a Communist Party member and  people's policeman. People reading the newsletter about his  deeds were moved to tears. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was worthy of  the praise given by the masses.    People's policemen have certain powers for performing their  official duties. It is rather convenient for them to use the  powers in their hands to seek certain "real benefits" for  themselves. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was always sober-headed in  facing this issue, and drew a clear line of demarcation between  public duties and personal gains. When performing official  duties, he gave the "red light" to his personal affairs and the  private affairs of his family and friends, and even refused to  buy a pair of shoes for his wife at the wholesale price. Did he  lead a well-off life? No. The difficulties he was facing was  self-evident because he had to support a family of three  generations with his salary alone, as his wife was working in a  unit that was mired in financial difficulties. Then why did he  turn down such little benefits? Because he was determined to  safeguard the solemnity and purity of the national emblem on his  cap, and to keep it from being sullied by self-interest and  corruption. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was deeply aware that he had  to always set strict demand on himself and keep himself  incorrupt and honest in order to really win the masses' trust  and support and to properly perform his official duties.    Comrade Mao Zedong said: It is not hard for one to do a bit  of good; what is hard is to do good all one's life and never do  anything bad. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was precisely this kind of  model Communist Party member. He always did good, not because  he acted on impulse, not because he wanted to earn some capital  for himself in order to climb to a higher position and gain  greater benefits; instead he did good really and wholeheartedly  for the purpose of seeking benefit for the people. In the eyes  of some people, his behavior was "no longer suited to the  current conditions" and he was too "silly." After Comrade Dai  Chengjiang's death, however, Tianjin residents spontaneously  braved the bitterly cold winds to take part in a funeral  procession. This was the best evaluation of a man's life.  Comrade Dai Chengjiang carried forward the Chinese nation's  uprightness and the Communists' lofty belief. Seeing the strong  repercussions evoked by Comrade Dai Chengjiang among the people,  are the people who are keen only to seek private gains and line  their pockets not ashamed of their behavior?    Comrade Dai Chengjiang stood at his posts for more that 23  years and always faithfully performed his duties by doing  innumerable little and ordinary things. The little things he  did showed his lofty spirit, and the ordinary work shone with  the splendor of dedication. This splendor lit up the hearts of  hundreds of millions of people, and encouraged the vast numbers  of cadres and masses to make progress and work with one heart  and one mind by following in the footprints of the hero.</p>

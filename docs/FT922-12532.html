			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Forte The market readily forgave Forte's 63 per cent fall in pre-tax profits at the interim stage. The excuse was the Gulf war, and expectations were for quick recovery. Now, after a 59 per cent fall in the second half, the market is again in a forgiving mood. The grounds this time are the depth and persistence of the UK recession which hit Forte's London hotel business hard during the autumn. Perhaps investors would take a harsher view if the company did not present a clean-cut image in an otherwise slightly racy sector. Unlike Ladbroke, Forte has no record of flattering its profit and loss account with property disposals. Unlike Queens Moat, it has had no rights issue since 1981. Moreover, Forte has coped sensibly with the recession, cutting out Pounds 40m of fixed costs and aggressively marketing its re-branded hotels in an apparently successful effort to raise market share. Gearing may have risen from 36 to 44 per cent, but interest is still covered 1.7 times and the ratio is likely to improve this year. At yesterday's close of 254p, however, the company is trading on a historic multiple of 42, more than four times that of Queens Moat. This year's multiple would still be over 20 if earnings doubled, which is stretching things on both counts. Higher debt will add to the interest bill, at least in the early part of the year. The tax charge, which last year included Pounds 11m of unrelieved ACT, is likely to stay high. Provincial hotels remain depressed. Business in London is not back to 1990 levels. In short, Forte is still far from achieving occupancy levels that will permit it to start jacking up rates. The recovery looks slow and the price expensive for a company which, with luck, will only just be able to cover a held dividend this year.</p>

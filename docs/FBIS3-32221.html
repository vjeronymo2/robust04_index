No violence  has been reported, but our correspondents in all of the  provinces and throughout Quito indicated the strike has been in  effect since this morning. The strike by workers, teachers,  students, Indians, and other segments of society was called to  demand the repeal of the increase of as much as 70 percent in  the price of gasoline.    After the first two hours of this protest action, which has  been described as preventative, there is a complete absence of  public transportation; there have been no outbursts of violence;  and all activities are suspended, even within the oil sector.  Government Minister Marcelo Santos has appealed to the  sensibility and understanding of the Ecuadoran people, but he  did not rule out the possibility of a decree ordering a military  mobilization if such a move becomes necessary.    So far, the toll of the student protests prior to today's  strike amounts to 70 people arrested; 10 people injured,  including both policemen and students; huge monetary losses; and  the destruction of private property. In addition, the members  of the economic team may face an interpellation.    A pot banging protest has been announced for Monday. On  Tuesday, Indians will go on a nationwide stoppage. The economic  measures have dealt a hard blow to the economy of the people,  and protests are increasing.</p>

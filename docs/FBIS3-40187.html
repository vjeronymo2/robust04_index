			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Nonmetallic Materials Section of the </F> Domestic Trade Department: "The Temporary Relief of Timber  Shortage Has Ended; Prospects for Plywood Are Great"]    [Text] I. Timber Resources Will Become Tight, Prices  Will Be Stable and Expected To Rise    After a comprehensive analysis of national economic  developments, the state's macroeconomic regulation and control  policies, and changes in the international timber market, we  believe that in this year and the next year resources on the  timber market will be tight, demand will pick up steadily, and  prices will also change from current falling to stabilizing and  rising situation.    1. Timber supply and demand contradiction becomes intense.  It  is predicted that the temporary relief of resource shortage will  end in early 1994 and the supply and demand contradiction will  gradually worsen. In the third quarter of 1993, due to the  function of market mechanism, social demand declined, giving  rise to a situation where resources appeared to be ample.  However, this balance of supply and demand was merely a fake  phenomenon during the period of shrinking purchasing power. The  1994 social timber balancing plan shows that the gap between  timber resources and social demand is approximately 1.6 million  cubic meters. First, judging from the domestic market, national  forests in northeast China and Nei Monggol already reached the  rational fixed production level of 19.17 million cubic meters in  1993. Domestic timber output is unlikely to increase  substantially in 1994, but social demand will increase markedly  along with the rapid growth of the national economy. Second,  judging from the international timber market, the Clinton  Administration has decided to ban the deforestation of 80  percent of virgin forests on 23 million acres of federal forest  land in the western United States. This, plus other negative  factors, such as slowing deforestation actitivies in Canada,  increasing log restrictions in Asia, and declining export of  timber from Africa and South America, are bound to affect the  market supply of timber which has become increasingly dependent  on the international market. Third, judging from experience,  China's timber shortage will not be easily corrected over a  relatively long period of time. The insufficient market supply  of timber is the major contradition, which will also exist for a  long time.    2. Timber prices will stabilize while falling. In the fourth  quarter and next year, the trend will be affected by many  factors, both up and down factors. Factors that will cause  timber prices to go up mainly include: 1) Along with the  implementation of state macroeconomic regulation and control  measures and the improvement of financial order, the production  fund shortage of key state construction projects and production  enterprises are expected to somewhat improve, and the evolution  of the supply and demand contradiction will provide a good  opportunity for the increase of timber prices. 2) Beginning 1  July 1993, railroad freight charges went up from 0.385 yuan per  ton kilometer to 0.535 yuan, jacking up the cost of timber  purchases. 3) The timber price of the international market has  gone up again. Between mid-August and mid-September, the log  price on the November future market of Chicago increased about  18 percent and the price for 1,000 square foot reached $316.  The price of domestic forest zones has also remained at a  fairly high level. Factors causing timber prices to decline  mainly include: 1) The state macroeconomic regulation and  control policy has achieved temporary success, and the function  and effect of such success will continue for a fairly long  period of time in the sphere of the economy. 2) The price of  timber substitutes--steel and nonferrous metal--has fallen to a  low level. 3) The large inventory of timber management units has  played a definite role in suppressing market prices. 4) The  mentality of timber users who buy when prices are high, not low,  has to a certain degree worsened the falling trend of timber  prices.    To sum up the above analysis, we believe that the basic  trend  of timber market price in 1993 and 1994 will rise gradually  during 1994 while stabilizing. But it will not increase as it  did in the first half of 1993.  <H5>  II. Plywood Import Will Gradually End Fluctuation </H5>   In the first half of 1993, resources of plywood import were  very tight, prices were sky-high, and plywood import became the  hot spot of business. In the third quarter of 1993, due to the  influence of falling prices of timber and other capital goods,  the prices of imported plywood declined somewhat. However,  compared to the beginning of 1993, demand for imported plywood  remains stable and the prices fairly high.    1. Regarding the delivery and cost of imported plywood, in  the first three quarters of 1993, the total amount of plywood  imported by all harbors of China decreased 21.7 percent as  compared to that of the corresponding period of 1992. Resources  were tight. In the first three quarters of 1993, harbors in  northern China witnessed marked increase in the import of  plywood, but the cost of imports remained high. Calculated  according to the current regulatory exchange rate (1:8.6), the  cost, insurance, and freight, after deducting other charges, was  66.7 yuan per sheet (specifications: 1,220 by 2,440 by 3mm).  This is basically the same as the cost after April.    2. After analyzing plywood import in the fourth quarter of  1993 and in 1994, we can come to the conclusion that it is  certain that the resources of imported plywood will become  tighter. Since the International Tropical Forest Organizations  demanded that Malaysia reduced plywood export by 1.5 million  cubic meters respectively in 1992 and 1993 and Indonesia  recently put strict control over the quota of plywood export to  China, our initial estimate is that our plywood import this year  will be 20 percent less than that in last year. Second, domestic  and international demands for South Pacific plywood has  increased substantially. New house construction rate in the  United States has increased 2 percent as compared to 1992; over  1.2 million houses will be built in Japan; and Korea has joined  the competition for resources in the plywood market.  Additionally, the peak season of remodeling and decorating in  urban and rural areas of China at the end of this year and the  beginning of next year is bound to fan demand for imported  plywood. Because of this, we predict that the market of imported  plywood will not slide substantially by yearend or at the  beginning of next year. The prices of imported plywood will  also rise from the current level.</p>

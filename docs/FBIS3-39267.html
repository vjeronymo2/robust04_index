[Delorme] The accords reveal a certain complicity between  the  United States and Europe, rather than competition. They have  arranged the resources so as to allow the two major powers to  support their agricultural sectors, protect their imports, and  subsidize their exports. The countries that hoped for a real  opening up of the markets, such as those in the Cairns group,  have been greatly disappointed. They cannot support their  exports financially. Nor do they have the political power that  would allow them to reject an agreement drafted without their  participation.    [LE QUOTIDIEN] What are the future stakes for the countries  in the European Union?    [Delorme] The agreement requires the Community to implement  the CAP seriously. The reduction in prices for which it called  has in effect been canceled out by the measures adopted  following the monetary chaos in the fall of 1992. The green ECU  [European currency unit], which expresses the guaranteed  agricultural prices, was aligned with the mark at that time. In  this way, Germany avoided a reduction in its prices just a few  months prior to the legislative elections. But the other  countries had to raise theirs. Apart from its budgetary cost,  this policy threatens the competitive capacity of European  products, grains in particular, since they are minimally  differentiated products that are very sensitive to relative  prices. Their price increases have prevented these countries  from winning back the European market, in competing with the  substitutes imported for animal feed, but they will also prevent  them from exporting without subsidization in the future. France  obtained a commitment from its partners not to expand their  fallow land areas further. But how, then, will the future price  drops be offset? By the European budget, but with a reduction in  aid to the Mediterranean producers? Or by the national budgets,  with a favorable modulation for the major producers?    [LE QUOTIDIEN] Can France manage the future of its  agricultural sector in the post-GATT era?    [Delorme] Public assistance to the agricultural sector will  have to be reorganized. In all the sectors, including grain  production as well as livestock breeding, both the very large  operations and those of medium size feel that they have been  weakened, because they cannot modernize without the assistance  of the state. The choice of those among them that must receive  priority support is above all a sociopolitical choice. On the  international level, France will from now on have an opportunity  for alliances that are more varied than its traditional link  with Germany within the Community. The United Kingdom, The  Netherlands, and Denmark, all countries that import grains, look  with favor on a reduction in prices. Paris could also obtain  support from Washington in the effort to persuade Germany to  lower its prices. And so France could give priority to  production with substantial added value, rather than focusing  solely on grains.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition  party leaders today formally chose Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  as candidate to succeed out-going Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, who abruptly announced his resignation two weeks ago.    At a meeting this afternoon, the leaders endorsed a policy  platform for a new cabinet and named Hata as the coalition's  joint candidate for the prime ministerial election in both  houses of the Diet (parliament) that is expected to meet next  Monday, coalition officials said.    Hata, 58, concurrently the deputy prime minister in the  Hosokawa cabinet, is expected to win the premiership election  because of the coalition's majority status in the Diet.    Soon after the election, Hata, who is the leader of  Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party) which is the coalition's core party, is  expected to launch his new administration, the officials said.    The endorsement of Hata came after secretaries general of  the  ruling parties struck a deal early today on two key issues --  tax system reform and Japan's response to the suspected nuclear  development program on the Korean peninsula.    The agreement put an end to two weeks of feud, first over  the  procedures for picking Hosokawa's successor and then over the  above- mentioned two issues, which are crucial to keeping the  nine-month-old alliance intact.</p>

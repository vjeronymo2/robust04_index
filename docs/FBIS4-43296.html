			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has won a vote of confidence from the  Eduskunta on its policy aimed at obtaining membership in the  European Union [EU]. The Eduskunta rejected the proposal by the  Leftist Alliance of a vote of no confidence by 97 votes to 80.  Sixteen representatives of the government parties abstained:  nine from the Center Party, six from the Christian League, and  one from the Swedish People's Party. The National Coalition  Party unanimously supported the government. No representative of  the government parties voted against the government. Of the  opposition parties, one representative of the Greens and the  sole representative of the Liberal Party supported the  government.    Prime Minister Esko Aho interpreted the vote as meaning that  there are no obstacles for the government to pursue its EU line.  However, each government party must define its own stance on the  matter. According to Aho, it was good that the results of the  vote of confidence were clear. What was not so good was that  the support from the government parties was not unanimous.    According to Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, the  Eduskunta's decision will calm the financial markets.</p>

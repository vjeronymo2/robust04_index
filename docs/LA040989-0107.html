			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> THEY'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT THE CALL AGAINST THE HALL  </P> <P> On the morning after Michigan won the National Collegiate Athletic Association  basketball championship, Steve Fisher's job status and Glen Rice's  records-breaking performance were overshadowed by The Call Against The Hall.  </P> <P> It was, in retrospect, the most lasting memory from Michigan's thrill-a-minute,  80-79 overtime victory over Seton Hall Monday night at the Kingdome. Forget  Rumeal Robinson's baseline two-handed reverse dunk or the second-half duel  between Rice (31 points) and Pirates guard John Morton (35).  </P> <P> In the end, it all came down to lead official John Clougherty's call with three  seconds remaining in overtime. Seton Hall point guard Gerald Greene was called  for bumping Robinson, as the Michigan point guard appeared to be passing off as  he drove in the lane. The Pirates were leading, 79-78.  </P> <P> "Honestly, I thought it was kind of weak to make that call at that time," said  Robinson, who after a Seton Hall timeout made both ends of the one-and-one.  </P> <P> "That's where I think referees take over the game," Robinson said. "I honestly  feel if I was the referee, I probably wouldn't have called that. I would have  let the play go on because there's only three seconds left. When you have so  much riding on the game, why call that?"  </P> <P> Said Greene, "It was one of those calls that could have gone either way. The  ref made the call on me, so it was the right call. I didn't spend much time  thinking about it. There were three seconds remaining and a lot of things could  have happened."  </P> <P> What happened was that Seton Hall forward Daryll Walker took a long inbounds  pass from center Ramon Ramos, wrestled the ball away from Greene, turned and  fired from 24 feet away. The ball ricocheted high off the backboard and into  the hands of Rice.  </P> <P> Michigan (30-7) had its first NCAA basketball championship. But Seton Hall  (31-7), which had trailed by 12 points five minutes into the second half and  had led, 79-76, following a three-point shot by Morton with 2:50 left in  overtime, had won more respect than any losing team in recent Final Four  memory.  </P> <P> "We knew they were going to come back, because they did against Duke," said  Michigan center Terry Mills, alluding to the Pirates' early 18-point deficit  that turned into a 17-point victory. "They have showed a lot of character and  class."  </P> <P> So did P.J. Carlesimo. Unlike many coaches, who might have ranted about how the  call cost his team the national championship, the Seton Hall coach displayed  the same cool and class afterward that he had shown during the game. He blamed  his team's defeat on its inability to hit some key free throws and makable  shots down the stretch.  </P> <P> "We had our opportunities," said Carlesimo, whose team could have wrapped  things up earlier, when Greene missed a crucial one-and-one with 1:13 left in  overtime, and later, when two shots by Morton fell short. "They made the shots  at the end and we didn't."  </P> <P> As for the officiating, Carlesimo said, "I'm not trying to be smart, but I  thought it was a well-officiated game. John Clougherty is one of the best, if  not the best, officials in the country. We couldn't have asked for anyone else  we'd rather have make the call when the game is on the line than John  Clougherty."  </P> <P> Of the call, one veteran official with extensive NCAA tournament experience  said, "First of all, no matter what anybody thinks, it's in the eye of the  beholder, and in this case, the official is the eye of the beholder. When that  call was made, it looked as if Robinson was going to the basket and the bump  caused him to pass off.  </P> <P> "You could argue from now until doomsday. You get 10 people, and five will say  it was a good call and five will say it wasn't. For a good official, it's not a  tough call. You want to be consistent for 40 minutes. If you make that call in  the opening seconds, you make it in the closing seconds."  </P></p>

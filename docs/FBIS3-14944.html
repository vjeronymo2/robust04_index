			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 40 (530): </F> Reports by Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor  Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Presidential aides Georgiy Satarov and Yuriy Baturin  and Yeltsin's representative in parliament Aleksandr Yakovlev  held a news brief in Moscow on Monday.    In an opening speech, Yakovlev said he thought that the main  idea of the president's message to parliament was a commitment  to build a democratic society in Russia in democratic ways in  keeping with the country's constitution and laws.    For his part, Satarov said the new constitution marked an  end  to the stage of building democracy from "above". He described  Russia's democracy as rather fragile adding it needed internal  stability to survive. The aide described as fundamental those  aspects of Yeltsin's address.    Both officials agreed that Russia was still in need of  coordinated legislation to ensure internal stability under its  multi-party democracy. "The system tends to become a  destabilizing factor when the number of parties exceeds five",  Satarov said. And he called for the creation of such parties  which could reflect real public mood and opinion. Satarov  pointed to the message's section saying part of government  functions must be devolved to the public.    The Duma's Saturday resolution on amnesty for October  uprising leaders dominated the agenda.    Yakovlev said the society was tired of political squabbles.  In his view, many of the deputies voted for amnesty driven by a  sincere desire for civic peace. He said it would not be long  before it became clear whether the resolution was aimed at  national reconciliation or confrontational attitudes.    On the possibility of the amnesty being withdrawn, Satarov  said the rebellion leaders could be jailed again only Interfax  they were in breach of law. [sentence as received] "Such is the  president's belief", he added. The aide described as crazy the  suggestion from one of the journalists saying the president  could try to overturn the amnesty resolution by force.    One other aide, Yuriy Baturin, who was 45 minutes late for  the briefing because of a routine meeting with Yeltsin said:  "Our society is in need of an amnesty law. Without such an act,  it will be hard to envisage steps for minimizing the negative  implications of the Duma's amnesty resolution". Baturin  reaffirmed having discussed this with Yeltsin. But declined to  comment on the meeting though not ruling out the possibility of  Yeltsin appearing on appear on national television on Monday.    Baturin described the continuing split in the democratic  camp  as by far the greatest danger for Russia's fledgling democracy.  "We must overcome it. I hope we will, otherwise there can be no  democratic society," he said.    A presidential message listing priority bills, scheduled to  be submitted to the Duma this Monday, will not be sent to the  lower house of the Russian parliament for at least two or three  days. Georgy Satarov, president's assistant, told Interfax  Monday that "the State Duma forced us to attend to other  business," meaning the presidential team's attempt to have the  release of those amnestied by the Duma put off.    According to Satarov, those attempts were not dictated by  the  desire to safeguard the president from a comeback by his  political opponents. Rather, the goals of Yeltsin's messages to  the prosecutor general and the State Duma were to align the  amnesty with the law and minimize the harm it might do.    Satarov did not agree with the view that the presidential  team had been passive while the Duma had debated and later  adopted the amnesty resolution. He said that he had proposed to  the State Duma Council on February 22 that the issue should not  have been discussed before the annual presidential message was  heard.    Satarov emphasized that the lower house of parliament was  best placed to prevent a new increase of political tension in  the country. He said that he had been assured by State Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin that the parliament's leaders were aware of  this responsibility.</p>

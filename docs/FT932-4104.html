			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Analysts see no merit in change: Mixed response to Lamont's 'independence' call CITY ANALYSTS were less than impressed by Mr Norman Lamont's call for an independent central bank. Although many are in favour of wresting control of monetary policy from politicians, the response to yesterday's speech was that once again the UK was searching for a panacea to its enduring problem of inflation. Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, said: 'Nigel Lawson made a similar plea when he resigned, but I am afraid it misses the point. What you really need is not so much a constitutional change which allows for an independent central bank, but an aversion to inflation on behalf of the population.' Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, said: 'In the late 1980s everyone thought that ERM entry would be the answer to inflation. 'I think it is rather depressing that we are again looking for a holy grail. In the end it boils down to whether we have the right policies or not, and an independent central bank isn't going to change that.' This view was echoed by Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburgs. 'I am not sure that an institutional change will solve the UK's underlying macroeconomic problems,' he said. 'An independent central bank would help, but it isn't necessarily the panacea for inflation that people think it is.' Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, said it was remarkable how retired chancellors appeared to see the attraction of handing over monetary control to an independent body as soon as they left office. 'It probably would be an advantage,' he said. 'But I think the advantages are grossly overdone.' Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank, said that even an independent central bank would have to earn its own credibility. 'Just having one does not automatically prove your credibility as a low inflation country,' she said.</p>

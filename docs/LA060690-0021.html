			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP AND L.A. SCHOOL BOARD BATTLE OVER AMBASSADOR SITE  </P> <P> The priorities of The Times with regards to the Ambassador site seem to be  development first, children, if a place can be found for them, second, and  retention of low-cost housing last, if anything is left. Why not knock down an  old office building if more offices are needed in the mid-Wilshire area? The  Times would have the school board destroy people's homes as the way to solve  the problem.  </P> <P> Better to relocate a place of work than further aggravate the low-income  housing stock. Better to place a new high school on land that tells children  they are our top priority.  </P> <P> The Ambassador site is the place to make the hard decisions for our children's  future. Los Angeles Times and Donald Trump, move on down the road. Our children  need a new school as soon as possible.  </P> <P> ED BROSTOFF  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

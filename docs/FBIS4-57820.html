			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 24 May (AFP) -- Manuel Garcia  Lizardo, president of the Central Electoral Board (JCE), today  categorically denied that the thought of a runoff election was  being considered because "the people have already voted."  Garcia Lizardo thereby denied statements to the contrary, which  were attributed to him by some news media.    Noting that the vote count will begin on Wednesday [25 May],  Garcia Lizardo said: "The people have already voted. What is  left to be done is assessing the people's vote."    In addition, JCE spokesmen recalled that the law does not  call for an annulment of the elections or a runoff election.  According to the law, the only action that could be taken would  be holding partial or complementary elections in places where  there were serious irregularities.    Presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez called for  a  runoff election after alleging that a "scandalous fraud" was  committed in the 16 May elections.    The JCE has not proclaimed a winner yet. However, following  the count of 98 percent of the votes, President Joaquin Balaguer  was ahead of Pena Gomez by 1.01 percent.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Strong overseas growth helps Farnell to Pounds 28.7m Farnell Electronics, the components distributor and manufacturer, reported sharply higher interim profits and turnover, reflecting strong overseas growth and the Pounds 41m acquisition of the Multicomponents distribution business. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 increased by 36 per cent to Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 21.1m). Turnover grew by 77 per cent to Pounds 261m (Pounds 147m); underlying growth was 13.5 per cent. 'Overseas growth was particularly strong,' said Mr Richard Hanwell, chairman. Both the high volume distribution and the low-volume catalogue businesses improved profitability overseas, he said, 'demonstrating the success of offering customers a pan-European service'. The Multicomponents operations, renamed Farnell Electronic Services, added Pounds 93.7m to turnover in the first half and Pounds 2.2m to operating profits, which increased by 40 per cent to Pounds 29.8m (Pounds 21.3m). Overall, the overseas FES operations doubled profits on sales up 15 per cent. In the UK, sales volumes at FES increased by 11 per cent but margins remained under pressure. Farnell Electronic Components reported a 22 per cent increase in profits on sales 12.3 per cent ahead. The UK operations achieved steady sales growth while overseas sales were up by more than 40 per cent. Particularly strong sales of power supplies for the telecommunications sector helped the group's manufacturing operations to increase sales by 26 per cent, but results from Farnell Instruments were 'disappointing'. At the end of July the group had net borrowings of Pounds 8.67m, equivalent to gearing of 7 per cent. Interest costs totalled Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 138,000), reflecting borrowings undertaken to finance the purchase of Multicomponents. Earnings per share grew by 36 per cent to 14.3p (10.5p). The interim dividend is increased by 19 per cent to 3.8p (3.2p). Mr Harry Elstone is to step down as finance director, although he will remain on the board. He is succeeded by Mr Andrew Fisher. Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, and Mr Barry Bramley, a director of BAT Industries, are both joining the board as non-executives. COMMENT Once again Farnell has produced a strong underlying performance, justifying its decision to expand its overseas operations. Following a recent strategic review undertaken by Mr Howard Poulson, the chief executive, the company intends to focus future growth on the higher margin catalogue distribution business and is particularly interested in expanding in the US or east Asia  -possibly through acquisition. Pre-tax profits should climb to about Pounds 62m this year, producing earnings of about 30.5p. At 531p, the shares are trading on a forward multiple of 17.4 - a small discount to competitors such as Electrocomponents - and well below their 12-month peak of 653p.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Property: Recovery is patchy in housing market - Cadogan's Place The March figures of the Corporate Estate Agents' property index showed much more business than in February but little change compared with March last year. New instructions were up 15.5 per cent on February, and gross sales (those agreed but not completed - a good forward indicator of confidence) by 9.5 per cent. Most important - because they provide the best indication of what is actually happening - is that completed sales were up 5.2 per cent on February. But March was not so rosy when compared with March last year. New instructions were up by 5 per cent, but gross and completed sales were both down, by 4 and 3.8 per cent respectively. The CEA covers about half the country's agents, and stories from others confirm this mixed picture. Some house prices have risen when there has been competition, but many are still coming down. The market is stabilising through a modest recovery. Only in London have there been marked rises at the top end of the market. Savills Prime Central London index gained 5 per cent in the first quarter, bringing the total increase since December 1992 to 15.7 per cent. The rise that began with large houses in Mayfair, Belgravia and Knightsbridge has now spread to flats in Docklands, a depressed area not long ago. Beyond the capital, however, buyers are refusing to bite unless prices seem reasonable, although agents report many potential purchasers on their books. And increases in fixed-rate mortgages may be an excuse to be yet more choosy. The secret for vendors is not to set a price geared to their highest expectations - or what they paid six years ago - but to choose a fair to generous figure. That will attract cash-conscious buyers and produce the chance of competition, with a selling figure above the original guide price. How much competition will there be for one of the country's best grouse moors? Earl Peel waits to see. Through Davis and Bowring (0524 - 271 711) and Savills (0904 - 620 731), he is selling his large Gunnerside estate in upper Swaledale, West Yorkshire. On offer are 26,485 acres (including 6,580 of farmland, let and in-hand) with shooting rights over a further, heather-covered 5,670. There are eight cottages and a 14-bedroom house. Swaledale is right out of the television series All Creatures Great and Small. At the bottom, grey stone walls criss-cross the green meadows with their stone barns. Above are the wild moors, where it was snowing only a few days ago. Peel has worked hard to regenerate the heather, which has been affected since 1947 by over-grazing. The government's sheep incentives have not helped the moors, either. Now as the sheep decline, the heather is returning although there are still 3,000 acres where it could grow again. Shooting is as good as in the best parts of Scotland, with a variety of drives which can be tackled on the same day thanks to new roads through the estate. And bags have continued to get larger, reaching 4,103 brace in 1992. Although last year was a disaster, the 10-year average is 2,324. The estate ranges from high moors to a small upland valley where the birds swoop suddenly over the guns who stand beside the stream. The grouse are laying their eggs now and the main hatching time is around May 20. Peel and his four gamekeepers must hope for a great last season before completion next February 2. The price needs thought. The starting figures between Pounds 70 and Pounds 75 plus VAT for shooting a brace, (or a capital value in recent large sales of about Pounds 2,500 a brace). Then there is the farm income (Pounds 70,762 in 1992/93) and the value of a fine pheasant shoot in the low ground - not to mention the buildings. Hardest to assess, though, is the quality of the shooting. How much premium will a buyer pay for that? Expect multi-million pound offers from people prepared to continue making the heather grow and providing a habitat that also attracts curlews, golden plovers and black grouse.</p>

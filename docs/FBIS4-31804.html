			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Asen Furchilkov, leader of the Rakovski </F> Bulgarian Officer Legion, by Lyubomir Denov; place and date not  given: "Lieutenant Colonel Asen Furchilkov: Rakovski Legion  Will Not Be Obedient"]    [Excerpts] [Denov] Mr. Furchilkov, where do you think the  money could be found for the 25 percent increase in military  wages the Rakovski Officer Legion demanded at its congress?    [Furchilkov] We know that the military budget is low.  However, in order to avoid being accused of populism I must  stress that our declaration on increasing the wages is a unique  signal that the military wages are low. Let the government draw  its own conclusions.    [Denov] Is there a danger that the legion could be excluded  from the Defense Law when the parliament votes on it? After the  Khaskovo petition many deputies said that they will not support  the legitimation of the organization.    [Furchilkov] I am not afraid of that. The Europeanization  of the country cannot be stopped. Such organizations exist in  all democratic states in Europe. [passage omitted]    [Denov] How are relations between the legion and the Defense  Ministry chiefs after the conflict over the so-called "bloody  letter?" When the letter was published the Defense Ministry  leadership accused the authors of the letter, who initiated a  petition demanding to increase the military budget, of  instigation and planning a coup.    [Furchilkov] The whole problem is that we failed to  construct a proper cooperation mechanism. We reached an  agreement at all meetings at which specific problems of the  officers were discussed. When our relations are disrupted  blunders occur. This is a paradox -- after all, both we and the  minister of defense pursue the same goals, and yet conflicts  emerge. Obviously, the problem is in the mechanism of our  contacts. I hope that everything will be strengthened out.  Naturally there will be differences, but the legion will not be  an obedient organization.    [Denov] What is the legion's attitude toward the intention  of Minister Aleksandrov to apply the 1958 Law on Military  Service and force all officers above the age of 50 to retire?    [Furchilkov] The defense minister has no other choice except  to apply the existing law. There simply is not any other law.  This is another paradox that stems from the low military budget.    However, the legion proposes several criteria for retiring  the officers. If those criteria are strictly followed the  tension in the Army will significantly abate. First, officers  who do not have a higher education should be dismissed. Second,  those who have posts which are lower than what their rank  requires must go. Third, officers whose qualifications do not  correspond to the posts they have must retire. However, the  1958 law does not contain such clauses. This means that people  will be dismissed in accordance with the year of their  recruitment. It is difficult to say which principle is better.  If the selective method is applied the danger exists that  distortions will emerge if the "your people -- our people"  principle is applied.    Simultaneously, we nevertheless demand that those people  receive all compensations and indemnities.    [Denov] Does the legion have contacts with political  parties?    [Furchilkov] Yes, the legion has contacts with all  officially registered political forces. It is a different issue  how efficient those contacts are. Until now we associated with  the parties mainly through the newspapers. This produced  certain negative consequences. From now on we will adopt the  course of direct meetings with the basic parliamentary forces,  in order to demonstrate our real face. [passage omitted]</p>

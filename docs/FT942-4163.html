			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Hollinger boosts quarterly payout Hollinger, the international publishing group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, has raised its quarterly dividend by 50 per cent and presented a confident view of future prospects, especially in North America. The dividend increase, from 10 cents to 15 cents a share, was accompanied by a prediction from Mr Black yesterday that 1994 will be a year 'of unprecedented profit and cash flow'. Hollinger's interests include 57 per cent of the UK Telegraph group, which in turn owns 25 per cent of Australia's John Fairfax Holdings. It also has a minority stake in Southam, Canada's biggest newspaper group, and earlier this year bought the Chicago-Sun Times. Mr Black told the annual meeting in Toronto that he expects Hollinger's North American papers (excluding Southam) to lift earnings to CDollars 80m (USDollars 57.9m) this year, before depreciation and taxes but after interest, from just under CDollars 50m in 1993. He predicted that profits of American Publishing, Hollinger's US subsidiary, would exceed those of the Telegraph within the next three years. Mr Black said the Sun-Times, Chicago's second-largest daily, was 'fairly close' to a decision on new technology to replace its ageing printing facilities. Hollinger has already trimmed the Sun-Times' payroll. Mr Black added that the circulations of the UK Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph were 'quite satisfactory' at present, in spite of cut-price competition from The Times. But he said the Telegraph would consider 'remedial action' if The Times' circulation rose to more than half that of the Telegraph, presently just over 1m copies a day. 'We will not tolerate any challenge to the Telegraph's market supremacy,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, 2 Mar (TANJUG) -- We have conveyed our  view to the Russian side that we do not oppose in the least the  agreement between the Croats and Muslims, provided it is  directed toward peace, Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the  assembly of the Srpska republic [RS] and member of the RS  delegation in Moscow, told Novi Sad radio today.    "Developments have so far shown that the intentions of the  Croats and Muslims are such as to form a block against the  Serbian side," he said. "We are going to exchange views on this  today with the speaker of the Upper House of the Russian  Federation in Moscow."    Krajisnik said it is the U.S. Administration's mistake to  assume that the Serbs will bow to pressure and do something  against the Serbian people's interests. He noted over the phone  that the Serbs have offered maximum concessions to the Muslims  -- 33.3 percent of territory -- in order to secure peace among  all three national communities in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "However, the Serbs will not accept a solution that would be  considerably detrimental to the Serbian people's strategic  interests. This is why we regard this agreement in Washington as  some sort of action against the Serbian people. It is  incomprehensible that such an agreement is being drawn up which  isolates the Serbs, and which intends to create an artificial  and unfeasible entity."    Krajisnik warned that the division of the Serbian part of  the  territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be dangerous: "Our  messages are: Don't count your chickens before they are hatched,  and that there can be no peace if one tries to exclude Serbs  from the agreement."    The president of the Srpska republic assembly said that, had  the organizers of the Washington meeting been in favor of an  agreement with the Serbs, they would have invited them to attend  the conference and tackled the problem together.    "It is inconceivable that anyone should conclude an  agreement  between Croats and Muslims and then impose this stand on the  Serbs," he said.    Krajisnik said that the Serbs cannot be forced to have  one-third of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory because  they own 64 percent of the territory.    "A just solution and peace cannot be achieved by means of  pressure, blackmail, and ultimatums. Such a practice can only  prolong the war," said Krajisnik in conclusion.</p>

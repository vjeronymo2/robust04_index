			<p>BFN     [Text] A POSFACTUM correspondent has been told by competent  sources that the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry [MVD] and the  counterintelligence service are buying foreign weapons and  ammunition at the instruction of Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin. On the list are pistols, automatic weapons, and  revolvers manufactured by famous Western firms. Tens of  thousands of units of ammunition have been bought for each type  of weapon. It seems that the authorities are set to undertake  an uncompromising fight against bandits. But what form it is to  take now can only be guessed at.</p>

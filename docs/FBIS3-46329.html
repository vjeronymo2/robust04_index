"We also hope that cooperation between Europe and Asia will  be further strengthened," said Qiao when meeting with Austrian  Foreign Minister Alois Mock.    Qiao said that it is imperative to use peaceful means to  solve state-to-state differences and conflicts.    He hoped that the United Nations would play more important  role under the present turbulent and dramatic changes in the  world.    During the meeting, Qiao briefed Mock on China's foreign  policy.    He said that China, as one of the permanent members of the  U.N. Security Council, will do its best to do everything  beneficial to the world peace and stability.    "China desires to enhance its friendly ties and cooperation  with countries all over the world," he added.    On Sino-Austrian ties, Qiao said: "We are satisfied with the  growth of bilateral ties, hoping that such relationship will be  continuously enhanced on the existing basis."    Qiao invited Mock to visit China later so as to directly  acquaint himself with the country's changes.    Mock extended his warm welcome to Qiao who arrived in  Austria  Wednesday [26 January] on an official goodwill visit.    He also gave a brief account of Austria's foreign policy.

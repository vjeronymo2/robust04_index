			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Fresh progress at Barbour Index Despite continuing difficult conditions in the construction industry, Barbour Index, the specialist information supplier, reported growth in annual turnover, profits and earnings. Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to April 30 amounted to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.42m), from turnover of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 10.9m). The problems of the construction industry - the company's main market - meant that microfile services to architects and planners were particularly hard hit, although this had been more than offset by new services launched for civil and structural engineers. The relatively new health and safety microfiles showed substantial income and profit growth with a renewal rate exceeding 90 per cent. Three new services are due to be launched this year. A proposed final dividend of 4.85p brings the total to 7.25p (6.6p), covered twice by earnings of 14.8p (13.8p) per share.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Lamont launches vigorous defence of policy record: Chancellor regrets hardships inflicted by recession as he fights to retain his post MR Norman Lamont last night launched a last-ditch and probably futile effort to remain chancellor by offering a vigorous defence of his record alongside a candid expression of regret for the hardships inflicted on the electorate. But as he issued what amounted to a public plea for prime ministerial clemency at the Scottish Conservative Conference in Edinburgh, senior political associates of Mr John Major were insisting the prime minister would move Mr Lamont in a summer cabinet reshuffle. With some of the most senior figures in the Conservative party adamant that Mr Major must move quickly to reshape his team, one suggested there was a small chance Mr Lamont could be moved during the Whitsun parliamentary recess at the end of this month. The most likely dates, however, remain July or September. At one point in his speech, Mr Lamont appeared to acknowledge the gravity of the threat when he commented: 'My job is unimportant - your jobs are what count. We have beaten inflation, let's go on and beat unemployment.' In a generally combative performance, that brought only respectful applause from an audience that had earlier attacked the imposition in the Budget of value added tax on fuel, Mr Lamont insisted there had been no alternative to the harsh anti-inflation policies of the past two years. Declaring that 'the British recession is over', he said he had never claimed credit for the resumption of economic growth. But he had laid the foundations for growth by getting inflation down to its lowest level for 25 years and interest rates to below the level of any other European Community state. Defending the tax increases in his March Budget, he said that reducing the government's borrowing requirement was essential to ensure the recovery was sustained. He added: 'I accept my responsibility for everything that has happened over the last two years. The government should be judged on its record, and I rather hope I shall be judged on mine.' Mr Lamont said he expected criticism. The chancellor inevitably was in 'the firing line' when people were losing their houses or businesses as a result of recession. But he then launched a searing attack on the media for taking out of context his remark - Je ne regrette rien - during the Newbury by-election campaign. Describing it as a light-hearted response to a light-hearted question, he said the media had been determined to misrepresent him. Mr Lamont added: 'I do have regrets. I regret that inflation got out of control at the end of the 1980s. I regret the hardship that getting down inflation has caused. But I do not regret taking the tough but necessary decisions that getting inflation down has caused.' Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said Mr Lamont's 'gesture of regret' would have been welcome if accompanied by a change of policy - but there was no change. The chancellor concluded by saying the government had to keep its nerve 'when all our enemies want and expect us to lose it'. That meant 'sticking together when they want us to fall apart'. But the polite reaction of Tory party activists did nothing to dispel the question mark over Mr Lamont's political future. Page 11 Scottish Tories in upbeat mood Economic Viewpoint, Page 20</p>

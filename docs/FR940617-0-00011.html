			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None of the parties who commented raised opposition to this proposal to change the existing regulation. A number of them supported it vigorously or proposed that it be made even stronger. The FmHA suggested the rule should provide that ``if a clear alternative exists to avoiding a proposed conversion of important farmland and the applicant for Federal assistance is unwilling to pursue such an alternative, the Federal agency cannot provide financial assistance.'' FmHA went on to argue that if the FPPA did not impose this ``affirmative duty'' on agencies to deny assistance, ``then other significant provisions of the Act become meaningless, such as (1) the ability of a governor to bring action in Federal district court to enforce the requirements of the FPPA, and (2) the requirement that each Federal agency identify and report to Congress any provisions of law, administrative rules, regulations, policies, and procedures applicable to it which prevent it from complying fully with the FPPA. What can governors enforce, what possible legislative or regulatory conflicts can exist, if the FPPA allows a Federal agency total discretion in deciding whether or not to finance an unnecessary conversion of important farmland?'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Natural Resources Defense Council, the American Land Resource Association, and the American Farmland Trust also supported the change and, like the FmHA, proposed that it contain requirements that federal assistance be withheld from nonagricultural development in cases where alternatives mitigating or avoiding prime farmland conversion are available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department, after considering the comments, believes that the proposed rule amendment is necessary to achieve the intent of Congress under the FPPA and, therefore, adopts that amendment in this rule. The amended &sect;658.3(c) allows the various federal agencies to consider the particular facts relating to their proposed assistance activities and to decide, in light of the policies of the FPPA and their own authorities, which reasonable alternative action will best achieve their mission and comply with the FPPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In similar deference to the agency discretion provided by the FPPA, the Department has determined not to accept the recommendations for a complete withholding of federal assistance to convert farmland in situations where alternatives exists to avoid or mitigate the effects of conversion. There may be, specific situations, compelling reasons of national, state, or local importance that would outweigh the protective policies of the Act. The federal agencies, in exercising the responsibility provided by the FPPA, can best analyze the facts of those situations, and their discretion to do so should not be unnecessarily constrained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that the Congress, during deliberations on proposed amendments to the FPPA as part of the Food Security Act of 1985, Public Law 99&hyph;198, considered and rejected a ban on federal assistance to convert farmland in situations where reasonable alternatives to conversion exist. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 447, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 472 (1985), reprinted in 1985 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 2398. The final rule allows the intentions of Congress, as expressed in the FPPA and in the 1985 deliberations, to be carried out. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During consideration of the comments received on the proposed rule and in interagency discussions within the Department, a misunderstanding of the scope of the analysis required by the FPPA and the regulations surfaced. This related to the extent to which federal agencies are required to identify and assess the potential for future conversion of farmland as a result of present activities and assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with other natural resource or environmental evaluations, such as the analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act, the scope of the review must be related to the scope of the activity under consideration. In complying with the requirements of section 1542 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 4203) that each federal agency review its programs, authorities, policies, and procedures and take appropriate measures to assure that they conform with the purposes of the FPPA, an agency may properly consider the broader implications that its programs and policies have toward the potential for future conversions of farmland to nonagricultural uses. However, in considering whether a specific project or assistance activity of the agency will result in the irreversible conversion of farmland, the focus will be on those direct and indirect effects of the activity that can be reasonably identified and evaluated. In a review of a specific activity which does not contain proposals for, nor necessarily lead to, future activities that may convert farmland, the potential activities may be too general or speculative to adequately identify and usefully consider. The scope of each evaluation is determined by the scope of the objectives and facts of the agency activity under consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

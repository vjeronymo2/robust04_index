			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Relevant Decrees Published, </F> Vote-Extention Decree in the Works"]    [Text] Rome, 18 Jan (ANSA) -- The 11th legislature  officially came to an end today when the presidential decree  dissolving parliament was published in the Official Gazette. At  the same time, the relevant decrees were also published which  set March 27th as the date for coming general elections and  April 15th as the date for the first meeting of the new  legislature.    Meanwhile, Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi conferred separately  here Tuesday [18 January] morning, first with the Senate  Speaker Giovanni Spadolini at Palazzo Giustiniani [residence of  Senate speaker], and then with House Speaker Giorgio Napolitano  at Montecitorio [parliament], on a decree extending voting into  a second day, March 28th, so that Orthodox Jews could cast their  ballots once the sun went down on their Passover holiday during  which time they cannot participate in other than religious  activity.    Coming out of the meeting, Spadolini said he had the  impression that once the consensus was assured of the various  parliamentary caucuses, the decree could be launched this very  day. Spadolini said he would be contacting caucus leaders by  telephone, noting that complete unanimity was not required.    In reply to a journalist's question, Spadolini noted that  customarily the government did not present electoral decrees  once parliament was dissolved and elections were called but that  this exceptional procedure was resorted to, given the  exceptional circumstances, although there was no constitutional  veto on such a move.    A similar assessment was made by Napolitano who also  proceeded to sound out causcus leaders in the Lower House.</p>

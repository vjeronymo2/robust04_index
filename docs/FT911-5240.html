			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Code tells directors to act as watchdogs NON-EXECUTIVE directors are to be expected to monitor the activities of executive directors and, should they consider their performance to be unsatisfactory, report directly to shareholders. This role of non-executive directors as the guardians of shareholders' interests will be set out on Thursday when the Institutional Shareholders Committee publishes its long-awaited code of practice for directors. It is expected that the code will also spell out the way in which non-executive directors will be accountable to shareholders. The debate over the responsibility of institutional shareholders towards the companies in which they invest has been spurred by cases of corporate irresponsibility during the past decade. The Bank of England, in particular, has urged institutions to take a more active role in the companies they invest in - especially when things go wrong or companies act unreasonably - and not just walk away by selling the shares. The ISC, composed of investment managers representing pension funds, life and general insurance companies, unit trusts and investment trusts, has reacted to this pressure by drawing up a code of good practice on how companies should be controlled. The code is expected to state that companies should appoint an adequate number of non-executive directors, who should be independent of their executive colleagues. The non-executives should set the renumeration of executives and, if necessary, should report to shareholders if the executives are unsatisfactory. The code is also expected to state that the activities of non-executive directors will be subject to the scrutiny of shareholders, who will be able to remove them if they fail to exercise their responsibilities. It is not known whether the ISC will be prepared to seek amendments to company law if companies ignore the best practice set out in the code. Professor Sir James Ball, chairman of Legal &amp; General Group, said at this year's investment conference of the National Association of Pension Funds that voluntary action to persuade companies to appoint non-executive directors had failed and he could see no alternative to legislation. To complement the directors' code, later this year the ISC will publish its code of good practice for institutional shareholders.</p>

Bulgaria and Macedonia became Thursday the latest in a host  of former communist states pressing to join the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation, which is due to hold a two-day summit  starting January 10 when the enlargement issue will be raised.    NATO heads of state and government are expected to endorse a  plan to step up cooperation with the states of East Europe at  their annual summit without granting them membership in the  alliance.    Among those knocking on NATO's door are Hungary, Poland, the  Czech Republic, Romania and the Baltic states of Lithuania,  Latvia and Estonia.    Russia, which fears being "locked out" of Europe, and its  military leadership oppose their former Warsaw Pact allies  joining NATO in the near future, and Western leaders are anxious  to avoid fanning nationalist passions in Russia's newly-elected  hung parliament. [passage omitted]    Bulgarian President Zhelio Zhelev said Thursday he had  informed Russian leader Boris Yeltsin that Sofia wanted to join  NATO in the wake of Zhirinovsky's visit. [passage omitted]    Kiro Gligorov, president of the former Yugoslav republic of  Macedonia, told parliament Thursday his country would ask to  join the Western defence alliance, saying "it is very important  for the security of the region that we join the NATO council,  and NATO itself, as soon as possible."

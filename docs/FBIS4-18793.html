			<p>BFN     [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis  described Albanian Government claims regarding a Greek  provocation on the Greek-Albanian border as unfounded.  Yesterday, six masked men attacked a guardpost, killed two  Albanian soldiers, and wounded another three.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos rejected the  Albanian charges and stressed that Greece detests and condemns  every act of violence and is not willing to put up with any  provocation or any attempt to associate the Greek Government  with such acts.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Ashdown warns on EU reforms Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday warned the European Union that the next round of institutional reforms will fail unless national parliaments are involved in negotiations. Mr Ashdown told the European Movement in Brussels that the Commons 'will not put up with another Maastricht in terms of being asked to ratify something that appears to be a fait accompli'. He said the next inter-governmental conference on EU constitutional reform, due in 1996, should include both the European parliament and the parliaments of member states. He also called for the addition of employment trends to the economic convergence criteria for European monetary union, from which Britain has been granted an opt-out. He said this would mean that 'before the EU could deliver a common currency  -something which its people suspect - it would first have to deliver something they welcome - jobs'. Mr Ashdown's comments reflect the cautious approach being adopted by the Liberal Democrats in the run-up to the European parliament elections on June 9, when the party expects to win seats for the first time. Liberal Democrat leaders have played down the party's long-standing commitment to European integration since last year's tortuous parliamentary debate on the Maastricht treaty, when the party helped the government to secure ratification. However, Mr Ashdown attacked the government's 'negative' opposition to EU proposals to change the union's qualified majority voting system after the accession of Austria and three Scandinavian countries. Accusing the government of 'playing the nationalist card,' he said it was in Britain's interests to have a workable qualified majority voting system to promote agricultural reform, rather than allowing 'stubborn minorities' to defend vested interests. 'Maintaining the unity of the Conservative party by appeasing the nihilists on the right is not a vital national interest,' he said.</p>

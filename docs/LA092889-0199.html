			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RALLY FOILED; DOLLAR CONTINUES TO TAKE IT ON THE CHIN  </P> <P> Central banks sold dollars for a third straight day Wednesday, pushing the  currency lower after an agreement last weekend that it had risen too much in  recent months.  </P> <P> The losses left the dollar 4% lower against the West German mark and Japanese  yen than it was late last week, back to its levels of late July and early  August.  </P> <P> The central banks squashed a rally attempt at mid-morning in New York. Still,  the slight rebound in the dollar signaled to some traders that the official  bankers had won the battle against the $300-billion-a-day currency market, but  not yet the war.  </P> <P> "Do they want it to get off the mat or do they want to kick it while it's down?  Assuming they're playing a serious game, I think you'd go for the kidneys now  rather than later," said Charles Taylor, an international economist at  Prudential-Bache Securities in Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Sales  </P> <P> A strong dollar tends to swell the U.S. trade deficit by making imports cheap  and pushing up the price of American goods in foreign markets. At a meeting in  Washington, finance leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations agreed  Saturday that the dollar's rise was "inconsistent with longer run economic  fundamentals."  </P> <P> Traders said the frequency of sales rather than their size was pushing down the  dollar.  </P> <P> The dollar fell against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar, which  often moves in tandem with the U.S. dollar, and the British pound, which was  weighed down by a worse-than-expected trade deficit report.  </P> <P> In London, the British pound fell to $1.6155 from $1.6215 late Tuesday. In New  York, the pound fell to $1.6167 from $1.6190.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.45 Japanese yen to a closing 141.35 yen. Later, in  London, it dropped further to 139.45 yen. It was quoted at 140.32 yen in late  New York trading, down from 142.35 late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to late Tuesday's rates,  included: 1.8805 West German marks, down from 1.8918; 1.6305 Swiss francs, down  from 1.6415; 1.1771 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1756; 6.3655 French francs,  down from 6.4110, and 1,361.7 Italian lire, down from 1,366.9.  </P> <P> Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Tuesday's rates, included:  1.8830 West German marks, down from 1.8885; 1.6305 Swiss francs, down from  1.6390; 6.3485 French francs, down from 6.3990; 2.1215 Dutch guilders, down  from 2.1480; 1,359.50 Italian lire, down from 1,377.00, and 1.1770 Canadian  dollars, up from 1.1750.  </P> <P> Gold bullion edged higher in active European trading. In London, the metal rose  to a late bid of $368 an ounce from $367.75 bid late Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Silver Falls  </P> <P> In Zurich, Switzerland, gold also rose to a late bid of $368 from $367.75 bid  late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.09 to close at a bid of $369.92.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell  to $367.60 from $368.50. Later, Republic National Bank of New York said gold  was bid at $366.20, down from $367.30 late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.28 an ounce, down from $5.31  bid late Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell  to $5.245 from $5.263 on Tuesday.  </P></p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Pressure grows on unions to ballot for Labour leader PRESSURE intensified yesterday on Labour-affiliated trade unions to ballot members before voting in the party's leadership contest, as the two main contenders clashed over tax policy. Amid signs that Labour's links with the unions could be changed irrevocably by the contest, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment spokesman, who is standing for the party leadership, said the winner's credibility could be undermined if he was 'not seen to be legitimately elected'. Senior Labour figures are privately dismayed by the high profile of the unions in the contest and by some union leaders' dismissive attitude to ballots on the leadership issue. Unions hold 40 per cent of the vote in Labour's electoral college. The GMB general union is the only large union to have said it will hold a workplace ballot but it may be joined by the TGWU general union. The executive of the AEU engineering union said it will not hold a ballot, citing time problems and cost. It may be forced to change its position at the union's national conference next week. In spite of the relish which some union leaders are bringing to their old power broking role in the Labour party, most agree that the links must be loosened. Yesterday, Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB, said the unions should have no votes in the electoral college and the block vote at Labour's conference should be radically cut. Lobbying for support at the Scottish Trades Union Congress meeting in Perth, Mr Gould said: 'The constitutional link cannot be broken but must be democratised.' He backed a role for unions on Labour's national executive committee and on the new policy-making forum. Unions seem set to scale down their financial contributions to the Labour party before any decision about scaling down their political involvement. Adding to the tension over the contest, Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor and favourite to win the leadership on July 18, launched a counter attack on Mr Gould's criticism of Labour's redistributive tax policy. Speaking on behalf of Mr Smith, Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, said those who questioned Labour's tax plans, as set out during the election, should state the spending pledges they would drop. Mr Gould, whose aides accused Mr Smith of becoming over defensive, retaliated with further attacks on the shadow chancellor's Budget proposals. Mr Gould denied opposing a redistributive tax system but said on BBC Radio, 'that begs the question of whether the precise package was as cleverly put together as it might have been'. Labour's plans to abolish the ceiling on National Insurance contributions and increase higher tax rates were 'seen to be putting a cap on people's aspirations'. Mr John Prescott, a candidate for deputy leader, attacked the clashes. He said potential leaders had no right to set party policy. A further sign of the disquiet within Labour ranks came in an attack on the parliamentary party by Mr Barry Sheerman, home affairs spokesman. He accused it of a 'dreadful inertia' and of failing to push for reform of either the party or Parliament. Labour faces a snub from workers, Page 8</p>

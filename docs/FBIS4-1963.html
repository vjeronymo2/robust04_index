			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Chinese authorities released a pro-democracy  activist, Zhai Weimin, from detention in western Henan province  last Tuesday [29 March], but are not allowing him to return to  Beijing. Instead, Zhai's normal political rights, which were to  have been restored on September 13, a year after his release  from prison, have been suspended for a further 94 days and he  has been told by public security officers that he will not be  allowed to leave the province until the end of the year, sources  said yesterday.    Zhai is staying with his parents in Xinan county, about  three  kilometres from the Yeshugou jail where he was detained after  being sent back to the province in a special train carriage  under police' escort on March 7. Zhai plans to sue the  provincial public security bureau over the 21-day detention,  which he was told was due to his participation in unspecified  "illegal activities".    Zhai, who completed a three-and-a-half year sentence for  "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement" last  September, was picked up by Beijing police in the city's  university area on March 6. While in Yeshugou prison, Zhai was  fed only steamed bread and corn meal. He emerged from the  three-week detention pale and thin, his family said. "He is  irritable and has a bad temper because he says the authorities  had no justification to lock him up like that," one source said.    Zhai has asked local officials to arrange a job for him in a  nearby high-technology economic zone so he does not become bored  at home. Zhai, 23, was number six on the "list of most-wanted  students" after the 1989 Tiananmen Square movement.</p>

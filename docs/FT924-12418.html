			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Malaysian Smaller liquidation The board of Malaysian Smaller Companies, a closed-end investment company, is proposing liquidation of the company, writes Philip Coggan. The move comes in the wake of an alternative liquidation proposal by Buchanan Partners, a London-based investment firm. Two separate extraordinary meetings will be held on December 14 to consider the proposals. The board says that a possible takeover offer by Credit Lyonnais International Asset Management had been withdrawn in the wake of the Buchanan proposal.</p>

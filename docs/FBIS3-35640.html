With regard (?of) the following he stressed: The  last proposal of the Russian Federation does not contradict with  the program of the European Council regarding the regulation of  the Karabakh conflict. This is an attempt to find means that can  really function.    This press conference was devoted to the results of the  visit  of the minister to France, Yugoslavia, and Russia. As to the  position of Iran, the minister said that they are greatly  worried by the fact that military actions take place (?there in  their territory as well. The government has long activated its  role in the solving of the problem.)    It is possible that ambassador of special assignment of the  Russian Federation Kazimirov will visit Karabakh. During his  press conference Minister of Foreign Affairs of Karabakh,  Arkadiy Gukasyan, said that Kazimirov should visit Baku and  Yerevan, as well (?intending) to discuss other ways out of the  Karabakh problem. According to the last proposal of Russia, it  is expected that Russian detachments will be stationed in the  occupied region. The Azeri side confirmed [word indistinct]  this idea which has been already discussed in Moscow with the  participation of all the sides. In all probability the visit of  Kazimirov is connected with the working out of the last variant  of the proposal.</p>

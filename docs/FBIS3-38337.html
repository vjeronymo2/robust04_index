Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have already been  removed from the COCOM lists.    While featuring in the COCOM lists, Poland cannot buy the  world's most advanced commodities and technologies that may be  used for civilian and military purposes.    COCOM demanded from the countries concerned to introduce  legal regulations allowing for a strict control exports of  strategically important goods and technologies to third  countries.    Poland has launched related legislative procedures but  failed  to introduce them in time as required by COCOM as a condition to  abolish the restrictions.    While in Paris the Polish delegation presented the system of  controls created in Poland and actions envisaged to guarantee  their efficiency. The system of controls is supervised by the  Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations and a special department  of turnover with goods and technologies of strategic importance.  Its main aim is to control the possible exports of these goods  to third countries.    A French mission has been invited to Poland to convince the  COCOM authorities about the efficiency of the system. So far  over a dozen American, German and British missions have visited  Poland.    According to the Polish commercial counsellor in Paris, it  is  possible that Poland will disappear from the COCOM lists before  March 31, which is the deadline for the COCOM existence in its  present form.</p>

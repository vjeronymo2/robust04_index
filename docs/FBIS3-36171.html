President Tired of Standstill"]    [Text] The peaceful or, at any rate, tacitly indifferent  coexistence of Boris Yeltsin's administration and the newly  elected chambers of Russia's Federal Assembly must have appeared  to the republic's president unconscionably drawn-out as early as  five weeks after the day of the December elections. Having  signed on 24 January his Appeal to Members of the Federation  Council and Deputies of the State Duma, he seems to be  demonstrating a firm intention to end the situation of mutual  neutrality and noninterference that he finds unusual and clearly  unpleasant.    The document that is being circulated on an ever wider scale  on Bolshaya Dmitrovka and Krasnopresnenskaya Naberezhnaya  [respectively, seats of the Federation Council and the Duma]  these days speaks in form only about a purely procedural  problem: the president reminds the deputies that in setting the  50-percent quorum necessary for the chambers to approve their  temporary rules of procedure, they proceeded from the number of  seats that were actually distributed in the 12 December  elections -- six seats in the Duma and seven in the Federation  Council, while they did not consider at all the seats remaining  vacant. Such a violation gives Boris Yeltsin occasion to  express "extreme anxiety" over the fact that, already in the  first days of their work, parliamentarians "violated the most  important provisions of the Constitution," and that "real  prerequisites have been created for the making, in the future by  either of the chambers, decisions not only on rules of procedure  but also on federal laws and other decisions" contrary to the  requirements of the Fundamental Law. "The Russian Federation  Constitution does not provide for the presence of chambers of  the Federal Assembly consisting of 171 and 444 deputies, hence  the decisions of such chambers cannot be recognized as  constitutional," the president remarks in an easily  distinguishable metallic voice.    In the meantime, the method for determining the quorum  causes  extremely tense debates already in the first hours that the Duma  and the Federation Council were in session. Going back to what  seems to be a closed-door session threatens them with a  tremendous scandal. Accepting the president's claims would  amount in the case of the State Duma, in particular, no more and  no less than cancellation of the results of the voting for its  chairman: Ivan Rybkin won the race for the position of speaker  by one single vote, gathering a false quorum, as Yeltsin sees it.    One should hardly see in the president's demarche the desire  to dismiss the agro-communist, who so far is acting quite  modestly and circumspectly. Mr. Yeltsin must have set a much  bigger task: to remind the deputies that they all still walk  under the president, as well as to demonstrate that this  president sits up high and sees far afield.    As a matter of fact, the standoff indicated by the Kremlin's  resolute action will inevitably call for an arbiter. In the  given case, it may only happen to be the Russian Federation  Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court now proves to  have regained its ambitious hopes and wishes just in time. A  worthy cause is all that was lacking to go back to the line of  fire. Well, here it is.</p>

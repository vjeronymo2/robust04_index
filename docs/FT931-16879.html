			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Don't bank on a brave new world for investors BENEFITS of the single European market for the personal investor remain elusive. In theory, he or she should be able to get a bank account, mortgage, insurance policy or equity investment from the best company anywhere from Athens to Zaragosa. In practice, there is little point in, say, a British depositor seeking a bank account from Credit Agricole, unless he is a regular visitor to France. Most depositors are attracted by the convenience of domestic branch networks; it would be too expensive for a foreign bank to build its own. Similarly, when the Third Life Directive takes effect in July 1994, consumers should be able to buy life insurance from the cheapest source available in the Community. But the chances of many people shopping round the continent are practically nil. This disappointing prospect stems partly from investors' innate conservatism. Many are used to buying financial products such as insurance or equity funds via their local bank; they have built-in resistance to buying products from an unfamiliar name. Indeed, most people who sell financial products are tied to a particular company, and so are unable and unwilling to offer investors a European-wide choice. Different tax regimes also make it difficult for companies to devise products to appeal to all European investors. There is some pan-European selling; for example, to the growing expatriate community, or to those buying holiday homes in other member states. But it remains a niche market. The Undertaking on Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (Ucits) directive allows collective funds which had been authorised in one state to be marketable throughout the Community. Some companies have set up Ucits using Luxembourg and Dublin as a base and have modest success in attracting investors. But there is little tax incentive for, say, a UK investor to prefer Ucits to UK-based unit trusts and incidents like the Barlow Clowes scandal have made many shy away from an 'offshore' label. Life insurance companies can set up branches in other countries post-July 1994. But it will not be a truly competitive market; consumers will not be able to use a financial adviser or broker in their own country to buy insurance from a company in another member state. Brokers and advisers will not have an agreed pan-European regulatory system until 1996.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Sale of Latin American art disappoints LATIN American art has suddenly gone off the boil. After three years of rapidly increasing prices, the auctions in New York this week were disappointing. On Tuesday, Sotheby's raised Dollars 4.5m (Pounds 2.9m) from 79 lots but the auction was only 52 per cent sold by value. There was one significant record, for a colonial painting. It depicts the Christmas Eve festivities in Mexico City in 1720 and is signed Arellano. It had been discovered recently in a house in England and more than doubled its estimate, selling for Dollars 497,500. A painting depicting cafe society in Bogota, 'Cuatro Mujeres' by the Colombian artist Fernando Botero, was at the bottom of its estimate, realising Dollars 717,500. Sotheby's had more luck with its New York sale of the Alexander S. Honig collection of African art. It totalled Dollars 646,715 and was 92 per cent sold. A Fang male reliquary from Gabon fetched Dollars 206,000. Christie's tribal art sale on the same day fared less well, totalling Dollars 825,212 but only 57 per cent sold. A Benin rectangular bronze plaque of about the year 1600 went below estimate for Dollars 112,500.</p>

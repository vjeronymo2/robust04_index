			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALTRANS TO SEEK RULES FOR TRUCKS ON FREEWAYS  </P> <P> California Transportation Director Robert K. Best announced Friday that he will  meet next month with top trucking and shipping industry officials to discuss  the possibility of restricting large trucks on freeways during peak rush hours.  </P> <P> Announcement of the meeting came with release of a study commissioned by the  state Department of Transportation showing that while large trucks account for  only 2.5% to 5.5% of all traffic, they account for 20% of the delays caused by  accidents, mechanical breakdowns, spills and other problems.  </P> <P> Although the report found that large trucks cause a disproportionate share of  traffic congestion, authors of the $300,000 study did not agree with Gov.  George Deukmejian and other Administration officials that restricting  commercial truck traffic on freeways during peak hours is a potentially good  solution to the freeway congestion problem.  </P> <P> Deukmejian first raised placing restrictions on big rigs during his State of  the State address earlier this month. The governor so far has not made any  recommendations.  </P> <P> The report -- ordered by the Legislature and prepared for Caltrans by Cambridge  Systematics Inc., a private consulting firm -- assessed the causes of gridlock  and congestion on urban freeways and was called the first of its kind.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Too Many Cars  </P> <P> It concluded that passenger cars -- more precisely, too many passenger cars --  not big trucks, are the primary cause of traffic congestion.  </P> <P> The problem with trucks, the report said, was not that their number was  excessive but that their mishaps and breakdowns were more serious and took  longer to clear up. "The volume of large trucks on the freeways does not have  an inordinate impact on peak-period congestion," it said, "but truck-involved  incidents and accidents do have a significant effect."  </P> <P> If restrictions were placed on trucks during peak hours, the report said,  "Average freeway speeds would increase slightly, but a ban would not provide  significant relief from peak-hour congestion."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the study said that restrictions on trucks would increase  average freeway speeds during peak periods from 40 m.p.h. to 42 m.p.h.  </P> <P> However, the report said business would have to pay a huge economic cost if  night and off-peak-hour deliveries were required.  </P> <P> The report said that restrictions on big trucks would affect 17,000 businesses  in Los Angeles at an estimated annual cost of $1.5 billion. In San Francisco,  8,000 businesses would be affected at a cost of $710 million a year, according  to the study.  </P> <P> The study defined big trucks as those with at least three axles and weighing  26,000 pounds or more. Included in the classification were those that pull  trailers, 18-wheelers, concrete mixers, garbage haulers, beverage and fuel  trucks. Vans, light delivery trucks, pickups and mail vehicles were not  considered large trucks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Courts' Role  </P> <P> The report, noting that the federal government has broader regulatory authority  over the trucking industry than the state, warned that courts "have  consistently struck down state laws that have attempted to impose truck bans  based on general concerns about congestion and safety."  </P> <P> As a first step toward solving the problem of truck-caused congestion, the  report recommended that the state expand and improve its traffic management  programs in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. It called for the state  to strengthen its efforts to prevent accidents and equipment breakdowns through  its licensing, equipment maintenance and safety inspection programs.  </P> <P> Best said he will meet with trucking industry officials Feb. 16.  </P> <P> "We want to know to what degree shippers and receivers dependent on truck  deliveries can realistically be expected to shift receiving and shipping times  to non-peak travel hours," he said.  </P></p>

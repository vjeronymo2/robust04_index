			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers as Hong Kong gains 3.3% A FALL in the yen against the dollar following Japanese and US talks over the weekend soothed market worries about last week's volatility in the currency markets, and the Nikkei average regained the 17,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei rose 266.48 to end at the day's high of 17,117.99 on active buying by public funds and index-linked purchases by investment trusts, having fallen to a low of 16,920.04 in the morning on selling by arbitrageurs. Volume declined to 190m shares from Friday's 281m, which was supported by trading linked to stock option settlements. Advances outscored declines by 595 to 334, with 173 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 11.81 at 1,300.76, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.24 to 1,047.17. Currency markets stabilised after Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister, announced that Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, had not called for higher yen rates to cut Japan's trade surplus, during their meeting over the weekend. The dollar gained Y0.70 against the yen to finish at Y121.15. Traders said buying by public fund managers convinced short sellers of firm support around the 17,000 Nikkei line. 'Fears of a near-term market crash have receded on active buying by public funds,' commented Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. High-technology exporters, sold off last week on concern about the higher yen, rebounded. Fujitsu moved forward Y15 to Y540 and Sony rose Y50 to Y4,110. Hitachi, however, remained unchanged at Y695, held back by foreign investor selling. Overseas selling depressed Toyota Motor, Y20 down at Y1,380. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y4 to Y297 on buying by public funds. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y8 at Y509. Banks saw heavy volume as investors sold and bought back holdings to realise profits: Shizuoka Bank appreciated Y40 to Y1,340 but Asahi Bank was flat at Y900. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 36.87 ahead at 18,410.02 in volume of 95.3m shares. Roundup THE REGION'S winners were more vigorous than its losers yesterday. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index topped 6,000 for the first time since November, adding 191.29, or 3.3 per cent, at 6,049.44. Turnover totalled HKDollars 3.52bn (HKDollars 2bn on Friday). Overseas institutions snapped up shares on renewed hopes that Britain and China would start talking about finding a solution to the impasse over Hong Kong's political development. Reports in local newspapers said that China would not insist on Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, dropping his democratic reform package before Sino-British talks on the stalemate are held. SINGAPORE rose on balance but some blue chips shed weight on continued consolidation ahead of Friday's national budget. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 5.05 higher at 1,618.57. TAIWAN was bullish but volatile after the nomination of Lien Chan, governor of Taiwan province, as premier last week. The weighted index ended 13.31 ahead at 3,876.76, a five-month high, after an advance of more than 40 points in the early stages. Turnover surged to TDollars 44.73bn, its heaviest since last June. AUSTRALIA staged a late rally after a sharp initial retreat to leave a slightly weaker close following a string of higher company half-year profits. The All Ordinaries index was finally 7.0 off at 1,596.5. Foster's, Placer Pacific, Wesfarmers, Stanilite, Charles Davis and Rabbit Photos all reported rises in half-year profits, which brokers saw as favourable for the market. BOMBAY declined on worries that the government might not secure enough parliamentary support for its budget proposals later this month. The BSE index finished 105.28 lower at 2,640.20.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated September 17, 1992 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;782), Utah submitted to OSM, under SMCRA and the Federal regulations implementing SMCRA at 30 CFR chapter VII (the Federal regulations), a proposed amendment to the Utah program. Utah submitted the proposed amendment in response to a September 4, 1992, agreement (administrative record No. UT&hyph;778) between Utah and OSM concerning the regulation of coal mine access and haul roads (mine roads) in Utah and as required by OSM at 30 CFR 944.16 (n) and (o). The proposed amendment consists of revised definitions of the terms ``affected area,'' ``road,'' and ``public road'' at Utah Administrative Rule (Utah Admin. R.) 645&hyph;100&hyph;200. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the November 16, 1992,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 54032), and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and offered to hold a hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;800). The public comment period closed on December 16, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the close of the comment period and during its review of the proposed amendment, OSM identified certain concerns regarding whether the proposed amendment was, as required by 30 CFR 732.15(a), in accordance with SMCRA and consistent with the Federal regulations. OSM notified Utah of these concerns by letter dated January 21, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;817). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated February 16, 1993, Utah submitted to OSM additional material, including a revision to the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;824). However, OSM identified certain concerns with this revision and notified Utah of these concerns by telephone on March 4, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;825). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated March 24, 1993, Utah submitted to OSM additional revisions to the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;827). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM announced receipt of the March 24, 1993, revisions to the proposed amendment in the April 8, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 18187), and, in the same notice, reopened the public comment period on the revised proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;830). The comment period ended on April 23, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter to Utah dated May 19, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;842), OSM found that provision II.1 of the September 4, 1992, agreement was not valid. In addition, OSM qualified the applicability of provision II.2 of the same agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated June 22, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;847), Utah responded to OSM's May 19, 1993, letter and stated its interpretation of and intentions with respect to the September 4, 1992, agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated July 1, 1993 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;845), the Joint National Coal Association/American Mining Congress Committee on Surface Mining Regulations requested that OSM reopen the comment period for Utah's proposed amendment to allow additional public comment on the effect of OSM's May 19, 1993, letter on the September 4, 1992, agreement and the proposed amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM published a notice in the July 29, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 40608) reopening and extending the public comment period to allow the public the opportunity to comment on the effect that the invalid part of the September 4, 1992, agreement would have on Utah's proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;850). The extended public comment period ended on August 13, 1993. The proposed amendment, as revised on March 24, 1993, is the subject of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

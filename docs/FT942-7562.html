			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Recruitment: Empowerment in Virgin territory - Middle managers feel threatened by their new role as 'willing helpers' / Personnel directors choose psychometric testing How many management, employment and recruitment words are we expected to absorb before we throw away the dictionary of American business terms? Hardly a month goes by without another supposedly new idea embodied in a freshly coined word creeps stealthily out of the software like a tarantula out of a banana crate, arousing a mixture of terror and curiosity. The jargon has encroached steadily into the management schools, so much so that it has spawned an industry in expensive seminars held to explain what it all means. Empowerment is one such concept that received the seminar treatment last week at an Economist conference in London. It has also been subjected to scrutiny by the Harbridge Consulting Group, which has just produced a report called Empowerment: what organisations really do. Harbridge has attempted to discover what empowerment means and how it is being adopted in the UK. Most of the organisations it surveyed had reduced their employees in the last five years. In practice it found that empowerment often meant individuals being asked to perform functions traditionally undertaken by management, one reason why most middle managers questioned in the survey felt threatened by the idea. In companies where the concept had been widely adopted, says the Harbridge report, the managerial role had to change to that of a 'willing helper'. Managers not letting go was the most widely cited impediment to its implementation. One of the most important factors quoted by individuals expected to take more responsibility for decision making was a promise that their job would not be on the line if they made a mistake. Some companies, said the report, were employing empowerment without realising it. This applied to Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways, according to Nick Potts, its personnel director. He told the Economist seminar that empowerment 'typically exists naturally with youth, vigour and smallness in organisations'. The company had shunned empire-builders or specialists in its early days. Creating empires and classic organisational structures, he said, were the biggest barriers to empowerment. As the business grew the company realised that staff, by default, had been given the freedom to make decisions and influence company direction. 'We learned that people who decide and act, produce more profit than people who wait for instructions,' he said. The three youngest directors, he noted, all had arts backgrounds. Paul Griffiths, the commercial director, had a degree in music and raced motorcycles, Steve Ridgeway, marketing director, was a boating enthusiast. Potts himself used to be an opera singer. 'We realised we had a lot of artists in all positions. This, I suppose, is not surprising as creativity, flair and imagination are very important in the Virgin culture,' said Potts. He might have been over-egging his point. What he didn't say was that the board is loaded with experienced airline people and as Virgin itself admitted: 'Griffiths was taken on for his 15 years airline experience, not for his ability to play the fiddle.' The company began to look for people who had done 'interesting things' or had career breaks. It sought out emotional people and looked for risk takers on the basis that 'entrepreneurial business is one huge gamble'. Again this should have been qualified. Risk-taking attributes would not apply to flying staff, nor would they seem apparent in Nigel Primrose, the finance director, who is a chartered accountant. Potts argued that a gambling instinct was useful when trying to maximise revenue per seat on each flight. 'The gamble is when to release seats and at what price. Clearly there is no point in having the highest fares and no passengers or vice versa, a full plane where the ticket sales don't cover the costs.' Instead of expecting staff to use statistics to dictate decisions, the company preferred them to become 'immersed in the job, build up this knowledge through experience and gut feel, and then gamble on your instincts. 'We have found these people make the best revenue managers. We trust their judgements and let them make the calls.' Rather than just plugging gaps, recruitment was viewed strategically and undertaken by the best people in the company, said Potts. Spotting and assessing, even 'scavenging' for talent, he said, 'is the most important thing you can do for a business - so you should invest a considerable amount of time doing it'. Virgin is currently doing just that, recruiting about 700 staff, mostly cabin crew, as it expands its route network. So what are personnel directors doing to find the best people? The Institute of Personnel Management commissioned a Mori poll of 123 UK personnel directors to find out what recruitment methods they employed. The result shows that psychometric testing - the science of measuring abilities or personality traits - has overtaken panel interviewing as the favourite selection technique of personnel directors. When asked which ones they used, among seven types of recruitment techniques, some 105 of the directors questioned - the biggest response to any of the techniques - said they used psychometric testing. Panel interviewing, used by 99 of them, was pushed into second place above meeting the partner of the applicant, used by 34. Fourteen of the directors said they tested applicants with a problem calculated to induce stress or surprise and two of them went in for graphology, the study of handwriting. None of them used cranial assessment or astrology, the two other techniques in the questionnaire. Asked to rate the success of the methods on a scale of nought to 10, the most popular rating for both panel interviews and psychometric testing was seven, from just less than a third of respondents, although the testing just had the edge in popularity over interviews. Breaking down the responses into four sectors - industrial, financial, business and the public sector - panel interviews were rated most highly among the public sector. Employers in the public sector also placed more store than any of the others on psychometric testing for achieving successful results. This is not so surprising since testing has been long established in the public sector, particularly in the Civil Service. Of the 14 directors who used the stress/surprise technique in an interview, 10 of them gave it six, seven or eight out of 10. Industrial employers scored highest when asked to rate meeting the applicant's partner. This may surprise some who would question how much influence a wife, husband or partner should have on their other half's job prospects. The ratings for graphology were statistically useless but intriguing none the less. Both respondents who used it were directors of financial services companies. One of them reported that it was not at all successful in finding good recruits and the other gave it a rating of five. The IPM is currently formulating a policy on graphology in recruitment. While it has yet to make a formal pronouncement, the signs are that it will come down against it. Research carried out by the institute has failed to discover any evidence that it is an accurate predictor of someone's personality. This will be bad news for S G Warburg, the merchant bank, which has been using it for years.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: IS 'ROCKETEER' HIS ROCKET TO STARDOM?  </P> <P> Bill Who?  </P> <P> That was the question on a lot of minds when Bill Campbell was announced as the  star of Disney's "The Rocketeer."  </P> <P> Based on the popular comic book character who fights for justice, donning a  streamlined helmet and strapping a rocket pack to his back, it's due next  summer.  </P> <P> A former commercial art student who considered becoming a comic book artist,  Campbell, 31, came to town six years ago after working in Chicago theater.  </P> <P> He's since appeared on a spate of TV shows, including "Dynasty," playing the  boyfriend of Steven Carrington during the 1984-85 season; and a crew-cut,  gum-chewing young cop on NBC's "Crime Story."  </P> <P> "The Rocketeer" is the first feature film role for the boyish, 6-foot-4,  205-pound actor.  </P> <P> "One of the appealing things about him is that he's a regular guy," Campbell  says of the character. "He wears aviator-type clothes -- you know, boots and  leather jacket. And he's propelled through the air by something that is  technically possible.  </P> <P> "He's not so much a fantasy figure as he is an adventurer."  </P> <P> Directed by Joe Johnston ("Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"), the film is currently in  its second week of shooting near Valencia. Alan Arkin, Jennifer Connelly and  Timothy Dalton co-star.  </P> <P> Campbell spoke to us between takes, "beating up bad guys -- you know,  delivering knuckle sandwiches." But he doesn't plan on doing his own "flying."  </P> <P> "Since the Rocketeer wears a helmet, I think there's going to be a stunt man. I  have no desire to hang from wires."  </P> <P> A sequel to "The Rocketeer" is a possibility, but Campbell isn't worried about  being typecast at this point. "I'm just happy to be working in a movie," he  says. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

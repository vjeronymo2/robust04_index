			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 'STILL IGNORANT' ON IRAN-CONTRA, REAGAN INSISTS  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan acknowledges that the Iran-Contra affair hurt  his effectiveness in the last two years of his term, but he defends his actions  in his new memoir.  </P> <P> Reagan also says he is "still ignorant" about all the facts in the scheme in  which weapons were sold to Iran and the profits diverted to the Nicaraguan  Contra rebels.  </P> <P> In his book, "An American Life," Reagan said that if he could relive the past,  he would bring former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter and his  then-aide, Oliver L. North, to the Oval Office to explain the Iran-Contra  affair to him.  </P> <P> Excerpts of the book, made available Sunday, appear in this week's issue of  Time magazine.  </P> <P> " 'OK John and Ollie, level with me,' " Reagan wrote about what he would say. "  'Tell me what really happened and what it is that you have been hiding from me.  Tell me everything.'  </P> <P> "If I had done that, at least I wouldn't be sitting here, writing this book,  still ignorant of some of the things that went on during the Iran-Contra  affair," he wrote. Poindexter and North were most involved in the diversion.  </P> <P> Reagan insisted that the sale of weapons to Iran was not intended to swap arms  for American hostages held in Lebanon. "But I know it may not look that way to  some people," he said.  </P> <P> Reagan said he was hurt by the scandal, the most serious of his eight-year  Administration.  </P> <P> "The cloud that descended over my credibility during Iran-Contra undoubtedly  affected my last two years in office," he said.  </P> <P> Reagan said his greatest regret as President was sending Marines to Lebanon,  where a suicide bomber attacked the Marine barracks in Beirut on Oct. 23, 1983,  killing 241 servicemen.  </P> <P> Reagan said he had believed that it was a good idea to deploy Marines in  war-torn Lebanon as peacekeepers. But he said American officials did not  realize how vulnerable the servicemen were in the barracks on a wide-open  space.  </P> <P> "In any case, sending the Marines to Beirut was the source of my greatest  regret and greatest sorrow," Reagan wrote.  </P></p>

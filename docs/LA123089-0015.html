			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING PAGE GETS MIXED REVIEWS  </P> <P> "Betting With Poor Bob?"  </P> <P> Or, maybe "Betting Poor With Bob" might be a more appropriate title now that he  has failed (miserably) to help the poor readers/bettors.  </P> <P> Bob's results show that it is not only difficult to win at betting horses, but  also that his manner of betting leaves something to be desired.  </P> <P> He was constantly going out on a limb, so to speak, with triples and parlays. A  more conservative method might be a better approach.  </P> <P> First, I think he should be wagering real cash, either his own or the paper's  money. And second, he should not be required to bet every day. Only when he  wants to. The "profits" could go to the "homeless," poor Bob, or some other  charity at the end of the season.  </P> <P> HENRY BITMAN  </P> <P> Covina  </P></p>

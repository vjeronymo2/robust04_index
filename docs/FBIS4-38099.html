			<p>BFN     [Text] In his sermons today, Ayatollah Emami-Kashani, the  acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran, set out to analyze the  characteristics of the hypocritical elements responsible for the  bomb blast in the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon him.    He said: This savage act was in fact a declaration of war  against Islam, and those who have no respect whatsoever for the  status of the family of the prophet undoubtedly adhere to no  doctrine or school of thought.    The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran added: The  perpetrators of such acts should know that such crimes will lead  to nothing but the further consolidation of the revolution's  foundations. Moreover, such acts draw the attention of Muslims  and the followers of other divine religions to the scared  notions of Islam.    Ayatollah Emami-Kashani described the terrorist actions of  the Monafeqin throughout the history of the Islamic revolution.  He then commemorated the martyrs of 7 Tir [bomb blast in  Islamic Republic Party on 28 June 1981], of Mashhad'a 'Ashura  [bomb blast on 20 June 1994], and the other martyrs of the  revolution. He said: The recent act by the Monafeqin was  condemned in many countries. However, mere condemnation of these  savage acts, by Islamic communities and Shiite and Sunni  scholars is not enough, and the Islamic world has a duty to  react against such crimes.</p>

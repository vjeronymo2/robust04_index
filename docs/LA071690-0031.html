			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> BAN ON DRINKING IN PARKS TO BE WEIGHED  </P> <P> The Ventura City Council will consider tonight whether to ban drinking in three  downtown parks.  </P> <P> The request to ban alcohol use in the Downtown Mini-Park, Valdez Alley and  Eastwood Park came last week from the Ventura Parks and Recreation Commission,  said Bill Byrets, recreation superintendent for the city.  </P> <P> "We've had a number of complaints from tourists, downtown businesses and  residents who say they are tired of being assaulted by a bunch of drunks,"  Byrets said. "It's reached a point where people are reluctant to come downtown  because of a small group of transients that basically hang around and drink all  day."  </P> <P> Posting no-drinking signs in the three parks would allow police to enforce laws  against drinking in public, Byrets said. Although police patrol the area  frequently, alcohol-related problems continue, he said.  </P> <P> Currently, a drinking ban is enforced at only two of the city's 23 parks,  Byrets said. Alcohol is banned at Surfers Point and after sunset at Grant Park.  </P> <P> Valdez Alley, which connects Main Street with Cedar Street, and Eastwood Park,  located at Cedar and Poli streets, pose particular problems because they are  isolated. The Downtown Mini-Park, off Main Street, is more accessible, but the  presence of drunks scares many people away from the business district, Byrets  said.  </P> <P> Groups are able to get permits to drink in those parks during special  occasions, Byrets said.

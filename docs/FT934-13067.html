BRT at present employs about 650 people but over the next few months this will rise to 2,700 as it absorbs a large number of operational telecoms staff from BR, most of whom are RMT members. BRT managers accept that they will have to review the situation after the occupational structure of the company changes but they may want to retain the single union recognition which could be attractive to potential buyers. RMT said yesterday the changes could pose a safety hazard. Signalling and telecommunications functions were often carried in the same cables and could affect each other. 'If the telecom staff are going to come from a non-railway background with no knowledge of signalling it is potentially very dangerous,' said an RMT official.

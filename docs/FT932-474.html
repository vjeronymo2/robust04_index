			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Attack deepens Baghdad mood of pessimism OUTSIDE one of the Baghdad houses flattened by stray US cruise missiles in the weekend attack on Iraq's intelligence agency, rubble was yesterday being used to fill a crater about 10 metres deep, while scraps of the culpable missile were carefully placed on a table outside for all to see. Predictably the focus for the Iraqi government and its people is the civilian damage and casualties caused in the up-market Mansour district. At least three missiles careered off target in the residential area, killing six and wounding many others. The air strike came as a surprise to most Iraqis but according to one of the few remaining western ambassadors in Baghdad, this was not the case for the Iraqi government. US reconnaissance aircraft had been observed over the capital for two days before the attack. The Iraqi regime had also expected some kind of reprisal to be linked to the alleged plot to assassinate Mr George Bush on a visit to Kuwait in April. Although the Iraqis deny any involvement in the Kuwaiti-uncovered conspiracy, they realised early on what the accusations might lead to, the ambassador said. The intelligence agency headquarters itself has been sealed off but the view from nearby suggests that at least two of the main buildings are beyond repair. One side of the central 10-storey block of offices is on the verge of collapse, the floors forming a concertina. Next door, a six-storey building has had most of its roof blown away. But a nearby newly-built telecommunications tower remains intact. Sensitivity of the site is underlined by the heavy military presence surrounding the buildings. Iraq's secret service, or Mukhabarat, is one of the most feared instruments of President Saddam Hussein's power. After demonstrations and a state funeral for the civilian dead, yesterday was calm as people got on with surviving under burdensome economic sanctions. But talk of western double standards compared to the situation in the former Yugoslavia is common. And some say that Mr Clinton is using Iraq to show that he does possess some muscle when it comes to foreign policy. But hopelessness and apathy prevail. 'The people's feelings are dead. They've suffered too much,' one Iraqi explained. Foreign diplomats go further. They say that since Mr Clinton took power they have noticed greater pessimism and despair among the Iraqis. Many had hoped in vain for an easing of sanctions. Apart from this, there is one factor which the Iraqis find more difficult to swallow than anything else: George Bush still seems to be an influential factor in the future prospects of the country. A potent, and sarcastic, symbol of this recognition can be seen at the entrance of the luxurious al-Rasheed hotel. The hotel lobby was hit by a cruise missile during a US attack on a nuclear installation in January during the last few days of Mr Bush's presidency. As part of the hotel's rehabilitation programme the Iraqis have painted on the gleaming tiles outside the front door a snarling portrait of the former US president which is trodden on daily by hundreds of Iraqis and other hotel guests. Such 'therapy', however, is unlikely to heal the increasing likelihood that Iraq will remain a pariah state for a long time to come.</p>

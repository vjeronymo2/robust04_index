			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hundreds of New York callers who thought that they could get premium credit  "gold cards" actually got nothing more than hefty phone bills by dialing a  "540" telephone number. Unsuspecting customers lured by the promise of the  credit cards dialed the number and were slapped with a $49.95 charge for the  call, said New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams. The company that ran the come-on,  International Shoppers Spree Inc., Baltimore, may be forced to dole out refunds  to as many as 450 people.  </P></p>

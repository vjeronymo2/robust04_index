			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Money for rope for man who makes ends meet - Des Pawson who has turned his passion for knots into a business HOW MANY suppliers can create business simply through the aroma of their catalogue? Des Pawson can. One valued regular customer sits in his office high above Wall Street with the Footrope Knots brochure handy enough to sniff. Instead of staples, the 16-page publication is stitched with tarred marlin. This heavy twine used in traditional ropework is treated with Stockholm tar and has a smell evocative enough to bring the square-riggers back to life. Pawson believes he is the only business in the world tying knots, teaching knots, writing about knots and selling other enthusiasts the means to pursue their hobby. From his office/warehouse/home in Ipswich emerges a steady stream of turks- heads, monkey fists, rope mats and all sorts of intricate ropework and netting. Equipment ranging from marlin spikes to The History of Knot Theory (translated from the Danish) leaves by every post. Pawson, a bearded cheery man with a matelot's patter, has also been used as an expert consultant by Surrey police pursuing a murder inquiry. Knots used to tie the victim yielded valuable clues to detectives. 'I've loved knots and been fascinated by them since I was a little boy,' explained Pawson, 46. 'But the difference between me and amateur tiers is that I've always had a financial interest. 'When I was 11 I used to buy cord and turn them into fancy woggles for other Scouts and sell them at a profit. I've always believed my skill had a value.' Rather than running away to sea, after leaving school he spent five years working in Harrods furniture department. Pawson says it taught him all his basic skills of stock management, salesmanship and cash flow. He later put this background to use in running a Pounds 1m a year business for an East Anglian office supplies company. All the while he was developing his hobby towards being a fully-fledged business which could support him and his wife Liz - two grown-up sons are at college. The first significant order was in 1968 for three dozen braided bell ropes for Captain O M Watts, the Mayfair chandler. Like many crafts-people faced with volume orders, he began using outworkers for routine tasks. 'I realised that with the ultimate niche market, I was going to have to do more than tie knots myself all day - even if I had wanted to,' Pawson said. Ten years ago he was one of the founding members of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. From an initial 20 or so members it has grown to over 600, with subscribers in every large country. Faced with an audience of this size Pawson resolved to become the leading supplier of scarce materials for the enthusiast. The large shed at the foot of his garden is a paradise for anyone who has ever loved the feel and smell of traditional rope. Coils of manilla, hemp and sisal fill the floor. Racks of shackles, fids and spikes line the benches. Pawson often has to track down materials from such arcane sources as French Navy surplus auctions. 'The problem is that I sometimes have to buy enough to last five years. The opportunity is that I'm the only person around who has got some of this stuff,' he said, while illustrating the arcane merits of differently balanced marlin spikes. Fellow knotters are encouraged to visit. Often they are 'dropping by' en route to some serious business meeting but the lure of Pawson's wondrous shed proves too much for them. His has two business tenets. He never borrows money and, from the earliest hobby days, he has made tax returns. Pawson says the first rule kept his feet on the ground and prevented things growing beyond their economic base, the second reminded him that it really was a business, however small. In the early days there was no tax to pay. Nowadays, he says, Footrope Knots is turning over slightly more than Pounds 25,000 a year, with very low overheads. For the first time, Pawson will be running a knotting summer school at Suffolk College. He also writes Rope Yarns, a regular feature in The Boatman magazine. Strong interest in the restoration of classic yachts has helped business. He is often called upon to recreate fenders and the like from sources such as Edwardian photographs. He feels the call of the sea himself and enjoys sailing a modest traditional Dutch scow. Pawson has a stand at the London Boat Show which closes tomorrow and has been demonstrating his skills. 'It's more of a promotional exercise than a retail one for me,' he said. 'But a lot of the people I meet and give cards to will become customers during the year. 'However, the knotting business is far bigger than just boats. It appeals to all kinds of people who never go near the sea. It's to do with tradition and texture.' The Boat Show at Earls Court, London, is open today and tomorrow, 10 am-7pm. The Footrope Knots catalogue is available for 68p from 501 Wherstead Rd, Ipswich, Suffolk, IP2 8LL. Tel: 0473 690090.</p>

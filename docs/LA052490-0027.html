			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VOLUNTARY WATER CONSERVATION URGED  </P> <P> As part of an effort to stem a growing water shortage in Southern California,  the Inglewood City Council Tuesday urged residents to begin voluntary  conservation measures.  </P> <P> The council passed a resolution discouraging residents from hosing off paved  areas, using decorative fountains that do not recirculate water, or watering  lawns between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. The city's resolution also said restaurants  should not serve water unless requested, and residents should wash their cars  with buckets of water or with hoses that have shut-off devices.  </P> <P> Inglewood's water use has stayed roughly constant over the past five years,  city officials said. They are hoping voluntary restrictions will cut water use  by 10% in the next year.  </P></p>

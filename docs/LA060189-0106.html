			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S. OUSTS 2 NICARAGUANS  </P> <P> Two Nicaraguan diplomats who arrived in Washington just 10 days ago were  ordered home by the State Department in retaliation for the expulsion of two  American envoys from Managua last week. The Nicaraguan Embassy was told that  Roberto Vargas and William Vigil, both minister counselors, are "no longer  acceptable," State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said, emphasizing that  there were no allegations of improper behavior. Last Thursday, Nicaragua  expelled U.S. economic attache Joel F. Cassman and a visiting U.S. labor  attache based in Honduras, Kathleen Barmon, on grounds they had interfered in  domestic affairs by urging schoolteachers to strike for higher wages.  </P></p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Management: A mesh of the formal and the flexible Boundaryless, virtual, horizontal, flat, shamrock- or starburst-shaped, clustered, concentric, circular. Managers are constantly bombarded with these images of the sort of organisation their companies must become if they are to survive the change, complexity and chaos of the late 1990s and beyond. As if one set of such epithets was not enough, executives are assured by gurus and academics that these structures will create the type of customer-facing, rapid-response, high-performance, self-managed, team-based enterprises needed to compete in the markets of the future. In an overworked but powerful phrase, they are told that this is the 'new management paradigm'. Most managers are intrigued by at least some of these images. But they are also confused or frustrated. Before taking action, some are searching for a clearer, more detailed, picture of what the 'new organisation' should look like, with its constituent sub-structures, systems and procedures. Others are already having a crack at the new approach - or elements of it. But they risk floundering because of the paucity of proven models to draw from. With the exception of several overworked examples from 'creative' industries such as media and consulting, there are few concrete cases of the approach operating comprehensively and successfully at the level of entire organisations of any size. Most well-documented instances are either of medium-sized companies with unusual backgrounds, such as Gore-Tex, or of isolated business units within giants such as US General Electric. A third group of managers, the sceptics, are steering clear of almost anything that smacks of such radical, risky - and over-American - innovation. All three groups are in danger of losing their way. Like fans - radical or conservative - of architecture, who see it as having a capital 'A', they make the mistake of being transfixed by structure and outward appearance at the expense of an organisation's intricate inner workings. They treat an organisation as an all-important big 'O', rather than as a means of enabling companies to act more effectively in the marketplace. To make matters worse, the Big O brigade mistakenly sees the 'new organisation' as mainly a matter of formal design, rather than as what Nitin Nohria and James Berkley, two Harvard academics, call pragmatic or 'action-centred' entities, whose life-blood consists of informal attitudes, relationships and ways of operating. In the latest issue of California Management Review, Nohria and Berkley argue that while the informal side of organisations has often been acknowledged in the past, the energy of most managers and management thinkers alike has been directed towards trying to develop better formal models and designs. To underline their view that the current spate of organisational change and experimentation is not a prelude to some ultimate, fixed architecture, the two academics reject the term 'new paradigm' as misleading, even dangerous. They argue that the most helpful metaphor is of a shifting 'action perspective'. This sees organisations as complex systems - better still, as organisms - where many different things are happening at once, and which are constantly in flux, often in response to low-level action. To illustrate the dangers of top-management attempts to impose new organisational designs, Nohria and Berkley cite the 'sobering' example of a group of three divisions within Allen-Bradley, itself an offshoot of Rockwell International. In 1990 the group, which makes high-tech industrial control devices, announced a flat, team-based, 'concentric' structure. Within months the old hierarchy reasserted itself: 'business teams' were formed to oversee the operational teams, and an executive council to oversee the business teams. Within a year, the use of teams was reined in severely. In 1992 much of the concentric organisation was disbanded, and a traditional multi-divisional structure re-installed. The upside of the story, the academics claim, is that the fundamental ideas behind the 1990 reorganisation are still held to be central, in spite of the reversion to a conventional formal design. This is feasible because the group persevered with the introduction of two steps essential to effective informality: IT systems that spanned its whole organisation; and broader sets of performance measures. In essence, Nohria and Berkley's message is eminently sensible: few European companies would be as rash as Allen-Bradley or some of its American cousins in converting so suddenly to such a novel structure. Any halfway sensible organisational innovator knows that informal changes have to accompany formal ones, and often precede them. That is not to say that formal changes are unnecessary. Nohria and Berkley say as much, but with far too little emphasis. As so often with management academics, they almost throw the baby out with the bathwater. If any senior manager thinks internal boundaries can be bridged without dramatic change in organisational design, he or she should examine the experience of the myriad of companies that have tried to introduce cross-functional teamwork just by laying a lightweight project structure across a collection of chimney-like vertical departments, and instigating a series of accompanying informal changes. Ford, Digital and a string of other companies are now having to rectify that mistake. The truth is that the formal and informal aspects of an organisation are equally important, and interdependent. Whether old-style or new, formal or embodying an 'action perspective', they need to be in synch.</p>

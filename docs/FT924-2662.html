			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Arts: Richard III travels south - Theatre A coachload of peasants and upstarts has arrived from Yorkshire and taken over the Riverside Studios for a production of Richard III. They wear clogs, pronounce 'you' as 'yer' and 'lover' as 'luvver'. The men are clothed in a strange collection of evening dress and garish drape jackets. The women resemble a mixture of tarts and char ladies. But do not be deceived. Off-stage, they probably speak the Queen's English and are not nearly as averse to the south as they pretend. Their Richard III is among the most pulsating you are likely to see. There are not many subtleties in it, but that may be because there are not many subtleties in Richard III. Instead there is a rattling good story briskly told. Barrie Rutter's Richard makes no plea for sympathy and no pretensions to hidden depths. He comes across as an out-and-out villain played by a northern stand-up comic who nevertheless has the capacity to charm, especially the ladies. His main trait, apart from his physical deformity, is the enthusiasm with which the villainy is pursued. At the end he is beaten to death with staves by practically the entire cast. He receives the blows without a whimper. Rutter is the director as well as the king. He is also the founder of Northern Broadsides, established in Bradford in 1990 to give more northern bite to the British theatre. Richard III was a sell-out at this year's Hull Festival. The bite is there in abundance; so, remarkably, is the pace. Here is Shakespeare with a strong dash of Fred Trueman. The clogs come into their own in the final stages when the rival armies perform a clog dance in the build-up to the battle. It is like the natives beating the tom-toms; the excitement is palpable. Riverside is an exceptionally good place for Rutter's style. The large stage is even broader than it is deep. The back is a bare brick wall. There are no southern sophistications like playing around with the lighting and there are virtually no props. Rutter adds novelties of his own. The two young princes, for example, do not look particularly young, despite their short trousers and school caps. This avoids conventional sweetness and pathos (though it does not entirely fit with the text in the description of their murder). Richard's deformity is confined to an almost permanently immobile left arm with the hand in the trouser pocket and a slightly twisted left leg. He wears a clog on his left foot and an ordinary shoe on his right. Yet when on of his nephews suddenly jumps on his shoulders for a piggy-back, there is a huge cry of pain. There has been a hint of this moments before when Richard senses that a piggy-back is what the boy wants. These are almost his only visible feelings in the play: they are the more striking for being physical rather than emotional. Why women succumb so easily and quickly to this monster who they know has killed their nearest and dearest is a question only Shakespeare could answer. Rutter does not have to try. He just gets on with the show at a cracking pace. Then, when Richard is dead, there is a silence of about two minutes in which the men slowly take off their clogs before the final lines are spoken. This is one of the surprises of this production for these Yorkshiremen are nothing if not professional; many of them are graduates of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre who have returned to their home county. It is a pleasure to have them back in London, however briefly. They run until January 9. Riverside Studios (081) 748 3354</p>

The PRDS of Mauritanian President Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed  Taya is expected to retain the majority in 160 communes while  UFD is expected to win in at least 32 communes, an official  source stated. Independent candidates have won about 20 towns,  with the rate of participation at around 60 percent. The second  round is slated for 4 February. Final results should be known  tomorrow.    PRDS, UFD, and the Union for Democracy and Progress (UDP),  the second opposition party, will be contesting the second  ballot in about 10 communes including Nouakchott, the political  capital, and Nouadhibou, the economic capital. In Nouakchott,  PRDS obtained 44.77 percent of votes as against 42 percent for  UFD. According to partial results, the two parties obtained  identical percentages in Nouadhibou. The PRDS will also be  contesting the second ballot at Nema and Aoun, two eastern towns  where it had absolute majority.    The UDP, which was legalized in 1993, has already called on  its voters to cast their votes for the UFD during the second  round in areas where it came third. The municipal elections are  being held two years after the first pluralist elections (March  1992 presidential and legislative elections) and three years  after the introduction of multiparty democracy into Mauritania.</p>

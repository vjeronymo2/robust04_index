			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Qol Yisra'el correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi; from </F> the "With the Midday Events" program -- italicized passages are  recorded]    [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal has renewed his past  regular meetings with Faysal al-Husayni following the imposition  of a security cordon on the territories and the appointment of  al-Husayni as PLO official in charge of following up the  situation in Jerusalem. Shahal's meeting with al-Husayni came  at a time of media clamor and exchanged accusations between the  government and opposition parties against the backdrop of the  letter Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres sent to his Norwegian  counterpart late Jorgen Holst. During his meeting with  al-Husayni, Minister Shahal underscored the government's  position on the current crisis.    Talking about this meeting, al-Husayni adds: He also  raised the issue of the existing relationship, the political  process, the status of Jerusalem, and all related matters.    Regarding the Palestinian viewpoint on the contents of the  letter Shim'on Peres sent on the status of the Palestinian  institutions, al-Husayni says: Yes, this is the way we  understand the letter. We believe that the subject of Jerusalem  or negotiations on the future of Jerusalem will take place in  the second phase. Until then, the status of these institutions  and the importance of Arab presence in Jerusalem should be  maintained. The letter is with the Israelis, Norwegians, and  the PLO. It was considered secret. Consequently, it is not with  us. But since it was announced, I think we can obtain it.    Orient House has in the past served as a starting point for  several activities on the peace process, including the  preparation of working papers for the Washington talks.    Orient House is a Palestinian institution. Many  activities on the political process as a whole sprang from it.  These activities are completely linked to the political  process, that is, to a comprehensive solution, God willing. As  for partial solutions like the issue of the national authority  in Gaza and Jericho first, these are partial and not  comprehensive. Consequently, Orient House remains in its place  doing the same services it used to do until we enter the final  stage and until we reach a final solution, God willing.    Regarding the meeting held at Orient House yesterday evening  in the presence of several Palestinian political and religious  figures, Faysal al-Husayni says: The situation in  Jerusalem was reviewed. The problems facing us, including the  closure of Jerusalem from the rest of the occupied Palestinian  areas and the financial problems facing some institutions, were  also reviewed. We also discussed the current crisis of these  institutions and this controversy between us and the Israelis as  well as the sensitivity of the subject and the need to address  it without creating useless side battles. I was asked to follow  up the establishment of this committee [not further identified]  in order to follow up all issues related to the Palestinian  institutions and Palestinian citizens.</p>

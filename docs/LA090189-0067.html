			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEFENSE BID TO POLL 'STALKER' JURY DENIED  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Thursday denied a defense motion seeking to  interview the Night Stalker jurors about their ability to continue deliberating  the fate of defendant Richard Ramirez in the wake of the murder of a fellow  juror more than two weeks ago.  </P> <P> To interrupt jury deliberations at this point -- on the 12th day -- "would  probably be a fatal mistake," said Judge Michael A. Tynan.  </P> <P> He added that the jurors appear to have gotten over their grief after the  slaying of Phyllis Y. Singletary. She was found shot to death in her Carson  apartment on Aug. 14, apparently the victim of a domestic quarrel with her  boyfriend, James C. Melton, who later committed suicide.  </P> <P> Tynan agreed with Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan S. Yochelson, who argued  that to interview jurors now would be tantamount to "jury tampering."  </P> <P> Still to be heard on Tuesday are arguments on another defense motion seeking to  disqualify the jury, largely on the same grounds.  </P> <P> Ramirez, 29, is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies stemming from a  series of nighttime residential burglaries throughout Los Angeles County,  mostly in the spring and summer of 1985. He was arrested four years ago  Thursday, and could face the death penalty if convicted.  </P></p>

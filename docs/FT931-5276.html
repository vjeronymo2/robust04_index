			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Buba rate cut catches bourses by surprise THE cut by the Bundesbank of the repo rate caught markets by surprise as it seemed to signal an imminent cut in the Lombard and discount rates, perhaps at the next council meeting on March 18, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT moved modestly down as some analysts forecast a period of consolid-ation for the market following recent strength. The DAX index closed 4.58 lower at 1,682.82, up 1.4 per cent on the week, as turnover rose slightly to DM6.5bn from DM6.3bn. With 'Bundesbank watching' entering a new phase as some observers try to second-guess when the Lombard and discount rates will actually be cut, other observers continue to warn that the fundamentals of the German economy remain weak and are expected to weaken throughout 1993. On this basis, they say, the present market valuation looks rather stretched and vulnerable to a downward correction. One analyst in London commented that many investors still have not fully appreciated that 1993 earnings are likely to be further downgraded, given the recent batch of disappointing economic data. This will be underlined when chemicals report next week. Mr Patrick Shields of NatWest Securities forecasts a decline in 1992 pre-tax earnings of 47 per cent for Basf, 26 per cent for Hoechst and 15 per cent for Bayer, which yesterday announced short-time working at some of its plants. The shares fell respectively DM2.60, DM2.40 and DM1.20 to DM227.00, DM254.40 and DM272.30. PARIS was firm in early trading, weakened later before sprinting to a gain in the CAC-40 index of 8.37 to 1,995.12, for a week's rise of 2.6 per cent. Turnover remained firm at FFr3.8bn. Speculation on possible stake building continued to lift volume in Suez, which saw 1.6m shares change hands as the shares gained FFr13.20 to FFr318.20. Of all the names rumoured to be interested in the group, including that of Sir James Goldsmith, only UAP, which currently has a 6.5 per cent stake, denied interest. UAP finished FFr11 stronger at FFr586. The car sector finished a dreadful week with further losses in Peugeot, down FFr18 at FFr572, Michelin, off FFr4.60 at FFr175.10 and Valeo FFr34 lower at FFr751. AMSTERDAM ended a difficult week higher, with the CBS Tendency index up 0.8 at 101.8, up 1.9 per cent on the week. There was lingering interest in companies which had reported this week with Philips and DSM both 30 cents higher at Fl 22.80 and Fl 73.50 and Polygram up 50 cents at Fl 49.40. Heineken set a new record high, up Fl 8.30 or Fl 195.80, but some analysts felt that the shares were now beginning to look expensive. MILAN marked time although the market was alive with rumours which made for an active day's trading. The Comit index eased 1.25 to 535.47 - 4.3 per cent ahead on the week. Olivetti fixed L63 or 2.6 per cent lower at L2,385 before easing to L2,365 after hours and Sip was L26 lower at L1,680 amid fears that the groups might be planning rights issues. Stet shed L35 to L2,355 before easing to L2,340 after hours on speculation that it might soon conclude the sale of a stake in its telecommunications equipment subsidiary Italtel. In the other direction, Rinascente, L480 or 5.5 per cent ahead at L9,190, was in demand, particularly by US investors in spite of Fiat's fresh denials that its sale was being negotiated. Pirelli broke through the L1,500 level, adding L50 to L1,531 in heavy volume. Stocks from the Ligresti group were caught up in speculation about possible divestments. Holding company Premafin shot up L621 or 12.8 per cent to L5,450 and were up to L5,650 after hours, while Grassetto, the construction group, rose L660 or 12.2 per cent to fix at L6,060 before continuing up to L6,175 after hours. Elsewhere, the Consob market regulatory agency suspended the shares of holding company Fimpar and its hotel group Ciga pending an announcement on the status of Ciga's financial restructuring plan. ZURICH finished easier but a strengthening dollar enabled shares to pull up from the day's lows. The SMI index dipped 4.9 to 2,134.6, a 1.6 per cent rise on the week. CS Holding fell SFr30 to SFr2,230 after its main asset, Credit Suisse, reported a 1.1 per cent rise in 1992 group net profit which was at the lower end of expectations. UBS, which last week reported a 10.4 per cent rise in net income, rose SFr2 to SFr944. BBC Brown Boveri shed SFr50 to SFr3,940. Analysts expect the Zurich-based Asea Brown Boveri, from which BBC derives virtually all its income, to announce 1992 profit at or below the previous year's level. STOCKHOLM drew strength from lower debt market yields and better than expected earnings from Sandvik. The Affarsvarlden Index rose 16.7 to 1,031.2 , a 3.1 per cent rise on the week. Sandvik's B shares rose SKr12 to SKr465 as the company unexpectedly raised its dividend and a fall in profits proved not as bad as feared.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 5                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1161.93     1160.24     1159.32     1155.96 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1224.77     1224.18     1223.92     1222.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1156.00     1160.33     1159.66     1159.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1220.27     1216.39     1223.82     1225.29  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Mar 4     Mar 3     Mar 2     Mar 1    Feb 26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1156.15   1158.99   1156.71   1158.20   1139.80 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1216.30   1221.03   1211.84   1213.57   1194.07  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1162.10; 200 - 1225.94 Low/day: 100 - 1155.52  200 - 1215.21.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

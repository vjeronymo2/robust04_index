			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Hong Kong speculates over Patten's flying visit MR Chris Patten is to make a flying visit to London on Tuesday for discussions with Mr John Major, the prime minister, on the issues he plans to raise in his first key policy address as Hong Kong's governor on October 7. Mr Patten's planned speech has generated considerable speculation in the colony, particularly on the approach he will take to the development of democracy in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997. Some officials expect him to announce changes to Hong Kong's political institutions and a widening of the scope of democracy, though perhaps without altering the pace, previously agreed with China, of direct elections to the Legislative Council. Mr Patten's visit was arranged at short notice at his request, according to Hong Kong government officials. He will arrive on Tuesday morning and leave for Hong Kong the same evening. The meeting was interpreted positively in Hong Kong as underlining Hong Kong's rising position on the agenda of the government in London. Negotiations with China on the financing of Hong Kong's new airport are expected to be another topic in the talks with Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. Mr Hurd is expected to meet Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York later this month. Uncertainty about Mr Patten's plans for democracy is widely thought to have been a factor delaying Chinese approval of the airport financing plans. However, there were signs of progress on the airport this week when China made a new proposal which the Hong Kong government said it would examine seriously. It is important for Mr Major that the airport plans proceed smoothly, because his visit to Beijing last year to sign a memorandum of understanding on the airport was the price for securing China's agreement to let the project go ahead. The airport is planned to open before British sovereignty over Hong Kong ends in 1997, but this target could be in danger if the financing plans are delayed much longer. The joint Sino-British airport committee is expected to meet again on Wednesday to discuss China's latest proposals. British government officials could make no comment yesterday on the agenda for Mr Patten's talks. Among issues in Mr Patten's policy statement, one area of possible change is expected to be the structure of the Executive Council (Exco), now the equivalent of a cabinet, appointed by the governor. Exco members have offered their resignations, allowing Mr Patten the possibility of splitting the executive from the legislature and turning the former into a purely advisory body.</p>

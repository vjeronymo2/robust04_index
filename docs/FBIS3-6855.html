			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "International Terrorism"] </F>   [Text] The accident involving a motorcycle fortunately  prevented terrorists from carrying out a bomb attack with their  truck. The Israeli Embassy was probably the target of the bomb  attack. The accident forced the terrorists to desert their  truck, which was eventually moved to Lumpini Police Station.    Inestimable damage and tragedy would have resulted if the  terrorists were able to carry out their mission. What prevented  the tragedy was the accident, not the ability of the officials  concerned.    Police and security officials and questioning of witnesses  indicate initially that the bombing attempt was the work of  international terrorists, possibly Arabs who seek to avenge the  Hebron massacre.    Among the observations concerning the bombing attempt are:  How did immigration officials allow these terrorists to enter  the country? Is the intelligence network sound and is its  coordination with foreign intelligence agencies efficient?    True, because Thailand is a democratic country and tourism  is  a major revenue earner, its check on arriving foreign tourists  is rather loose. But this should not mean that entries are  permitted without checks or for selfish reasons.    Another observation is: Why did officials of the Lumpini  Police Station leave the explosive-laden truck unchecked for six  days? This delay deprived others of any chance of a timely  arrest of suspects. Was there a written record of the accident?  Was there a neglect of duty?    Although the cold war has ended, disputes among nations have  continued more vigorously in some places, such as in the former  Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, and in the Middle East.  International terrorism has not ceased. The countries who have  lax security will fall prey first.</p>

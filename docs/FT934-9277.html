			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Japanese nuclear policy increases UK's risk Sir, For the first time, a Japanese official has acknowledged that, if Thorp operates, plutonium separated from Japanese fuel will have to be stored at Sellafield (Letters, November 8). While Mr K Kaneko of the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan says that it will not remain there 'forever', he knows that Japanese objectives cannot now be met without long-term storage at Sellafield. If current contracts are honoured, around 35 tonnes of fissile plutonium will be separated from Japanese fuels by British and French reprocessors. Japan is also constructing its own reprocessing plant at Rokkasho-mura which is expected to produce a further 50 tonnes in the 10 years after it opens in 2001. Add another 5 tonnes from the existing Tokai-mura plant and one arrives at a supply of about 90 tonnes by the year 2010. The trouble for Japan is that its consumption of plutonium cannot approach this figure. The fast reactor programme that was to have absorbed most of the plutonium has been much delayed, and plans for using the material in conventional reactors are still in their infancy. A surplus of more than 20 tonnes by 2000, and 40 tonnes by 2010, is now probable if reprocessing plans are implemented. The Japanese government has recently reaffirmed its 'no stockpiling' policy. The great great political sensitivity in east Asia about plutonium has led the Japanese government to declare that only a 'running stock' sufficient for current needs will be held on Japanese territory. The implication is that any surplus will have to remain in Europe until well into the next century. This will be true even if plutonium recycling expands after 2000, since priority will then have to be given to using the plutonium separated at Rokkasho-mura. Otherwise, stockpiling in Japan will be unavoidable. If Thorp operates, large tonnages of Japanese separated plutonium will therefore have to be held in store at Sellafield. Along with the British plutonium for which there is no use, and the German plutonium which is also likely to remain here, the surplus stock at Sellafield will exceed 100 tonnes soon after the year 2000. Reprocessing is now the most expensive and risky storage policy imaginable. Instead of leaving the plutonium and radioactive wastes safely stored in spent fuel, they are separated out just to be stored again. How can the government consent to this?

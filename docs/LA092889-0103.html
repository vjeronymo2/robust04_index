			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE TO GET STATE FUNDS FOR PARKLAND  </P> <P> Glendale elected officials this week said the city will receive $500,000 in  tobacco tax funds to purchase parkland in the San Rafael Hills.  </P> <P> The money, which will be matched by $250,000 from the city's $1-million park  acquisition fund, will purchase about 150 acres for preservation as open space  in the mountains east of the Glendale Freeway.  </P> <P> The money was a last-minute addition to the annual "Christmas tree bill" in  which state legislators fund pet projects.  </P> <P> At a press conference Tuesday morning in the mountains, Assemblyman Pat Nolan  (R-Glendale) said he learned the day before the session closed that money was  available through the 5% of the tobacco tax set aside for wildlife and open  space protection.  </P> <P> Nolan asked Glendale parks officials for proposals. The city identified several  parcels that could be purchased with the money, said Nello Iacono, director of  parks and recreation.  </P> <P> Iacono declined to identify specific parcels because the owners had not been  notified of the city's interest.  </P></p>

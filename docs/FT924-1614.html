			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Banks reject wide ombudsman role BANKS yesterday publicly rejected the idea of extending the banking ombudsman scheme to cover small business complaints. The idea is being discussed in meetings this week between Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and senior bankers. Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the British Bankers' Association, said it would be 'impractical' to extend the scheme's terms of reference. 'If you started changing the terms, you would end up with a muddle,' he said. Sir Nicholas said incorporated businesses had redress against banks through the courts. The ombudsman would not be equipped to 'second guess' banks' commercial decisions, such as what rate of interest to charge on loans. He said he could not disclose the topics of discussion between Mr Lamont and the chairmen and chief executives of banks this week. The chancellor is, however, thought to have raised the idea of extending the scheme. Mr Lamont yesterday met Sir Nicholas, Mr Andrew Buxton, the chief executive of Barclays Bank, and Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of National Westminster Bank. The chancellor has been urging banks to pass on base rate cuts to borrowers. National Westminster Bank said Mr Wanless told the chancellor the vast majority of allegations about banks and small business were 'unsubstantiated and misplaced'. The bank had passed on all base rate cuts in full . Two years ago the government rejected suggestions by the Jack Committee on banking services that small businesses should be brought within the scope of the banking ombudsman scheme. The scheme is funded and supported by banks. Separately, Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, last night criticised both the government and the press for their role in encouraging what he called 'the biggest wave of anti-bank sentiment in Britain since the 1930s'. Sir Jeremy, making his presidential address to the Chartered Institute of Bankers in London, said the government had been 'happy to find someone else to share the blame for the hardships in the economy'. Banks faced further criticism from the Consumers' Association, however. It said high street banks had been 'unacceptably slow' in implementing the banking code of practice and had made 'parsimonious' interpretations of it. Ms Jean Eaglesham said that 'honourable exceptions apart', banks had implemented the code in a 'slow, half-hearted, grudging' way and favoured their own interests over customers when there was a clash.</p>

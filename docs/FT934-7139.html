			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Books: Tempt the young to turn to the bible - The FT Children's Book of the Month 'MY MOTHER forced me, by steady daily toil, to learn long chapters of the Bible by heart; as well as to read its every syllable through, aloud, hard names and all, from Genesis to the Acopalyse, about once a year; and to that discipline - patient, accurate, and resolute - I owe, not only a knowledge of the book, which I find occasionally serviceable, but much of my general power of taking pains, and the best part of my taste in literature.' Thus wrote John Ruskin in 1885 of his strenuous childhood in the 1820s. A century after Ruskin's death, when many people have little faith or none, it is difficult to know how to introduce this rich and complicated inheritance to children. Should it be through one of the traditional translations or through the collections of easier Bible stories? What is the Bible to our generation - and what should it be to the next? Should the Bible be considered mainly as a literary and cultural inheritance  -as a means to understanding the west's painting, poetry, literature and music? Or should Bible study be considered as a way of teaching morality - using the teachings of Christ to show young people how to behave? The Bible must continue to serve as a living guide to right conduct, runs this argument. The raciest Bible to be published this autumn, Nelson Word's Youth Bible (Pounds 9.99), with such words as 'justice . . . fear . . . love . . . depresLine is overdrawn sion . . . faith . . . sex' blazoned across its jazzy cover, promises to reveal to 'a new generation that the Bible is the best guidebook by which to live your life.' Although this approach is often linked with Evangelical Christianity, even humanists would regard Christ as a great moral example. Of this autumn's selection of bibles and part bibles, the Youth Bible (conceived for young adults) is the least attractive: 'accessible', 'relevant', moralistic, evangelically brow-beating, it is so buttressed about by useful signposts, 'frameworks for understanding', 'goals' to tempt uninterested teenagers onto the path to truth, that the complications and inconsistencies of the book is entirely lost sight of. Martin Waddell's Stories from the Bible (Frances Lincoln, Pounds 9.95), which consists of re-tellings of a number of the best known stories from the Old Testament for children of five and above is beautifully simple and clear, but the language is often too bright and feisty for the subject matter. In the beginning, we are told: 'God said: 'Let there be light]' and there was. It was great.' And: 'The next day God made Heaven and Earth, doing the big bits first.' Thus, in one swift stroke, children are caused to lose all sense of gravity and duty. Waddell's account stops inexplicably at Jonah. The best of the crop is undoubtedly The Kingfisher Children's Bible (by Ann Pilling, Pounds 12.99) which both selectively encompasses the Bible from beginning to end, and mingles a modern re-telling in a language that manages to retain some sense of the majestic cadences of the King James Bible, with quotations from that translation and others. And, in spite of the fact that it is a book of biblical 'highlights', each small, individual chapter is prefaced by a specific reference back to the Bible itself, book and chapter, so that children thirsty for more can easily consult the original source. It therefore achieves what a good modern bible for children needs to achieve if it is to serve the present generation: a harmonising of past with present so that children understand that language, stories and moral truths are hard won and long savoured. A language that leans too heavily upon this month's idioms will surely be dead by Christmas.</p>

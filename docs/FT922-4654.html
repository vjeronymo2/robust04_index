			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Major rejects calls for referendum on treaty MR JOHN MAJOR pledged to press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty yesterday despite signs that Denmark's vote against further European integration could spark a large-scale rebellion by Tory MPs. As the government sought to grapple with the vote's implications, several ministers were said last night privately to be backing calls for a renegotiation of the accord on political and economic union. The prime minister flatly rejected calls from Conservative and Labour Euro-sceptics for a British referendum on the agreement. In an uncompromising performance in the House of Commons, Mr Major insisted that the deal negotiated at Maastricht was in the best interests of Britain and the European Community. But there were signs at Westminster that the ranks of the two dozen or so Conservative rebels who have consistently opposed the agreement were being swelled by others demanding a fundamental reappraisal of the government's stance. Up to 100 Tory MPs were said to have signed a motion expressing unease about the pace of European integration. Some ministers shared the glee of the Euro-sceptics at the blow Denmark had dealt to Brussels. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, whose antipathy towards the Community was at the heart of her downfall two years ago, hailed the result of the Danish referendum as a triumph for democracy. Confidants of the former prime minister said she might lead the campaign for a referendum after her expected elevation to the House of Lords in the dissolution honours later this week. But her stance was sharply criticised by Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor. Writing in The European newspaper, he described her opposition to integration as 'obsolete'. Senior opposition figures indicated that Labour may now consider backing calls from the Conservative rebels for a referendum. If that shift were confirmed, Mr Major would face a serious risk of defeat in the House of Commons. The Danish decision forced the government to postpone - probably for two or three weeks - a debate on the legislation needed to ratify Maastricht scheduled for yesterday and today. Mr Major said Britain could lose more than it might gain by any general renegotiation of the accord, with some EC governments seeking to reopen the argument about federalism. Last night he drew comfort from the choice of Sir Peter Hordern, a close ally, as chairman of the backbench committee on Europe of Conservative MPs. The prime minister insisted that the structure of the treaty - based to a large extent on inter-governmental co-operation - had marked a reversal of the trend towards centralisation in the EC. Responding to calls from Conservative opponents of the deal, he replied: 'The treaty itself has not changed, and neither has my view of the treaty.'</p>

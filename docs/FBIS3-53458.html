			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 15 Jan (MENA)-- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chairman of  the Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli meetings  to implement the Gaza-Jericho First Agreement, has accused the  Israeli side of trying to obstruct the progress of negotiations  during the first week of the Taba talks.    He told MENA that this obstruction was very clear in the  Israeli statements before and during the meeting. He believes  that this might have been due to the fact that the Israelis are  waiting for the outcome of the al-Asad-Clinton summit meeting,  or probably because the Palestinians refused to accept the Cairo  document as a pure agreement, as the Israelis wanted it to be.    The Palestinian official noted that the Labor Party is  pursuing the same policy and approach that Likud formerly used.  I believe that we can overcome all the difficulties if all the  parties show good will, he said, adding: We are willing to do  that.    Sha'th said that 'Arafat dreams of a free and independent  Palestine, just like everyone else. We know that this is not  the right time. We agreed to and committed ourselves to  negotiations to find a solution for a transitional period. This  means that we know that the time is not ripe yet for an  independent state, he said.    The Palestinian official pointed out that the establishment  of an independent state requires, first of all, an agreement on  self-government in Gaza and Jericho, then in the entire West  Bank. After that there can be negotiations concerning the  independent state, he said.    Dr. Sha'th accused the Israeli negotiating delegation of  demonstrating hypersensitivity concerning what they view as a  symbol of sovereignty.    He affirmed that the Palestinian side does not seek to  establish an independent Palestinian state at present but that  the Israeli side sometimes takes an exaggerated view of the  symbols of sovereignty and even the symbols of the Palestinian  national identity, which the Palestinian people insist on  establishing. As an example, he recalled that Palestinians used  to be jailed for hoisting the Palestinian flag.    In his remarks, Sha'th pointed out that the Israelis do not  want the Palestinian authority to have its own postal stamps  because they take this as a symbol of sovereignty.    Postal stamps might represent some form of identity, but it  is not an instrument of sovereignty, he said. He added that  Israel does not want the Palestinian authority to have its own  telephone area code or to join the International Auto Club,  which Palestine was a member of until 1960.    As for the Palestinian currency, Sha'th explained that this  issue was discussed by the Palestinian-Israeli committee in  Paris. He noted that Scotland has its own currency even though  it is not independent of the United Kingdom.    Sha'th emphasized that the Palestinian people deserve to  have a national identity and to look forward to obtaining their  right to freedom, independence, and equality.    Sha'th spoke about the first week of the current round of  negotiations in Taba, which is scheduled to resume on Monday.  He said: There were two battles during the first week of  negotiations. The first was over whether or not there was a  Cairo agreement and who had backed down from it. The second was  over what the Israeli side had leaked regarding reaching an  agreement with us on Jericho. It was a pure fabrication and they  had to deny the same reports that they themselves had leaked.  He added: We succeeded in making them announce that there was  no document called the Cairo agreement, but rather a Cairo  understanding. He added: The fact is that six different  versions were written outlining what conclusions the Cairo talks  had reached. One version contained seven reservations expressed  by president 'Arafat and another included the reservations of  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    Turning to next week's negotiations, the head of the  Palestinian negotiating delegation noted that he had agreed with  his Israeli counterpart Major General Amnon Shahaq to start the  negotiations on Monday with a discussion of the structure of the  final agreement as the first item on the agenda. He added: We  will meet in three committees. The civilian committee, which  envisages concluding its work next week; the general drafting  committee; and the security committee. He noted that the only  items on the agenda of the civilian committee are archaeology,  water, urban planning, and land registration, both the state  land and the land of absentees [al-gha'ibin]. He noted that a  problem arose within the civilian committee when Jamil  al-Tarifi, head of the Palestinian delegation to the committee,  objected to ending the discussion of civil registration in Gaza  without discussing Jericho, which is part of the West Bank. It  was agreed in this respect that when the negotiations on the  West Bank start in the second stage, these three items [not  further specified] will be added and an agreement will be  signed, he added, noting that the Israelis wanted to separate  the records of the Jericho area from those of the West Bank.    Sha'th pointed out that concerning the general agreement,  there are two versions: One Israeli and one Palestinian. He  added: We have to look at them once again to come up with a  joint document. Sha'th added that the coordination measures had  also been agreed upon. He noted that the Israeli side proposed  a draft structure for coordination called the Higher  Coordination Body, which appeared to parallel the Palestinian  National Authority and which was to be divided into two  subcommittees, one for Gaza and the other for Jericho. He  added: The Palestinians managed to abrogate this body and only  keep a liaison committee affiliated to the Palestinian National  Authority -- similar to the liaison officers present at  embassies for instance -- to resolve the problems that may arise  between Palestinians and Israelis.    Asked what progress the security committee has made, Dr.  Sha'th replied that difficulties persist. We have not made any  progress because of the Israeli concept of security, he said.  He remarked that the current negotiations represent a conflict  between more Palestinian independence, freedom, and dignity on  the one hand and Israel's eternal struggle for security.    Dr. Sha'th noted some progress concerning Gaza's security.  The Israeli side presented to us a new map under which they  give us back 8 square kilometers of land belonging to the  Palestinians, in addition to 2.5 sq km of the Palestinian lands  they had seized to build settlements and 3 sq km of Gush Qatif  in southern Gaza, he said. He added that a further 4 sq km on  the border with Egypt are expected to be returned as well. We  have not obtained the latest map yet, he remarked.    Dr. Sha'th talked about the linking roads that will cross  Gaza to connect the settlements to the main road to Israel. He  noted that the two sides had agreed to set up joint  Palestinian-Israeli patrols along these roads. He explained  that Israel wanted to establish five military bases along this  main road, in addition to seven fixed checkpoints to protect it.    In general, Dr. Sha'th stated that progress has been made  concerning Gaza. He explained that the major points of  disagreement right now are concentrated in the area of Jericho.  All we have gotten in the whole area so far are 57 square  kilometers, he said.    The Palestinian official noted that Jericho is regarded as  part of the Old Israeli Alon plan, which the Israelis have not  relinquished. He explained that the plan covered the city of  Jerusalem and the surrounding settlements. It involved the  establishment of settlements along the borders with Jordan, in  what the Israelis call the defense line of their security zone  on the East Bank to defend against Jordan and Iraq. He remarked  that Jericho is included in that zone. He added that the  Israelis ultimately want to keep Jerusalem, the Red Sea coast,  and the Jordan River.    Sha'th said that the demands presented by president 'Arafat  involved the Lido coastal area on the Dead Sea, the al-Maghtas  area on the Jordan River, al-Qantal mountain, and al-Nabi Musa.    He added: We have secured a passage linking Jericho,  al-'Awjah, 'Aqabat Jabr Camp, 'Ayn al-Sultan Camp, al-Duyuk  village, al-Qarantal hill, and Musa al-'Alami farm.    He emphasized that the Palestinian negotiator will attempt  to  achieve three objectives that Egypt tried to achieve during the  Camp David negotiations. He said that during those negotiations  Egypt did not agree to leave one inch of its territory under  Israeli occupation, did not agree for a single Israeli settler  to remain after the Israeli withdrawal, and did not accept  Israeli economic hegemony in the name of normalization. We, as  Palestinian negotiators, must adhere to these three objectives,  he said.</p>

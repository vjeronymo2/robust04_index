			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Telmex shares tumble as results disappoint market The stock price of Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the country's telephone monopoly and largest private company, fell sharply yesterday morning after it reported worse than expected net profits of 7.14bn pesos (Dollars 2.09bn) in the first nine months of the year, an increase of just 1.5 per cent compared with the same period in 1993. Third-quarter profits rose by 5.5 per cent to 2.6bn pesos. Telmex 'L' shares closed 5.2 per cent lower. The poor results, along with others reported by Mexican companies, led to a 2.1 per cent fall in the Mexican stock market at close of trading. The company's profits were dragged down by a 29.2 per cent rise in operating costs over the nine months, mainly accounted for by the increased cost of maintenance and the investment in substituting analogue lines with digital ones. The rise in costs caused the operating margin to fall to 41.7 per cent. Financial costs were also up sharply, largely due to the depreciation of nearly 10 per cent of the peso against the US dollar, which led to a reported exchange loss of 978m pesos. Overall the company posted a financial loss of 582.5m pesos in the first nine months of the year. Revenues reached 21.37bn pesos in the first nine months of the year, an 11.8 per cent rise. The increase was attributed to the 12.4 per cent growth of lines in service and an increase in volume of long-distance and local telephone traffic. Telmex's cellular subsidiary reported another strong quarter, with the number of users increasing 31.9 per cent.</p>

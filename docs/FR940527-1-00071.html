			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Other Proposed Changes to the Prospective Payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System for Inpatient Operating Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Definition of and Payment for Transfer Cases (&sect;412.4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The prospective payment system distinguishes between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``discharges'', situations in which a patient leaves an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acute-care hospital after receiving complete treatment, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``transfers'', situations in which the patient is transferred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to another acute-care hospital for related care. If a full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DRG payment were made to each hospital involved in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer situation irrespective of the length of time the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient spent in the ``sending'' hospital prior to transfer,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this would create a strong incentive to increase transfers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thereby unnecessarily endangering patients' health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the regulations at &sect;412.4(d) provide that, in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer situation, full payment is made to the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharging hospital and each transferring hospital is paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a per diem rate for each day of the stay, not to exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full DRG payment that would have been made if the patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had been discharged without being transferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the per diem rate paid to a transferring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital is determined by dividing the full DRG payment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have been paid in a nontransfer situation by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geometric mean length-of-stay for the DRG into which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case falls. Transferring hospitals are also eligible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlier payments for cases that meet the cost outlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria established for all other cases (nontransfer and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer cases alike) classified to the DRG. They are not,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, eligible for day outlier payments. Two exceptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the transfer payment policy are transfer cases classified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into DRG 385 (Neonates, Died or Transferred to Another Acute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Care Facility) or DRG 456 (Burns, Transferred to Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acute Care Facility), which are not paid on a per diem basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but instead receive the full DRG payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Definition of a Transfer Case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under current policy, cases that are transferred from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acute-care area paid under the prospective payment system to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hospital or unit excluded from the prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system are considered to be discharges (as opposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfers) from the acute-care hospital. As a discharge,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment for the case is the full DRG amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rationale for this policy was set forth in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial hospital inpatient prospective payment interim final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule with comment period, which was published on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1, 1983. In that document, we stated that: ``*&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospitals and units excluded from the prospective payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system are organized for treatment of conditions distinctly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlike treatment encountered in short-term acute care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. Therefore, the services obtained in excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities would not be the same services obtained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferring hospitals (that is, paid under the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment system), and payment to both facilities would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate.'' (See 48 FR 39759.) Thus, since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment hospital was assumed to be providing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full course of acute inpatient care before transfer to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded hospital or unit for additional care and treatment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we believed it was appropriate to pay the prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment hospital the full DRG amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the most part, inpatient hospital services furnished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by hospitals and hospital units excluded from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment system are paid on a reasonable cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, subject to a cost per discharge limit. This payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not vary by source of admission or discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destination. Under &sect;&sect;412.22 through 412.29, the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of facilities are identified as being excluded from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prospective payment system: psychiatric hospitals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinct part units; rehabilitation hospitals and distinct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part units; long-term care hospitals; cancer hospitals;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children's hospitals; hospitals outside the 50 States, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico; Veterans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration and other Federal hospitals; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonparticipating hospitals furnishing emergency services to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare beneficiaries. Also listed in &sect;412.22(c) (2) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) are hospitals paid under approved State cost control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems and hospitals reimbursed in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized demonstration projects. Under &sect;412.4(b)(3)(i),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients moving from an acute-care hospital paid under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment system to hospitals within either of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these categories are currently considered transfers, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore they are not referred to in the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since implementation of the prospective payment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over 10 years ago the distinctions between the types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services provided in acute-care hospitals and excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals and hospital units have become less clear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acute-care hospitals may have an incentive to reduce patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lengths of stay, and thus patient costs, in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximize profits since payment is no longer linked to actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs. This has led to a steady increase in the numbers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded hospitals and units, as well as postacute-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, as acute-care hospitals look to discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients whom heretofore they were treating until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients were ready to be discharged to their homes. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Langenbruner et al.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Health Care Financing Review,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Spring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of a study of Medicare transfer cases funded by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA (``Transfers of Medicare Hospital Patients under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prospective Payment System'', PM&hyph;191&hyph;HCFA, January 1994),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RAND examined trends in transfer episodes from FY 1987 to FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991. RAND's analysis found that, from 1987 to 1991, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfers from one prospective payment system setting to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another increased 4.1 percent, transfers from a prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment system setting to excluded rehabilitation units and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excluded psychiatric units increased 18.9 percent and 7.0  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, respectively. We believe that this growth in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfers to excluded hospital units is an indication that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the distinction in the types of services provided in short- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term acute-care settings and excluded settings is not as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant as it was in 1983.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

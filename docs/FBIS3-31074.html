			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Martin: "Relation of Forces"] </F>   [Text] The Muslim media have for days been reporting on the  "shelling of the still free parts of Mostar" by the Croatian  Defense Council and the Croatian Army. Military sources of the  Croatian Defense Council have, on the other hand, been reporting  on the constant activity of Muslim snipers and gunners at Mostar  streets, schools, and buildings. The UN Protection Force and  military observers are counting mines and shells; dead and  wounded are counted, too -- civilians, children, and soldiers  alike on both sides. General Ante Roso, head of the Croatian  Defense Council Headquarters, protested against the UN  Protection Forces because of the shelling of civilian targets,  which caused the deaths of children. Several days later,  General Jean Cot wrote to General Roso about the shelling of  Mostar and asked him to stop the action.    The demarcation line in Mostar has remained almost unchanged  since 30 June 1993, when Muslim forces, supported by the units  of the Croatian Defense Council consisting of soldiers of Muslim  nationality, occupied the "Tihomir Misic" Barracks and the  largest part of Bijelo Polje. Since that time, there have been  clashes for the preservation of positions, mostly at the level  of provocations. Muslim forces tried to occupy Buna on three  occasions, with the aim of starting an offensive in the  direction of Stolac, but they were forced to withdraw because of  heavy losses. The attempt to occupy Hum also meant a tragic end  for Izetbegovic's soldiers. The Croatian Defense Council units  on several occasions succeeded in seizing several well-fortified  buildings on Ricina (Santic) Street in the center of Mostar.    According to some objective assessments, there are  6,000-7,000 soldiers in the 4th Corps of Izetbegovic's army in  Mostar. Most of them have been recruited among refugees from  eastern Herzegovina and eastern Bosnia and are armed with  weapons they obtained or "borrowed" from the Croatian Defense  Council. These are infantry weapons, including mortars,  recoilless rifles, and single-barreled rocket launchers; they do  not have heavy artillery guns. It is highly probable that they  have recently bought mostly ammunition and certain weapons. On  the other side, there are Croatian Defense Council units, who  are much better armed and have much more ammunition but cannot  (and do not have to) keep as many soldiers on the Mostar front  as the Muslims.    It is only logical to ask why the Croatian Defense Council  has not completely occupied Mostar in the past nine months. Why  has this stalemate position -- in which the Croatian Defense  Council is losing its people -- not been resolved yet?    There are various theories about it, but the most probable  is  the one that says that it is a political issue. Taking into  consideration the information on the number of soldiers that can  be engaged on both sides, on the weapons the parties to the  conflict have, and on the much more favorable positions the  Croatian Defense Council units have, it is certain that the  Muslims would be defeated according to any military law should  it be decided to take Mostar. The only question is how long the  Muslims could offer resistance, since many Muslim soldiers are  ready to leave Mostar and the unbearable life in isolation and  poverty.    The striking force of the Muslim army are refugees from  eastern Herzegovina, who are more than aware of the fact that it  is almost certain they will never be able to return to their  homes. This makes them the most radical element in the Muslim  army. The local Muslims could make an agreement with Croats,  although this would not be easy. On the other hand, it has  become evident that "foreigners" play an important role among  the Muslims in Mostar. This is proven by the fact that two  Muslims from Sandzak joined the negotiations in Medjugorje, but  the Croatian Defense Council representative did not want to  negotiate with them, so the first negotiators returned.    The Serbian soldiers situated on the slopes of Velez  Mountain  are observing everything and are waiting for an outcome. They  do not know when or if they will interfere in the  Muslim-Croatian conflict.</p>

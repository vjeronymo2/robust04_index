			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Yesterday, without any  secrecy, the establishment of the Palestinian Preventive  Security Service [PPSS] was officially announced. Jibril  al-Rujub, head of the PPSS in the West bank, announced: "Today,  we officially started functioning as a security service." Later  he added that this was only the official announcement. "In  fact," he said, "we have been operating for several months."  [passage omitted]    Al-Rujub made another, quite official statement: "The PPSS  was established to provide for the security of Palestinian  civilians and to defend their freedom."    Explaining the PPSS policy, he stressed: "There will be no  cooperation between the Palestinian intelligence services and  the Israeli security services. We signed the Gaza and Jericho  agreement, which speaks of security coordination, and there will  be coordination." [passage omitted]    The second principle guiding the PPSS, according to  al-Rujub,  will be to safeguard democracy: "We will disqualify no  democratic struggle and will not rule out any opposition that  operates democratically. It is every man's right to express his  opinion, but we will allow no one to impose his stands and will  on anybody else. If, for example, some body or group should call  for a strike, they are free to do so. If, however, they use  terror to impose a strike, we will not let them do so."    The third principle governing the PPSS is the territorial  scope of its operations throughout the territories, "including  East Jerusalem, because it is occupied territory."    Al-Rujub further said that the first goal of the PPSS will  be  to settle accounts with Palestinian collaborators. His remarks  on this issue sounded a bit apologetic: "Unlike other nations  under occupation, the phenomenon of collaborators here was not  that terrible. It is a dangerous matter, and we must deal with  it." Al-Rujub promised that they will deal with the matter  while examining each case on an individual basis. "We will  treat each person in accordance with the gravity of his crime.  As of today, we will not allow collaborators among us," he  said. [passage omitted]</p>

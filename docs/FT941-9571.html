			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / International Company News: Mexico to offer bank licences The Mexican government will this week invite US and Canadian-based banks to apply for licences to set up Mexican subsidiaries, according to Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister. The foreign banks granted licences would be the first to operate in Mexico, except for Citibank, which manages a Mexican branch under special agreement. The licences are expected to be given out in the second half of this year. Mr Aspe said foreigners would be given 60 days to make their applications. He expected that all those that applied, and met the necessary legal and financial requirements, would be granted a licence. The financial minister said the banks would make Mexico's financial system more competitive. 'I think there is going to be a revolution, which is exactly what I wanted,' he said. Mexico agreed to open up its financial system under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Under Nafta, US and Canadian-based banks are collectively allowed up to 8 per cent of total banking capital this year, with the limit gradually increasing until the year 2000, when it disappears. Individual foreign banks are allowed up to 1.5 per cent of total capital this year. Several large US banks - including JP Morgan, Bank of America, Manufacturers Hanover, and Chemical Bank - are believed to have shown interest in opening up Mexican subsidiaries. European and Asian banks, through their US and Canadian subsidiaries, are also expected to seek licences. Under Nafta, Mexico further agreed to open brokerages and the insurance sector to US and Canadian-based companies. Foreign brokerages will initially be limited to 10 per cent of the Mexican market. Based on foreign banks' interest in coming to Mexico, Mr Aspe did not expect that the 8 per cent of total assets for foreign banks would be a binding limit. But he was setting the 60-day time period for applications so as not to have to ration foreign banking licenses in the future. JP Morgan has already sought approval from the US Federal Reserve to operate a subsidiary in Mexico. Morgan, which has a large representative office in Mexico, plans to apply for the maximum permitted capital per foreign bank. It hopes to offer a broad range of commercial and investment banking services through a bank and brokerage, according to a spokeswoman. Mr Aspe said the government would run a balanced budget this year, as planned. However, he said spending priorities had changed after the New Year uprising in Chiapas, and money would be shifted from some programmes to politically more important ones. The finance ministry separately announced that it would sell some or all of its remaining shares in three large banks; Bancomer, Serfin and Prime-Internacional. If all government shares were sold, the sales could be worth Dollars 2.4bn. Mr Aspe said money from those and other privatisations would, as in the past, be placed in the government's special contingency fund. It was still not decided whether the money would be used to reduce debt or finance increased social spending, the finance minister said.</p>

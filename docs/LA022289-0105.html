			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIFT OF GAB: SLAIN WOMAN'S CHOICE FOR PROTECTION  </P> <P> Robbyn Panitch decided not to buy a gun.  </P> <P> Through her doors each day came the desperate and delusional, transients with  private demons.  </P> <P> It was dangerous but rewarding work for the 36-year-old Los Angeles County  mental health worker.  </P> <P> But at 5 feet, 2 inches, the only protection the red-haired Panitch had was a  touch of fearlessness and a gift of gab.  </P> <P> "Robbyn could carry on a conversation with a telephone post," said Dr. Randall  Firling, a psychiatrist for the County Homeless Outreach Program, who worked  with Panitch for more than a year.  </P> <P> "She would start talking to people that, quite, frankly, I wouldn't know how to  approach," he recalled. "She really didn't have any kind of fear."  </P> <P> But a gun to protect herself from those needing help? No, she told relatives.  </P> <P> "She had decided that she couldn't do that because she was in the business of  trying to help people," said Mark Panitch, her 42-year-old brother from Yakima,  Wash. "She said if she had to be afraid of the people she was dealing with, she  should not be doing this."  </P> <P> What she wanted, said her family, was added security provided by the county,  but funding cutbacks made that impossible.  </P> <P> "She had talked to me several times, saying how she had gone to her supervisors  and asked for some kind of protection," Mark Panitch said, "but they told her  they county couldn't afford that."  </P> <P> Tuesday, a 26-year-old drifter with a 3-inch knife walked into the Santa Monica  clinic where Robbyn Panitch worked and stabbed her to death. Panitch's screams  alerted co-workers, who captured her attacker.  </P> <P> As news of the killing spread through the mental health community, relatives  and friends drew on the emotions of the day and recalled the woman they knew.  </P> <P> At their house in Palos Verdes Estates, her parents, Allan and Gloria Panitch,  recalled their daughter as a compassionate, loving person.  </P> <P> "She liked to work with people," Gloria Panitch said only hours after the fatal  attack, her eyes red with tears. "That is what she did -- what she was."  </P> <P> Her father, pacing, interjected: "It's ironic that one of the people she was  trying to help would do this."  </P> <P> Panitch, a Democratic Party activist, said politics was partly to blame for his  daughter's death.  </P> <P> The father contended that Republican-inspired budget cutbacks led to a lack of  security at county mental health facilities.  </P> <P> "It goes back to Proposition 13," he said. "It goes back to (Gov. George)  Deukmejian. It goes back to (former President Ronald) Reagan."  </P> <P> Continuing to pace, Panitch added: "They have to kill your daughter; they have  to kill your baby for people to realize what's happening. . . . How was I going  to know that my daughter was going to be sacrificed at the budget altar?"  </P> <P> As they spoke, Panitch's fiance, Tom Flaherty, arrived and embraced the  parents.  </P> <P> "This is what you get when you have no funding," he said bitterly, referring to  recent county cutbacks in mental health funding. "This guy has been running  around the street. It could have been you, but it was her."  </P> <P> Robbyn Panitch spent most of her childhood in Van Nuys. She attended high  school in Palo Alto after the family moved there. Her father is a contract  manager at Hughes Aircraft and her mother is a marriage and family counselor.  </P> <P> After doing civil rights work in the 1970s, she attended Mills College in  Oakland and later received two master's degrees -- one from USC in social work  and another in Jewish communal studies at Hebrew Union College. She played the  flute.  </P> <P> Panitch chose psychiatric social work, her brother said, because "she was  really concerned about people who had been dealt a low hand by society.  </P> <P> "She was very dedicated to the idea that everybody deserved a decent shake from  society, and she felt that what she was doing was a way of personally helping  to put her ideals into practice," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worked With Homeless  </P> <P> On the streets of the South Bay area, where she had worked for more than a  year, former colleagues recalled Panitch as a dynamo in working with the  homeless.  </P> <P> "There were times I told her she should be more careful," Firling said.  </P> <P> She also helped troubled inmates in County Jail and at Sybil Brand Institute  for Women, becoming friendly along the way with many people in the Sheriff's  Department. Her fiance works in medical services for the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Her brother said Panitch took part in the county's mobile psychiatric response  team. She was among the mental health workers who responded to 911 emergency  calls involving people acting strangely.  </P> <P> Her brother said Panitch had been attacked several times by these people, only  recently returning to work after back and leg injuries.  </P> <P> A resident of Santa Monica, Panitch was recently transferred to her hometown to  work at the county's Santa Monica West Mental Health Clinic, a pale brick  two-story structure in a quiet, tree-lined area dotted with apartments.  </P> <P> Ralph Mitchell, acting district chief of the facility, said Panitch was eager  to work with the caseload of transient mentally ill when she arrived.  </P> <P> "She asked to come," Mitchell said. "When she talked to us, she saw it as an  opportunity to work with the homeless."  </P> <P> Among her tasks at the clinic were manning the "cold weather shelters" where  transients go for treatment during poor weather and working as part of the  two-person mobile units that check on street populations in Santa Monica,  Beverly Hills, Culver City, Westwood and parts of Malibu.  </P> <P> A year ago, hiring was frozen at the clinic, and last week, the clinic laid off  six of its 12 staff members. Panitch was considering starting a private  practice and was looking for an office.  </P> <P> Gloria and Allan Panitch said their daughter, a union activist who decried the  layoffs, often volunteered to work overtime for free at the clinic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'She Knew'  </P> <P> "She'd volunteer her time because the county would not give her enough time,"  her father said.  </P> <P> More time meant more exposure to danger, her mother said.  </P> <P> "She knew," her mother added. "She told me that she was alone in this office  where anybody could walk in."  </P></p>

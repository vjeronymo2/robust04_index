Can It Be Avoided?''; first paragraph is boldface  IZVESTIYA introduction]    [Text] According to the most restrained World Health  Organization forecasts, if prevention is not significantly  intensified, at least 30-40 million men, women, and children  throughout the entire planet will be infected with HIV by the  year 2000.    At a Riga meeting of health and finance ministers from 35  European countries that was organized by the European regional  office of the World Health Organization, the latest statistics  regarding development of the AIDS epidemic in the region were  made public.    Among the East European countries, Romania heads the sad  list  of number of recorded cases per 100,000 population. Following  after it are Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, a number of countries,  and only then the Russian Federation. Not long ago, our  specialists in communicable diseases even expressed cautious  optimism regarding the slow development of events.    ``In Southern Asia,'' said Michael Merson, director of the  World Health Organization's global program for fighting AIDS,  ``the pandemic is now proceeding at the same swift paces as in  Africa at the end of the 1970s. A half million inhabitants of  Asia are now infected. And six years ago the number of those  known to be infected was in the single digits. This happened  largely because of the naive assumption that people in Asia are  immune to AIDS. If all possible measures are not taken now, a  tragedy may play out in Central and East European.''    On the basis of other countries' experience, a silent,  hidden  epidemic initially proceeds for about 10 years. Then comes an  overt epidemic, where infections and patients are recorded every  hour of every day. It has been emphasized that if resources are  not invested in preventing HIV infection now, the subsequent  swift development of events will be simply impossible to manage.  As Luxemburg's Minister of Health has put it, ``Pay now or pay  later.''    Specialists from the World Bank participated in the meeting,  which was called ``Investments in Health Protection.'' They are  now working out a decision regarding how much money to invest in  preventing HIV infection.    Doctor Antonio Campos, the World Bank's chief specialist in  health care investment, stated, ``Expenditures to prevent AIDS  are not at all unprofitable. On the contrary, they are among the  most profitable types of capital investments that the world  community can make. The point is that on this very day, the  epidemic is incapacitating the young and most capable members of  society. According to today's estimates, direct health care  costs in connection with AIDS in 1992 totaled $5 billion  throughout the world. If the indirect costs of the epidemic are  taken into account, that figure must be multiplied by 10. And  that still does not include the economic losses.''    The future largely depends on today's efforts. In  development  of the epidemic, East European is lagging 5-6 years. And it is  especially important that this time be used effectively because  the economies of most countries in the region are not in the  best condition. What kind of resources must be invested in  preventing an epidemic in Central and East European? About $248  million is needed to provide the public with condoms and market  them. The costs of treating patients amount to about $151  million. Measures regarding ``sex industry'' workers and their  clients will cost about $48 million. Public health education in  schools will cost a bit less, about $46 million. Among other  items of expenditure, the following should be noted: preventing  in-hospital infection ($25 million); running a mass media  campaign ($15 million); guaranteeing the safety of blood and  blood products; preventing infection among drug addicts, and  developing national programs. These are approximate figures.    Participating in the meeting were the Baltic countries,  Russia, and virtually all other states of the CIS -- Ukraine,  Byelarus, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.  Ilona Kikbush [transliteration], a department director of the  World Health Organization, said that for the first time,  physicians and financial experts were discussing the problems of  AIDS together. This was dictated by the very logic of life: In  keeping society healthy, the medical community is far from the  sole and main player.    Experts from Switzerland and England talked about their  interesting experience. There is a very strong preconceived  opinion that it is impossible to affect anything connected with  sexual bias. Switzerland's experience says otherwise. As a  result of an active campaign, 60 percent of the country's young  people use condoms (only one third of that amount did  previously). The campaign in the Swiss mass media was run under  the slogan: Be faithful to your partner or to a condom. There is  a popular picture postcard where a condom is, please forgive me,  in place of the sun.    Perhaps this material will seem frivolous to someone. The  life of several generations is at risk, however. It is therefore  necessary to have open and frank talks with children and youths,  so that this is not interpreted as bawdiness.    There is the opinion that early teaching of knowledge about  sex life education in schools will push children to very early  sex. On the contrary, in reality, children and adolescents with  whom sex has been seriously discussed are in no hurry to begin  swimming in the ``sea of love.'' Among children who have been  prepared, there is a decrease in the number of adolescent  pregnancies and in the number of HIV infections. Who knows,  perhaps, the infected child who drew himself and wrote ``I'm  infected...Hug me, I am not dangerous!'' may have been born that  way out of someone's fear of explaining the consequences of  unsafe sex...The drawing has become a popular banner in many  countries.    The meeting participants erected a small column on one of  Riga's streets. It was made of stones with the names of people  from different countries who have died of AIDS. A stone  commemorating the event was also laid alongside the Domskiy  Cathedral.    The following reminder was sounded again and again in the  speeches of the delegates from the different countries: No one  form of sexual behavior should be considered criminal. Not one  of those persons infected or ill should be subjected to  ostracism and discrimination.    The meeting participants approved a document entitled the  ``Riga Initiative.'' It is a call for active action and a  program of special measures to prevent an AIDS epidemic in  Central and East European in 1993-1996. The document pays  serious attention to protecting the dignity of infected and ill  persons, adhering to the principles of physicians' ethics, and  complete confidentiality of tests and treatment.</p>

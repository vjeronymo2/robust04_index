			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL JOINS STUDY-ABROAD GROUP  </P> <P> Students at Antelope Valley College now have the opportunity to walk some real  halls of ivy, thanks to a new program that includes a semester of study in  London.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley is the 11th community college to join the ranks of the Southern  California Foothills Consortium, which sends faculty and students abroad to  study.  </P> <P> Unlike other foreign study programs, the consortium sends its own faculty  abroad to teach the students.  </P> <P> "These are American community college students attending American community  college courses taught by American community college professors in London,"  said Rae Yoshida, vice president of academic affairs, who represents the  college on the consortium.  </P> <P> The consortium contracts for academic and support services that include  classroom facilities, meals, housing, counseling and special cultural and  social events.  </P> <P> Additionally, students are given memberships in the University of London and  the Imperial College's student union.  </P> <P> To be considered for the program, students must have completed 12 units of  college with a 2.5 grade-point average by the time they begin the London  program.  </P> <P> Once in London, they are required to enroll in a minimum of 12 units, including  three units of British life and culture.  </P> <P> The $4,000 cost of the program includes tuition, air fare, accommodations,  meals and trips. Consortium officials said financial aid is available.  </P> <P> Other colleges that belong to the consortium include Citrus College, College of  the Canyons, Pasadena City College and Victor Valley College.  </P> <P> In the spring of 1992 the consortium plans to offer a semester in Guadalajara,  with an emphasis on language. Then, there are plans to add Florence, Italy, and  Madrid as destinations, Yoshida said. STEVE DELANEY  </P></p>

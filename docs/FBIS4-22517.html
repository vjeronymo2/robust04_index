			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Ukolov: "What Miners Tried To Get in the </F> Capital"]    [Text]  <H5>  Voices From the Picket Line </H5>   At the Krasnopreskenskaya Metro Station passengers going out  to the street were met with a rhythmical, incomprehensible,  alarming clatter. It came from the White House, which was  picketed by miners who came from all over Russia. The government  is now located there.    The building was painted. Traces of shelling are no longer  visible. However, all of it is surrounded by a solid fence made  from reinforced concrete slabs. Only a passage was left at  Pavlik Morozov Square. The crowd stood there. Robust fellows  continuously banged their helmets against the iron enclosure.  The following poster was above others: "President, Miners Will  Not Die in Silence!"    This is for sure. In the morning, when the masters of the  White House walked and drove to work, they were met with such an  angry whistle that their nerves were strained. Some people will  say: You cannot do this. And they will be right. However, these  sloggers, whom the government does not pay for their work and  about whose safety in faces it is not concerned--if you are  disabled, this is your personal problem--are much more right.  They give it an evaluation the way they know how. To put it  mildly, a negative evaluation.    General words are always just words. But every picketing  miner has his own trouble, everyone separately is being  strangled by the noose of the lack of money. As an example,  several statements recorded into a dictaphone.    Mikhail Tarasevich, heading man at the Severnaya Mine  (Vorkuta):    "Since December I have not brought any pay home. I am  ashamed  to be dependent on my wife for support. A loaf of bread already  costs 670 rubles, 1 kg of meat (in fact, bones), 4,000, and a  container of milk, 720. We skimp on everything. But my son,  Zhenka, is 6 years old. What about him? In the kindergarten  something still comes his way. However, the kindergarten is  being closed--three have already been shut down. They say that  there is nothing with which to feed the children. In our  kindergarten, teachers, as a sign of protest, went on a hunger  strike. A good price for reforms?    "And what is going on at the mine? Not a single sinking or  mining machine was bought last year. Hence the frequency of  accidents. Not long ago, again, someone's hand was torn off.  Statistics know: Two lives, two deaths per 1 million tonnes of  coal."    Vladimir Lyagostin, head man at the Dubrovskaya Mine  (Tulaugol):    "I brought with me as proof a receipt from the accounts  office (payroll). The state personally owes me 335,000 rubles.  Imagine what the amount is for the entire mine and for all  enterprises! It is no accident that many are idle. But then,  where will the country get something for normal life?    "We are still working, although the mine is in a state of  emergency. We have no timber or props. I have not received  working clothes for 2 years. A lunch underground--this is your  problem. I put a piece of lard in my bag--as far as bread is  concerned, you can do without it.    "Recently, I sent my son, Nikolay, off to the army. He will  be fed there. But I feel sorry for my parents, who are old  people--they live in poverty. People no longer have any faith in  the government."    Pavel Sidorov, link leader at the stoping face of the  Chertinskaya Mine (Belovo):    "I have no idea how to feed my family. Money is now lent  only  at interest. I feel as though I am sinking deeper and deeper  into the mud.    "I am also depressed by the fact that warehouses are  overflowing with coal. Doesn't anyone need it? No, the reason is  that railroad workers ask exorbitant rates for transportation.    "Recently, our colleague Viktor Vlasov was injured at  work--he hurt his head badly. He has no money for medication!"    Vasiliy Lupin, head man at the Zapadnaya Kapitalnaya  Mine (Rostovugol):    "Today there is one government and tomorrow, another.  However, all of them now give preference to rogues and to  commercial structures, not to those that are in faces. Not to  those that lay down their lives there so that Russia does not  freeze because of them. People in the White House should finally  realize: They should work for us, not we for them!    "What we have come to! In the face there is no timber, no  nuts, and no bolts. Earned money is not paid. I expected to buy  a refrigerator with my 13th wages, but this is how I was  cheated: The paycheck was stopped, but prices were doubled. I  was left looking like a fool."    The Russian Committee of the Independent Trade Union of Coal  Miners generalized miners' demands and presented them to the  government. There is nothing supernatural in them: to pay off  budget debts to the sector without delay, as well as to help to  exact debts from consumer enterprises. Moreover, they must see  the prospects at least for a year ahead.    The third point: Miners wanted to meet with President B.N.  Yeltsin and head of the government V.S. Chernomyrdin.  <H5>  And From the High Rostrum </H5>   The meeting, although not with the former persons, was held  in a high-rise in Novyy Arbat, in Rosugol. Deputy Premier  Aleksandr Shokhin and Labor Minister Gennadiy Melinyan came to  miners. Of course, Yuriy Malyshev, general director of Rosugol,  was also there.    A. Shokhin informed them about the decision adopted by the  government; first of all, about money.    Plans are made to finance the sector during the first half a  year in the amount of 3.4 trillion rubles; in April, 300 billion  rubles every week.    Furthermore, an interdepartmental commission is being  established for a permanent contact of the government with  miners. Its first task is to propose a program for the sector's  development, including improvement of unpromising mines and  pits. All labor collectives must clearly visualize their  tomorrow. Finally, the government promises to adopt documents  providing for more significant measures of support for the fuel  and energy complex.    Aleksandr Nikolayevich maintained that this package of  measures was intended for the sector's serious stabilization.  However, this was not enough for miners. They demanded  guarantees that tomorrow they would not be left again at the  mercy of fate. They have already been deceived so many times!    "Guarantees are needed?" A. Shokhin asked again. "I am  making  a firm promise: If the government breaks the promises it made, I  will resign!"    And what, did the audience freeze? Did it burst into  applause  or humbly fall silent? Nothing of the sort! Who cares today  about someone's resignation? Will this improve our lives?    That is why miners began to chant:    "Yeltsin! Yeltsin!"    A break was announced. Seemingly, the ministers went to  telephone Boris Nikolayevich. They left.... for good.    An hour later leaders of the Russian Coal Trade Union  appeared at the table. They announced: Yeltsin promised to meet  with miners in May. They proposed that the terms of truce with  the government be accepted temporarily, but, if it violates  them, that an all-Russian miners' strike be started immediately.  They demonstrated their strength--workers' solidarity--very  convincingly.  <H5>  Incidentally </H5>   The picketing of the White House by emissaries of labor  collectives of the nuclear industry began yesterday.</p>

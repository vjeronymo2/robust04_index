The two discussed possibilities to ratify in the Russian  parliament an agreement on mutual legal assistance and a  consular convention, both of which were signed in Lithuania in  1992 and have already been ratified by the Lithuanian parliament.    Lithuanian and Russian officials also exchanged views on the  implementation of a bilateral agreement on the most favored  nation trade status and prospects to expand the Kaliningrad free  economy zone.    Podoprigora said the legal assistance treaty and the  consular  convention will be included among the priority treaties to be  ratified by the Russian lawmakers.</p>

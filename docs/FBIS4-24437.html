			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, May 28 (XINHUA) -- There is a rush among many  people to join the private economy in central China's province  of Hubei.    More and more people from government departments, colleges,  institutions and state-run enterprises are "plunging into the  sea of business", as the Chinese expression for joining the  private economy goes.    By the end of March this year the number of private  enterprises and individually-run firms had reached 95,173,  employing 196,800 people. They have produced a total value of  1.83 billion yuan so far, a 43 percent increase over the same  period of last year.    The Wuhan city government has taken the economic growth in  private sector as an important part of the reform in recent  years. To make it work better, the government has drawn up a  series of regulations and policies, urging government  departments at all levels to turn on the green light for the  registration, land use, personnel recruitment and money raising  of private and individual enterprises.    Now, most of the new private businesses can get their  licences within two or three days.    The development of the private economy not only provides  jobs  for both surplus staff of government departments and the  unemployed, but also makes a great contribution to the  development of the whole local economy.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Evered Bardon to Pounds 44m ACQUISITIONS in the UK and US helped Evered Bardon, the quarrying products group, to a 12.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profit from Pounds 39m to Pounds 43.9m. Although the group's name has been changed since Evered's merger with Bardon two months ago, the 1990 results reflected Evered's performance. Turnover rose by 32 per cent to Pounds 253.1m (Pounds 192.5m), operating profit was some 19 per cent ahead at Pounds 49.9m (Pounds 41.8m) and net interest costs more than doubled to Pounds 6m (Pounds 2.8m). However, earnings suffered from the extra paper issued to make acquisitions, including a 3-for-10 rights issue at 125p per share in September 1989. In spite of a low tax charge, earnings per share fell 15 per cent to 12.7p (15p). Fully taxed, the decline would have been been 21 per cent to 10p. Mr Roy Kettle, deputy chairman, said that acquisitions - mostly early in the year - and capital spending totalled about Pounds 250m last year. The biggest chunk was the Pounds 114m purchase of Civil and Marine (CAM), a UK producer of sand and gravel. It contributed Pounds 10.5m of operating profit and enabled the recovery of Pounds 3.1m in advance corporation tax. CAM had a favourable effect on UK operating margins. Turnover rose 20 per cent to Pounds 139.2m (Pounds 115.6m), while profit increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 25.1m (Pounds 19.5m). Without CAM, the decline would have been just over 25 per cent. In the US, the main newcomers, Millville and Superconcrete in the Maryland/Washington DC area, helped turnover nearly double to Pounds 106.9m (Pounds 55.7m), but lower margins were reflected in a 34 per cent operating profit increase to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 16.3m). Mr Kettle warned of the ill effects on the Maryland business of a state moratorium on road building. The group had two big quarries, but there was only enough work for one. Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said the combined group's workforce had been reduced. A maintained final dividend of 3.66p makes a total of 5.595p (5.46p). In 1990, Bardon's pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 3.9m from Pounds 12.1m for nine months to December 1989 after US losses. Turnover was Pounds 118.3m. COMMENT Evered, which came into the quarrying business through the London and Northern acquisition in 1987, has splashed out a lot of cash, or more particularly paper, to claw its way into the top half dozen aggregates companies, behind the likes of Tarmac, ARC and RMC. With the group barely pausing for breath to make its existing businesses sweat, a disappointing earnings line has been reflected in a near-30 per cent underperformance of the market since last summer. Nearly 100m more shares issued for Bardon, plus a rising tax charge, means that the combined management will have to run hard just to limit the earnings damage. Pre-tax profit is forecast to fall to Pounds 33m-Pounds 35m, giving a prospective p/e of 14 to 15 on yesterday's close of 94p. On anything less than a three-year view, it looks expensive.</p>

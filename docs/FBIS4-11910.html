			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' by Safa' </F> Hijazi in Cairo; date not given; from the "Arabs' Home"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Hijazi] Mr. Faruq al-Shar', Syrian foreign  minister, the Arab League Council's 101st session had the topic  of amending the Arab League Charter on its agenda. Some say  that the Arab situation does not allow this amendment now. When  will the Arab situation allow it?    [Al-Shar'] We in Syria adhere to and insist on rectifying  the  Arab situation. We always say, and I said it in front of the  Arab ministers, that the Arab situation is not in its best  shape, with Arab countries facing serious problems--Iraq,  Algeria, Somalia, southern Sudan. Even Yemeni unity is  threatened with collapse, God forbid, and there is the  possibility of a civil war in Yemen if the unity falters. All  this prompts us to work seriously and earnestly to rectify the  Arab situation and create the right atmosphere for better Arab  relations. This is our objective, anyway, and we must continue  to work to realize it. The Gulf war made things difficult, but  we in Syria believe that we should not consider the Gulf crisis  the end of the world. True, we must study all the negative  consequences of the Gulf war and address them in a positive and  constructive spirit with a view toward remedying the Arab  situation and serving common Arab interests.    [Hijazi] Do you think there is an international collusion to  disarm the Arabs and retain Israel's arsenal? What about the  elimination of the mass destruction weapons from the Middle  East? This was also a topic on the session's agenda.    [Al-Shar'] There are international inclinations, with Israel  behind them, to disarm the Arabs and retain Israel's formidable  arsenal of conventional and nonconventional weapons. You know  that Israel possesses and manufactures all kinds of mass  destruction weapons--nuclear, chemical, and biological. It has  so far refused to subject its nuclear weapons to international  supervision and to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and  the safeguards agreement. Therefore, we believe that 1995 will  see a review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and this  gives the Arabs a chance to adopt a unified position regarding  the renewal of the treaty on the condition that Israel join it.  The Arabs must take a position regarding the renewal of the  treaty if Israel refuses to join it.    [Hijazi] The Arab boycott of Israel was also on the agenda.  What happened?    [Al-Shar'] We held contacts with many Arab foreign ministers  and sensed a unified and firm Arab position; namely, that the  boycott should continue until its causes--the state of war  between the Arabs and Israel and Israel's occupation of Arab  territory--are removed. As long as these causes remain, the  boycott must be maintained. This is a peaceful act and a  legitimate right of self defense against aggression and  occupation. It is strange that we, the Arabs, are asked and  pressured to lift the boycott, which is a legitimate act of self  defense, when no pressure is applied on Israel to end its  illegitimate occupation of the Arab lands. This is not a topic  for discussion; it was not discussed in the meetings. But there  was an item on the agenda concerning a report from the main Arab  Boycott Bureau in Damascus; this is an annual report on the  activity of the bureau and how to strengthen the boycott by  closing the gaps that may appear from time to time. The aim was  not to discuss lifting the boycott. So far, this item has not  been on the agenda with the purpose of lifting the boycott.  There was virtual Arab unanimity not to discuss the subject and  to maintain the boycott.</p>

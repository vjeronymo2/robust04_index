			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. ROHRABACHER  </P> <P> Yet another baby-boom congressman has been exposed as having a tarnished past  ("Story Says Drug Foe Rohrabacher is Ex-User," Oct. 19). Rep. Dana Rohrabacher  (R-Long Beach) claims that he should not be held accountable for his youthful  indiscretions and that his right to privacy should protect him. The story is  relevant because Rohrabacher supports legislation that would deny all Americans  that same right.  </P> <P> He has been able to overcome his past. Will it be so easy for a young person  today to overcome a five-year mandatory prison sentence as a result of the  exact same activity that Rohrabacher claims is so harmless? Get caught and go  to prison; get away with it and go to Congress.  </P> <P> By the way, I'm in favor of abolishing the National Endowment for the Arts.  Unlike Rohrabacher, I value consistency. The federal government should  consistently leave the American people in peace with pocketbooks intact.  </P> <P> JANE HENSON  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

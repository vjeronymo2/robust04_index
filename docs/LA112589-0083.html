			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIAN PANEL TO STUDY TAKING ANOTHER STEP AWAY FROM MOSCOW  </P> <P> Lithuania has taken another step toward breaking away from the Soviet Union by  setting up a commission to study how to restore its statehood, local  journalists said Friday.  </P> <P> The "Parliamentary Commission to Achieve Lithuanian Independence" was formed at  a meeting of the republic's Parliament on Thursday, the journalists said by  telephone from Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.  </P> <P> The move defied Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has said that  secession by republics, although permitted by the Soviet constitution, is  politically out of the question.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt in Lithuania about independence as a goal," a correspondent  with Radio Vilnius said. "The question is how to achieve it."  </P> <P> The commission was charged with preparing a parliamentary program to determine  how best to restore the independent statehood Lithuania enjoyed from 1918 to  1940.  </P></p>

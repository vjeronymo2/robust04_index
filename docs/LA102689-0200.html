			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> ILLINOIS TEACHERS' PENSION FUND BUYS COSTA MESA CENTER  </P> <P> The Illinois teachers' pension fund bought the Costa Mesa Courtyards shopping  center at the corner of Harbor and Newport boulevards for $38.75 million, the  center's manager said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The three-year-old shopping center was sold by BHI-Dover, a Newport Beach  concern which buys and manages shopping centers. The company will stay on to  manage the center.  </P> <P> While other pension funds -- including the California teachers' fund -- have  made some large purchases in Orange County, this is thought to be the first  large purchase in the county by the Teachers' Retirement System of the State of  Illinois.  </P> <P> Unlike many shopping centers of similar size, Courtyards has no single large  anchor tenant like a supermarket or department store. The land there was so  expensive that developers didn't want to give over so much of it to one large  retailer, according to Harold Hofer of BHI-Dover. The developers thought they  could make more money at the busy street corner by building a larger number of  smaller shops.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Health Club Biggest Tenant  </P> <P> So far that strategy appears to have worked. About 95% of the center's 171,000  square feet is leased, BHI-Dover said.  </P> <P> The largest tenant is a health club, with 37,000 square feet, and the  next-largest stores are a drugstore and home furnishings shop, each with 9,000  square feet. A record store, a computer software store and a clothing store are  among the other tenants.  </P> <P> The original developer was Pacific Savings Bank, which began construction in  1985 but sold the new center a year later, before the problem-ridden thrift was  seized by federal regulators. The thrift has its headquarters across the street  in the same Spanish architectural style as the shopping center.  </P> <P> Pension funds once bought only what the real estate industry calls "trophy"  buildings, office towers in big cities and enormous regional malls.  </P> <P> But as competition intensifies for those buildings, the pension funds,  insurance companies and foreign investors are looking farther afield.  </P> <P> BHI-Dover is a joint venture of two Newport Beach concerns, Bonutto Hofer  Investments and Dover Investment Properties. BHI-Dover owns about 20 smaller  shopping centers, most in the Los Angeles area. The largest is a  275,000-square-foot center in Upland.  </P></p>

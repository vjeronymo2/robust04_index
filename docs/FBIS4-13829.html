			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by the political editor: "Jordan Is A Homeland, Not </F> An Eggshell; They Are Threatening Us With The Blockade and  Tomorrow Will Ask Us For More; If We Do Not Resist Now, We Will  Never Resist"]    [Text] Each time, they used to tell us: Our country is  targeted, in terms of its regime, stability, and political  entity. However, we are still the most ancient state in Arab  Asia, according to the modern concept of the state. In a few  years from now, Jordan's political age will be three-quarters of  a century. Archaeologists, moreover, have found in 'Ayn Ghazal a  fine agricultural settlement established around the Amman waters  more than 6,000 years ago.    They used to say Jordan was targeted. We knew our country  was targeted. However, they told us this to instill fear in our  hearts and make us silent. This is because it is natural for  us, when the homeland is in danger, to mobilize the sons of the  homeland to defend its security, stability, and political  entity, rather than be afraid and remain silent.    For years now, the U.S. blockade has been eating away our  country. Before Tawfiq Qa'war [president of the Jordanian  Shipping Agents Association] raised his voice, a colleague of  ours at AL-RA'Y came to us with photos taken by the captain of a  ship that was bound for al-'Aqabah with metal pipes on board.  The photos show clearly how the U.S. Navy was throwing the  pipes into the sea because the "telephone number of the  Jordanian importer on the shipping papers was nor legible." The  captain of the ship, who is a foreigner, gave the pictures to  the press because he was angry and wanted to enrage the public  and show the world the vileness of U.S. force. However, our  government remained silent.    When Tariq Masarwah wrote in AL-RA'Y and when Tawfiq Qa'war  gave a statement to AL-RA'Y on everything that was happening in  the Gulf of Aqaba, we heard many officials say: "Brothers, our  country is targeted, so please let us wisely handle this  question with Washington."    Voices of protest got louder and the "wise handling" of the  affair continued. Christopher then came twice to our country  and he promised that "the subject will be reviewed." At an  Amman hotel, Christopher gave us glad tidings about future  prosperity and affluence once peace is established. When one of  those who attended the dinner -- during which Christopher gave  the glad tidings -- raised the question of the al-'Aqabah  blockade, the eloquent boy said "his government will look at  this issue with compassion". The problem exacerbated and the  measures of the blockade doubled after each promise.    His majesty the king, known for his legendary patience,  discussed the question of the blockade with the U.S. President.  His royal highness the crown prince also raised the question of  the blockade when he visited the United States. They told us:  Let him shake hands with a criminal like Shim'on Peres and we  will ease the burden of Jordan's debts on the economy and we  will lift the blockade of al-'Aqabah. And so we accepted the  image of our decent, respectable prince extend his hand to a  killer for the good of our country. However, nothing happened  and the blockade was tightened and words of caution also  increased, such as: Brothers, there is no need for harsh talk  in the press because our country is targeted.    When things came to a head, his majesty the king summoned  the  ambassadors of the five permanent Security Council member  states. He delivered an unequivocal message: We cannot continue  to participate effectively in the peace process while pressure  and the blockade are continuing against us.    Quickly, those who are "concerned" about Jordan more than  King Husayn started to explain the king's words and once again  gave us their magical sentence: Brothers, our country is  targeted, so let us work quietly. Do you want us to clash with  the United States?    What strange words. The blockade has been in place for more  than two and one-half years and losses have amounted to a  billion dollars. How much longer will the people accept the  seriousness of this quiet, wise approach?    The people do not want to fight America. However, they are  asked to defend their country's interests in the face of the  tyrant. Washington is using pressure to force us to be the next  meal, so as to devour us after the Palestinians. The embargo  against Iraq is a lie. It is no secret that we are with Iraq  and with the Iraqis who are being starved by the embargo, and  with the Iraqis who give us oil, while they are in a situation  which we know very well. Are we exporting to Iraq  Jordanian-made tanks, missiles, and nuclear reactors?    We said to ourselves that the multilateral negotiations on  water issues will be held in Muscat on 17 April, so why don't we  show up, especially since these negotiations, in the absence of  Syria and Lebanon, are no more than an distasteful symposium  used by Israeli media to show Israelis tell lies in an Arab  capital, while killing the Arabs of Palestine on the streets and  in the mosques. Once again, we heard the handy sentence:  Brothers, our country is targeted. We will send a very  low-level observer, not a negotiator, maybe a third secretary at  the embassy.    Washington and Tel Aviv do not want a Jordanian negotiator,  because there are no negotiations. So why don't we declare our  boycott of the multilaterals and deliver a clear threat to  boycott the bilaterals?    Following his majesty's meeting with the five ambassadors in  Amman, Washington expedited the meetings of its subcommittee  that is in charge of the al-'Aqabah blockade. But following the  clever statement that "interpreted the king's words" and  "declared the government's support for it" Washington postponed  the meetings of the subcommittee. It was clear that it would  drag this question to the Muscat meetings to break his majesty's  position.    This week, we have seen viler U.S. and Israeli behavior. The  blockade was tightened. Rabin and Peres have warned our country  because a Hamas statement about the Hadera operation came from  Amman, just as it was issued from London and from every place  where there is a fax machine. U.S. newspapers and news  magazines have started to talk about the smuggling of U.S.  military technology via Jordan and Jordan's import of  sophisticated U.S. monitoring equipment that can pick up U.S.  military contacts in the region.    This indecent, off-color talk is full of ill-concocted lies  that are strangely in harmony with the statements made by those  "concerned" about Jordan in Amman when they say: Brothers, our  country is targeted. Brothers, give us a chance to work out  things quietly, etc.    But how are you going to resolve these problems? Has the  al-'Aqabah blockade been lifted? Do you believe that Hamas is  in Amman when you see with your own eyes that it is in 'Afula,  Gaza, and Hadera? Do we have monitoring equipment that can pick  up the contacts of U.S. fleets and aircraft? If a U.S. firm is  smuggling technology to Iraq, then do you want to keep it from  smuggling in Amman? Why don't the Americans themselves prevent  it?    The problem is that U.S. and Israeli pressures have a  serious  parallel trend on the local scene. This parallel trend attracts  groups in banks, markets, and Amman's velvet salons. Those  people are "concerned" about Jordan, while all of them despise  Jordan's interests, dignity, and Arabism. The measure they  adopt is: The financial market has come to a standstill; real  estate prices are falling; capital is worried, and all such  off-color, vile talk that turns the concept of a homeland into  one of a tourist and a hotel.    We say: When the homeland is targeted, what is required is  to sharpen the people's national will to defend their homeland;  and when Jordan's stability is targeted, then courage, not  cowardice, is the shield of the homeland and the citizen.    When Washington and Tel Aviv threaten our interests and  destiny, then our reaction should be: No. We should not submit  and give in. They are threatening us with the blockade because  they will ask us for more tomorrow. If we do not resist now, we  will not resist tomorrow.    Those who show "concern" laugh when we say: Our people.  They also laugh when we say: Our national will and the dignity  of our country. And if they condescend and reply to us, they  will say without any shame: Brothers, where do you live? Have  you not seen what happens to those who say no? But when we ask  them: Can you tell us what happens to those who say yes, they  turn their faces away.    We say: Our country is not an eggshell. It is a true  homeland that deserves our fighting any party for its good.</p>

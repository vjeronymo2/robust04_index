			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Output at Jaguar jumps by 46% CAR OUTPUT by Jaguar, Ford's luxury cars subsidiary, jumped by 46 per cent in the first half of this year - compared with the corresponding period last year - as recovery continued in some of its main world markets. However the increase, to 14,970 cars from 10,227 cars, reflects the fact that last year the company had extensive lay-offs and short-time working as the recession hit Jaguar's Birmingham plants. So far this year output for the US market, the single most important to Jaguar, has risen 20 per cent, with UK output up 10 per cent. A sales push in Germany, following the launch there of the new V12 saloon, doubled Jaguar's market share in that country in the first five months of this year. But the collapse in Germany's luxury car market - sales of all makes in the first five months were down by 46 per cent - meant Jaguar's sales volume in Germany rose only about 20 per cent. Jaguar said yesterday it believed it was on target to reach 29,000 sales this year.</p>

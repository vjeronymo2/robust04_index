			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of address by President Saddam Husayn to a </F> delegation from the Athens International Conference on  Solidarity With Iraq during a meeting held in Baghdad on 18  January]    [Text] I am pleased to meet you all, starting with the  general who heads the delegation, as well as every member of the  delegation.    I greet you on behalf of the Iraqi people. I also value your  stand and thank you for the difficulties you endured during the  long journey, especially since you had to come by car most of  the way as a result of, as you know, the air embargo imposed on  our country.    I am sure that all the Iraqi people are well aware of what  your stand means. As you also know, one loses many loved ones,  particularly if one is an official and not an ordinary citizen.  We have lost many loved ones but at the same time we have won  many friends. We have won you as well as others who have truly  understood the nature of our stand and why the conflict had  taken place.    We have lost many beloved ones. However, the experience  enabled us to expose some false friends who used to speak about  friendship before the war. The experience also enabled us to  expose on a large scale many of the enemies as their enmity was  not based on a worthy cause and did not stem from a just stand.    I am certain that you know, as I know, many of the details  concerning the real state of affairs. That's why I will not  burden you with a review of the details of what you already  know, or what you could come to know. But I believe it is my  duty and it is your right that I contribute as best as I can to  entrenching the basic pillars of your concept on how to combat  injustice.    Some of those who spoke a few moments ago said that they  are trying to convince the public opinion in their countries to  remove the injustice done to the Iraqi people. Although they  have made large strides when compared with where they started,  they believe they still have much to do to make the public  opinion in their countries understand the situation as they  themselves understand it.    I would like here to comment and say that your work is of  the  constructive type. It achieves advancement. Therefore, do not  expect to gain much at the beginning. The major calls and  missions, including the prophets' missions to communicate God's  message to mankind started with a small group, then spread to  millions, as you know. One of the male or female speakers has  said that the public opinion in Europe has started to comprehend  and has started to become aware of part of the deception  practised against it at the beginning of the incidents, not to  mention the injustice that has befallen Iraq as a result of the  aggresion.    I would like to say the following on this issue: We rejoice  at these positive manifestations you spoke about. However, what  is more important is that the European public opinion not be  deceived once again. If the European and world public opinion  is no longer deceived as it had been deceived by the false U.S.  claims and the claims of the Kuwaiti rulers who oppress the  Kuwaiti people, if the real cause which led to the deception is  known, and if this cause is remedied, then we will all be  satisfied because the blood of the Iraqis would have achieved an  important gain on the human level in terms of making the truth  known to all and exposing the evildoers without their being able  to deceive others for a long period of time.    In any case, what is important is that we pinpoint where the  mistake is and the party responsible for it. But, it is in  mankind's interest that we all cooperate to prevent mistakes.  But, if mistakes are committed, then we all have to do what we  can to minimize their impact as much as possible, particularly  if they have to do with humanitarian issues which directly  affect the individual and his rights.    Some speakers said that they have noticed that many  quarters used to believe that the injustice emanating from this  or that country would last for a long time. But that now they  no longer believe this. They also used to believe that some  would collapse from the blows that were dealt against them. As  of now, they no longer say this and, instead, affirm that Iraq  cannot collapse as a result of the blows it is dealt.    I would like to comment on this by saying the following: We  must pinpoint how the opposition behaves, whether this side is  right or wrong in what it does. This is an essential  requirement of scientific research and analysis. However, what  has more value for us are those who support what is right,  irrespective of their preliminary assessment of whether right  will triumph within a specific period of time, or will only  triumph on the longer term. I believe that your stand is more  sound than any of the stands adopted by the others who approach  matters from a technical point of view. They support wrong when  they believe wrong will triumph, and they support right when  they believe it will triumph. What is important to us, from a  humanitarian and principled standpoint, is that we support right  irrespective of the results -- irrespective of whether right  will triumph or not, from a technical point of view, within a  specific period of time, or whether wrong is defeated or not,  again from a technical point view, along with its defeat on the  ideological level.    As a person from Iraq, and as an official from Iraq, I place  high value on your stand because you supported right  irrespective of the technical results it might attain in its  confrontation with these major blocs with their immense material  potential and because you opted for this honest and sound stand.  Humanity has many worries. This dictates that all of us must  work hard for its sake. However, the most important thing that  will save mankind from the pitfalls into which the leaders drag  it is an honest and frank dialogue among the people and nations,  whether through their popular organizations, or even through  their rulers. Although some rulers speak about dialogue and how  important it is, about democracy and how necessary it is, and  about themselves and the influence they can have on others,  they, in reality, do not like dialogue.    You know, for example, that former U.S. President Bush  mobilized all media organizations to tarnish the image of Iraq.  He wanted to affect the people of Iraq with his propaganda. We  proposed that he directly address the people of Iraq. We also  proposed that we broadcast his address or the debate, which we  proposed to conduct with him, and, at the same time, have the  debate broadcast in America so that the American and Iraqi  people would make their judgment in light of the results of this  debate, its nature, and its components. Our objective was to  help those who stood on the side of justice or against it. He,  however, rejected the proposal. In order to tackle the  embarrassment caused by his rejection, he addressed a brief  message to the people of Iraq that smacked of threat rather than  a spirit of dialogue.    In any case, we should always know how to differentiate  between the democracy that is only a political practice to serve  the interests of the rulers, on one hand, and the democracy that  stems from a principle based on respecting people and their will  and on providing an appropriate atmosphere for this people to  exercise their role in political life, on the other.    I have no doubt, and I know, that rulers in all democratic  countries in the West pay great attention to public opinion in  their countries. Why? This is because public opinion decides  whether or not they will be reelected. However, when certain  rulers believe that public opinion will not affect the results  of elections they ignore public opinion in their countries.  Therefore, if a ruler discovers that there is a journalist, a  newspaper, or a television station that is ready to falsify some  matters to promote his chances of winning -- or to hide a fact  from public opinion so that his chances of winning will increase  and the opportunities to weaken his winning chances will  diminish -- he will not be disturbed. Neither will he say that  such distortion is illegal because this has affected public  opinion. He will not be disturbed by this. In fact, some of  those rulers would work in order to provide such an atmosphere,  given the rule we mentioned earlier with regard to the issue of  elections.    The effects of any problem could be small when this problem  is confined to one country. However, this problem could become  bigger when some rulers, of the kind we spoke about, emerge in  these countries. Despite this, they talk about themselves as  being a country whose democratic approach must be followed by  others, when, at the same time, they deny other peoples the  right to choose their own approach.    Let us take another example you know, from America. You know  that the war would not have broken out and the Security Council  would not have adopted its resolution against Iraq had it not  been for the American decision. Human blood was shed regardless  of its source, whether a Frenchman was killed, an Iraqi was  martyred, or an American was killed. They all were killed  because of this war. False information contributed to making the  war decision. False information was disseminated in America and  the U.S. President and his aides were aware of it. They learned  about the story of a young girl, who was the daughter of a  Kuwaiti official, who was introduced to a film director in  accordance with a special scenario, and who acted falsely when  she cried on television. She told a story in which she said  that she saw Iraqi soldiers taking incubators from Kuwaiti  hospitals to take them to Baghdad. This story was later exposed  and it became clear that the whole thing was fabricated.  However, what happened to those who fabricated this story? This  story was responsible for shedding the blood of many people. It  played a role in making the American public accept the war idea.  Thus, U.S. public opinion was deceived, and as a result of this  deception, it gave in to the American rulers' premeditated  intentions.    So, as peoples, wherever we find an official in charge who  understands the peoples' principles and has faith in human  relations, we must work hard to reach a sound level of human  relations and of relations among peoples and nations.    The prophet says that a Muslim cannot commit adultery. Nor  can a Muslim steal or lie. A Muslim cannot lie. So, when a  Muslim ruler lies then he has lost every legitimate right to be  a ruler. And you know that one of the Ten Commandments is:  "Thou shalt not lie."    I do not want to take much of your time. Although we know  that this is an uncommon opportunity, you are friends and guests  in Iraq, and we should not bore you and or take advantage of  your presence as guests here to explain all our problems to you.    The work you are undertaking is considered great by almighty  God and the people of the world, because you are truly  democratic and because you want others to enjoy what you  yourselves are enjoying. Meanwhile, the others -- those who  speak about democracy and human rights -- kill and slaughter  people and persist in killing and starving them to death.    If we wish, we could become friends with this type of people  overnight. But friendship for those rulers who mobilized their  armies against us means that we should be illiterate, that we  should disrespect our people, and that we should divide our  people's wealth between us and them. They want this wealth to  be personally divided. In other words, they want us to take the  share that they give us so that we put it in the banks of  Switzerland, England, America, or France, leaving our people  hungry. They want us to give them the bigger share. Besides,  they want us to rule in an autocratic way and to tell them that  we accept any decision they make for us.    Isn't this the situation of their friends in the Third  World,  or at least in our region? Do you not know their names?    Such behavior cannot exist among the people of Iraq. The  Iraqi people will not accept a ruler or a leader of this kind.  If facts should be plain and the public should be left to  realize matters as they truly are, then I do not think that the  American people would wish to have such friends. Nor do I think  that the American or the French people, who are known to be an  enlightened people, or the Greek, German, English, and all  European and world peoples would wish to have such friends.    Please convey our greetings on behalf of the Iraqi people to  all those who attended your conference in Athens and told the  truth. Please convey our greetings to all those who asked you to  convey their greetings to the people of Iraq.    I also hope that George Kaloi [name as received] from  Britain  will convey my greetings to the Palestine Club that asked him to  convey its greetings to us. This is what democratic thinking  dictates. A democrat should be honest. It shows respect for  others' opinions to convey the message honestly. If you, Mr.  Kaloi, try to note what the English papers have said, you will  not find a wide favorable response.    You are welcome.</p>

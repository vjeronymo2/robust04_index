			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Arts: Asko Ensemble - The Proms IF YOU schedule a programme of new music at ten on a Thursday night, you get the audience you might expect: this was a Queen Elizabeth Hall concert with the gloom and the boom of a nine-tenths empty Albert Hall around it. There at the middle the Asko Ensemble of Amsterdam were playing brilliantly under the young British conductor Jonathan Nott. Of the four pieces, there were recent chamber concertos, all with the virtuoso soloist being chased and filigreed by musicians of similar skills and intensities. Ligeti's Piano Concerto came off best, perhaps because its fascinations drew the ear into intimacy through all the echoing space. Ligeti has related his astonishing music of the last decade to fractal geometries, and the Piano Concerto supports that connection with its swirling detail, its ceaselessly reinterpreted patterns and its suggestions of things we know: Baroque toccatas, the exultant pulsations of Afro-Caribbean folk music, wan smiles of fading Romantic pathos, brassy jazz. As this performance demonstrated, it is also a comedy' especially for the percussionist, who tails the piano in a manner at once manic and silly, and who brings the whole thing to a sudden stop with a sharp knock on the woodblock. But everyone was on excellent form, from the racing-fingered Roland Pontinen at the piano to the poetic double-bass player. The other mini-concertos both featured the violinist Irvine Arditti. Luca Francesconi's Riti neurali was again music of echoes, but more deliberately so, the work of a Berio pupil in having a soloist who is part Paganini, part folk fiddler playing into the reverberations of a small orchestra. Brian Ferneyhough's Terrain, new last year, lost most from the scale of the place. Mr Arditti's solo line, almost uninterrupted through the 12 minutes of the piece, was full of nimble wonder, but diluted by distance from fervour (the characteristic first marking is 'tense, electrified') into something more like grace, as if the violin were a bird skimming over a landscape of rolling harmonic hills and fizzier things from an octet borrowed from Varese's Octandre. That homage was followed by the bursting, vital reality of Varese in a performance of Integrales which Mr Nott ably heaved and steered without a score through all its splendour, crackling percussion configurations and lonely, finely played oboe melody.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h)(1)(viii) of the final rule requires that felling activity on any slope when rolling or sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable be kept uphill from, or on the same level as, previously felled trees. This provision has been adopted from the proposed standard and the pulpwood logging rules. Various State standards contain similar requirements (Ex. 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;22, 38K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received various comments on this provision (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;12, 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). Several commenters said that OSHA should more clearly define what constitutes sloping terrain (Ex. 5&hyph;16, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). These commenters suggested that the provision be limited to slopes exceeding 25 or 35 percent. They also indicated that mechanical felling in southern states should be excluded because slopes are gentler and shorter than in other regions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The record shows that this provision is necessary to protect employees from being injured by rolling or sliding trees. The WIR survey supports the need for this work practice requirement. According to the WIR survey, nearly three-fifths of the workers who reported injuries said that their accidents occurred on moderately or steeply sloped terrain, and 10 percent of all injured workers blamed the steep terrain for their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report indicated that 20 employees were killed when they were struck by rolling trees or logs (Ex. 4&hyph;61).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has not adopted a precise minimum slope that would trigger this requirement or excempt any region from the requirement, however, the final rule does address the commenters' concerns by limiting this provision to those sloping terrains where rolling or sliding of felled trees is reasonably foreseeable. OSHA is aware that logging work sites are often not completely level, and that many logging sites could be considered to be sloping terrain. Elements other than the mere slope of the terrain also must be considered in determining whether there is a reasonable possibility that the trees could roll or slide. When a given slope does not present the reasonable possibility that felled trees will slide or roll, OSHA agrees that this requirement should not apply. However, when the terrain slopes to the degree that a reasonable employer would believe that sliding or rolling is foreseeable, then this work practice requirement is necessary to protect loggers from being injured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whether a particular terrain slope poses a possibility that trees or logs may slide or roll requires an assessment of the condition of the terrain. All conditions that might contribute to a hazard must be considered (e.g., tree size, weather conditions). For example, when the terrain is either wet or covered with snow or ice, the possibility of trees sliding and rolling is greater and these conditions must be considered in determining whether uphill felling is required. As long as the hazard of sliding or rolling trees exists, felling must be done on the uphill side even if industry practice has been downhill felling, or even if roads have generally been located on the tops of ridges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter said that this provision of the final rule may be counter to some environmental considerations in timber harvest plans which require opposite felling schemes (Ex. 5&hyph;7). However, the commenter has not provided substantive information to support his assertion. OSHA has previously discussed the danger of manual felling operations being conducted in adjacent work areas due to the potential for a felled tree falling into another work area. In light of that the fact that most trees fall down hill when felled, the hazard to employees working below another felling activity exposes those employees to an unacceptable risk of injury or death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one commenter said downhill felling should be permitted because it can reduce the feller's fatigue (Ex. 5&hyph;12). While NIOSH suggests that worker fatigue may be a factor in logging accidents, NIOSH did not recommend downhill felling as being a method to reduce worker fatigue (Ex. 5&hyph;42). Rather, NIOSH said that the employer should reduce worker fatigue and the potential for accidents that results from such fatigue by planning appropriate work schedules. NIOSH suggested that the employer's planning of work schedules should include an evaluation of the amount of heat stress, physical exertion and other factors contributing to fatigue in planning those work schedules. OSHA agrees with NIOSH that planning appropriate work schedules rather than downhill felling would be the appropriate way to reduce worker fatigue without exposing the employee to further hazards and to assure that jobs fit the capabilities of the person. (OSHA is addressing these factors in its rulemaking on ergonomic safety and health management.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

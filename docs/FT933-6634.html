			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Renault and Volvo close to completing deal on merger RENAULT, the French car and truck manufacturer, and Volvo, its Swedish partner, are making progress towards the completion of a merger and should be able to finalise an agreement within weeks, official French sources said yesterday. According to these sources, an agreement is possible before the Frankfurt motor show on September 7 but would depend on the resolution of several outstanding issues. The issues are believed to include the shareholding structure of the two groups and the top management structure. Spokesmen at Renault and Volvo declined to comment on the state of negotiations between the two groups. The two companies, which have steadily deepened their alliance since it was initially forged in 1990, have cross-shareholdings and have set up joint units in areas such as quality control, component purchasing and product planning. The French government has been pressing Renault to step up the process of its merger with Volvo to clear the way for the privatisation of the state-owned car group. France's ambitious privatisation programme, which includes the sale of 21 state-owned groups, is due to be launched this autumn. Motor analysts said Renault and Volvo might comment on the progress of their talks when they announce results this week. In line with other European carmakers, the two groups have suffered from the depressed state of the market. Industry analysts are expecting Renault to report pre-tax profits of about FFr650m (Dollars 110.35m) for the first six months, a sharp fall on the FFr5.44bn achieved in the same period last year. Sales have also fallen sharply, although the company has increased market share. Volvo, meanwhile, is expected today to announce first-half losses after financial items significantly deeper than last year's SKr103m (Dollars 12.79m) deficit, but with a sharp improvement at the operating level. Analysts are also predicting a return to profit over the year as a whole after last year's record SKr4.75bn loss.</p>

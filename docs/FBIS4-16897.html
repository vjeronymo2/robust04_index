			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Chernykh report: "Will Swiss Brood Hen Help Out </F> Siberian Oil Broilers?"]    [Text] Tomsk -- The first international tender for  exploration, prospecting, and development rights to the oil and  gas deposits in Tomsk Oblast is over.    It lasted 18 months, and two contenders came forward just a  day before the offer to tender expired. This despite the fact  that a presentation about the tender had been given in the  United States. There was essentially no choice. The winner was  a consortium of foreign companies, represented by the Swiss firm  of "IMEG Management SA." The contenders had proposed conducting  a full range of work with hydrocarbons over a territory of 2,870  square kilometers.    Just what will the Russian side get in return? If a certain  level of extraction is achieved, the oblast's social support  fund will receive $6 million. The minimum expenditure on the  work over the course of five years is being put at 46 million  [currency unspecified].    There is another side to things as well. Also taking part in  the project will be the "Tomskneft" Joint-Stock Company and the  "Tomskneftegazgeologiya" State Geological Enterprise, both of  which have been in a difficult economic position. This will  allow them to step up their search for hydrocarbons and to  create new jobs.    The comprehensive prospecting for oil and gas on a  contractual basis will make it possible to effectively implement  the oblast's gas program. The Russian side will receive several  hundred million dollars in proceeds from the project as a whole.  And all this through foreign investment, without any spending  by us. The license agreement should be signed by 1 July this  year.    It is also necessary to elaborate the economic basis of the  contract in more detail. Then it may be possible to start  counting our oil "chickens." The results of the first offer to  tender have also shown that foreigners are in no great hurry to  invest in the shaky Russian economy. The hopes that the  tendering commission would be inundated with envelopes bearing  the logos of the big guns of the international oil business were  not at all borne out.</p>

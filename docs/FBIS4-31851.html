			<p>BFN     [Text] The protest action initiated by the Alfa Cartel  Trade Union Confederation, which was joined by the CNSLR-Fratia  [National Confederation of Free Unions in Romania] and the  National Trade Union Bloc [BNS], is still continuing in  Victoriei Square.    Being present among the protesters, Mr. Victor Ciorbea, the  chairman of the CNSLR-Fratia, stated that, quote, further  efforts are being made to organize a second round of  negotiations with the government. Until now those efforts have  failed, so what is left is the meeting scheduled to take place  tomorrow at 1000 [0700 GMT]. However, we still hope we could  meet with the government today, unquote.    At the same time, rallies and marches have been organized in  several towns of the country by the teaching staff of schools.  Also today, in Mures County, all employees of the Mures Wood  Processing Company have gone on strike.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EARTHWATCH;  </P> <P> HEALTHIER WINES;  </P> <P> MORE SMALL WINERIES ARE RELEASING VINTAGES MADE FROM ORGANICALLY GROWN GRAPES.  </P> <P> This week I got to thinking about the popular drinking toast, "To your health."  I'm a fan of California wines and I wondered if pesticides and toxins had found  their way into that area of life. There's good news and bad news -- good about  small California wineries, and just bad news about jug wines.  </P> <P> First, the good news. It seems my favorite winery, Fetzer, will release several  vintages grown from strictly organic grapes -- no pesticide residue -- in a few  months. But there is no need to wait until after New Year's, since the family  of 10 brothers and sisters who make their wines already use methods that  minimize sulfites and other preservatives.  </P> <P> If you must have an absolutely environmentally orthodox New Year's Eve, you can  buy the product of three wineries. Frey, Bell Rose and Briceland are already  releasing vintages from organically grown grapes, but they are hard to find  locally.  </P> <P> Using organically grown grapes is a new approach to winemaking in California  and the public hasn't grown accustomed to the slight taste differential. Such  was the case 20 years ago when many independent wineries such as Fetzer and  Ridge started making non-additive-laced vintages. I used to have to order them  personally from the vineyard and have the cases delivered to my home, until  local wine stores began carrying them. Now, things have improved to the point  where major wine dealers such as Best Buy Wines in Camarillo can stock the  vintages of 200 different California wineries. The little wineries take extra  care in the manufacturing process and do not use as many preservatives.  </P> <P> Use of organically grown grapes is widening in California. Buena Vista will be  competing with Fetzer by late '91 and, according to knowledgeable wine merchant  Tim Coles of Thousand Oaks, in Paso Robles "one of the great wineries of the  world, Chateau Beaucastel, is going into major production of wine from organic  grapes." Coles will sell you a bottle for $12, which is a pretty good price for  a great wine, and you can get a taste of the future of California wines.  </P> <P> Both Glenn Sanders of Best Buy and Coles of Conejo Wine and Provisions are  frequently asked whether or not their wines have artificial preservatives.  Their customers, they said, "should really be asking about whether the grapes  are organic," said Coles. Natural preservatives will form as part of the  fermentation process even with organically grown grapes, and in any case they  dissipate naturally after five years in the bottle. Sanders told me that  brand-name peanut butter has more preservatives than a good California wine.  </P> <P> The problem, according to Earl Mindell, author of "The Vitamin Bible" and  "Unsafe At Any Meal," is that the jug wine manufacturers are not interested in  aging. They fool around with the natural fermentation process by adding sulfur  dioxide, which can cause headaches and allergic reactions.  </P> <P> Mindell lists in precise detail the findings of the Center for Science in the  Public Interest with regard to the preservative content of the major jug wines.  Of course any wine that is inbibed to excess will cause problems, whether there  is sulfur dioxide or not. The particular problem, in fact, is called a  hangover.  </P> <P> In this connection, I want to end by quoting Glenn Sanders, who said that the  most important ingredient in my story "won't be listed on the label of the  bottle."  </P> <P> "What's that?" I asked, and he replied, "The name of the designated driver."  </P> <P> </P> <P> FYI  </P> <P> Wines grown from organic grapes:  </P> <P> * Frey Vineyard, (707) 485-5177  </P> <P> * Bell Rose Vineyard, (707) 433-1637  </P> <P> * Briceland Vineyards, (707) 923-2429.  </P></p>

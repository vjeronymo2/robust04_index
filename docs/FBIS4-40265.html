			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Participants in an international forum,  "Kyrgyzstan is Our Common Home," which is in progress in  Bishkek, are discussing the diversity of problems connected with  the life of the Russian -- or even broader -- the Slavic  diaspora in Kyrgyzstan. The forum was convened at the  initiative and under the patronage of President Akayev.    It is not by chance that Akayev is taking an active part in  all the events of the forum. Last Saturday [11 June] was a  really Russian day in Akayev's life. Apart from his speech at  the opening ceremony and his interested participation in a  roundtable discussion on Russians in Kyrgyzstan, Akayev also  spoke at the opera and ballet house during a solemn evening  devoted to the 195th anniversary of Pushkin.    On the eve of the forum, in a conversation with Mikhail  Romanov, ambassador of Russia to Kyrgyzstan, Akayev noted that  it would have been much better not to exchange reprimands  addressed to each other but to get together and to discuss in  full detail the problems connected with the life of the Russian  and other Slavic peoples in Kyrgyzstan.    The president has done his part to hold a discussion that is  highly useful. First, a large group of the forum's participants  was brought from Moscow to Bishkek at his personal invitation  and on his personal plane--a group that included renowned  political scientists, historians, lawyers, sociologists, former  state figures who worked in Kyrgyzstan, and Russian and foreign  journalists. [passage omitted]    Second, and important, the president provided the right  direction for the discussion in his speech at the opening of the  forum. This speech, in the opinion of the forum's many  participants, was very deep, frank, and intellectually rich, as  well as thought-provoking, analytical, and scientific, and it  was based on facts and arguments rather than on emotions.    Discussing the Republic's economic prospects, Akayev said he  had to be honest with his people and to admit that Kyrgyzstan  would remain at the outskirts of the world economy for a long  time--at least for the next 10 years. The Republic is not able  to maintain its production structure and its infrastructure at  the moment and has been forced to eliminate a number of specific  areas of more or less outdated production and stop them.    Akayev said that Kyrgyzstan does not have any other way out.  The population's living standard is very low. Possibilities to  save on wage payments and on turnover capital attract foreign  investors to us. Nevertheless, the profit of such investments  is reduced to zero because of very low skill and labor  productivity levels. In a nutshell, it is difficult to expect  that the rating of our Republic will sharply increase with  regard to foreign investments in the next 10-15 years. I cannot  avoid speaking about such issues as the impoverishment of our  liberal arts intelligentsia and the reduction of the number of  students, coupled with the decreased quality of training, Akayev  said.    The "Kyrgyzstan is Our Common Home" forum will end on 17  June.</p>

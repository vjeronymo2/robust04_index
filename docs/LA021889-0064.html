			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD TO TAKE SECOND SHOT AT ST. MARY'S  </P> <P> After being bombarded with offense in four games over two weekends against  Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount, the University of San Diego men's basketball  team faced defense-minded St. Mary's College Wednesday in Moraga.  </P> <P> St. Mary's is third in the NCAA in scoring defense and field-goal percentage  defense. The Toreros found out why, shooting just 39% from the field in a 70-45  loss at McKeon Pavilion. The 45 points were the fewest USD had scored this  season.  </P> <P> Tonight at 7:30 p.m. at the USD Sports Center, the Toreros get another shot at  figuring out the Gaels' mixture of zone defenses.  </P> <P> Three years ago, St. Mary's finished 10-17, 3-11 (seventh in the West Coast  Athletic Conference). The following year under new Coach Lynn Nance, the Gaels  were 17-13, 7-7. Last season, they were 19-9, 9-5.  </P> <P> This season, with five senior starters and a good supporting cast, St. Mary's  is 21-3 and 9-2. USD Coach Hank Egan and others say this private school of  2,200 students is headed for the NCAA tournament regardless of its finish in  the WCAC tournament March 4-6.  </P> <P> USD, on the other hand, has lost five games in a row and 12 of 13 for a record  of 6-17, 1-10 in the WCAC.

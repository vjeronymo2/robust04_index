			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel Focus: A Caribbean floating fantasy - Catherine Stott joins 16 nationalities seeking fun in the sun aboard a floating resort / Cruising BRITONS still tend to regard a Caribbean cruise as the ultimate travel fantasy. While many of the 50-odd islands have become relatively expensive since being developed, a ship makes them accessible financially as well as geographically to a broad range of travellers. With more than 40 ships to choose from year-round in the Caribbean, standards have risen. I took a one-week cruise which, in spite of the luxury, cost no more than a week's full board in a middle-of-the-road hotel in the Med. The accommodation could not be faulted, food was available round the clock, and the service was good. The British passengers - mostly young families - had flown to Miami and spent the night in the French-owned Sofitel before being driven to Fort Lauderdale. Most seemed to be first-time cruisers as well as making their first visit to the Caribbean and expectations were high. As 70,000 tons of gleaming ship filled the view from the bus windows, there was a collective gasp. Then silence. Designed by Renzo Piano to resemble 'a dolphin moving through water', Princess Cruises' Crown Princess was launched three years ago. Although it comes into the 'floating resort' category and holds 1,600 passengers, it feels uncrowded even when booked solid, as it was all last year. Inside, it is luxurious; I have been in worse hotels at twice the price. Maximum use is made of space, enhanced by full-length mirrors. My bedroom was light and furnished stylishly with nice fabrics and framed prints. The good-sized bathroom had a power-shower, plus a vacuum loo that sounded like cannon-fire, and there was a vanity unit and separate dressing area with 40 hangers and 20 drawers. Some of the new mega-liners have been described as no more than vulgar floating casinos, but this one was elegant with shops that were glitzy but chic. There were 16 nationalities on board, all determined to have fun. The mix ranged from a 600-strong teetotal religious group from California to the six exuberant Mexicans my sleepless companion spotted entering the whirlpool bath in the middle of the night with a bottle of champagne and a ghetto-blaster, wearing very little. Our table for 10 at dinner in the enormous restaurant was fairly jolly. All the diners were wealthy Americans. Willy, once a Swiss farmer's boy, owned a gold mine in Alaska. Gary was a psychotherapist-cum-novelist from Phoenix; his wife was so twitchy, she must have been a patient. Kelvin from Beverly Hills was chairman of a computer corporation; and Sheldon - well, Sheldon was the real prize. He said: 'I have taken a suite on a cruise ship every year since I became affluent.' Sheldon was honeymooning with his brother's ex-wife. He wore big jewellery and she had big hair. Mario from Ravenna was a heavy-duty Italian tycoon into heavy hand-kissing. His wife spoke no English. Together, we motley 10 ploughed our way nightly through six decent courses of Italian food with an American accent. The wine was rather expensive but the Americans all drank iced tea. Being at sea seemed to have made them amorous. There was more nuzzling than eating. Waking at sunrise on the second day, I saw a flat coral atoll passing my window. It was Eleuthera in the Bahamas, our first port of call where Princess Cruises has set up its own watersports resort on a private beach. Here, we were to unwind and take part in a programme called Adventures Ashore, including a beach barbecue. At 9am, the first tenders left with the pirate-clad crew to set up the beach party. How would they move 1,600 people without chaos? The answer: in 20 minutes and without chaos. After two minutes, my skin was screaming for more sun-block. It was unbelievably hot but almost indecently beautiful under the sea-grape trees and royal palms. On the beach, the Chinese played the Japanese at volleyball and the Italians smooched on loungers. The Mexicans zoomed around the bay in rented speedboats while the British fried, sipped pina colada, and read Jeffrey Archer and Jackie Collins. Aboard, we were spoilt for choice in ways to pass the time. Should we learn bridge or blackjack, or how to fold a napkin into a swan, or scuba diving in the pool? Or join Miss Rhoda Israelove in her seminar on 'How to Protect Your Money?' At night, there was the casino and Broadway-style music shows. With San Juan, Puerto Rico, as the next port of call, the ship's TV relayed endless lectures on where to find the cheapest liquor, gold and diamonds. As we queued to disembark, I got talking with a woman education officer from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, who said she and her companions were delighted with the cruise. 'Where else,' she asked, 'could four single women see so much in such comfort and safety?' Some people had booked 'A hike in the rain forest', hoping to see the creepie-crawlies. I treated myself to a Pounds 30, 30-minute helicopter ride over old San Juan, that 300-year-old Spanish colonial masterpiece. At dinner, the rain forest hikers were glum. 'I'll tell you what happens in the rain forest,' said the psychotherapist. 'It rains. Very hard. And all we saw was one small snail. The best sight was the bus back to the ship.' Sheldon-the-affluent proudly showed off his new and heavy gold bracelet and admitted to being 'a real male jewellery freak'. His brother's ex-wife sported a diamond 'tennis bracelet'. The dress code was 'casual' after a day in port. Mercifully, someone was expelled from the restaurant for going barefoot, another for baring his tattoos via a tank top, but these were the only sartorial indiscretions. 'Formal', when most men wore a white tuxedo, was interpreted liberally. There were lounge suits, sports jackets, even an eccentric in tweed jogging pants whose pony-tail had been dipped in silver. Next came St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands where the red roofs caught the early morning sun prettily. Dolphins escorted us into port, the green and hilly capital of Charlotte Amalie. Time for an adventure, we thought, and booked a Pounds 17 catamaran ride to the island next door - St John, a national state park - just for the joy of watching glorious yachts in full sail and snorkelling on the reef. On our return to St Thomas, we saw a 3ft iguana standing at a bus stop. Our friends who had seen nothing in the rain forest were livid. Waiting to dock at Nassau gave me the chance to ask passengers what they had thought of the cruise. The consensus was that it had delivered even more than it had promised. No criticisms, then? Only, it seemed, that people found the drinks - at Dollars 3 a cocktail - rather expensive. But they had solved that problem by buying bottles of rum, at the same price, in Puerto Rico. Catherine Stott travelled with Princess Cruises. Caribbean cruises on the Crown Princess start from Pounds 895 a person for nine nights in an inside cabin with private facilities, including return flight and a night in a Miami hotel.

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Brussels wins US car tax probe THE governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday agreed to set up an independent disputes panel to examine an EC charge that US car taxes discriminate against European exports. The US said it would accept the decision, which must be taken by consensus. The EC claims that European car manufacturers are paying a disproportionate share of the three taxes - two of which penalise high fuel consumption, while the third is a luxury tax. Brussels says the total revenue of the three taxes levied in 1991 was Dollars 558m (Pounds 362m), of which Dollars 494m fell on European cars. European manufacturers paid 100 per cent of penalties under the corporate average fuel economy (Cafe) law, 80 per cent of the 'gas-guzzler' tax, and 80 per cent of the luxury tax, against a market share of just 4 per cent. The EC argues that Cafe payments in particular discriminate against European luxury car manufacturers since they are based on the sales-weighted average fuel consumption of all models produced. Thus US producers who make cars across a range of sizes, and Japanese producers who manufacture mostly small, fuel-efficient cars, do not incur penalties. The Gatt council failed to reach consensus on a demand by five Latin American banana producers for a panel to examine the EC's new banana import regime, which comes into force on July 1. The producers, whose panel request under expedited procedures was supported by other Latin American countries, the US and Australia, argue that the regime unfairly discriminates against them. However, their request was blocked by the EC, with backing by several Caribbean and African banana producers who will get preferential treatment under the new regime. The Community said it was still willing to search for a negotiated settlement to the long-running dispute. The Gatt council agreed to return to the matter later. Separately, the EC was criticised for failing to settle compensation for countries hurt by its oilseeds subsidy policies, which are not covered by last November's bilateral deal between the EC and the US. There was also renewed criticism of punitive US levies on imported steel.</p>

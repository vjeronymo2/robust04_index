			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / DTI outlines view of Archer material Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has opened up the possibility of publishing the information disclosed to the inspectors in the DTI report on Lord Archer's share orders in Anglia Television. He said there was 'no legal barrier' to publishing the facts surrounding the case given the consent of all those concerned. Mr Alistair Darling, opposition City and financial services spokesman, said all the information provided to the DTI inspectors about the affair should now be made public. But Mr Heseltine stressed that publication of the facts supplied to the inspectors, without their judgment and assessment of these facts, would lead to further media speculation as to why Lord Archer had bought the shares. He added that he did not think that was a responsible exercise of his functions. In a letter to Mr Darling, Mr Heseltine wrote: 'Facts ascertained by inspectors are inevitably the product of information provided by a variety of witnesses, and of the inspectors' analysis, and judgment, on that information. 'I recognise, however, that there would be no legal barrier, given the consent of all concerned, to my publishing all the information provided to the inspectors.' After the DTI report Mr Heseltine decided that no action should be taken against Lord Archer. His wife, Lady Archer, is a director of Anglia Television. Mr Darling said that now Lord Archer was back in the country there was nothing to stop him making a full and frank statement. He added: 'This matter is not going to go away. If there is no satisfactory explanation I will raise the matter on the floor of the Commons when it returns in October.'</p>

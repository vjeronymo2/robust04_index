			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] has called for sending civilian United Nations observers  to the Kurdish areas in Turkey. This would help to protect the  lives of threatened people more efficiently, Deputy Chairperson  Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul told journalists in Bonn on Wednesday  [30 March].    In addition, the Federal Government and the other  governments  of the European Union [EU] should increase pressure on the  Turkish government. The association agreement between the EU  and Turkey is a good means of doing this. The SPD politician  emphasized that foreign policy must not be confined to  "ingratiating oneself" with Turkey.</p>

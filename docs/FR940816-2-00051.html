			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Schering Corporation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action or make final the agreement's proposed order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This matter concerns advertising and promotional practices related to the sale of Fibre Trim, a fiber containing tablet, that were disseminated between 1985 and 1991. These advertisements and promotional materials were disseminated in magazines, newspapers, television, radio, direct mail correspondence and in-store displays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's complaint, issued on September 22, 1989, alleged that Schering's advertisements and promotional materials represented that: (1) Fibre Trim is an effective appetite suppressant, weight loss, weight control or weight maintenance product; (2) Fibre Trim provides the health benefits associated with a fiber-rich diet or a high intake of dietary fiber from food; (3) Fibre Trim is a high fiber supplement; (4) the recommended daily dosage of Fibre Trim provides most of a person's daily requirements of dietary fiber; and (5) the recommended dosage of Fibre Trim provides about 2.35 grams of dietary fiber per serving or about seven grams of dietary fiber per day. The complaint alleged that Schering did not have a reasonable basis for these representations, and that the latter three representations were false. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complaint allegations were tried before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) between January 22 and March 29, 1991. In an opinion dated September 16, 1991, the ALJ upheld the first, second and fifth allegations described above. With respect to the third allegation, the ALJ ruled that Schering's claim that Fibre Trim is a high fiber supplement was false as to the product's weight maintenance dosage, but true as to its weight loss dosage. The ALJ rejected the fourth allegation described above. The ALJ's decision was appealed to the Commission. Subsequently, the parties agreed to the proposed consent order and the appeal was withdrawn from adjudication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order contains provisions which are designed to remedy the advertising violations charged and to prevent Schering from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order prohibits Schering from misrepresenting the amount of fiber or any other nutrient or dietary constituent in Fibre Trim or any other food, food supplement or drug product. Part I also prohibits the misrepresentation of such products as being high, rich, excellent or superior sources of fiber or any other nutrient or dietary constituent. Part I also contains a safe harbor stating that it does not prohibit any representation as to the amount of fiber or any other nutrient or dietary constituent in any product if that representation is specifically permitted in labeling, for the serving size being advertised, by regulations promulgated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pursuant to the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA). The Commission's recently adopted Enforcement Policy Statement on Food Advertising (May 1994) (Food Policy Statement) provides additional guidance on what may constitute a misrepresentation of nutrient content. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part II of the proposed consent order requires Schering to rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence if it makes claims for any food, food supplement or drug product regarding the product's (1) Fiber content or type or the amount or content of any other nutrient or dietary constituent; (2) provision of any health benefit associated with the intake of fiber or any other nutrient or dietary constituent; or (3) provision of any appetite suppressant, weight loss, weight control or weight maintenance benefit. Part II requires that Schering possess and rely on tests, analyses, research, studies, or other evidence conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted by others in the profession or science to yield accurate and reliable results in making the first two categories of claims. For the third (weight loss-related) category of claims, Schering is required to rely upon at least two adequate and well-controlled, double-blinded clinical studies that conform to acceptable designs and protocols and are conducted independently by different persons qualified by training and experience to conduct such studies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part II also contains two safe harbor provisions. First, the proposed order does not prohibit any claims for drugs that are permitted in labeling under an FDA tentative final or final standard, or under an approved new drug application. Second, the proposed order does not prohibit any nutrient content or health benefit claims covered by Part II that are specifically permitted in labeling by FDA regulations under the NLEA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part III requires Schering, when making a fiber content claim for any food, food supplement or drug product, to disclose, clearly, prominently and in close proximity to that claim, the number of grams of dietary fiber contained per serving of the product. If the description of the fiber content of such a product is a term defined by FDA regulations issued pursuant to the NLEA ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``high fiber''), then compliance with those regulations constitutes compliance with Part III and no additional disclosure of the amount of dietary fiber is required under Part III. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The litigation and the negotiation of the settlement of this case occurred prior to the Commission's issuance of its Food Policy Statement. Depending on the nature of the fiber content claim, the disclosure requirement in Part III may not be identical to the provisions of the Commission's Food Policy Statement. For example, Part III covers comparative fiber claims ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``25% more fiber'') for which the Food Policy Statement likely would require additional disclosures, such as the basis for comparison. Part III of the proposed consent order does not explicitly require those additional disclosures. However, the prohibition on misrepresentations of fiber content in Part I of the proposed order and Part II's requirement that such claims be substantiated would require such disclosures as are necessary to prevent a claim from being misleading. Thus, unless such claims adequately adhere to the guidance of the Food Policy Statement, they likely would violate Parts I and II of the proposed order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parts IV, V, VI and VII of the proposed order relate to Schering's obligation to maintain records, distribute the order to its operating divisions responsible for advertising activities, notify the Commission of changes in business or corporate structure and file compliance reports with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way its terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> C.

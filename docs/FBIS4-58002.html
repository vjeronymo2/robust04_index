			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- In Lima today the Cartagena  Agreement Board announced that Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela  have decided to implement the Andean Common External Tariff  (AEC) as of 31 December 1994.    Representatives of the three countries managed to overcome  disagreements of a conceptual and technical nature and undertook  serious commitments in this direction during the meeting held by  the Andean Group Commission, the highest level organ of the  Andean integration process, during the past four days in this  capital.    The commitment is contained in a decision draft, as the  integration mandates are called, proposing a tariff structure  and preferential treatment for Bolivia and Ecuador, as well as  mechanisms for unifying in time the products that are still  unable to fully adopt the AEC by 31 December 1994.    The project also includes a system for the implementation of  agreements reached by Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela in the  automobile sector through a sectorial agreement, and the  commitment to adopt specific variable rights for agricultural  products affected by the variations in international prices.    It also includes strict mechanisms to restore  competitiveness  when one of the member countries is affected by the application  of tariffs other than the AEC after 31 December 1994, according  to a press communique issued by the Cartagena Agreement Board.    According to the communique, the decision draft implements a  measure that consolidates the Customs Union [Union Aduanera] and  establishes clear mechanisms regulating competition between the  member countries.    The Andean Group has established four tariff levels of 5,  10,  15, and 20 percent, depending on the merchandise involved.    Peru is currently under a special regime within the Andean  Group, approved in April, that allows it to temporarily regulate  its trade in the region through bilateral agreements until the  rest of the member countries gradually eliminate the  protectionist tariffs they maintain in various economic fields.    Peru, according to the mentioned system, continues as an  observer at the meetings of the commission designed to discuss  the AEC, and is authorized to maintain tariffs at 15 and 20  percent.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO PAIN, NO GAIN: HOW TO TRADE UP;  </P> <P> BRUSSELS TALKS AFFECT EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY  </P> <P> When it comes to enjoying the fruits of world trade, we Americans always feel  as if we're on the losing end. That doesn't do our psyche or our pocketbooks  much good.  </P> <P> But all that could change. If new international trading laws go into effect,  they would mean more jobs, better wages and perhaps cheaper clothing and other  goods -- big, big trade dividends for everyone.  </P> <P> Such improvements in our standard of living depend in no little measure on what  happens in Brussels over the next two weeks. If negotiators for 105 nations can  hammer out a satisfactory agreement, they will succeed in establishing a new  framework for world trade, unfettered by distorting government subsidies and  other protective trade practices.  </P> <P> At stake for the United States are billions and billions of trade dollars. A  new trade agreement under the GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)  umbrella could add $300 billion, or 5%, to the gross output of the U.S. economy  by the end of this decade, according to a study by the Stern Group, a trade  advisory group. U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills figures liberalization  would result in a $200-billion increase in U.S. exports to Third World  countries over the same period. If government farm subsidies -- which amount to  $250 billion a year worldwide -- are eventually phased out, Washington could  get some budget relief. U.S. farm subsidy dollars could be diverted to  desperately needed domestic programs.  </P> <P> But after four years of trade talks, there's little -- if any -- consensus. The  United States, the European Community, Japan and others all need to get serious  and compromise, especially on farm subsidies. Washington needs to adopt a more  realistic approach to cuts in farm subsidies; the European Community must show  some flexibility, and Japan and South Korea must be willing to modify their  restrictions on rice imports. A new agreement could cover as many as 15 trade  categories, including agriculture, investments, intellectual property rights  and services.  </P> <P> Trade is an increasingly important segment of the U.S. economy. Indeed, the big  and continuing boom in exports has so far helped keep us out of a full-fledged  recession. "The best opportunities for American companies and the American  economy are going to be outside U.S. borders between now and 1995," explained  Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Assn. of Manufacturers.  </P> <P> Sadly, the long-term economic benefits of revamping world trade get lost in the  political rhetoric and maneuvering of the moment. Angry European farmers  showing up by the thousands in their tractors to protest cuts in farm subsidies  is powerful stuff.  </P> <P> Liberalizing trade is sure to cause some hardships. Although new rules, if  approved, will be phased in over a 10-year period, some industries may  nevertheless encounter difficulties adjusting to the new realities. That is to  be expected, but that's a small price to pay for opening up immense new  economic opportunities worldwide.  </P> <P> No pact means no trade dividends for anyone.  </P></p>

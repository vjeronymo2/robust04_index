			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter remarked that the words ``increased to the next higher'' were unclear in the instruction for arteriolar nephrosclerosis following diagnostic code 7507. We agree that this language, which was retained from the prior rating schedule, is ambiguous. The intended effect is to recognize that heart disease or hypertension is more serious when the claimant also has renal disabilities. We have amended the instruction following diagnostic code 7507 to clarify this principle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the diagnostic codes for nephrolithiasis (7508), ureterolithiasis (7510), and stricture of the ureter (7511), a 30 percent evaluation was proposed for recurrent stone formation requiring diet therapy, drug therapy, or frequent surgical therapy. One commenter believed a higher evaluation should be assigned for ``frequent surgical therapy,'' since frequent surgery implies a condition more severe than one controlled through diet or drug therapy. By ``surgical therapy'' we meant to include extraction through a catheter or fragmentation through such means as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. To remove any ambiguity and thus avoid confusion, we have amended the criteria under diagnostic codes 7508, 7510, and 7511 to refer to ``invasive or non-invasive procedures'' rather than ``surgical therapy,'' and we have replaced the term ``frequent'' with the more objective measurement of more than twice per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the words ``multiple urethroperineal'' in the evaluation criteria for fistula of the urethra (7519) were unclear. Once again, we agree that a term retained from the prior rating schedule is vague and potentially confusing. We have added the word ``fistulae'' to indicate that when there are two or more fistulous tracts draining from the perineum a 100 percent evaluation will be assigned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under diagnostic code 7531 (kidney transplants), we originally proposed that a follow-up examination be conducted six months after surgery in the same manner as for malignancies (diagnostic code 7528). Diagnostic code 7531 previously required assignment of a 100 percent evaluation with a prospective reduction two years after surgery. Three commenters stated that a period longer than six months is warranted because of the fragile condition of these patients, the complications of surgery, the side-effects of immunosuppressive therapy, and the risk of transplant rejection. One commenter suggested that a one year period would be reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Considering the possibility of late immunologic, medical, and surgical complications, we believe it is more reasonable to assess residual disability one year after surgery instead of six months. We have therefore amended the NOTE following diagnostic code 7531 to state that a mandatory VA examination will be conducted one year after hospital discharge instead of the six months originally proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A minimum rating of 30 percent was proposed under the diagnostic code for kidney transplant for as long as a patient is on immunosuppressive medication. One commenter stated that almost all persons who have undergone transplant surgery permanently require immunosuppressive medication. Upon further review, VA agrees that it is so seldom that immunosuppressive therapy can be stopped after transplantation, that the proposed exception to the minimum evaluation under diagnostic code 7531 is not necessary. We have deleted that exception from the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter believed that there should be an evaluation level of 30 percent in addition to the 20 percent level proposed under diagnostic code 7532, Renal tubular dysfunctions, since various renal tubular nephropathies may have severe disabling effects. Another commenter suggested that the category of renal tubular dysfunctions was too vague and seemed to embrace a variety of conditions which should be singly listed, and that they often render veterans unemployable due to the combination of treatment and symptoms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Renal tubular disorders include disorders of the proximal nephron function, disorders of function of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and disorders of distal nephron function. We have amended the parenthetical portion of the heading of diagnostic code 7532 to include additional examples of these diseases, which have common characteristics and should therefore be rated under the same criteria to ensure consistency. These conditions generally cause metabolic imbalances which can be adequately treated by replacement therapy; as such, in our judgment, they do not warrant an evaluation greater than 20 percent. They may on occasion, however, result in more severe kidney dysfunction. For that reason we have added an instruction to alternatively rate this disability as renal dysfunction, which will allow evaluations greater than 20 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that in keeping with ``current BVA [Board of Veterans Appeals] policy,'' the diagnostic code for penile deformity with loss of erectile power (7522) should provide a 20 percent evaluation even when erectile power has been restored by means of a penile implant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Pak Dong-chun, the  North Koreanrepresentative in Paris, told LIBERATION yesterday  that his country will view the imposition of "economic or other"  sanctions as a "declaration of war by the United States and  those aligned with it, including France." His statements were  confirmed by the official North Korean radio. "The situation on  the Korean peninsula is at a very negative turning point," Pak  Dong-chun said. He added that his country is "ready for  dialogue, but also for all-out war, and that this is not just a  lot of hot air."    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who began a tour of  Japan and China yesterday to rally support from the two  countries, warned that "there were limits" to South Korea's  "patience." The South Korean Armed Forces were put on a state  of alert on Wednesday.    The annual U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers known as  Team  Spirit -- the holding of which was announced yesterday by Seoul  -- would have "catastrophic" consequences, according to Pak  Dong-chun. "Dialogue is still possible," he explained, "but  first the maneuvers must be canceled." The imposition of UN  sanctions and the actual installation of 160 Patriot antimissile  missiles which Washington decided to station in South Korea  "could lead to North Korea's definitive withdrawal from the  Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons [NPT]."  Pyongyang, which ratified the treaty in January 1992, announced  its withdrawal from the NPT in March 1993, although it suspended  the withdrawal in June, just one day before it was to take  effect.    Yesterday, Russia suggested convening an international  conference to find "a comprehensive settlement" to the crisis.  According to Moscow, this conference will have to bring  together "Russia, China, the United States, Japan, North Korea,  and South Korea, as well as representatives of the UN secretary  general and the IAEA director general."</p>

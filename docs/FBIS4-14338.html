			<p>BFN     [Text] London, April 28, IRNA -- British Government  allegations of Iran's involvement with terrorism and having  connections with the Irish Republican Army (IRA) are "absolutely  unfounded," Iran's Charge D'affaires to London, Gholam Reza  Ansari said Thursday [28 April].    The Islamic Republic has "always condemned terrorism and  never supported such activities in anyway," he told a press  conference after holding talks with Foreign Office Minister,  Douglas Hogg.    Ansari's said London's allegations were to divert public  opinion from Bosnia, ahead of his participation in an  Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) group meeting with  Hogg, which included seven other senior diplomats from Muslim  countries.    The Iranian charge d'affaires was asked to attend the  Foreign  Office just prior to his participation in the OIC meeting, which  criticized the United Nation's indifference to the Bosnian  crisis.    However, on his arrival, he found the Foreign Office  minister  claiming that he was "summoned." Political analysts were both  mystified and surprised at Britain provoking a fresh dispute  with Islamic Iran. The BBC suggested that it could undermine  the already fragile relations between the two countries.    A delegation of London parliamentarians had been hoping this  week to make its first trip to Tehran since the Islamic  revolution in a move to repair relations, which had been  approved by Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd.    Other opinions suggested the smear campaign may be a cover  for the failure of Britain's peace initiative in Northern  Ireland, which appears to have recently ended in deadlock.</p>

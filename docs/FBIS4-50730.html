			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- The development of  ROCSAT-1, Taiwan's first satellite intended for both  communications and scientific research, is expected to begin as  scheduled, an official of the National Science Council (NSC)  said Thursday [19 May].    The NSC signed a contract with the U.S.-based TRW space and  electronics group in mid-April to jointly build and launch the  satellite, said NSC Vice Chairman Hu Ching-piao, who also  supervises operations of the national space program office  (NSPO), the executive agency in charge of the satellite project.  The launch of ROCSAT-1 is scheduled for the end of 1998.    The contract, inked by Hu and Bruce Gerding, vice president  of TRW's civil and international systems division, carries an  important rider stipulating that the contract will become void  if TRW fails to acquire an export license from the U.S.  Government within 60 days.    As technology acquisition is a predominant factor in  international procurements, Hu said, a technology assistance  agreement is integral to the ROCSAT-1 contract. The rider also  mandates that TRW must secure such an agreement from the U.S.  Government to implement the deal. Technology assistance  agreements are required by U.S. companies before they can export  high technologies.    Gerding informed the space program office Thursday that TRW  officials, confident in acquiring both the technology assistance  agreement and an export license in time, will visit Taipei on  Monday and Tuesday to brief the office on progress regarding the  contract, NSPO Deputy Director Jung Kai said.    Once the technology-assistance agreement is secured, Jung  said, the NSPO will send 24 engineers to TRW headquarters in  Redondo Beach, California to participate in the design,  development, manufacture and testing of the satellite, which  carries a price tag of NT$ [New Taiwan dollar] 1.6 billion  (U.S.$59.26 million).    The NSC began the ROCSAT-1 procurement project in December  1993. Four foreign companies, including France's Matra Marconi  -- a group comprising French and Israeli aircraft industries,  Germany's Dornier, France's Alcatel, and TRW submitted bids.    TRW was awarded the contract in April after the NSC  evaluated  the bids, Hu said.    Under a NT$13.6 billion (U.S.$509 million) space program,  Taiwan plans to have three satellites in orbit by 2006.    TRW, a leading space/defense contractor to the U.S.  Government, has developed and launched 175 spacecraft and more  than 500 scientific payloads in the past 35 years, according to  TRW officials.</p>

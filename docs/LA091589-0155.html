			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> NEW CHEF'S EFFORTS MUST VIE WITH VIEW FOR ATTENTION  </P> <P> The new chef at The Towers, Jackson Kenworth, has what you call credentials. He  was trained at La Varenne in Paris, and then polished his skills at Spago with  Wolfgang Puck. He comes to his new job from Citrus in Los Angeles, where he  spent two years as executive chef under owner Michel Richard.  </P> <P> Now, just as he's ready to step out on his own, he faces competition from an  unexpected source: Nature.  </P> <P> Every table in the Towers' ninth-floor dining room affords a magnificent view  of the Laguna Beach coastline. Even the restaurant's decor, with its stunning  Art Deco-style motifs, competes for attention with the kitchen. Any chef  working this room needs to make a big splash. Kenworth does so. But that  doesn't mean that things always go smoothly.  </P> <P> At a recent lunch, for example, one of Kenworth's specialties -- corn soup with  smoked bacon -- was thin and watery, with barely a trace of the smoky flavor  I'd anticipated. Even less impressive was the tepid chicken salad with shiitake  mushrooms. The greens were soggy with dressing, and the toppings had lost their  flavor.  </P> <P> But there were bright spots. The warm short-rib terrine with vegetables and  mustard vinaigrette showed imagination and dexterity. And a special dessert,  frozen chocolate pave in a pool of sauce the chef calls coffee sabayon, was  almost as impressive as the view.  </P> <P> On my next visit to The Towers, five of us arrived for dinner on a quiet  weekday evening, just in time to be treated to a remarkable sunset. It was a  perfect moment; everyone in the restaurant fell silent and just stared off into  eternity. I couldn't help feeling apprehensive for the chef. How do you follow  that act?  </P> <P> Things got off to a good start with a terrific pea soup with mussels (a scant  two), and a velvety lobster bisque that was slightly above average (what it  lacked in intensity it made up for in texture).  </P> <P> Other appetizers weren't as good: A dish of home-cured salmon was notable for  its presentation in bite-sized nubs, but was scarcely interesting. A grilled  shrimp in a delicate herb sauce was somewhat better, but hardly extraordinary.  And a salad of California greens with goat cheese croutons turned up with  ordinary bread croutons that had cheese sitting on top of them like canapes at  a catered office party.  </P> <P> By the time the entrees arrived it had grown completely dark and the chef had  our full attention. But the main courses got mixed reactions. Sea scallops,  light as a mousse, were served with onion sauce and potato risotto (yes, potato  risotto -- Kenworth got the dish from his Citrus repertoire). It was  sensational.  </P> <P> But in another main course, Maine lobster was almost as bad as the scallops  were good. The lobster was rubbery and salty, the morels were barely  reconstituted, and the saffron added nothing but distracting sweetness.  </P> <P> There is a very nice rib-eye steak with bone marrow, however; mine would have  been excellent had it not been for some injudicious overcooking. A lamb rack  with fresh herbs also suffered from too much time on the stove; it came out  medium well instead of medium rare. We also tried roasted duck with honey and  cilantro, which proved to be a big mistake. The flavors were very subtle and  pleasing, but the skin and meat were so fatty no one wanted a second bite.  </P> <P> As for dessert, the pave I was served at lunch is about the only one worth the  effort. Most are commercially produced offerings that the restaurant buys  locally. We tried the opera cake, one of those multilayered affairs with lots  of waxy chocolate, and mango mousse cake, which ran down the plate like a  melted ice cream pie and tasted like a tin can.  </P> <P> Despite the lapses, Kenworth is a talented chef and the Towers is worth a visit  on any beautiful day. Right now, however, he's going to have to settle for  second billing . . . or move to a more circumspect dining room.  </P> <P> The Towers is expensive. Appetizers run from $3.50 to $28, and main courses  start at $19.50. Jackets are required for men after 5:30 p.m.  </P> <P> THE TOWERS  </P> <P> 155 S.

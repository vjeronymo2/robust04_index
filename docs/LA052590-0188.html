			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DAN RATHER 'HERO' IN 2ND GRADE  </P> <P> The memories came rushing back Thursday when CBS anchorman Dan Rather visited  the red-brick elementary school he attended in Houston.  </P> <P> Rather was reunited with Alberta Taylor, 78, the second-grade teacher whom he  credits with teaching him to read.  </P> <P> "You were one of my favorite students," she said. "Every time we read a story  you wanted to be the hero, the prince, the king . . . Now you're the prince of  the news." Rather recalled planting trees in front of the school during an  Arbor Day celebration. "I take more sheer pride in planting those trees than  almost anything else," he said. Rather gave the students a few inspirational  words, urging them to study hard even though he admitted, "I can't tell you I  always did that when I was here."  </P></p>

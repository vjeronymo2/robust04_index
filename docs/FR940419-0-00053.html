			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No changes have been made in the regulations as a result of these comments. Experience in observer programs in other fisheries indicates that arrangements usually can be made for modifications when necessary to accommodate changes in schedules (&sect;685.11(c) (1) and (3)) and delays in departure times or special accommodations for observers (&sect;685.11(d)). It is recognized that vessel operators may want to make rapid turnaround on trips and may not have 72 hours on shore to contact NMFS concerning the next trip. These operators can contact NMFS through a telephone call from their vessels at sea, if necessary, to determine if an observer will be required and to arrange the placement, if necessary. If a vessel's departure is delayed, the operator can telephone NMFS on a toll free line to arrange for a change in schedule with little disruption. NMFS expects that experience in the longline fishery observer program will provide feedback from vessel owners and operators that should result in an effective program with minimal disruption of vessel operations and scheduling. If necessary, changes can be made to operational procedures without requiring changes in the regulations. Finally, one of the two commenters pointed out correctly that the preamble to the proposed rule could be clarified to indicate that: (a) The Council had recommended, and the Secretary had taken, emergency action to close the protected species zone to longline fishing before the Biological Opinion was issued; and (b) the limited success of the voluntary observer program had been due in large part to the limited number of observers available for duty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries NOAA, (AA), has determined that the measures in this rule are consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of E.O. 12866, this rule has been determined to be ``not significant''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. Permit holders or their designated agents will have to notify NMFS at least 72 hours prior to departure on a fishing trip so the RD can determine whether an observer must be taken. If the RD concludes an observer must be taken, the permit holder or designated agent will be so advised and further arrangements will be made, as necessary, concerning details of time and place of embarkation, observer duties, permit holder, vessel operator and crew responsibilities, and related matters. Vessel owners may submit reimbursement claims for certain observer-related costs. The public reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average 5 minutes per call, with all trips covered. About 10 percent of all calls would result in an observer placement, requiring possibly 1 hour to meet with NMFS officials and make observer placement arrangements. This collection is part of a previously approved collection (Southwest Region Logbook Family of Forms, OMB No. 0648&hyph;0214), modification of which was approved by the Office of Management and Budget for the interim final rule. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or on any other aspect of this collection-of-information to the RD (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (0648&hyph;0214), Washington, D.C. 20503 [Attn: NOAA Desk Officer].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action is intended to carry out the requirements of the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement issued by NMFS under section 7 of the ESA on June 10, 1993. These data are necessary to determine the impacts of take on the species and possible measures to reduce or prevent the take in the future. Therefore, this rule is consistent with the ESA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

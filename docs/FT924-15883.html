			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Rouble's sharp fall continues THE Russian rouble dropped sharply again yesterday in interbank trading in Moscow, from the previous record low of 254 to the new low of 309 to the dollar. The latest sharp fall means a drop in the rate for September of nearly Rbs100 - from Rbs210.5 on September 1 to Rbs309 yesterday. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the Russian Central Bank chairman, told the Interfax news agency that the issue of again fixing the rate of the rouble against hard currencies would be 'most actively discussed' with the government in the next month. He blamed expectations of a further rise in inflation following higher fuel and energy prices for the continuing fall in the rouble, and said the bank attempted only limited intervention. The rouble fell yesterday as citizens were for the first time able to collect vouchers with a face value of Rbs10,000 which will entitle them to buy shares in companies soon to be offered for auction. The evidence from Moscow was of a sluggish, almost reluctant response, with a fraction of those planned for collecting their vouchers. Perhaps symbolically, the first commercial bankruptcy in the former Soviet Union was reported yesterday, in the county of Harju in Estonia. The company, Norten, was declared bankrupt by the regional court and its assets seized. The September revolution, Page 22</p>

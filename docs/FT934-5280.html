			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (6): Brent smoothes oil's troubled waters THE EVOLUTION OF OIL MARKETS: TRADING INSTRUMENTS AND THEIR ROLE IN PRICE FORMATION by Joe Roeber Royal Institute of International Affairs, 90 pages, Pounds 12.50 OIL MARKETS AND PRICES by Paul Horsnell and Robert Mabro Oxford University Press, 334 pages, Pounds 39.50 Asked how the oil markets work, most would probably say they were run by the big oil companies and OPEC. That may have been so 10 years ago, but today things are very different. OPEC's grip on oil prices began to slip after the oil shocks of the 1980s and finally gave way in 1985-86 when Saudi Arabia stopped playing the role of 'swing producer'. Since then, open markets have taken over, and oil is now traded like any other commodity with published prices and all the derivative trappings. The markets revolve round a few 'marker' crudes, such as Brent from the North Sea, West Texas Intermediate in the US and Dubai in the Gulf. The market players are a tight-knit - and shrinking - group of large oil companies, Wall Street investment houses and Japanese traders. According to Horsnell and Mabro, 174 traders were identified in the late 1980s, but now the core of those who really matter numbers a mere 15. In the 'wet markets' for actual delivery, oil is traded on the basis of cargoes using a complicated system which anticipates three-day loading slots at some future date in the future. In the dated Brent market, a cargo is traded round the market in a kind of pass-the-parcel, and whoever holds it at the end of the afternoon is 'five o'clocked' and has to buy it. There are wrinkles, like the 'tolerance game' which enables traders to trade on the fact that cargoes may have variations, or tolerances, up to 5 per cent. The evolution of derivative markets such as futures and options, (the 'paper markets') has opened the way for sophisticated trading techniques in which tax minimisation, hedging or pure speculation provide the motivation as much as a simple desire to buy crude oil. The key question, though, is what drives the oil price if it is no longer OPEC? Both books reach the same conclusion: Brent is the key because many OPEC members price off it, and other markets are linked through arbitrage. Politics plays a role, but as Horsnell and Mabro point out, it is anticipation of what OPEC may do rather than what it actually does which influences prices. The markets are far from perfect: they can be manipulated, they lack the ability to trade certain types of crude oil, and the best price information depends on newspaper reporters speaking to the right people at the right time. But both books contain pleas to government to resist the temptation to try and make them better. Readers can choose between these two publications. Roeber has compressed the subject to a handy size, but the result is often dense and heavy going. Anyone with a serious interest in the oil market would do better to invest the time and money in Horsnell and Mabro whose account is both fascinating and scholarly.</p>

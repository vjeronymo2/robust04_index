			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Following the victory of the African National  Congress, ANC, in the all race elections and the dismantling of  apartheid in South Africa, the Islamic Republic of Iran and  South Africa have decided to officially resume diplomatic ties  with effect from 10 May. The decision was announced in a joint  communique which was released on Friday.    The two countries' decision about the resumption of  political  ties, which came following talks between officials of the South  African Foreign Ministry and members of the office protecting  the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in that country,  brings to an end a 15-year-old complete rupture of Iran's ties  with South Africa.    Iran's ties with South Africa were severed following the  victory of the Islamic revolution and in protest against that  country's racist policies.    The Islamic Republic of Iran cut off all economic and  political ties with that country placing on top of its foreign  policy priorities its support for the struggle of the South  African nation for achieving independence.    The long and difficult struggle of the South African nation  has finally brought to an end the more than three-century-old  white domination over that country.    The Islamic Republic of Iran, while welcoming the trend of  return of peace, together with independence and restoration of  the rights of the black majority, considers the recent  developments in South Africa as being to the removal of  obstacles in the way of establishing political and economic ties  with that country and has announced its willingness for the  resumption of full diplomatic ties with South Africa. [passage  as received]    From a political point of view, the recent developments in  South Africa, which have provided the ground for all the races  to have direct and active participation in running the country's  affairs and making political and economic decisions, are  significant in that they can have positive impact and  consequences within the foreign policy and regional framework  for South Africa's future ties with other countries.    In this connection, the resumption of Islamic Republic of  Iran's economic and political ties with South Africa, the  groundwork of which was prepared during Mr. Mandela's visit to  Tehran last January, is an appropriate response to the victory  of the black majority in that country, and is a confirmation of  the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has always and will  continue to support the will of the nations in deciding about  the own fate.    As the rupturing of ties with the South African apartheid  regime 15 years ago and the resumption of ties with South Africa  now indicate, Iran does not have the slightest doubt in making  political decisions in this regard.</p>

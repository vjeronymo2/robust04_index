			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Petra Kelly shot dead by partner, police believe BONN'S political establishment has been shocked by the deaths of Ms Petra Kelly and Mr Gert Bastian, founder figures in Germany's Green party and peace movement in the 1980s. The two were found shot dead at home in Bonn, almost three weeks after they were last seen or spoken to. Police investigators said yesterday that Ms Kelly, 44, co-founder of the Greens and one of its first MPs in 1983, had been shot by Mr Bastian, 69, who had then committed suicide. No message was found. Mr Bastian, a former major-general in the Bundeswehr, was himself a leading figure in the German peace movement, having retired early from the army in 1980 in protest at the deployment of cruise missiles. He was a curious political convert, having once been a member of the right-wing Christian Social Union, latterly belonging to the international organisation 'Generals for Peace'. Both had become alienated from the mainstream of the Greens, disillusioned with its bickering and faction-fighting. The extent to which Ms Kelly and Mr Bastian had withdrawn from the public eye was underlined by the length of time before their partially decomposed bodies were discovered on Monday night. Colleagues in the Green party said Ms Kelly had been depressed by the political situation in Germany, in particular with the attacks on asylum-seekers, and the mood of hostility to foreigners. However, they did not believe depression was enough to explain suicide. She was a product of the anti-Vietnam war movement in the US, where she studied in the 1960s, and brought something of that movement to the founding of the Greens. She was an extrovert and a charismatic speaker, at ease with political leaders, and an important source of encouragement for protest movements in former East Germany.</p>

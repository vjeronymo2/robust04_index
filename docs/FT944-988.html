			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Samsung Electronics may face legal action Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest electronics maker, could face legal action from domestic institutional investors over extraordinary losses from stock sales, reports Reuter from Seoul. Samsung Electronics said it lost Won14.8bn (Dollars 18.3m) after it sold its holding of 20m shares in Samsung General Chemicals, at Won2,600, to Samsung Engineering and Construction and Samsung Aerospace. Domestic institutional investors who had extended investment portfolios in Samsung Electronics in anticipation of higher earnings in 1994 protested against the losses and demanded an immediate shareholders' meeting. In spite of the share-deal losses, Samsung Electronics expects a pre-tax profit of Won1,000bn for 1994, up from Won210.23bn a year ago. The rise is mainly attributable to higher shipments of semiconductors and personal computers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The first round of Croatian-Muslim negotiations on  the peaceful resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict ended  in Vienna late this afternoon. The most important topics were  the cessation of the Croat-Muslim conflict, sending humanitarian  aid, and the problem of territorial settlement between the  Croatian and Muslim communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. An  agreement has been reached that in the next two years Mostar  should be administered by the European Union.    The heads of delegations, [Croatian Foreign Minister] Mate  Granic and [Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister] Haris Silajdzic,  also met peace negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.  Negotiations are to be resumed tomorrow.    A good start in Vienna: a principled readiness for peace,  and  the free dispatch of humanitarian aid to all. At one-hour  tete-a-tete talks held behind closed doors, the envoys for  President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic set the agenda for  the talks, and then all members of the delegations entered the  conference hall in Vienna's Hofburg Palace. The Muslim side  expressed its principled readiness for a complete cease-fire.  This is a preparatory meeting for Geneva, with envoys being in  permanent consultations with Zagreb and Sarajevo.    [Begin Granic recording] We spent most of the time on  cease-fire talks and future Croatian-Muslim relations. [end  recording]    They spoke about the main issues -- securing aid for the  entire population, Croatians and Muslims, securing freedom of  movement for aid convoys. They also discussed the completion of  POW exchanges based on the all-for-all principle, whereby the  Croatians have so far done more. Topic number one was a  cease-fire and the cessation of all hostilities.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Has a step  been made toward peace, in central Bosnia for instance?    [Silajdzic] We will continue to discuss that issue tomorrow.  You must understand that in light of our past experience, I  speak with slight reservations about global and final solutions.  I can tell you that my impression is that there is a great deal  of goodwill on both sides and that is a good start.    [Correspondent] The issue of sea access was raised and will  continue to be discussed. Croatia's positions on this issue are  firm. Reference is being made to the lines of demarcation within  a union of the Bosnia-Herzegovina republics.    [Granic] Some progress has been made with regard to  humanitarian issues. Talks about all other issues will resume  tomorrow.    [Correspondent] The atmosphere at the talks reflects the  difficult situation in the field, where Muslims cannot benefit  any further from continuing their war against the Croats.  Although all issues were touched upon today, a general  agreement is no nearer.    [Granic] This is a preparatory meeting before Geneva, even  much more in view of the situation in central Bosnia.    [Silajdzic] The atmosphere can be described as constructive.  Today we discussed humanitarian convoys, and I think we agreed  to hold a meeting shortly to agree on continuing sending fresh  convoys, desperately awaited by the population of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We also discussed Mostar. We, of course, agreed that the  European Union would administer Mostar over two years or even  less, depending on what we agree. I can also say that I am very  pleased with the fact that both sides accept the idea of Mostar  for the people of Mostar [Mostar Mostarcima], in other words the  return of all the people of Mostar to their town. [end  recording]    Croatians accept this idea of Mostar's status, providing it  implies the departure of those who are not from Mostar, who came  from elsewhere, of Muslim newcomers. Negotiations in Vienna are  continuing.</p>

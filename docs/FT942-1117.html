			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: The Telegraph's sharp decline Telegraph shareholders have seen the value of their holdings decline by almost half from their peak last month, as the newspaper this week entered a price war with The Times, cutting its daily cover price to 30p. The Times responded with a cut to 20p. Other newspaper groups' shares also suffered. The Stock Exchange has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Telegraph's price cut. Hollinger, the Canadian publishing company controlled by Telegraph proprietor Conrad Black sold Pounds 73m-worth of shares a month ago, when the share price was 587p. Hollinger now owns 57 per cent of The Telegraph, down from 66 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW MUCH LONGER CAN HE STEM THE TIDE?;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: AS THE SPECTER OF CIVIL WAR HAUNTS HIS COUNTRY, GORBACHEV IS PUT  TO HIS BIGGEST TEST. HE IS LOSING, AND MOSCOW IS LOSING, AUTHORITY THROUGHOUT  THE VAST REALM.  </P> <P> "In the Soviet Union today the optimists study English, the pessimists study  Chinese and the new realists study the Kalashnikov."  </P> <P> That grim joke, which I heard in Moscow last week, reflects a growing pessimism  among many Soviet citizens. It is one of a number of signs of the specter of  civil war that is haunting the Soviet Union -- and not only in its southern  republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia, where the danger of uncontrollable  violence is more immediate.  </P> <P> There is a growing demand in Moscow for the imposition of martial law in  Azerbaijan, even though Mikhail Gorbachev has ruled out the use of force  against the peaceful nationalist movements in the Baltic republics. That latter  position has not gone unchallenged within the Communist Party Central  Committee. If the Lithuanians were to go so far as to declare unilaterally that  they had become an independent state, there is no guarantee that those in  Moscow who favor restraint would continue to prevail.  </P> <P> The danger for the peoples of the Baltic republics -- and for Gorbachev --  could increase if unrest gets further out of hand in the Caucasus and  elsewhere. It would fuel a growing sense of crisis, a concern among party  conservatives and the military in particular that the Soviet Union is  disintegrating and descending into anarchy. The same fear is increasingly being  expressed by ordinary Russian citizens, whose dissatisfaction with the grim  economic situation is also growing.  </P> <P> Respect for Gorbachev remains high among the best-informed Soviet citizens --  in a large section of the intelligentsia and especially among those who work in  research institutes dealing with the humanities, social sciences and  international affairs. But his popularity has taken a serious tumble at a  man-on-the-street level as well as within the powerful bureaucratic structures  of the party and state.  </P> <P> But even those who regard Gorbachev as the best Soviet leader available have  come to wonder whether he has much chance of stemming a tide of events  threatening to get out of control. If reason, dialogue and appeals for patience  fail, there will be insistent demands for a return to more traditional methods  of imposing control over a country that, it will be argued, is otherwise  ungovernable.  </P> <P> Not only Gorbachev but the Communist Party as a whole -- indeed, the party more  than Gorbachev -- is losing authority in the Soviet Union. But in a country  with little or no tradition of democratic government, it would be facile to  assume that a multiparty system would offer a speedy solution to the major  political problems, not to speak of the economic ones. For the time being, the  best hope for reform is the continuation of the informal alliance between  Gorbachev and his reformist allies in the upper echelons of the party, on the  one hand, and the intelligentsia (both party and non-party members) on the  other.  </P> <P> Even that alliance is being challenged by a rising Russian nationalism. It  could be put under further strain by workers' strikes if material conditions  are no better this summer than they were in the summer past, when the Soviet  Union was given its first foretaste of large-scale industrial unrest. To  forestall that, and to buy time, the Soviet leadership has significantly  increased import orders for consumer goods, an emergency tactic that Gorbachev  rejected two years ago.  </P> <P> A party congress originally scheduled for February, 1991, is due to be held  this October. But now there are demands from both wings of the Communist Party  -- reformist and conservative -- for the date to be advanced still further. It  is likely that when a crucial plenary session of the Central Committee takes  place later this month, that issue will be one of the items on the agenda. Both  "right" and "left" of the party are afraid that time is working against them,  and that at least gives Gorbachev some room to maneuver.  </P> <P> So far he has used every setback as a device for introducing more far-reaching  political reforms. It is probable that this year will see Gorbachev concede a  de facto federalization of the party (even though he may not wish to call it  that) and to accept in principle a substantial devolution of power to the  republics. The more radical reformers in Moscow's research institutes are  suggesting that everything except defense and major foreign policy be handed  over; they do not even exclude a limited foreign-policy role for the republics.  </P> <P> It remains to be seen if Gorbachev will go that far and whether even such  dramatic concessions would satisfy the Baltic republics in particular. They  would not, in any event, provide an answer to the ethnic dispute between  Armenians and Azeris, since part of the problem there is lack of agreement on  their territorial republican boundaries.  </P> <P> Although problems are mounting faster than their solutions in today's Soviet  Union, it is too early to write Gorbachev off, as many Western commentators are  now doing. Though this month's Central Committee meeting will be perhaps the  most difficult he has ever faced, he is likely to survive it with his  leadership functions intact. Beyond that, he will be faced with the need to  combine immediate crisis-management with longer-term measures of reform. To  call it a dauntingly difficult task is an understatement. But I see no other  Soviet leader on the horizon who would be likely to do it better.  </P></p>

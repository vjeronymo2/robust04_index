			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Nearly all Seoul dailies disapproved of  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's remarks during his 20 May  meeting with Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh. The 22 May papers  all mentioned the portion of Han's speech that brought heavy  criticism. Except for HANGYORE SINMUN, all the dailies were  angry over Han's statement that "regretably, there had been a  period of wounding between Korea and Vietnam..." The papers  called this "irresponsible words by a responsible official."  CHOSON ILBO, in its editorial called this one of several  blunders Han has made since his appointment and urged him to  "rein in his tongue." HANGUK ILBO expressed its disapproval:  "The Vietnamese government has not asked for an apology; our  government has no policy of apologizing for participating in the  Vietnam War; why did Han apologize?"       Both CHOSON ILBO and HANGUK ILBO pointed out that "the  Vietnam War was a war between the free and the communist worlds  during the cold-war era and our role was part of a mission  trying to maintain regional security and protect freedom. We  need make no apologies or excuses for our part. HANGUK ILBO  asked rhetorically: "Did the Chinese apologize for fighting  against us during the Korean War?." According to the CHOSON  ILBO, Han should know better than anyone that the United States  and Vietnam are negotiating to establish diplomatic relations  and that the subject of the Vietnam War is on the agenda, thus  it was not an issue in which South Korea should be involved.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' [MOFA] spokesperson tried to  represent the issue as a "mere diplomatic gesture" and urged the  media not to read into Han's statement what is not there. The  media was not satisfied: HANGUK ILBO demanded "how can a  diplomat make a speech without the support of government  policy?", adding that Han's speech was an "insult to our many  soldiers who gave their lives as well as to the surviving  veterans" of the war.    While most Seoul dailies protested Han's comments, HANGYORE  SINMUN carried an article on pages 1 and 3 praising Han's  remarks as a "step towards national diplomatic maturity" while  saying that they "did not amount to an official apology." In  reality, the paper claimed, Han had acknowledged "our  involvement in an `unjust war'". The paper said Han's statement  to the Vietnamese "improved our diplomatic position a notch"  relative to the Chinese and Japanese. HANGUK ILBO and CHOSON  ILBO reported that MOFA, however, cautioned the media not to  compare Han's statement in Vietnam with Japan's apology to  Korea.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN NEWS: JAPANESE STONE BASINS ARE FOR HAND-WASHING;  </P> <P> YOU CAN FIND REASONABLY PRICED CONCRETE IMITATIONS IN LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> At least one of those huge containers being offloaded by giant cranes at the  Port of Los Angeles was full of Tsukubai instead of Toyotas.  </P> <P> Tsukubai is the traditional stone basin used to wash one's hands before a tea  ceremony in Japan, or to wash one's hands while weeding -- a more modern use.  </P> <P> You can find reasonably priced concrete imitations in Los Angeles or buy the  real rock-solid, granite basins imported by George Yamaguchi. They cost from  about $300 for the low kinds that require some stooping (considered humble and  worthy) to $1,000 for an extremely handsome tall one that requires no humility  at all. Considering what they weight (George is not sure, but they can be put  in the trunk of the car), the price per pound is pretty good.  </P> <P> There are basins that look like natural boulders, basins shaped like an old  Chinese coin, basins shaped like a chrysanthemum flower and basins that are  simply round and elegant.  </P> <P> For those who want to use tsukubai in a traditional Japanese setting, the book,  "A Japanese Touch for Your Garden," by Kiyoshi Seike and Masanobu Kudo  (Kodansha International; Tokyo and New York) explains the rules for positioning  them next to a "sea" of gravel or small stones, with a large flat stone for  standing on and two smaller flat stones to hold other objects while washing.  The authors even give the traditionally proper dimensions and spacings.  </P> <P> Yamaguchi has also imported 40,000 pounds worth of solid granite lanterns from  the small path-side Oki-gata, to the towering Tachi-gata, for those looking for  a traditional Japanese touch in night lighting. All are available at Yamaguchi  Bonsai Nursery, 1905 Sawtelle Ave. in West Los Angeles, 213/473-5444. Robert  Smaus  </P></p>

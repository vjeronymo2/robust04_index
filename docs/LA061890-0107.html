Final  </P> <P> CUBA SUGAR CROP TOPS HOPES AT 8 MILLION TONS  </P> <P> Cuba surprised international analysts today by announcing a  higher-than-expected 1989-90 sugar production figure of just over 8 million  tons after a harvest marked by bad weather and technical problems.  </P> <P> Granma, the official Communist Party newspaper, described the 8.04-million-ton  crop as a "real labor achievement by our workers." Sugar is the traditional  mainstay of the Cuban economy, and the island is the world's biggest exporter.  </P></p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Keating plays for make or break: Kevin Brown assesses the Australian PM's economic statement MR PAUL Keating, the Australian prime minister, was in buoyant form in parliament yesterday as he delivered an economic statement which, on his own admission, will make or break his government. For the first time since December, when he defeated Mr Bob Hawke in a bitter battle for the Labor leadership, Mr Keating showed the fighting spirit which won him the job. Throwing caution to the wind, he unveiled a wide-ranging package which he claimed would boost growth in gross domestic product from zero this year to nearly 5 per cent in 1992-93. In typical Keating style, the package offers ADollars 8.6bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in personal tax cuts from 1994, showing that it is aimed not only at resuscitating Labor's fading hopes of winning the next election in 1993, but at laying the groundwork for a further win in 1996. Roars of support from Labor's back benches showed that Mr Keating had achieved his first objective - to heal the wounds of the leadership battle and unify the divided party around his leadership. Early reactions from outside parliament also suggested that the statement had succeeded in generating hope of relief from the recession which has battered the economy for the last two years. However, the prime minister knows that he will have to do much more if he is to close a yawning opinion poll gap between Labor and the opposition Liberal/National Party coalition before July 1993, the last possible date for the election. What is most important, he must convince the financial markets and overseas investors that the statement is not, as some economists fear, a pro-cyclical stimulus which will overheat the economy. Over the longer term, he will also need to convince the electorate that the statement contains a vision for Australia's future which builds on the more open society Labor has created since the party returned to power in 1983. The key element of the statement is a ADollars 2.3bn injection of public money into the economy over the next 16 months in an attempt to promote business activity and pull down the unemployment rate from 10.3 per cent. Much of the injection will come in the form of badly needed infrastructure spending on inefficient roads, railways, airport facilities and a major expansion of vocational training. However, the biggest headlines will probably be generated by a one-off payment of ADollars 300m to consumers through the family allowance system, combined with a cut in the price of new cars. The initiatives are intended to give an immediate fillip to the economy, but critics said they looked suspiciously like a pay-off to families hit by the recession Mr Keating once promised would never happen. If the strategy works, the government calculates that GDP will recover from stagnation in the current year to 4.75 per cent in 1992-93, which it hopes will reduce unemployment to 9.5 per cent. The strain would be taken by the federal government budget deficit, which would increase from a projected ADollars 6.8bn this year to ADollars 8bn; the current account deficit, forecast to rise from 3.75 cent of GDP to 4.25 per cent; and inflation, forecast to rise from 1.5 per cent to 4 per cent. Much will depend on the reliability of the Treasury forecasters, who have generally painted a woefully inaccurate picture of the economy over the past two years. The opposition was already claiming last night that many of the assumptions in the statement were over-optimistic. The government is also laying great stress on a renewed deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which has pledged to restrain pay claims to a level which would keep inflation in line with Australia's main trading partners. Mr Keating, a close political associate of Mr Bill Kelty, the ACTU secretary, was confident that the unions would keep their part of the bargain, in spite of pressure from rank-and-file members for real increases in wages after several years of restraint. However, the government is also proposing to restructure the industrial relations system to encourage workplace bargaining, which will increase the difficulty of maintaining central control over wage outcomes. In the longer term, Mr Keating promises cuts in personal taxes worth ADollars 3.4bn in 1994-95 and ADollars 5.2bn in 1995-96, together with a package of measures designed to increase private sector investment. These include provisions for accelerated depreciation, tax-free bonds for infrastructure projects, fast tracking of environmental and Aboriginal heritage planning procedures for the mining industry, and more generous tax treatment of bad debt provisions to encourage banks to allow businesses to trade through their problems. Public sector infrastructure investment will include the establishment of a Brisbane-to-Perth standard-gauge railway link, upgrading of several East Coast highways, and common-user terminals at several overcrowded airports. The statement also sets out to increase the efficiency of the economy by relaxing restrictions on foreign investment, completing the deregulation of the aviation market, and allowing more foreign banks to enter Australia. The statement says the package will stimulate average GDP growth of 4 per cent in the next four years, cutting unemployment to 7.75 per cent by mid-1996, when inflation and the current account deficit are forecast to decline. However, economists said the longer-term projections were little more than guesswork based on the hope that imports would not increase in line with exports. Some said it was hard to understand the government's contention that the budget finances will be transformed from a deficit of ADollars 8bn next year to a surplus of ADollars 2bn in 1995-96.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                     AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC STATEMENT  -------------------------------------------------------------------- KEY ANNOUNCEMENTS                COST (ADollars m)         PERIOD  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Rail                                    498               2 years Roads                                   600               2 years National electricity grid               100 Accelerated depreciation                490               3 years Infrastructure bonds                     50 Personal tax cuts                      3400            in 1994-95                                        5200            in 1995-96 Financial help for farmers               19 Vocational education                    720               3 years Employment programmes                   100  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

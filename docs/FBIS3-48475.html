			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Junji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Policy  Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, who led a fact-finding team to  former Yugoslavia, has said the dispatch of Japan's military  observers to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) deployed in  Macedonia is "worth a study" and his remark is now causing a  ripple within the government. So far, the government has  persistently taken the view that it is difficult for Japan to  cooperate with the UN Peaecekeeping Operations (PKO) in former  Yugoslavia. The government has unequivocally explained that it  has not sent the fact-finding team to study the possibility of  dispatching Japan's military observers, (says a senior Foreign  Ministry official). Raising questions about Mr. Yanai's real  intentions, a top government official has said, "We need to pay  attention to him." The same government official also has become  cautious regarding the Foreign Ministry's "initiative."    Yasushi Akashi, special representative of the UN Secretary  General, who is in charge of UN affairs in former Yugoslavia,  has expressed the hope that Japan will send its military  observers to the UNPROFOR in Macedonia since assuming his post.  At a meeting with Mr. Yanai on 8 January, Mr. Akashi said, "I  hope Japan will explore the possibility of cooperating with the  UNPROFOR."    The UNPROFOR is a new form of the PKO which is being tested  in Macedonia. The PKO Cooperation Law in Japan does not envision  Japan's participation in the UNPROFOR and the Foreign Ministry  has indicated it would be "difficult for Japan to dispatch its  military observers to the UNPROFOR," (says a top government  official).    The government is baffled by Mr. Yanai's remark in view of  this background. Defense Agency Vice Minister Shigeru  Hatakeyama told a news conference on 17 January that "I do not  think that Japan can send the military observers to Macedonia  under the present legal system." It is true, however, that  complaints are rising within the Foreign Ministry that  "political constraints are standing in the way of fully using  the PKO Cooperation Law," (says a senior Foreign Ministry  official). Many officials in the Foreign Ministry, which has  promoted Japan's cooperation with the PKO with an eye on Japan's  seat on the UN Security Council, think that discussion on  whether to send the military observers to former Yugoslavia  should be continued. Mr. Yanai's remark is taken as a reflection  of that mood in the Foreign Ministry and as an attempt to create  a stir in the government and among the people.    The same top government official revealed on 17 January his  distrust in the Foreign Ministry's "way of handing things,"  citing the fact that the government's decision to "postpone"  sending Self- Defense Forces personnel to Mozambique for the PKO  was reversed after the Foreign Ministry's fact-finding team  returned home.    It is certain that once a high-ranking Japanese Government  official speaks of a "study," his remark leads the United  Nations, European nations, and other nations concerned to pin  high hopes on Japan. Administrative Vice Foreign Minister  Kunihiko Saito has said, "Mr. Yanai's duties were not to make a  judgment, but to undertake a survey." Hence, Mr. Yanai may come  under criticism for making a rash remark.</p>

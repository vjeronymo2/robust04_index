			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Stephen Alderman, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary staff] </F>   [Text] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today rejected  Opposition demands for more United Nations troops to be sent to  war-torn Rwanda. Labour Foreign Affairs Spokesman Dr Kim  Howells said 100,000 people had been slaughtered in the Central  African country in the past two weeks. He asked why Britain had  approved a UN decision to reduce peace-keeping troops there from  2,700 to 270. "Is there one level of compassion for our  European friends in Bosnia and another for black Africans?"    Brian Donohoe, Labour MP for Cunninghame South, protested  the  UN security force in Rwanda was doing "absolutely nothing." He  demanded: "When is the Government going to put pressure on the  UN to bring back the troops to safeguard the lives of those that  are being slaughtered in that country today?"    Mr Hurd replied: "I am not sure how either of you suppose  that maintaining a UN force at the original scale is going to  help assuage these horrors."    The UN Security Council had concluded it was no longer  possible for the UN force to carry out its mandate, he said.  "I assure you there is no magic in keeping troops there, if  there is not something useful which they can do."</p>

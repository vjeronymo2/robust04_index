			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Output of cars rises by 14.4% THE sharp contrast between the severely depressed UK market for new cars and the British car industry's production levels was emphasised yesterday by statistics showing that car output rose by 14.4 per cent in September compared with the same month a year before. The September output figures, which included a 25.39 per cent jump in production for export, lifted total car production for the first nine months of this year to 962,155 - 1.88 per cent ahead of the 944,382 produced in the same period of last year. The statistics, published jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office, showed total car production in September at 103,738 compared with 90,613 in the same month a year before. Production for the UK market, at 42,932, was virtually unchanged from last year's level of 42,120. The SMMT, in a thinly veiled disagreement with the Treasury yesterday, pointed out that September's statistics more than compensated for a 7.75 per cent drop in car output in August. The Treasury, commenting on 'obviously disappointing' output for industry in August, had said the sharp drop experienced had been 'more than accounted for' by lower car production.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Japan's gift to executive stress: the pocket-size resignation DIRECTORS of Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment and camera maker, have been ordered to bring letters of resignation to work each morning - as a reminder that they are personally responsible for hauling the company out of loss. Mr Hiroshi Hamada, Ricoh's president, told the 23 directors, each of whom is directly responsible for a business division, to 'have a resignation letter in your shirt pocket'. He warned that he wanted to promote younger managers, and hinted that resignations could become effective at any time if the company's performance did not improve. The Ricoh resignation method is one of the more dramatic responses to plunging profits at Japanese companies, which have been shaken by a slowing domestic economy. Ricoh said yesterday that most of the directors had already drafted their resignation letters, and some had submitted them to Mr Hamada. His order came after Ricoh announced that it would report a Y5.8bn (Pounds 25m) pre-tax loss for the year to March 31, the first loss since the company was listed in 1949. Ricoh said the resignation threat should be seen as 'not merely ceremony', as is generally the case with executive resignations in Japan. At the height of the stock scandals last year, the president and chairman of Nomura Securities resigned to take responsibility for the shame brought on the company. 'The resignations show our sincerity. They indicate our responsibility to our shareholders, customers, and our employees,' Ricoh said. Ricoh, like Sony Corporation, is regarded as a maverick in Japanese industry, having risen outside the powerful corporate families known as keiretsu. These companies, guided by often charismatic executives, have cultivated strong corporate cultures and sometimes employ unorthodox methods in crisis control. However, Sony, which expected to report a Y20bn loss, said yesterday that it would not start a 'resignation movement'. Mr Hamada is fond of philosophy and likes to remind listeners of 'The Spirit of the Three Loves', the company's guiding principles of: 'Love Your Neighbour, Love Your Country, and Love Your Work.' In a recent speech, he explained that he liked executives to 'own' their problems. By drafting resignation letters, he had forced the directors to stake their future on the company's recovery.</p>

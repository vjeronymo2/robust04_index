			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOURMANDS NOT AFRAID TO LEI IT ON THICK AT LUAU IN LAGUNA NIGUEL  </P> <P> Forget about plastic leis, mai tais in paper cups, and slabs of pork -- the  usual scene at luaus on this side of the Pacific.  </P> <P> For members of the Laguna Niguel chapter of Chaine des Rotisseurs -- an  international society devoted to the joy of savoring fine food and wine -- it  was a necklace of orchids, mai tais in shaved coconuts, and dainty servings of  squab at Hotel Laguna on Sunday night.  </P> <P> For openers, guests -- including Hotel Laguna owner Claes Andersen and his  wife, Georgia -- nibbled on salmon rolls, mushroom caps stuffed with shrimp  mousse, and scallops. After guests watched a golden sun drown in an opalescent  sea, they gathered at the hotel's central patio, complete with gushing fountain  and palm-smothered gazebo (which housed a dreamy-sounding Hawaiian band). Here,  they dug into a feast so elegant that they began to speak in hushed tones.  Nobody wanted to distract from the perfection of it all.  </P> <P> Up for savoring: camphor-wood barbecued squab and white miso soup accompanied  by a William Hill Reserve '88 (Take notes -- this group knows its wines); lamb  steak with pine nuts offered with a Clos de Bois, Marlstone '86; spinach  cucumber salad with selected caviars served up with Clos de la Roche '83; and  almond mousse in a Florentine cookie basket presented with Penfolds Grandfather  Port or a Late Harvest '85 Riesling by Kendall Jackson.  </P> <P> Among guests was Ritz-Carlton general manager Henry Schielein and his wife,  Carol. Henry is the president of the Laguna Niguel chapter of the illustrious  group that regularly meets to lap up the good life. How does one become a  member? "They have to be referred," said Schielein, decked out in Hawaiian duds  and his wife's lei. "Then we invite them to a dinner or two to see if they fit  in." (Make that behave. Members must not be given to drunkenness and must know  how to carry on a polite dinner conversation. Political debates are banned.)  </P> <P> If Rotisseur-wanna-bes pass muster, they get to take regular flights of  culinary fancy with some of Orange County's most discriminating gourmands. And  occasionally, they get the chance to rankle one another. For example,  Andersen's luau invitation referred to something guests might be able to spot  "to the south" as they sipped their libations on Hotel Laguna's beachside  terrace: "the PuPu Ritz -- an extinct volcano!" (the drop-dead gorgeous  Ritz-Carlton, but of course).  </P> <P> Perspectives: While Hotel Laguna was brimming with the style of the South Seas,  a nearby cottage bustled with the style of Scandinavia on Sunday. Bill Magnuson  and Ulf Strandberg, proprietors of the Gustaf Anders restaurant at South Coast  Plaza Village, staged an intimate dinner for supporters of the Laguna Art  Museum in their cliff-side home with an ocean view.  </P> <P> Up for sampling on their balcony: salmon, golden caviar, pickled herring,  Scandinavian breads and cheeses. Afterward, guests filed into the back yard for  a sit-down dinner that featured a first course of fish soup (the smell of it  simmering was reason enough to come to this party) and a main course of smoked  reindeer. Smoked reindeer? "It's a delicacy," Strandberg said with a smile as  he tumbled the shrimp shells in his soup. "We get it from Scandinavia via San  Francisco." (Said one giggling guest: "Thank God it's not Christmas!")  </P> <P> Among guests: John and Teri Kennady (elegant in a white blazer hand-painted in  silver); Robert and Nadine Hall (in a stunning turquoise cashmere blazer); Tim  and Debi Bremner; Dr. Signe Belden; Robert Ehrlich; Dr. Robert Ball; Carl and  Beverly Mitchell; Virginia Snyder; and Kitty Morgan with her husband, Charles  Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum. (Desmarais was in the pink about  the museum being in the black.) The evening was part of the museum's  "Perspectives" fund-raising party series.  </P> <P> Capers: Neiman Marcus at Fashion Island staged its sixth annual "Catalogue  Caper" on Saturday night, netting more than $100,000 for the Orange County  chapter of the American Diabetes Assn. Leba Kramer was chairwoman of the  $175-per-person affair.  </P></p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Long day's journey - FT Writers explain the rights of passengers who find their flights overbooked or seriously delayed It is a struggle to crawl out of bed at 6am in the dead of winter, but that is the price one pays for being a north Londoner with a flight leaving Heathrow at 9.30. The Northern and Piccadilly Underground lines delivered me to Terminal 1 at 8.30am on December 28. There I was greeted by a notice saying that my Cyprus Airways flight to Larnaca had been delayed until 6 that evening because of a 24-hour strike by Cypriot civil servants. What rights do you have if your flight is delayed? Not many, as I discovered. Rebecca Evans, a barrister in the legal department of the Consumers' Association, says delays are a 'grey and fuzzy area'. The best strategy is to scream and shout, which often results in offers of compensation. Cyprus Airways check-in is handled at Heathrow by British Airways. The BA staff were helpful, walking along the check-in queues to warn passengers for Larnaca that they should not wait, as their luggage would not be accepted before 3pm. All further inquiries were directed to the Cyprus Airways airport staff. Cyprus Airways agreed to send a fax to my hotel in Nicosia to say I would be arriving after midnight, but that was all. All further requests for help received a belligerent response, as did inquiries to the airline's London office after I returned home. The airline's staff at Heathrow said they would not feed customers who had to spend the day at the airport. There were no cups of tea on offer and certainly no sympathy. The strike, the airline employees said, had nothing to do with them. The delay had been caused by government employees, including customs and immigration officials and air traffic controllers. But wasn't the airline owned by the Cyprus government, the internationally recognised administration that controls the southern, Greek side of the island? Not really, the airline's London office said. The Cyprus government owned a minority 49 per cent stake. The remaining 51 per cent was held by private investors. As the strike had started the night before, why hadn't the airline attempted to contact passengers to warn them of the delay? The airline said its London staff had not known about the strike until the morning after it started, suggesting that communication between Cyprus and London is not all it should be. Although it is true that the strike was called at short notice, BA had already postponed a flight the night before because of the dispute. Cyprus Airways' London office said most passengers on the flight lived within commuting distance of the airport and could go home. It added that BA had sent its own passengers home. If any passengers were out of pocket, they should contact the airline. BA confirmed that it had sent passengers home. It said it had no hard and fast rule on how to deal with delays. It said customer service staff were encouraged to take responsibility for passengers and keep them comfortable. Ms Evans says the Warsaw Convention, which governs airline behaviour, has more to say about delayed baggage than delayed passengers. Airlines are obliged to compensate you if they do not get you to your destination within a reasonable time - usually six hours for a long-haul flight. But Cyprus Airways was within its rights: if a delay is caused by events outside an airline's control, you have no right to compensation. But, she adds: 'It's not unknown that if people make a fuss they do get compensation.'</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Committee considers recalling governor - Harrods Bank A COMMONS committee is considering provoking a constitutional row by recalling the governor of the Bank of England to give evidence for a second time on action being taken against Harrods bank. The trade and industry committee has taken advice from legal counsel on whether the Bank's governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, was right earlier this year to insist that banking confidentiality laws prevented him from detailing what measures had been taken. Several MPs on the cross-party committee are angry at what they see as a defiance of their powers to summon witnesses to answer questions. The legal advice is believed to support those who argue the powers of parliament transcend banking law. The committee will debate what action to take next week. Members could decide Mr Leigh-Pemberton has already given as much information as could reasonably be expected. However, some believe there is a point of principle and a constitutional anomaly at stake. The long-running controversy stems from the damning report by government inspectors on the takeover by the Fayed brothers of the House of Fraser, of which Harrods bank is a subsidiary. Several senior Conservative MPs want the Fayed brothers to be removed from control of Harrods bank to protect the interests of its depositors. Reflecting that anxiety, Mr Kenneth Warren, Conservative chairman of the committee, issued a strong challenge at the end of last year to Mr Leigh-Pemberton to give evidence about Harrods bank, saying it was 'high time' he responded to the committee's request to do so. During a tense evidence-taking session in February, Mr Leigh-Pemberton repeatedly refused to answer questions about Harrods bank or the Fayed brothers. He cited section 82 of the 1987 Banking Act which makes it a criminal offence for anyone, including the Bank's governor, to disclose information received under the act relating to the business or other affairs of any person without their consent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dakar, 12 Jan (AFP) -- Senegalese Economy and  Finance Minister Pape Ousmane Sakho has announced a 10 percent  salary increase in three months' time to mitigate the negative  effects of the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc which was  decided yesterday evening. Mr. Sakho, who was answering  questions put to him by Radio Senegal reporters, said the  emergency plan adopted by Senegal in August last year to remove  the major imbalances in public finances will be maintained with  some modifications. With this plan, salaries were reduced by 15  percent in the public sector thus lowering civil service  salaries from 2.6 billion French francs to less than Fr1.8  billion .    The emergency plan is "unavoidable" and will "support the  external adjustment" necessitated by the CFA franc devaluation,  the minister said. He also announced the establishment of a  future plan to limit inflation on essential commodities like  rice, sugar, and flour. According to Mr. Sakho, the inflation  rate envisaged for the first year after the devaluation is 40  percent. The ultimate objective is to reduce this inflation  rate to 10 percent in the second year.</p>

However, at the same  time, the economy has also swiftly started to move toward  overheating. Our aim in looking back at and analyzing past  fluctuations is to be better able to understand China's economic  structure at present by comparing it with that of the past. We  want to see which aspects have seen change and which aspects  have not yet seen change, so that we can, in a targeted way,  adopt effective policies for macroeconomic stability.    5.1--"Already changed" and "not changed"    First, we should recognize that as compared to 1987-88, our  country's economic structure has seen many positive changes: 1)  There has been further development of the non-state-owned  economy, and such entities now account for over 50 percent of  gross industrial output value and GNP. These are economic  entities which are oriented toward the market and have strong  self-restraint. They thus play a positive role in stabilizing  the economy. 2) There has been a further expansion of opening  up to the outside, there has been a great increase in investment  of foreign funds, imports and exports have been further expanded  and price increases have, in many areas (such as steel products  and other production materials) already been subject to the  restraints of international market prices. 3) All sorts of  markets have seen further development. While in some markets,  such as the share market, the real estate market,and the  securities market, there has been some chaos (especially because  of the "speculation using public funds" engaged in in some  markets by state-owned and semi-state-owned companies), in the  end, however, these still provide more investment avenues and  play a role in holding down the expansion of consumer demand and  in encouraging the accumulation of capital. All of these aspects  have played a stabilizing role in regard to macroeconomic  movement.    However, solely on this basis or on the basis of the  phenomenon of "market weakness" which appeared during the two  previous years of tightening up, holding that China's economic  structure has undergone a "basic change," and that there has  been a change from "resource constraint" to "demand constraint"  (see Guo Shu-qing, 1992) is a bit premature.    China's economic structure has not yet seen basic changes in  the following two major areas:    1. The basic structure of the state-owned economic sector  has not yet seen change, and the soft budgetary restraints of  the local governments and state-owned enterprises and the  various operational modes based on these (including the response  modes to the many economic "policy variables") have not yet seen  basic change.    2. The leading position of the state-owned economy has still  not changed. This can be explained through the following two  aspects: 1) While the state-owned economy no longer constitutes  the majority in terms of output value or national income, the  state-owned economy still occupies the dominant position in  terms of expenditure and total demand. Here the key question  is: When the bank savings from the various economic sectors are  transferred into credit, they mainly flow through the state  banking system to state-owned economic sectors (at present, it  is estimated that this is the case for more than 80 percent of  the total), while the credit issued to town and township  enterprises only constitutes a very small part. In this way,  the operational sectors, which only constitute a small part of  the income structure, through the savings-credit link, come to  constitute a large part in the expenditure structure, and  particularly investment expenditure. Seen from the situation of  enterprise direct financing, the state-owned enterprises have  quite weak restraints, and quite great "nerve," and the funds  they draw in are naturally quite great. 2) The state-owned  economy is mainly centered in national economic lifeblood  sectors such as light and heavy industry, energy, and mining.  Thus, the guiding role that it plays in the national economy  has not changed. 3) Based on the above two points, that which  determines the changes in economic fluctuations in our country  at present is still the various state-owned economic sectors.  Town and township enterprises and the private economy have seen  quite high growth rates since 1990. However, as they are mainly  centered in consumer product processing industries, commerce,  and service industries, they only play a role in maintaining the  supply of consumer products, and they cannot spur the revival of  the overall economy. Only when the state-owned economy  "revives" will the overall economy be gradually enlivened. A  prominent point in this is that not only does investment by  state-owned sectors still constitutes a large part (over 60  percent) of overall social investment, but the expansion of  investment by the state-owned economy (whole-people ownership  investment) still plays, as it did in the various previous  economic fluctuations, a leading role and a decisive role in  overall economic recovery. 4) In financial income, the profits  and taxes which derive from state-owned enterprises still  constitute the major part. As the financial balance situation  plays an extremely important role in the formulation of  macroeconomic policies, the operational situation of state-owned  economic sectors still plays a decisive role in overall  macroeconomic changes. For example, sectors will not dare or  are not willing to adopt various policies to restrain the  expansion of credit or growth of demand (such as by raising  credit interest rates), just so that they can ensure that the  profits and taxes handed up by state-owned enterprises do not  decline or their losses do not further expand.    5.2--A new round of handing down power and financial  chaos    Under the precondition of the "no changes" noted above,  since  the beginning of 1992, following the further expansion of the  autonomy of localities and enterprises, and the intensification  of decentralized "competition under soft constraints," elements  of economic instability have seen a further increase rather than  a reduction. Of these elements, the two "autonomies" noted  below have been particularly important in macroeconomic  instability and accelerating the pace of economic overheating:    1. Autonomy in terms of examining and approving investment  projects has been completely handed down. This has led to a  very great increase in investment by localities themselves (for  example, some data show that 82.7 percent of newly commenced  projects involving whole-people ownership investment over the  period January to May 1992 were local projects). Also, there  has been a great increase in fixed-asset investment. Over the  period January to May 1993, there was a growth of 70.7 percent  over the same period of the previous year in state-owned  fixed-asset investment. This is a "high speed" rarely seen  previously.    2. "Autonomy in terms of direct financing." This is a very  important autonomy which has been obtained by local governments  and enterprises, as it enables them to avoid central government  measures to control (directly or indirectly) credit and money.  They raise funds directly in society by paying interest rates  much higher than bank savings deposit interest rates. This  results in government money policies losing their effectiveness.  In 1992, the total value of various types of negotiable  securities on China's securities market was 128 billion yuan.  Of these, state bonds were valued at 41 billion yuan, the  investment bonds of the various state investment companies under  the State Planning Commission totaled 12.7 billion yuan,  enterprise bonds totaled 37.9 billion yuan, financial bonds  totaled 25.5 billion yuan and shares totaled 10.9 billion yuan.  The above-mentioned securities are all quite regular and the  amounts issued can be ascertained through statistics. If we add  to these the shares issued within enterprises, the raising of  funds outside the plans, the sale of urban household  registration in order to raise funds and other "nonstandard"  securities issues, according to an estimate by the headquarters  of the People's Bank of China, the total value would be about  270 billion yuan. At the end of 1992, the outstanding balance  of securities monitored by statistics in our country was 410  billion yuan. Seen from the proportion between direct financing  and indirect financing, excluding the 25.5 billion yuan of  financial bonds, in 1992 the total volume of direct financing  throughout our country was 194.5 billion yuan. This was  equivalent to 54.6 percent of the increase in state bank credit  in that year (356.3 billion yuan). It was also equivalent to 46  percent of the increase in credit issued by financial organs  (including state banks, credit and investment organs and urban  and rural credit cooperatives) throughout the country in that  year (422.8 billion yuan). The proportion of the year's newly  increased total financing constituted by newly increased direct  financing rose from 12 percent in 1991 to 31.5 percent in 1992.  This means that changes have occurred in the mechanism for  transforming our country's savings into investment. However, it  also shows that the effectiveness of some of the current  macroeconomic money regulation and control measures is being  further weakened. (For the various data noted above, see Xie  Ping, 1993)    The handing down of such autonomy clearly exacerbates the  "competition under soft constraints" under the decentralized  state-owned economy and increases economic instability. It is  thus inevitably linked with chaos in the financial sphere. Our  economy has, since the beginning of 1992, not only entered a new  round of fluctuation basically the same as those in the past,  but has also entered a new round of high-speed growth which is  faster than that in the past. The fact that the economy has,  even more quickly, seen the appearance of "overheating"  illustrates this point very clearly.    The current question is which policies the government should  adopt in order to counteract this instability so as to ensure  that the degree of fluctuation is the smallest possible.  <H3>  6. The Current Countermeasure Thinking for Macroeconomic  Stability: `Dual-Track Regulation and Control' </H3>   On the basis of the analysis above of the economic  fluctuations in the eighties and the effectiveness of the  various macroeconomic stability (retrenchment) policies, and in  accordance with the analysis above of the current economic  structural situation and the structural causes for the new round  of high-speed economic growth, we can put forward the following  lines of thought on countermeasures.    6.1--Gradual reform and macroeconomic regulation and  control    In the current process of choosing policies for  macroeconomic  stability, we have to first clarify the following major issues:  First, at present, the issues we need to clarify, especially on  the level of understanding, are: 1) The effectiveness of  different macroeconomic regulatory and control policies depends  on different economic structural conditions, especially on the  "microeconomic base" of the economy. 2) We must develop a  market economy, but our current economic structure is still not  a market economy, while the "microeconomic base" of  macroeconomic operation is far from the "microeconomic base" of  a market economy. Thus, many macroeconomic stability policies  which are effective under market economy conditions are, under  current structural conditions, actually unable to play an  effective role. This is prominently manifested by the fact that  the state-owned economic sectors, which are still to a large  degree dependent for their operation on administrative links at  present, can only be restrained through the use of  administrative measures, and in a situation where localities and  enterprises still lack internal self-restraint mechanisms, it is  still necessary to retain a certain amount of external  restraint. Each economic structure has its own special logic,  and this cannot be violated. At present, we want to put great  effort into developing a market economy structure. However,  this mainly requires that we put effort into structural reform,  and especially into transforming the economic base of the  economy (this we will analyze below). It does not mean that at  present we can completely change the "policies" and "measures"  by which the economy is managed. If, at present, we blindly use  market economy macroeconomic policies, which have not yet seen  obvious results, to manage our economy, it will not really be  beneficial to the development of the economy and will not be a  real act of "marketization."    Second, structural reform is a process which requires quite  a  long period of time to see results, while macroeconomic  regulation and control is a near-term problem of "overall demand  management." The two must not be confused. Thus, the claim that  "through deepening reform, we can achieve macroeconomic  stability at present" is an idea which may sound correct, but is  not. Reform must be intensified, and this is particularly so at  present. However, prior to the completion of the reforms, we  still face the problem of how, under the current set structural  conditions, we are to carry out macroeconomic regulation and  control. The correct statement is that "through deepening  reform, we can achieve long-term economic stability."    Third, although our economy is not yet a complete market  economy, it is no longer completely a planned economy. Rather,  it is in a changeover stage as it makes the transition from the  old structure to the new structure. Its basic characteristic is  a "structural dual track." China has adopted a "gradual" mode  for its reforms. The basic characteristic of this mode of  structural change is: It does not suddenly destroy the vested  interests formed under the old structure. Rather, in the early  period of reform, it appropriately maintains the vested  interests, so as to reduce the social obstructions faced by the  reforms. Thus, the overall process of economic reform does not  involve first destroying the old structure, but rather involves  first developing new structural components at the "side" or in  the "cracks" of the old structure. Following the development of  the new structural components, and the expansion of the  proportions which they constitute in the overall economy, there  will be gradual deepening of the transformation of the old  structure.    This mode of reform will naturally mean that the process of  reform is characterized by "dual-track transition." That is to  say, for quite a long period there will a situation where the  new and the old systems and the two types of economic components  coexist. The new structure will have been partially formed, but  the old structure will continue to exist and its absolute scale  may even continue to grow. The two types of structures will  continue to play roles in the economy, but after a certain  period of transition, the change from the old structure to the  new structure will be completed for the overall economy. The  "dual-track transition" can be said to be the basic form of the  "gradual mode of reform." Here, "dual-track transition" not  only refers to a "dual-track pricing system," but also means  "dual-track property rights" and many other types of specific  dual-track structures. We can see that during the process of  our country's economic structural reforms, in every sphere there  will exist this "dual-track transition" form.    When components from the different types of structures  coexist in the same economy, it is inevitable that there will be  mutual restraints and that they will play a role regarding each  other. Also, the activity mode of each will inevitably affect  the other. However, as the basic operational mechanisms of the  two structures are different and, in the end, they differ in  terms of their activity modes, their reactions when facing the  same kinds of economic changes, government policies and external  pummelling will also be different. This then produces the  macroeconomic management level question of how to adopt  different policy measures to carry out regulation and control in  respect of the different economic components. Thus, during the  period of structural transition, the realization of an  appropriate structural dual track clearly requires that the  macroeconomic regulation and control measures are themselves  also "dual-track." By using only one method, it will not be  possible to achieve the hoped-for results. This is prominently  manifested in the fact that actually, at present, we do not have  any macroeconomic regulatory and control measures, either direct  or indirect, "market-driven" or "administrative," "monetary" or  "planning" measures, which can very effectively carry out  regulation and control of the overall economy. However, on the  other hand, none of the current regulatory and control measures  are completely useless. They all have a role to play to a  certain degree and over a certain range. This requires that we  "comprehensively" utilize the various types of measures, so that  we can carry out "comprehensive regulation and control" of the  economy. (Fan Gang, 1992)    6.2--"Dual-track regulation and control"    "Comprehensive regulation and control" will, during the  period of "dual-track transition," be specifically manifested as  "dual-track regulation and control." The basic line of thinking  on this is as follows.    On the one hand, in respect of the non-state-owned economy,  it means using indirect regulatory and control policies which  have already begun to show a certain effect, such as monetary  policies and taxation policies. In particular, we must  strengthen the use of interest rates. Even though the  state-owned economic sectors will not at present be sensitive to  this, we already have a quite large non-state-owned economy  which is quite sensitive to interest rates (when other  conditions remain the same, personal savings always react to  interest rates), and the other types of indirect regulatory and  control policies have also already shown themselves to be quite  effective in these areas.    In another respect, in regulating and controlling the  state-owned economic sectors which are at present still  maintained through reliance on administrative links, we should  continue to use direct administrative control measures to a  certain degree. In particular, we must, in a timely way,  directly control investment activities and consumption of public  funds. In the analysis above, we have already seen that at  present, only direct measures are effective measures for  controlling the scale of final demand in a decentralized  state-ownership economy. At the same time, we should  appropriately strengthen management and control over the issue  of securities and direct financing by local governments and  state-owned enterprises. (There is no need to excessively  intervene in the direct financing activities of non-state-owned  enterprises. It is only necessary to strengthen the  establishment and implementation of regulations.) The basic line  of thinking is that in respect of economic activity principals  which have not yet formed internal self-restraint mechanisms, we  must maintain necessary external restraints.    At the same time, we should not implement excessively tight  regulatory and control measures in respect of credit. Under  current structural conditions, if we implement excessively tight  credit controls (reducing the scale of planned credit), it will  basically be a uniform administrative control on financing, and  that may produce a quite strong "counter-choice" reaction--a  reaction whereby credit which should be blocked is not really  subject to much restraint, while that which should not be  stopped is the first to bear the brunt of the measures. For  example, as soon as there is excessive tightening up on funds,  the state-owned enterprises which do not have good results or  which incur losses can still use new credit to maintain their  existence. However, profitable enterprises with deposits fall  into difficulties when funds are blocked, and they are unable to  even draw on their own funds. Thus, their potential cannot be  brought into play. The non-state-owned enterprises which  originally had difficulty obtaining credit find it even more  difficult to obtain funds, their development is restricted, and  so on.    In the process of marketization, we need not feel a "taboo"  about continuing to use "administrative measures" for direct  control. However, we must particularly ensure that we do not  implement "uniform"-type administrative controls over the entire  economy. More importantly, we should not implement  administrative management over the non-state-owned economy.  Seen from the relationship between macroeconomic regulation and  control and the marketization reforms, a major advantage of  "dual-track regulation and control" is that it manages that  which should be managed and only regulates that which should be  freed. It does not manage these two things together. This is  beneficial to having the overall economy make the transition  toward the "single-track" of the market economy, and finally  abandoning administrative measures. Doing things in this way is  actually beneficial rather than disadvantageous to the  development of the market economy.    6.3--"Retaining some things and discarding others":  How to develop the market mechanism in the current process of  readjusting financial order    The aim of "dual-track regulation and control" is not to  maintain the existing economic structure and the administrative  measures for intervening in the economy. Rather, it is intended  for better making the transition to the market economy. Thus,  during the period of transition, in the process of carrying out  "dual-track regulation and control" of the economy, it is very  important that we should clarify what we should give up and what  we should put great efforts into developing.    In the early period, the main problem in macroeconomic  stability will be chaos in the financial market, and there is a  need to engage in readjustment, including the use of  administrative measures to implement necessary restraints.  However, in the process of readjusting the financial market, it  is also necessary to avoid the practice of "implementing in a  uniform way." Rather, we should "retain some things and give up  others." Specifically, there are problems in two areas to which  we should pay attention:    First, we should avoid the complete abolition of the  "secondary funds market." For example, at the same time as  handling the problem of inter-borrowing of funds, we should  consider how to better develop a funds market. A major element  by which the reform of our country's financial structure lags  behind the reforms in other spheres is that we have not, in a  timely way, implemented in the financial sector a "dual-track  interest rate system" which is in accord with the law and which  is subject to state supervision and management. Interest rates  are the price of funds use. Over the last few years, in our  country's product markets, many prices have, after making the  transition through a long period of the "dual-track system,"  been gradually freed, and the reform of marketization has been  realized. However, in respect of interest rates, it is still  the case that the state sets the prices. The result of this is  not that we have not seen the appearance of "dual-track  pricing," but rather that we have not seen clearly priced  "dual-track pricing" which is "in accordance with the law,"  which is subject to state management, and from which the  interest income goes to the state rather than into the pockets  of private individuals. What have appeared are "black markets"  and "gray markets" for funds, as well as "official speculation  in funds" and "financial corruption." Thus, here there actually  exists the problem of how to squarely face the objective laws of  the development of things and intensify "price reform" in the  funds market. Over the last few years, in the financial sector,  the area in which regulation through market mechanism has played  a major role has been inter-borrowing funds. The  inter-borrowing funds market is actually to a certain degree  equivalent to the development of a nonstandardized funds market  which is not subject to management, and is outside the  traditional credit system in which interest rates are difficult  to change and credit is subject to planning controls. To a  certain degree, this forms another price for credit funds. At  present, many non-state-owned companies and enterprises find it  difficult to obtain credit under the state credit plans, and  thus they can only obtain their funds through various forms of  "inter-borrowing." In this sphere, because many things are "not  in accordance with the law" and there is a lack of effective  supervision, there exists great chaos. For example, a large  part of interest rate differentials flows into the pockets of  individuals. A large part of inter-borrowing funds is used by  some state-owned or semi-state-owned financial and real estate  companies, which have special links with banks, to invest in the  securities and real estate markets. However, in the final  analysis, through this avenue some funds are deployed by the  market to production sectors where interest rates are quite  high. Thus, at present, on the one hand we must readjust the  funds market, so as to stop illegal inter-borrowing, and  "uncouple" some companies from banks, while on the other hand we  have to consider how to develop an "interest rate dual-track  system" which accords with the law and is subject to supervision  and management. We must not simply recover the "inter-borrowing  funds," again institute firm and unchanging interest rates, and  forcibly return to the "single planning track" which has been  proved by practice to be ineffective and not feasible. If we  continue to institute unitary "planned interest rates," and the  rates never float, the result will inevitably be the  re-emergence of "gray markets" and corruption. As compared to  this, it would be better to first let the interest rates for  some funds "legitimately" move in accordance with market prices,  and appropriately allow some bank funds to be loaned out "beyond  the plans" at market interest rates. This would be like when we  initially allowed enterprises to have the prices of some of  their products set by the market, and they were free to sell  them at those prices. This will not only be beneficial to the  effective use of funds, and beneficial to the reform of the  financial system, but will also be beneficial to the development  of the non-state-owned economy. Having credit funds subject to  unified central control and managing them very tightly will not  injure the state-owned enterprises. They are always "guaranteed  funds come rain or shine." The ones to feel the brunt of such  measures will certainly be the various types of non-state-owned  economy operations. Even initially they had a hard time getting  anything from the "credit plans" basket. If the financing  avenues outside the plans are abolished, their development will  certainly suffer seriously. This will be very disadvantageous to  the growth and development of our country's market economy  mechanism and to the sustained development of the overall  economy (the development of the market economy and economic  growth over the last 10-plus years have mainly depended on the  development of various forms of non-state-owned economy  operations).    Second, in the process of readjusting the financial market,  we should strengthen management over non-state-owned,  nongovernment financial organs (cooperative and  shareholding-type credit organizations and banks, as well as  private banks). However, we should not restrict their  development. On the contrary, in order to further develop the  market economy, we should adopt more open policies, and allow  and encourage the development of non-state-owned financial  organs. In the view of the authors, in terms of the process of  reform of the financial structure, an aspect which is lagging  behind at present is the development of non-state-owned,  nongovernment financial organs. Up to now, the measures adopted  have been to restrict rather than to encourage nongovernment  financial organs. Thus, while, in the overall economy, the  national income created by the various forms of non-state-owned  economic entities has already reached 50 percent of gross  national income, in financial activities, the proportion  constituted by nongovernment financial organs is still very  small, and the figure is not commensurate with the development  of the overall non-state-owned economy. A major excuse given  for restricting the development of nongovernment financial  organs is that these financial organs will "cause chaos to  normal financial order." The problem, however, lies in what is  meant by "normal financial order." In the financial sphere, the  most basic and most important order is "requiring repayment of  monies borrowed." It is on this point, we are afraid, that the  nongovernment financial organs are the greatest respecters of  "normal order." It is difficult to imagine a nongovernment bank  continually approving loans to an enterprise which is a heavy  loss-maker and which fails to repay repeated loans. Is it not  on this point that our state-owned banks are those with the  greatest disrespect for "normal order"? The problems are which  order do we want to maintain? Do we want to establish a new  order which is in accord with the patterns of the market economy?    Developing nongovernment financial organs does not mean that  we should abandon management of financial order by the  government and the state-owned central bank. On the contrary,  the development of the nongovernment financial organs will be of  benefit in strengthening such management and making it more  effective. In fact, the central bank has great difficulty in  implementing effective management of the various state-owned  commercial banks. The reason for this lies in the fact that the  central bank and state-owned commercial banks, like state-owned  enterprises and the various levels of local government, are all  state-owned, and none of them can say to the others that they  alone "have authority." They all have a thousand ways in which  to "finance" their needs. However, the central bank,  representing the state, can exercise management over  nongovernment financial organs. This is relatively easier and  more effective, the interests of the two sides are clearly  demarcated, and the monetary regulation and control measures of  the central bank will be more authoritarian. In market economy  countries around the world, it is the central bank which  controls non-state-owned commercial banks, and the effectiveness  of government monetary policies is built on this basis. Why do  we consider that allowing the development of nongovernment  financial organs will result in great chaos? In the early  period of the development of nongovernment financial organs,  because of the supersession of the old system by the new, it  will be difficult to avoid some confusion, but through  perfecting laws and strengthening management it will be possible  to ensure that the new structure and the new order are gradually  established. However, if we do not allow the development of  nongovernment financial organs, it will not be possible to  establish a new order and it will not be possible for the  government to gradually learn through practice how to manage  nongovernment financial organs. This will result in our always  lagging behind in financial structure reform. In the early  period of the development of our non-state-owned production  enterprises, there were also many problems, leading to many  people accusing them of harming "normal economic order."  However, what they were actually doing was playing an important  and positive role in breaking down the old traditional planning  structure and order, in establishing a new market economy  structure and order, and in accelerating economic development.    The basic experiences of our reforms of gradual  marketization  over the last 10-plus years have involved: 1) Using a  "dual-track pricing system" to break down and gradually replace  the old planning structure; 2) through developing the  non-state-owned economy, changing the property rights structure  of the overall economy, forming more market activity principals,  and, through a "structural dual track," making the transition to  a market economy. The reason our market economy has been able  to take embryonic form and the reason our economy has been able  to maintain a growth momentum during the reforms is that we have  relied on these two aspects. In the current process of  deepening the reform of the financial structure, we cannot  forget these two precious experiences of our "gradual mode of  reform."    6.4--The basic route for achieving long-term stability:  Speeding the pace of property rights reform    As far as long-term stability is concerned, we not only must  actively carry out reform of the banking structure, the  financial structure and the macroeconomic management system, but  also need to step up and deepen reform in other aspects. In  particular, we need to intensify reform in terms of property  rights relations in the state-owned economy. The 15-year  history of our reform and opening up has shown that as far as  the state-owned economy is concerned, purely "handing down power  and allowing retention of profits," while not carrying out  reform of ownership relations, cannot resolve the problem of  macroeconomic stability. Our current economic instability is,  to a great degree, due to the "handing down of power and  allowing retention of profits" in a situation where there has  been no reform of ownership relations in the state ownership  economy. The result is that localities and enterprises have the  "right" to seek their own interests, but there is still no one  who will take real responsibility for capital losses, the  "budgetary restraints" have still not been "firmed," and the  relationship between the government and enterprises has not seen  any essential change. The so-called "sluggishness in financial  reform" is actually due to the sluggishness of property rights  reform in the state-owned economy, which in turn "drags back"  financial reform. The situations in various respects show that  we have already reached the stage where we have to accelerate  reform centered on property rights. Reform of property rights  relationships has become a pressing issue.    Some property rights reform measures which are feasible and  where we should begin at present include: Clarifying the  specific ownership representatives or ownership principals for  state-owned assets (including land); through legislation,  clearly setting down the scope and volume of state-owned assets;  and appropriately defining and distinguishing central ownership  rights and local ownership rights. After this, we should widely  promote the "company corporatization" of state-owned enterprises  and, in the majority of state-run enterprises, implement a  system by which state assets are converted into shares, so as to  turn them into limited liability companies (not necessarily  "listed companies"). Through this mode, we will be able to  clearly define and quantify the property rights relationships of  state-owned enterprises. Thereby, we will ensure that property  rights in respect of state-owned assets are quantified property  rights which can be divided, which can be traded and which can  be transferred. This will create beneficial conditions for the  further stable reform of ownership relations in future in  accordance with the demands of the market economy and in  accordance with the demands of efficiency standards. The  property rights relations of the state-owned economy need to be  reformed, while within the non- state-owned economy there also  exist problems such as property rights not being protected,  property rights not being clear and so on. These problems also  need to be resolved through reform. In this aspect at present,  we should set about the following work: Protecting property  rights and encouraging various types of private investment, so  that the various types of non-state-owned economic entities see  more healthy and more stable development, so as to reduce the  extravagant consumption and the large-scale outflow of national  capital which have already appeared, and so as to speed the  accumulation of social capital. In town and township  enterprises and the various types of cooperative and collective  economy operations at present, there exists in very many cases  the problem of property rights relationships not being clear,  and this has already affected the development of the economy and  the accumulation of capital. Thus, we should speed the reform  of property rights. The main route at present is through  promoting, in the collective economy, the "shareholding  cooperative system" which has emerged in practice, to ensure  that the collective property rights of the past, which  previously could not be divided and could not be traded, become  divisible and capable of being traded.    Theoretical analysis and practical experiences have both  proved that if we do not start out with reform of basic economic  relationships, and do not reform the activity modes of  state-owned enterprises and local governments, so as to form  market economy mechanisms, we will never be able to break free  from the cycle in which "relaxation gives rise to chaos and  taking back power results in stagnation," those indirect  regulatory measures which have proved effective in market  economies will never be adopted in our economy, and we will  never achieve the hoped-for results.

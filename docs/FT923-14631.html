			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses early gains in sharply reduced volume SHARE prices failed to sustain mid-afternoon gains and the Nikkei average closed marginally lower in sharply reduced trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index fell 60.71 to 16,657.07 after a low of 16,624.75 and a high of 16,852.17. Dealers' purchases of speculative theme stocks pushed the Nikkei higher in the afternoon, but it declined as the buying failed to spark interest among institutional investors. Volume fell to 150m shares from 337m. Declines led advances by 530 to 397 with 171 unchanged, and the Topix index lost 6.01 to 1,287.54, its first decline in five days. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.44 to 1,009.36. Institutions remained lethargic, citing the Munich summit and a possible cut in the discount rate as reasons for their inactivity. 'There seems to be some movement behind the scenes towards an imminent cut in the official discount rate,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Mutual Life. However, Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto, analyst at Nikko Research Institute, said further monetary easing would not push prices higher. 'A lot of investors are sceptical, since the past four cuts in the discount rate have not helped the market,' he said. Speculative theme stocks were traded actively by dealers trying to increase trading volume. Two environment-friendly stocks, Taiyo Fishery and Nippon Formula Feed, rose Y29 to Y520 and Y15 to Y755 respectively after they announced plans to breed blue fin tuna. Toyama Chemical and Green Cross lost initial gains. Investors had bought the stocks on reports that the companies are jointly developing an anti-Aids drug. Toyama fell Y14 to Y751 and Green Cross lost Y30 to Y1,040. Fujitsu declined Y27 to Y606 on reports that the company might suffer an 80 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y5bn for the first six months to September. Brokerage houses were weak, with Nomura Securities down Y20 to Y1,290 and Nikko Securities losing Y30 to Y561. Investors were discouraged by Nomura's plans to reduce its staff by 2,000 over the next five years. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 124.83 to 19,567.41 in volume of 7m shares. Roundup APART from Hong Kong, where trading was extremely lively, turnover in the region was thin. Bombay remained inactive as a brokers' boycott entered its fifth week. HONG KONG hit an afternoon wave of profit-taking and registered its third consecutive loss in extremely active trading, the Hang Seng Index sinking 37.08 to 6,024.77 as turnover rose HKDollars 2bn to HKDollars 6.1bn. Property shares turned in the biggest losses after last week's HKDollars 3.2bn private placing by Sun Hung Kai. Late selling was fuelled by rumours of covered warrants being issued for Dairy Farm International. SEOUL dropped to a four-year low in thin trading, the composite index falling 9.69 to 535.72 on rumours of small company business failures and on declining deposits with brokerage houses. Turnover fell to Won108.7bn from Friday's Won138.2bn. An estimated Won10bn was withdrawn from brokerage house deposits of Won1,200bn. NEW ZEALAND climbed on falling domestic interest rates, the NZSE-40 index putting on 17.18 to 1,559.07 in turnover down from NZDollars 22.7m to NZDollars 21.9m. Fletcher Challenge, seen as a particular beneficiary of falling interest rates because of its relatively high dividend yield, gained 5 cents to NZDollars 3.53 in volume of 867,000 shares. MANILA rose in light dealings as bargain-hunting lifted selected stocks. Philippine National Bank gained 2.50 pesos to 330 as the composite index ended 19.17 higher at 1,496.33. AUSTRALIA went extremely quiet, turnover dwindling from ADollars 183m to ADollars 118m as the All Ordinaries index rose just 0.4 to 1,663.6. Brokers said the market was quiet in anticipation of a domestic easing of monetary policy as early as today. Equity raisings were also blamed for the thin business, as funds are being kept aside for such contingencies. SINGAPORE and KUALA LUMPUR moved little, the Straits Times Industrial index easing 3.59 to 1,480.51, and the KLSE composite index closing just 0.33 lower at 595.75. Volume at the SES was estimated at around 24m shares, one of the lightest trading days this year. An early firmness based on gains in Singapore Airlines (SIA) stock gave way in mid-morning as profit-taking in index-linked stocks overwhelmed the 40-cent SIA rise. BANGKOK's SET index fell 7.24 to 731.62 on turnover of Bt2.7bn. Turnover has not fallen below Bt3bn since June 10, just before Anand Panyarachun was re-named prime minister. DHAKA fell ahead of a 48-hour industrial strike due to start today. The all-share index fell 4.09 to 382.4 in turnover of Tk3.48m after Tk2.18m.</p>

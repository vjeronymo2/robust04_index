			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BURN CENTER, SUPPORT GROUP MARK BIRTHDAYS  </P> <P> It was black-tie optional. It was $100 per couple. So how come it looked like a  great big family reunion -- or a meeting of 180 long-lost friends?  </P> <P> A few words with the hosts and guests of last week's "Birthday Bash" for the  Orange County Burn Assn. and the UC Irvine Burn Center provided ample  explanation for all that cocktail-hour hugging and kissing and genuine emotion  so rare at formal events.  </P> <P> "This is a very close-knit community," said an ebullient Susie Martinez,  nursing manager of the eight-bed burn unit, which is at UC Irvine Medical  Center in Orange.  </P> <P> "Patients and members of the recovery team often become extremely close," said  Dr. Kenneth Waxman, associate director of the burn unit.  </P> <P> "These people," said Mark Chweh, who suffered burns on 50% of his body in a  building fire last summer, "are incredible."  </P> <P> For the record, the dinner and awards party marked the coming of age of the UCI  Burn Center (officially 21 years old) and the 10th anniversary of the Orange  County Burn Assn., a volunteer group that organizes patient support groups,  community education programs and fund raising for research.  </P> <P> In a tumble of words, Martinez explained the facts of life in the burn unit,  which treated about 700 patients last year.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to recruit nurses, because burns are such an awful injury, with  such devastating disfigurement, that a lot of nurses just don't want that kind  of emotional intensity," said Martinez, an 18-year veteran of the unit.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of drama, almost all the time," she said, "but it's so rewarding  to take a patient from the critical, intensive-care stage, with all the shock  and trauma and guilt and anger . . . and help them and their family get on with  their lives.  </P> <P> Helping burn survivors get on with life is the primary function of the  association, which organizes a monthly therapy session for current and former  patients. Between 15 and 30 people attend, discussing the physical and mental  adjustments required by their burns.  </P> <P> Caryl Modrinski, director of the organization, said she got a call recently  from a 38-year-old woman who wanted to find out more about the support group.  "She said she was burned when she was 3 years old, but she said she still could  not deal with her disfigurement."  </P> <P> A regular at the therapy sessions is Tom Handlan, 28, who 8 years ago suffered  second- and third-degree burns on 95% of his body.  </P> <P> "They gave me a better-than-100% chance of dying," said Handlan with a  mischievous laugh.  </P> <P> Handlan survived, recovered, flourished: He graduated from Cal State Fullerton  last year and is enrolled in the master's program in clinical psychology at  Chapman College.  </P> <P> After dinner, awards were presented to Dr. Robert Bartlett and Pat Allyn, R.N.;  Capt. William Lawler of the Westminster Fire Department; medical researcher  Aubrey Woodroof, and burn survivor and activist Barbara Kammerer.  </P> <P> Honored for their valor in rescuing others from flames were Quintin Reich,  Robert Walker, Greg Upham, Rubin Vigil, John Floyd and Mark Chweh.  </P></p>

Was this an emotional slip of the tongue  prematurely articulated by one of Hizballah's representatives in  Lebanon's parliament, or was it part of a new tactic set forth  by the party to get out of the cycle of deadlines, namely, the  coming agreements with the Zionist enemy? Hizballah must now  either respond to that situation, or it must break the hold,  which that situation has over it. If it tries to break the hold,  it could use force. But if it goes along with those agreements,  Hizballah will have to use political methods. The al-Ghubayri  demonstration was Hizballah's dress rehearsal for breaking out  of this cycle.    Was this calculated "slip of the tongue" an indication of a  new distribution in the balance of power in Hizballah? Did it  come out to indicate a new beginning [in the party]? And if  there is a new distribution of power in the pro-Iranian party,  who is the preeminent power now?    Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah contends that he controls  70  percent of Hizballah's power, policy, and decisions. Does this  mean that Hizballah's decisions are actually Fadlallah's to make?    We will not join the chorus of those who are questioning the  significance of the denial that always accompanies the Sayyid's  utterances when reference is made to his relationship to the  party. That denial is now considered by some to be confirmation  of the Sayyid's relationship to the party as well as an  indication of the fact that the reference to the 70 percent  [which he claims to control] did not come out of nowhere.    We will not question [the significance of the denial]  because  behind the Sayyid's control of the party is something that  reaches beyond the boundaries of the geographic decision between  the party's Consultative Council and the Sayyid's home. Both are  located in Bi'r al-'Abd, a few meters apart.    Sayyid Fadlallah is setting himself up to become something  more than the party's spiritual guide in Lebanon. He is setting  himself up to become the marja'iyah shi'iyah 'ammah [the supreme  Shiite source of emulation: marja'-al-taqlid]. His reach, of  course, would extend beyond the boundaries of Lebanon where  Shiites make up more or less one-third of the population. In  Iran, however, Shiites make up more than two-thirds of the  population, and that same percentage may also exist in Iraq and  in some Gulf countries.    The Sayyid printed his treatise to set the stage for  establishing a link between him, the treatise, and the  muqallidin [emulators of a mujtahid]--if they wanted to have  such a link. That link would also be established with disciples  or persons who want to meet their obligations by paying khums  and zakah [tax and alms tax, respectively, paid by Shiites to  the source of emulation, that is, marja'-al-taqlid]. These  payments provide enormous amounts of money, which the budget of  each institution of a supreme Shiite source of emulation has to  have to ensure the success of its role.    The fact of the matter is that there is a thin line linking  Fadlallah's statement about controlling 70 percent of the party  with his efforts to set himself up for the institution of the  supreme Shiite source of emulation. After all, Hizballah is  Iran's most prominent foreign tool, and as such, its importance  stems from its effectiveness in one of Iran's most dangerous  areas of activity. That is an area where Shiites have a popular  presence; it is an area that has borders with Palestine (the  control of the Zionist enemy); and it is an area where the  struggle in the Palestinian question has gone into a new phase.  The course of that struggle for many years in the future will  be determined by the West and through direct contact with the  West, primarily the United States of America.    Iran established Hizballah so that it can play an effective  role in Lebanon. But when Iran established Hizballah, it had to  have a leader for the party whose religious and political nature  was the same as that of Iran. At the time Iran found that leader  in Lebanon's Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, an official of  al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] Party. It made a deal with him  according to which Fadlallah joined Hizballah in return for the  public dissolution of al-Da'wah [the Islamic Call] Party.    Although the dissolution of the Lebanese chapter of  al-Da'wah  [Islamic Call] Party created problems and difficulties for him  with the original party in Iraq, which was founded by Sayyid  Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, Sayyid Fadlallah managed to deal  promptly with those problems. The dissolution of that chapter  made it possible for the Sayyid to play a distinguished role in  Lebanon throughout the period of the confrontation between Iran  and the West. Hizballah, which needed a spiritual guide in  Lebanon, was the vehicle by means of which Fadlallah played that  role. Furthermore, Sayyid Fadlallah did not offer his positions  to the party free of charge. He rather tried to implant himself  within the party by using the cadres he was grooming. Those  cadres, who made up the student organization of al-Da'wah  [Islamic Call] Party, were known as the Association of Muslim  Students.    During the period of Imam Khomeyni's presence Sayyid  Fadlallah played the part, which Iran wanted him to play. At the  same time he was preparing himself for the post-Imam Khomeyni  period. After all, he turned out to be the most fortunate party  in the confrontation, which occurred between supporters of Imam  Khomeyni and Shaykh Hoseyn 'Ali Montazeri, Khomeyni's successor.  That confrontation ended in the ouster of Shaykh Montazeri from  the position of succession.    Sayyid Fadlallah was fortunate in this confrontation and its  outcome because a principal obstacle, which could have  obstructed his private plan to set himself up as the supreme  Shiite source of emulation had been removed. Shaykh Montazeri  was the last mujtahid in Iran [a religious leader who makes and  issues independent interpretations of theological questions] who  was also source of emulation. He was the last such religious  figure to uphold the notion of a jurisconsult's guardianship.  With him out of the picture and then with the departure of the  imam, proponents of an Islamic republic and of the guardianship  of a jurisconsult found no one to perform the part of a  spiritual guide but Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, who had not yet  completed his treatise. This meant that Sayyid Fadlallah was no  longer under the obligation of following Khamene'i. Since  Fadlallah had completed his treatise, he was more learned and  more knowledgeable than Khamene'i, and he was not required,  therefore, to follow his guidance. (AL-SHIRA' had published in a  previous issue that Fadlallah had printed his treatise and had  placed it for safekeeping in a warehouse.) Accordingly, it was  Fadlallah and not Khamene'i who deserved to become the supreme  source of emulation in the context of accepting a Khomeyni style  guardianship of a jurisconsult.    Sayyid Fadlallah was even more fortunate in the departure of  Sayyid Abolqasem Kho'i, the world's supreme Shiite source of  emulation, who had objected to the universal application of a  Khomeyni-style guardianship of a jurisconsult. Sayyid Kho'i had  also objected to the establishment of an Islamic government,  particularly since the person who was favored by most Shiite  Muslims to become the supreme source of emulation was Seyyed  Reza Golpayegani, a man who was over 90 years old and who was  also opposed to the Khomeyni-style guardianship of a  jurisconsult. Iranians had consented to his proposal that Seyyed  Khamene'i be nominated to succeed Seyyed Golpayegani as the  supreme source of emulation until circumstances are straightened  out.    The fact that Sayyid Fadlallah and Iran parted company on  this matter seems normal here because Sayyid Fadlallah himself  wanted to become the supreme source of emulation. That Khamene'i  should become the supreme source of emulation before completing  his own ijtihad [independent interpretation and judgment in  theological questions] treatise was something that Fadlallah  could not rationalize.    What would Fadlallah do if Tehran were to decline supporting  him or if it were to confine the source of emulation to its  borders or show that Fadlallah had departed from its policy?    Would he, the man who controls 70 percent of Hizballah,  resort to inciting the party against Tehran?    Was this the context for that slip of the tongue by  Hizballah's representative in parliament?    Will other forces within the party remain silent about  Fadlallah's pro-al-Da'wah Party stance? Will they remain silent  if Fadlallah decides to present and circulate his treatise and  accept the position of becoming the source of emulation?    Whereas Lebanon has exposed Fadlallah to confrontations  stemming from Hizballah's defiance of the Lebanese state's  decisions and the state's determination to prevent Lebanon from  becoming an arena for conflict and for the settlement of scores,  Hizballah from now on will be exposed to more incompatible  positions, which have already started to manifest themselves. At  first, the cost of these incompatible positions in the  al-Ghubayri demonstration seemed high. (See the previous issue  of AL-SHIRA'.) The sorting that became evident in that  demonstration was between the different slogans of Sayyid  Fadlallah's supporters who had lined up together in a manner  that distinguished them from others, and between the Party's  fundamentalists who are led by Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. More of  this sorting will take place in the coming days, and the  position of Sayyid Fadlallah himself will be scrutinized  locally, regionally, and internationally.  <H5>  Why Fadlallah? </H5>   Because Fadlallah, according to his own assessment, is the  one who controls the party, he is the one who will use this  control to get the party to block an agreement between Lebanon  and Israel, that is, if he takes no action about any agreement,  which Damascus might reach with Israel in the context of the  prescribed settlement.    Will he decide to confront Israel's coming agreements with  Lebanon and with Syria? Will he object to them and fight against  them, or will he be satisfied with the lesson of the al-Ghubayri  demonstration? Will he give his political concerns a religious  dimension, which he will be careful to extend beyond the  boundaries of Lebanon?    An answer to that question will not be long in coming. From  now on let us watch Lebanon much more closely than we did any  time in the past.</p>

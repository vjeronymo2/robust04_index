			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANY SEPTIC TANK USERS STILL PAYING SEWER FEES;  </P> <P> UTILITY: SEVERAL PACOIMA FAMILIES FILE CLAIMS WITH THE CITY. BUT OFFICIALS SAY  THAT EVEN IF REFUNDS ARE GRANTED, THEY WILL BE FOR 12 MONTHS ONLY.  </P> <P> Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of mostly low-income Los Angeles residents  whose homes are connected to septic tanks have been paying more than $100  annually in sewer fees for as long as 12 years because they are unaware that  they must ask the city to stop billing them.  </P> <P> The residents, many of them immigrants who speak little or no English,  apparently have not noticed or do not understand annual English-only water bill  inserts explaining how to be exempted from sewer fees, city officials  acknowledge. Otherwise, the fees -- averaging $10.43 per month for a  single-family dwelling -- are billed to water customers automatically.  </P> <P> Even if an exemption is granted, the city will refund charges only for the 12  months preceding the date it was requested, officials said. Thus, a septic tank  user who unwittingly has been paying the fees since Los Angeles began assessing  them to residential customers in 1978 could have forfeited hundreds of dollars.  </P> <P> "It's like the city is robbing me -- just like in Mexico," said Pedro  Velasquez, a Pacoima gardener who estimates he has paid about $600 in sewer  fees since buying his home in 1985. He learned in January that he was entitled  to an exemption.  </P> <P> On Friday, lawyers with San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services filed a  claim with the city on behalf of Velasquez and seven other Pacoima residents  seeking reimbursement for unwarranted sewer fees. The claimant who has paid the  fees the longest, Robert Alvarez, bought his home on Brownell Street in 1981  and has never been hooked up to the sewer.  </P> <P> The problem arises because the city charges sewer fees to water customers based  on the amount of water consumed, on the theory that a portion of the water ends  up in the sewage system.  </P> <P> But the city does not know which water customers are connected to sewers  because parcel maps showing sewer connections are often outdated or inaccurate,  said Fred Hoeptner, a senior civil engineer with the Los Angeles Department of  Public Works waste water management division.  </P> <P> The city would have to send inspectors to each of the 733,380 parcels in Los  Angeles to determine which are on the sewer system, he said. Until such a count  is made, the city will continue to bill septic tank users for sewer service  unless they seek an exemption, he said.  </P> <P> Department of Public Works officials estimate that there are 590,000 sewer  hookups and that 3% of the city's residents live in dwellings served by septic  tanks.  </P> <P> Fred Nakamura, the attorney who filed the claim with the city, said many  low-income renters who pay their own water bills might not know whether the  property has a septic tank or sewer service and are continuing to pay the fees.  </P> <P> Neither Nakamura nor city officials could estimate how many people qualify for  the exemptions but have not asked for them.  </P> <P> The claim submitted on behalf of the eight Pacoima residents, who live along a  stretch of Brownell Street that has no sewer access, says the current billing  system violates state unfair business-practice and other laws.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the northeast  Valley, said he agrees that the billing system should be changed. "I think  administratively it's easier, but whether it's fair or not is another  question," he said.  </P> <P> The residents intend to sue the city if the claim is denied, a result that  Nakamura said is likely. Nakamura said the lawsuit would contend that the city  intentionally misled customers and that the plaintiffs were falsely led to  believe the fee was appropriate because public agencies are expected to obey  the law.  </P> <P> The claim filed Friday grew out of an unsuccessful effort by Brownell Street  resident Esteban Gallardo, 46, to obtain a sewer-fee exemption. According to  Gallardo, the Department of Water and Power threatened to cut off water to his  house, which he has rented since 1986, if he refused to pay the fee.  </P> <P> Last December, Gallardo mentioned the problem to neighbor Graciela Lopez, who  advised him to contact the legal-aid organization.  </P> <P> After Nakamura and other legal-aid attorneys heard Gallardo's story, they  knocked on doors in the man's neighborhood to see if others had the same  problem.  </P> <P> Like Gallardo, who is unemployed and on welfare, many of the claimants are poor  and speak little or no English. Many of them rent the small, ranch-style houses  whose loosely tended front yards are marked by square, wood septic tank lids.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. John Haggerty, who represents the Department of  Public Works, denied that the city has violated any laws. He said the city code  clearly states that residents may seek only a year's worth of damages when  making claims.  </P> <P> But for the residents of Brownell Street who are seeking refunds, there was  nothing proper about the way their money ended up in city coffers.  </P> <P> "We didn't know until January" that the sewer fees were not required, said  Margarita Velasquez, 17, Pedro Velasquez's daughter. "We were very upset. They  were charging us for something we didn't have."  </P></p>

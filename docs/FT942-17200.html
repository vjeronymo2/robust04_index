			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Celsis dismisses chief executive Celsis, a biotechnology company floated 10 months ago, said yesterday that it had 'dismissed' its chief executive Mr Tony Martin on the grounds that he had been 'ineffectual'. Mr John Precious, chairman, said that Mr Martin 'has not been able to grow in the way we needed a chief executive to grow'. Mr Martin joined the company just over a year ago and saw it through flotation. He leaves with two years of a three-year Pounds 90,000 contract still to run and has a 3 per cent stake in the company. Under stock exchange rules he is not allowed to sell the shares until July 1995. Mr Martin is consulting his solicitors. A shortlist of potential candidates for the chief executive post is understood to have been drawn up and some interviews have already taken place. The departure of Mr Martin is a reminder that the risks associated with the biotechnology industry go beyond the scientific. Few large US biotechnology companies still have the chief executives that presided over their flotations. Celsis executives said that they regarded their ability to dismiss the chief executive so soon after flotation as 'a virtue'. The company, which is developing equipment to test for contamination during the manufacture of food, drinks, cosmetics and drugs, raised Pounds 12.4m in a flotation that was nearly four times subscribed. The flotation price was 100p and the shares yesterday fell 4p to 78p. Celsis concluded a Dollars 700,000 collaborative agreement with Merck, the biggest US drugs company, in February. But Mr Mark Clement, finance director, said that Mr Martin had not been involved with that deal. Mr Chris Evans, the founder of Celsis and the man who recruited Mr Martin, said that he was appointed 'because of his perceived track record'. Mr Martin, 40, had been managing director of the diagnostics arm of one of the UK's biggest biotechnology companies, British Biotechnology. Before that he had held development and marketing positions with Procter and Gamble, the US consumer goods manufacturer, and Amersham International, the radioactive products supplier.

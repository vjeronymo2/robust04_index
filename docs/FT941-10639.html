			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Far East sell-off hits HSBC The near 10 per cent slide in the Hong Kong stock market sent related shares in London tumbling on very high volumes as cash flooded out of the Far Eastern markets and into the US to take advantage of higher interest rates. The Hang Seng Index fell more then 6 per cent in official trading and 3 per cent during London trading hours. In the UK, HSBC was the biggest casualty in the FT-SE 100, losing 83 to 1016p in the London registered with turnover hitting 15m, and 80 to 1037p in the Hong Kong registered on volume of 4.6m. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered plummeted 51 to 1380p. Caution increased as traders discovered that Nomura, the Japanese brokerage, had cut its recommended weighting of Hong Kong stocks in its global equity portfolio to zero from 3 per cent.</p>

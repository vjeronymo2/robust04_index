			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Labour leader ready for battle in parliament IT PROMISES to be an exciting debut. At his election as Labour leader Mr John Smith's greatest regret was that he had no opportunity to tackle the prime minister in the chamber before the Commons rose for its summer recess. Now both he and Mr Gordon Brown, his shadow chancellor, will make their first appearance on the parliamentary stage in their new roles in next Thursday's hothouse debate on the economy. A wounded prime minister and chancellor will have to make their defence in a bear pit, aware that many on their own back benches will be as sceptical as the opponents they face. Yesterday a Labour pack, led by Mr Brown and Mr Smith, were tearing into the corpse of the government economic policy that died in the foreign exchange markets on Black Wednesday. In back rooms, researchers were dredging through recent government speeches for the numerous statements on the pound and the ERM for ammunition to fire in next week's debate. Yet the smug chorus of 'We told you so' from Labour cannot disguise the fact that, by insisting on staying in the ERM and opposing devaluation, Messrs Smith and Brown were genuflecting to the very exchange rate policy advocated by their opponents. There are plenty of explanations for that. Not least, if the Labour leadership had argued the case for devaluation it would have been accused of economic defeatism, of advocating stop-go, high-spending policies, even of that unspeakable sin, 'talking the pound down'. Because they did not do so, as one assiduous propagandist pointed out yesterday, 'the Tories cannot now use the 'party of devaluation' charge as a stick to beat us with'. All that bears some truth. But a credibility problem remains over what Labour will say when the Conservatives hit back with the inevitable question: What would you have done? So far, attempts by journalists to pose that to the Labour leaders have been dodged. Once off the offensive, Mr Smith and Mr Brown have argued that Labour would never have found itself in the circumstances that the government encountered on Wednesday. Had they been elected in April, they say, their recovery programme of job creation, fiscal incentives to industry and other shorter-term measures would by now have started to generate enough confidence to have seen off pressure on the pound. Raise a sceptical eyebrow at that claim and the next response is that Labour would also have used the European Community presidency to seek international co-operation to bolster recovery across the Continent. If that still does not wash, the Labour leadership's loyalists insist that a Smith government would at least have seen the writing on the wall sooner than Mr Major and, if it were necessary, raised interest rates earlier to head off a collapse of confidence in sterling. Such claims may just pass muster as sound bites on the news programmes. But they have generated a fair deal of scepticism on Labour's benches, both back and front. Before this week's debacle in the foreign exchange markets, the lobby for a change of tack on ERM policy - and on the whole Maastricht treaty - had been growing. Mr Bryan Gould, the arch-Euro-sceptic, had led a chorus of frontbench doubters, and overtly pro-Maastricht Labour MPs had questioned the leadership's line as lacking in credibility. Mr Brian Sedgemore, the former anti-European turned quasi-federalist leftwinger for Hackney South and Shoreditch, has proved one of the most adept at arguing that Mr Smith's standpoint has undermined Labour's credibility. 'What we have been arguing is that you can have the same fiscal deficit, or perhaps a slightly larger one, significant cuts in interest rates and still maintain the parity of the pound at DM2.95 - it has been moonshine,' he said. 'Furthermore, some who have argued it have not believed it.' Labour, he goes on, can say that it has kept its virility as a non-devaluationist party. But the downside is that the leadership must now devise a new grand strategy with its credibility impaired. How much all that will matter in the debate next Thursday remains to be seen. Certainly the critical spotlight will be on the government, not the opposition. With devaluation a fait accompli and the French referendum outcome creating an opportunity to devise a fresh Labour policy on Maastricht and the economy, the Commons on Thursday will also offer Mr Smith a Godsent chance to demonstrate his debating skills on Mr Major as the prelude to a resounding reception in Blackpool. But already some niggling doubts over his economic caution and strategic judgment have been raised. Mr Smith knows he must be sure his shots hit their mark.</p>

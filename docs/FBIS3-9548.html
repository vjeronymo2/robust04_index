If presidential elections were to take place in Romania and  the candidates to run for the presidency would be the same as in  the 1992 election campaign, 37 percent would be likely to opt  for Emil Constantinescu [1992 candidate of the opposition  electoral alliance], 27 percent for [current Romanian President]  Ion Iliescu, and 10 percent for Gheorghe Funar (National  Romanian Unity Party -- PUNR.) Worth mentioning is that 20  percent of those polled said that they would abstain from vote.    As for a potential call of parliamentary elections, 30  percent of the electorate would favor the Democratic Convention  of Romania (CDR -- opposition,) while 23 percent would vote for  the ruling party, the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR].    Some 35 percent of the polled people view that a government  formed by the opposition would be much successful in getting the  country out of the crisis, 31 percent consider that the crisis  could be overcome by a coalition government formed by the  current ruling party together with the CDR opposition group and  the Democratic Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN], while 20  percent are of the opinion that much suited would be a coalition  government consisting of the PDSR with the PUNR, the Socialist  Party of Labor [PSM], and the Greater Romania Party [PRM], which  currently are the main government backers. Worth mentioning is  that 14 percent of the polled people are of the opinion that a  PDSR government would be most suited to get the country out of  the crisis.    Among the politicians in the current parliamentary majority,  in the event that Ion Iliescu would not run for the presidential  elections, 39 percent of the electorate are likely to opt for  Adrian Nastase, the current speaker of the Chamber of Deputies  and executive chairman of the PDSR, 21 percent for Gheorghe  Funar, current chairman of the PUNR, and 10 percent are favoring  Corneliu Vadim Tudor, the current chairman of the PRM.    The poll was carried out over 1-7 March 1994 on 1,100  individuals in 65 localities in the rural areas and in Romanian  towns.</p>

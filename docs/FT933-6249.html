			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: International bond funds THE TABLE shows the 10 highest-performing international bond funds in the year to August 1. The average growth rate was 26 per cent and the top six funds managed returns of at least 30 per cent, according to figures from Micropal. Philip Saunders, manager of Guinness Flight's Global High Income bond trust, said the 'bumper capital gains' had been achieved mainly because of the fall in the value of sterling once it left the exchange rate mechanism last September. 'Currency returns can account for more than 50 per cent of returns in international bond funds. Sterling investors have been protected from the devaluation, which is part of the reason for holding an internationally-based portfolio,' he added. Caroline Hay, manager of Newton's international bond fund, also said the gains arose from an investment strategy which recognised that interest rates in Europe would fall and the ERM was unsustainable. Her fund has benefited from the strength of the yen relative to the dollar since increasing its yen holding at the beginning of the year; the fund has now switched to being overweight in dollars. Both funds attribute their relatively high yields to investing in the high-yielding Italian and Spanish bond markets, but the Guinness Flight fund aims for income while Newton goes for total return. Neither manager expects the same level of capital returns over the next year. But both say there are further gains to be made and bond funds will continue to offer a higher fixed rate of income than cash. Whittingdale's fund is dollar-denominated and invests only in short-dated US government bonds. Its performance in sterling terms is determined by that of the dollar; for sterling investors, this has meant capital gains as sterling has weakened against the dollar in the past year. Minimum investment is Dollars 2,000, with an initial charge of 1.25 per cent and an annual charge of 1 per cent. The initial charges for the Guinness Flight fund are on a sliding scale depending on the level of investment. The minimum for this is Pounds 1,000 and the highest charge of 3.5 per cent is for investments up to Pounds 9,999. The lowest charge - of 1 per cent - is on Pounds 50,000 and above. The annual fee is 0.75 per cent. Newton's international bond fund has a 2 percentage point discount off its 6 per cent initial charge and has waived its 1.25 per cent annual management fee, both for an unspecified period. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 HIGHEST PERFORMING INTERNATIONAL BOND FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                         Size (Pounds m)     Yield (%)    Perf*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Guinness Fl Gbl High               12.1             7.4       32.0 Whittingdale US Shrt                4.6               0       31.2 Newton Intl Bond                    2.7             6.8       31.8 Perpetual Global Bond              78.8             6.4       31.8 CU PPT Global Bond                  7.0             5.4       31.7 S&amp;P Intl Bond                      24.2             5.2       30.2 Norwich Intl Bond                  30.0             5.3       29.8 Legal &amp; Gen Intl Bond               1.3             4.6       29.7 Invesco Intl Bond                   4.1             5.5       28.7 Cannon Intl Currency               28.7             5.0       27.4 Sector average                     32.8             5.4       26.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal ** As of August 1* Offer-to-bid with net income reinvested over year to August 1.

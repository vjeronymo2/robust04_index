			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Morocco in more state sell-offs Morocco will sell its stakes in five enterprises with a total turnover of Dirhams 3.85bn (Dollars 438.4m) this year, the Privatisation Ministry said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rabat. The state has 35-99 per cent of the five groups: Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur (BMCE), the Simef diesel and electric motor maker, the Sonasid steel mill, the Somas oil company and the Sochepresse publication distributor. 'We expect to put on the market our stakes in these units before the end of the year,' the ministry said. Privatisation Minister Abderrahman Saaidi stated on Monday that the five units 'will be ceded as soon as the Societe Nationale d'Investissement, the state investment agency, is privatised.' The government calls for bids today for its 67 per cent stake in SNI, of which 16 per cent will be placed on the Casablanca bourse before the end of October. Since January, 12 state-owned enterprises have been sold off, officials said. 'Earnings from privatisation are estimated at Dirhams 900m in the first nine months of 1994,' the minister added. BMCE and Sonasid have turnovers of Dirhams 1.969bn and Dirhams 1.603bn respectively and will be sold off quickly, Casablanca brokers said. When presenting the budget earlier this year, the Finance Ministry said the current privatisation programme would bring the state treasury an estimated Dirhams 3.5bn in 1994. 'We are on the right track. I am optimistic. We hope to reach the target by the end of the year because our plan is to privatise up to 40 enterprises before January 1994,' Mr Saaidi declared. The Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development has made a Dollars 72.5m-equivalent loan to Morocco towards financing electricity and irrigation projects under accords signed in Rabat on Monday. A first loan will finance 23 per cent of the cost of connecting the Spanish and Moroccan electricity grids. A second will cover 36 per cent of the cost of completing an irrigation network on the north bank of the Loukkos River in north Morocco. Both loans are for 17 years with five-year grace periods and carry 4.5 per cent interest, officials said. Since 1975, the fund has contributed finance to 26 projects in Morocco for the equivalent of Dollars 966m.</p>

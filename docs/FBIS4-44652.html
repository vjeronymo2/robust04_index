			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of Trade and Industry: </F> "Tim Sainsbury Launches New 3 Million Pounds Electronics  Initiative"]    [Text] Electronics will be the world's largest industrial  sector by the year 2000. And, today, Industry Minister Tim  Sainsbury launched a new initiative to help make sure that the  British electronics sector stays ahead of the competition.    The UK has the fourth largest electronics industry in the  world. With a turnover of &pound;30 billion the sector accounts  for  15 percent of Britain's visible exports.    Microelectronics in Business will promote wider use of  Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) -- with the  help of &pound;3 million funding from the DTI [Department of  Trade  and Industry].    Launching the initiative at a Federation of the Electronics  Industry lunch, Mr Sainsbury said:    `Electronics is not just a growing industry in itself; it  makes a critical contribution to all other sectors of industry  and commerce. Process control, analytical instrumentation,  medical healthcare and information technology are all the result  of the application of electronics research and technology.    `So the efficiency and competitiveness of the UK electronics  sector is of crucial importance to the rest of industry.    `Microelectronics in Business will promote the use of ASICs,  which can improve product performance and contribute to major  reductions in size, weight and manufacturing costs; highly  important selling points in today's increasingly competitive  markets.    `The programme will improve awareness and inform about  business opportunities through a series of regional seminars and  workshops.    `And it will provide the essential technical training  through  several regional support centres. The first two centres in  Bournemouth and Bolton are already open for business.    `The DTI has also taken other initiatives to help the  electronics industry.    `The department's new Electronics and Electrical Engineering  division has been talking to companies and trade associations to  understand better how we can help.    `Last year Michael Heseltine announced a new Benchmarking  Challenge for Trade Associations. Two of the successful  applicants in the first round are in the electronics sector. The  Printed Circuit Interconnection Federation is benchmarking best  practice in manufacturing productivity while The Semiconductor  Business Association is looking at best practice in the  relationship between suppliers, designers and customers of ASICs.    `We have continued to support the Japan Electronics Business  Association which helps British electronic component suppliers  sell more effectively to Japanese firms manufacturing in the UK.    `On the export side, European task forces have been  established with the DTI. Two, covering electronic components  and public sector security have existed for some time. A new one  will cover the increasingly important area of contract assembly  -- and tackle the German market.    `All of these initiatives demonstrate the Government's  recognition of the growing importance of the industry. We are  committed to an active dialogue and partnership with  manufacturing industry to help them win in world markets.'</p>

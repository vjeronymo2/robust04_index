			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Arts: The Rake's Progress casts its shadow - Opera The decade of Thatcher's Britain is a happy hunting-ground for experimental theatre companies. Against a backdrop of Canary Wharf almost any play or opera about wealth and poverty, greed and downfall, can be made to seem relevant. In its previous work, Opera Factory has not shown any great inclination to make political points, but it does in its new production of Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. The Faustian theme of a rake who makes a pact with the devil easily fits the 1980s, when people sold their souls en masse for material gain. In David Freeman's production, the rake sets out in search of riches, only to end up paying the price in cardboard city. Stravinsky and Auden called their Mephistophelean figure Nick Shadow. He enters here as the very devil of a life insurance salesman, selling policies with a sting in the tail. Later he appears in other incarnations as a leather-clad thug, a clown, and a magician. Geoffrey Dolton, a marvellous character-player as always, makes each one come vividly to life. It is not his fault that the music was written for a more saturnine voice than his. At first, it looks as though this is going to be a concept production in which the concept actually works, but Freeman knows little self-restraint and Opera Factory's usual cliches soon obscure the thrust of the argument. The scene in Mother Goose's brothel is an early warning of what is to come. A chorus of punks roll about the stage, amusing themselves with a variety of kinky sex-games. (Wouldn't a Mars bar party have been more topical?) By the time of the auction scene, the production has degenerated into a knock-down sale of second-hand ideas from the experimental theatre producer's handbook. Howard Milner as Sellem the auctioneer finds his own role under the hammer, reduced to little more than a gibbering idiot. Annabelle Cheetham is allowed to play an unexaggerated Mother Goose. Susannah Self as the bearded lady, Baba the Turk, has become a hermaphrodite; Tom McDonnell as Trulove quietly tends his geraniums. Fortunately the main couple make a touching pair of modern youngsters. As Tom Rakewell, Mark Tucker struggles somewhat with a role that is heavy for his tenor, but wins through in the end. Mary Plazas makes a delightfully vulnerable Anne Trulove, who shapes her aria with style. The most impressive contribution to the evening is the playing of the Premiere Ensemble, conducted with elan by Mark Wigglesworth. Stravinsky may have intended the score to be dry and ascetic, but Wigglesworth milks it for every drop of emotion. Although there are some good things in it, this Rake's Progress falls short of a return to Opera Factory's best days. The world of opera has moved on since the company was founded in 1982 and, as with the Thatcher revolution, its leaders should be questioning where they go from here. Otherwise impending bankruptcy may soon decide the issue for them. Further performances at the Queen Elizabeth Hall until 15 May, then in Lisbon and Birmingham</p>

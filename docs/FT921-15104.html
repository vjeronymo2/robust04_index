			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead CONGLOMERATES may be out of fashion, but Tomkins is expected to deliver a healthy interim profit increase of perhaps 35 per cent on Monday. With Philips Industries, acquired in August 1990, contributing to the full six months, pre-tax profits are estimated to have risen from Pounds 31.2m to about Pounds 42m. Two thirds of the group's sales are in the US and Murray Ohio, maker of lawnmowers and bicycles, is thought to have performed particularly well. Stockbroker analysts in the City expect TSB, the sixth largest UK banking group, to announce a pre-tax loss of between Pounds 30m and Pounds 60m for 1991, when its annual results are published on Thursday. TSB may have to put aside about Pounds 665m in provisions against bad loans. A year ago TSB posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 312m, but heavy losses by Hill Samuel, its merchant banking arm, drove it into a Pounds 150m pre-tax loss at the half-way stage. Asda, the hard-pressed grocery chain, is due to announce a ghastly set of full-year results on Wednesday. The food retailing industry has recently been affected by a worrying fall in sales volumes and Asda has suffered more than most. It is believed that sales at some of its older stores have been running more than 8 per cent down on last year, causing a heavy erosion of margins. Small shifts in sales can have a huge impact on profits because of grocers' high operational gearing and analysts have therefore forecast a wide spread of profits estimates ranging from Pounds 5m to Pounds 35m. Last year Asda made Pounds 58.6m at the half-year stage. Stakis, the hotel and nursing homes group where Sir Lewis Robertson took over as chairman last March, produces its full year results on Tuesday. At the half year stage Stakis lost Pounds 45.1m, including Pounds 44m write-offs as part of Sir Lewis's rescue, which included the sacking of Andros Stakis as chief executive. Analysts are forecasting a full year pre-tax loss to the end of September of between Pounds 47m and Pounds 50m varying according to their assessments of how badly Stakis has traded in the second half, during which it has sold its pubs but not disposed of its casinos.</p>

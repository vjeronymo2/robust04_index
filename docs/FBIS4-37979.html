			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, "president of </F> the Democratic Republic of Yemen," in Hadhramaut, by MBC news  reader Nicole Tannuri in London, on 26 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Tannuri] 'Ali Salim al-Bid, president of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen, has stated that international  recognition of his republic is a matter of time. This was  stated in an exclusive telephone interview conducted by the MBC  center today. In the beginning we asked al-Bid about the reasons  for the failure of all the cease-fire agreements.    [Al-Bid] The leadership in Sanaa has chosen the course of  war. It insists on not stopping the war [words indistinct].  Therefore, it only resorts to this course to achieve its  objective. However, this is a dead end and they cannot achieve  anything.    [Tannuri] The UN Security Council denounced the northern  shelling of south Yemen. The Council might issue a resolution  on sending UN forces to Yemen. What is your stand on this?    [Al-Bid] We always support international legitimacy. We  supported Security Council Resolution 924. We will always  support international legitimacy because we aspire to stability  and peace for us and for everyone. However, we do not expect  Sanaa to respond positively. The mentality of the leadership in  Sanaa is different. We highly appraise the recent U.S. position  which contains a clear warning. However, we hope this will be  followed by tangible steps that will translate words on paper  into real action. I believe the Sanaa regime will not stop.  [words indistinct] What does 'Ali 'Abdallah want to do to  Yemen?    [Tannuri] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, do you have any  indications that some states will recognize your declared state?    [Al-Bid] Regarding recognition, we are there on the spot.  We are fighting for the third month. [words indistinct] We  are there. Our relations and contacts are continuing with  several fraternal and friendly states. I am confident that the  world will deal with reality. This steadfast people in Aden and  all the parts of the Democratic Republic of Yemen deserve  recognition. They will acquire recognition deservedly through  more steadfastness and sacrifice.</p>

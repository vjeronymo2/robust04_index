			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry of the Saddam regime has  recalled a number of ambassadors and heads of missions abroad to  discuss urgent issues. This came in a circulation issued by the  ministry a few days ago. The ministry is expected to discuss  with these diplomats the method of action in the next phase.  Iraqi opposition sources expect the regime to embark on  diplomatic transfers on charges of dereliction of duties  following the sharp criticism of Iraqi diplomacy made by 'Udayy  Saddam Husayn through his newspaper BABIL.    An Iraqi diplomat, who asked to remain anonymous, revealed  that a circular was issued by the Iraqi Intelligence Command to  its offices in Iraqi embassies to activate their efforts and to  contact Iraqis abroad to attract them to return to Iraq.    The intelligence office in the Iraqi regime embassy in  Jordan  embarked on an organized campaign to exert pressure on Iraqi  writers, who are in Amman, to return to Iraq and to warn them  against issuing any anti-regime writings. The source added that  a ranking Iraqi intelligence officer, Hikmat al-Haju, joined the  Amman Embassy staff to replace the second man in the embassy and  to supervise intelligence activities together with two other  employees who were assigned to the embassy earlier. The source  added that a new plan has been set to utilize trade and  commercial centers to collect information and to monitor the  movements of Iraqis through recruiting agents among them as fake  reporters and propagation employees who deal with Gulf papers.    In another development, Interior Minister Watban al-Tikriti,  Saddam's half-brother, has been charged with the chairmanship of  the Higher Council for National Security, including the heads of  the Departments of Intelligence, Private Security, Military  Intelligence, and Internal Public Security. This council will  coordinate among the security departments and its affiliated  institutions to tackle the emergency situation that is expected  to explode in the country.</p>

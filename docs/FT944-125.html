			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Athena's debts 'closer to Pounds 15m' Athena Holdings' external creditors are owed between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m, according to the administrative receivers appointed to the failed card and poster shop group this week. Mr Scott Barnes, one of the two receivers and a partner with Grant Thornton, said yesterday that the figure was 'probably nearer Pounds 15m'. He was not able to estimate how much of the debt was guaranteed by Pentos. 'There are a number of creditors, and a number of landlords who are guaranteed by the holding company - but we are not talking about a huge sum of money,' he said. The biggest creditors are likely to be the landlords of Athena's shops, who are owed about Pounds 3.5m. Of the total 157 outlets, 127 are owned by Athena Holdings and 30 held under franchise agreements. Athena's suppliers, which include a number of smaller companies that are unlikely to recover any of their money, could be hardest hit by the receivership. They are angry about the timing of the decision to put Athena into receivership and have sought legal advice about Pentos' action. The Pentos management is understood to be sympathetic to the plight of the smaller suppliers but insists that the timing of the decision to put Athena into administrative receivership was dictated by the failure of talks with potential buyers of the business. Mr Bill McGrath, chief executive of Pentos, has said that the group was willing to 'give Athena away'. However, it is understood that the talks mainly foundered because of problems with assigning over the shop leases. Meanwhile, the receivers hope to have developed a survival strategy by the middle of next week. Mr Barnes said: 'Our strategy is that we want to get our feet under the table and see which of the shops are viable. We will probably be left with a rump that we will be able to do something with.' One option understood to be under consideration is the closure of the 20 or 30 shops thought to be mainly responsible for Athena's losses. The company lost Pounds 5m before exceptional items on sales of Pounds 16.2m in the six months to July 2.</p>

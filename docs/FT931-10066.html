			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (2): It's been a moving experience for many - Tony Jackson discusses the performance of companies as they prepared for the single market and suggests the most worrying aspect has been the lay-offs of staff by the giants / European industry THIS year's FT500 rankings show European industry on the brink of entry to the single market. It is thus tempting to scan the lists for clues on how companies have been preparing themselves for this brave new world. Sure enough, last year saw some significant mergers and takeovers. But most of the big moves in the rankings can be put down to more humdrum causes: recession, industry trends or the actions (often blunders) of the companies themselves. One big takeover which legitimately belongs in a single market context is that of Perrier by Nestle. Like its rival food giant Unilever, Nestle has been particularly active in adapting and extending itself to cope with the more competitive conditions of the wider market. The takeover, which brought together the 8th and 226th ranking companies from 1991, cost Nestle Pounds 1.6bn. Another big Euro-merger has yet to show up in the tables, since it had not been formally concluded at the FT500 cut-off date. The publishing houses Reed International of the UK and Elsevier of Holland, ranking around 80th and 100th respectively, announced their intention to merge their operations in September. The two parent companies will continue as separately listed quoted companies. Their combined market value would rank them in the low 40s, above Lloyds Bank or Barclays. Another merged company to rank above Lloyds is HSBC, the product of last year's takeover of Midland Bank (ranking 140 in 1991) by the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank. This must be particularly vexing for Lloyds, which fought HSBC for control of Midland and lost. HSBC, which qualifies for the rankings by virtue of being UK-based, is now the second biggest European bank after Deutsche Bank. Mergers apart, a worrying aspect of the single market is recalled by the table on Europe's biggest employers. Most of the top names have been in the news lately because of massive lay-offs. BT made 33,000 staff redundant last year alone. Daimler-Benz is to lose 40,000 jobs by the end of next year. The other big car makers are not far behind. Some of this is the result of recession. Another important cause is the increased efficiency resulting from operating in a wider market, and the need to reduce overheads to cope with the more competitive conditions which result. Within manufacturing industry, the sector which stood out in the rankings last year - not for the first time - was pharmaceuticals. The largest rise within the 500 came from Institut Merieux, the French vaccine manufacturer, which rose more than 200 places. Not far behind was Gehe, the German pharmaceutical wholesaler. Roche of Switzerland, best known as the manufacturer of Valium, shot up from 18th place into the top 10. Glaxo maintained its position in the top three, jostling with BT. On the face of it, this is surprising. The financial press throughout the year was full of tales about cash-strapped governments around the world trying to force down drug prices. But these are recessionary times; and as investors are acutely aware, pharmaceuticals are the classically recession-proof industry. In good times or bad, people still get sick. The dominance of the drug industry within manufacturing can be illustrated in another way. As might be expected in the mature economies of Europe, the top 50 companies are heavily weighted towards services and consumer goods such as food and drink. Only 16 of this year's top 50 are in industrial manufacturing, including electronics, engineering, motors and so forth. Of these 16, seven are drug companies. But if the drug companies stood out within manufacturing, they still had to give place last year to services. The sectors showing the fastest average rise in the tables were business services and software, publishing, broadcasting and food retailing. Conversely, the biggest average falls came in aerospace and defence, construction and office equipment. This will be partly the effect of recession, since falls in demand are most acutely felt in capital intensive industries with high operational gearing. But it may perhaps reflect a longer trend towards European manufacturing losing ground relative to the European economy, and by implication to the growth economies of the Far East. One company of which that cannot be said is SMH, the Swiss company which makes Swatch and Longines watches. SMH has just rounded off the first decade of its existence by challenging Citizen of Japan for the title of the world's biggest watchmaker. Last year it rose some 170 places. Some other fast-rising companies similarly represented one-off success. De La Rue of the UK, the bank note printer, which has been a darling of the London stock market for some time, rose by some 170 places as well. Sophus Berendsen of Denmark, which controls another UK stock market darling, the diversified service company Rentokil, rose 144 places. Among the year's losers, one of the most striking was Italmobiliare of Italy. This company illustrated to perfection the general truth that ambitious acquirers can go down as well as up. In May an Italmobiliare subsidiary, the cement producer Italcementi, paid FFr6bn for a controlling stake in its French opposite number Ciments Francais. It then emerged that the French company had lost FFr665m in off-balance sheet dealings in shares. Italmobiliare was ranked 107th in the 1991 FT500. It has now vanished from the rankings. Disastrous dabbling in the financial markets was something of a speciality of the building trade last year. One of the biggest falls in the rankings was that of Skanska, Scandinavia's biggest construction group. It emerged in September that a Skanska executive had been engaged in unauthorised speculation in the foreign exchange markets. The company lost SKr1.2bn (Dollars 222m), the boss resigned and Skanska fell more than 200 places.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     EUROPEAN SECTOR PROFITABILITY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           No of      % Sector                                      cos   chge  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Auto parts tyre &amp; rubber                      6  357.7 Electrical equipment                          9  102.9 Investment companies                          2   46.1 Retail-speciality                             7   23.7 Drugs                                        15   22.0 Transport/storage &amp; warehousing              17   20.3 Electronics/instrumentation                   4   17.1 Electric &amp; water utilities                   47   13.4 Broadcasting media                            4   13.0 Commercial banks                             58   12.0 Retail-dept store/gen merchandise            15    7.5 Food processors                              23    6.6 Heavy shipbuilding &amp; engineering              1    5.4 Apparel/textile producers                     2    5.3 Health care/cosmetics                         6    5.3 Telephone companies                           4    3.0 Financial services                            6    1.7 Business servs &amp; computer software            6   -0.6 Insurance/life/agents &amp; brokers               6   -1.7 Chemicals                                     4   -2.1 Beverages &amp; tobacco                          15   -2.3 Household durables &amp; consumer goods           9   -2.5 Advertising                                   1   -2.6 Fabricated metal prods &amp; containers           5   -2.8 Property                                      5   -3.0 Financial institutions                        8   -3.9 Publishers inc newspapers                    11   -3.9 Retail-grocery chains                        15   -5.1 Communications &amp; office equipment             4   -5.2 Insurance/multiline/property                 31   -5.9 Natural gas utilities                         2   -6.4 Paper &amp; paper products                        5  -13.6 Diversified holding companies                22  -14.1 Chemicals-diversified                        22  -18.4 Diversified industrial manu                  10  -18.7 Construction &amp; building materials            17  -19.2 Entertainment &amp; leisure                       7  -19.9 Automobiles                                   6  -27.0 Oil-Internationals/crude producers           12  -28.2 Construction                                 10  -30.1 Aerospace/defence/aircraft manu               3  -30.7 Machinery (composite)                        14  -32.3 Mining &amp; extractive industries               12  -36.2 Wholesale-nondurables                         2  -36.8 Restaurants &amp; hotels                          3  -45.3 Forestry products                             4  -65.1 Oil-petroleum products                        3  -65.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    EUROPE'S MOST PROFITABLE COMPANIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       Top 500 Company                             Cntry     Sec.

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORDS, ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> FOSS: "Orpheus and Euridice"; "Renaissance Flute Concerto"; "Solomon Rossi"  Suite. Yehudi Menuhin and Edna Michell, violins; Carol Wincenc, flute; Brooklyn  Philharmonic, conducted by Foss.  </P> <P> New World Records, NW 375-2 (compact disc). Renaissance and Baroque styles, in  well-performed, modern instrumental dress, spring alive in the beautiful  concerto and suite. The 1983 revision of the original 1972 "Orpheus" is a  sparely scored yet terrifying evocation of a descent into hell, with an  impassioned love duet (two violins) before violent death. WILLIAM RATLIFF  </P></p>

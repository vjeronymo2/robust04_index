			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US railroads Union Pacific's desire to create the US's largest railroad company by buying Santa Fe Pacific makes strategic sense, but is unlikely to happen. If history is any guide, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the all-powerful railroad regulator, will oppose the deal because it would reduce competition. Such a decision would be a mistake. Not only would regulatory rejection deprive shareholders of a bid a third higher than Burlington Northern's competing offer, but it would hinder efforts to wring further inefficiencies out of the system. These inefficiencies, despite the recent railroad renaissance, remain legendary. The fragmented rail network is an immense burden on the US economy. It drives up costs, delays deliveries and prevents the sector winning business from road haulage. Rationalisation would also allow rail companies to cut duplicative headquarters, rail routes and repair shops, as well as expand geographical coverage and the range of products carried. The reduced costs could then be passed on to customers in the Dollars 200bn US freight market. Union Pacific is trying to allay anti-competitive fears by offering other carriers access to its routes. If the ICC is going to make the mistake of rejecting its deal, it were best done quickly. But its record suggests the body could take more than two years to come to a conclusion. That would leave all three companies derailed for the duration.</p>

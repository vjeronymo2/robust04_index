			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Motorola proceeds with Iridium MOTOROLA is to proceed with ambitious plans to build Iridium, a Dollars 3.37bn global satellite communications network for which it has been seeking co-investors. The US electronics group said it had received subscriptions and letters of intent from a number of potential investors around the world. 'We are very pleased with the worldwide interest being expressed in the Iridium programme,' said Mr John Mitchell, Motorola vice-chairman. The Iridium telecom-munications network would be designed to use hand-held, wireless telephones that communicate through a constellation of 66 low-earth orbit satellites. The network would offer subscribers voice, paging, facsimile, data and radiodetermination satellite services (RDSS). Motorola declined to identify its potential Iridium partners, and noted the commitments were non-binding and subject to conditions, including approval of certain government agencies and ratification by investors. For more than two years Motorola has been seeking to establish an international consortium which will own and operate the Iridium network. It had set a December 1992 deadline to find funding for the project. Among the parties reported to have signed letters of intent to acquire equity stakes in Iridium are the Brazilian government and United Communications of Thailand. Other companies said to have expressed interest include DDI and Kyocera of Japan. Motorola is developing the Iridium system and intends to be an investor in the consortium and the prime contractor of the system. Current plans estimate the launch of the satellites would begin in 1996, with commercial service anticipated for 1998. However, several regulatory hurdles remain as Motorola competes with other proposed satellite telephone systems for approval from the US Federal Communications Commission.</p>

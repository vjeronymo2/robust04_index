			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gong Qian: "Accent Put on Standard Mandarin"] </F>   [Text] A nationwide Putonghua--standard Mandarin--contest  has been launched in a bid to promote a common spoken form of  the Chinese language across the country.    Sponsored by the Central People's Broadcasting Station  (CPBS)  and the State Language Commission (SLC), "The Third National  Putonghua Broadcasting Contest" is being staged to further  spread the standard tongue and eliminate communication  difficulties between people speaking different dialects.    The contest will be open to participants from 30 provinces  and regions.    Each will be allowed to put forward two candidates to  compete  in the finals to be held in Beijing in October.    Entrants from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will also take  part  in the competition.    Due to the huge expanse of the People's Republic, many  regional dialects exist. With the development of a more  integrated national economy, the problems created by people  speaking local dialects has become ever more conspicuous.    "As the economic and personnel exchanges among regions  increase, the need to learn Putongua has become acute!" said  Zhong Zheming of the SLC, noting that many individual  businessmen are trying to standardize their oral ability.    Furthermore, with the advent of speech from computer  software, Putonghua is also needed as the basis for  communications between machines and men.</p>

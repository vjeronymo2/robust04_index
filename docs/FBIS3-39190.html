In  Brussels, NATO is looking into the issue of air strikes against  Serbian positions in the hills around Sarajevo. As these  reports flooded into the news room it was hard to suppress a  feeling of "deja vu."    Exactly six months ago yesterday, on 9 August 1993, the 16  ambassadors to the North Atlantic Treaty Association (NATO) sat  around a table to talk about possible military action against  the Serbs besieging Sarajevo.    There are two reasons why a real ultimatum was never issued.  First, internal disagreement in NATO, namely resistance from the  French, meant that action was impossible. Second, at the  eleventh hour the Serbs resolved to pull out of Mount Igman and  Mount Bjelasnica from where they had their guns trained on  Sarajevo.    And so history repeats itself, more or less. Yesterday the  NATO ambassadors were debating once again possible air strikes,  and once again the summit was not immediately a picture of  unanimity. However, this time NATO did manage to issue a clear  ultimatum.    The Serbs, with the international community breathing down  their necks, yesterday sought, just as they had last year, to  quickly pour oil on troubled waters by demonstrating their  willingness to withdraw their heavy artillery and by signing a  hasty cease-fire with the Muslim Forces defending Sarajevo.    The question now is whether the West will again let itself  be  wrapped up in a series of empty Serbian promises. After all, in  August of last year Serbian Leader Radovan Karadzic promised a  stage-by-stage handover of the hills to the United Nations.  Half a year later they are still encamped in the hills and are  responsible for daily deaths on the streets of Sarajevo.    NATO is now asking the Serbs to stick to their promises.  They must tie the Serbian proposals to a concrete deadline --  preferably as short as possible -- and make it crystal clear to  the Serbs what the military sanctions will be should they break  their promises.    An ultimatum can help in this, but it must not be the  umpteenth deadline that passes with no action being taken. That  would be a fatal blow for the credibility of NATO and the  international community. NATO must be prepared to accept the  military consequences of its ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs.    Separate from the issue of the military rights and wrongs of  air strikes, there is no getting away from the fact that NATO's  tougher stance has come extremely late in the day. The war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is, after all, precisely two years old. If,  in the spring of 1992, NATO, the United Nations, and the  European Union had bared their teeth and made it clear that they  were serious, then maybe the conflict in Bosnia would not have  escalated to the point it has today. After all, NATO's action  is now restricted merely to dousing the flames instead of  preventing the fire.</p>

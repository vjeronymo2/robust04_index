The cease-fire was  agreed only on Sunday [30 January] to end months of clashes  following the disputed elections last year. But the government  apparently tried to take advantage and clear the railway line to  the coast. The opposition objected and launched an attack on a  train. There were deaths and a lot of injuries. From  Brazzaville, Antoine Mouyambala telexed this report. [read by  announcer]    Two people were killed yesterday and another 30 injured when  an opposition group attacked a train, carrying a team of workmen  sent to reopen the railway line from Brazzaville to the coast.  Traffic on the line had been disrupted for the past two months  by opposition supporters, and the attack took place whilst the  train was standing in a small station at Goma Tsetse in the  opposition stronghold region of Pool, 50 km from Brazzaville.  One of the dead was a senior official from the state railway  company, and many of the wounded were soldiers who had been  escorting the train. The victims were taken to Brazzaville  yesterday afternoon, where an emergency meeting is expected to  take place today between government and opposition supporters to  discuss ways to bring the rising tide of violence in the country  to an end. Despite yesterday's train attack, a spokesman for  the pro-government presidential movement said that there would  be no reversal of their cease-fire declaration made on Sunday.</p>

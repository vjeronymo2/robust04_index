			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Royal Ins placing Shares in Royal Insurance declined 5 to 283p after the rump of the recent rights issue was placed by SG Warburg and Hoare Govett. With an 87.2 per cent take-up of the issue reported, the outstanding 20.7m shares were successfully placed with institutions at 281p. The impact of the placing, along with general profit-taking, caused a retreat in the rest of the sector. General Accident eased 7 to 576p, Commercial Union lost 8 to 589p, Sun Alliance closed 4 lighter at 357p and Legal &amp; General relinquished 6 to 460p. Banking group Standard Chartered was the strong feature in banks after a recommendation from SG Warburg sent the shares 15 ahead to 769p. Trading was, however, thin. The recommendation came after Monday's meeting with several analysts and helped boost the stock that has underperformed the rest of the sector in recent weeks. The rest of the banking group traded easier with the market. Lloyds slipped 4 to 570p. Another decline in crude oil prices continued to unsettle an oil sector already weakened by the uneasy peace agreed at last week's Opec meeting in Geneva. BP attracted a fresh wave of US sellers and settled 2 1/2 off at 307 1/2 p on turnover of 6.2m shares. Shell, in spite of the encouraging noises from Monday's investment presentation, eased to 624p. Enterprise Oil dropped 9 more to 465p. There was more downside pressure exerted on Zeneca, where the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue closes next Monday. But dealers continue to take the view that the issue is safe. 'It is a question of holding your nerve and waiting for the reward,' was the view of one market optimist. Zeneca 'old' settled 1 1/2 off at 615 1/2 p on turnover of 3.7m, and the 'new' nil-paid eased a penny to 16p with a hefty 8.2m shares traded. ICI, where the recent US buying support has dried up, softened a penny to 706p. Fisons extended its recent strong showing, the shares moving up strongly to close a further 6 1/2 ahead at 168p on heavy turnover of 5.5m. Guinness finished the day 8 lower at 485p as the acceptance was announced of a management buyout at the South Wales-based Crown Brewery. Volume was modest at 1.6m. Elsewhere, other large brewers suffered knocks, Bass losing 3 to 475p, Allied-Lyons giving up 6 to 539p and Grand Metropolitan dipping 6 to 413p. Increased talk of takeovers stalked broadcasting shares, moving Anglia Television up 12 to 329p, Central Independent ahead 7 to 1925p and Scottish Television up 3 to 486p. Reaction to its annual meeting statement pushed down Ladbroke by 6 1/2 to 171 1/2 p in turnover of 9.6m shares. One analyst said that the statement was 'a shade disappointing' although he did not see any deep-rooted problems with the leisure group, while another maintained that the shares had been overpriced and were now beginning to find their level. Ladbroke is a large player in the DIY aggressive pricing battle and its statement revealed that its Texas Homecare chain had fallen short of trade hopes so far this year. Airtours moved forward 2 to 325p while Thorn EMI fell back 7 to 880p. David Lloyd Leisure, which was floated in March in an issue that was seven times oversubscribed, was bouyed by good results and advanced 13 to 191p. After the High Court's refusal to sanction Mr Terry Venables' reinstatement as chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur, the share price lost another penny to 87p. It marks a slide of 7 in the stock, which is USM quoted, since the boardroom battle between Mr Venables and Mr Alan Sugar resumed at the court last week. Confirmation by Coats Viyella that it has increased its holding in its Indian subsidiary from 39.9 per cent to 51 per cent pushed up its share price 4 to 230p in a volume of 1.6m. The Indian government granted permission for the stake increase in the subsidiary, which is renamed Coats Viyella India. Courtaulds managed to close only a penny easier at 539p on a volume of 1.3m. Among engineers and aerospace issues, continued profit-taking left British Aerospace 7 down at 393p. Smiths Industries shed 3 to 357p following the completion of a big buying order on Monday. Vickers put on 4 at 140p, powered by a recommendation from SG Warburg. The 84 per cent jump in profits at FKI had already been discounted by the market following the stock's strong performance for most of this year. The shares eased 3 1/2 to 138p. A talk-to-the-investors session and positive comments from NatWest Securities enabled Unilever to push up 4 to 1048p with 2.6m shares traded. Share price buoyancy of the company, which is optimistic about its growth in East Asia, followed a strong showing on the previous day which had been triggered by a similar presentation in Amsterdam last Friday. Other gainers in food included Dalgety, which moved up 6 to 456p, albeit in thin trading; United Biscuits, 2 firmer at 391p; and Unigate, which added 2 at 352p. A food analyst said investors were making tentative moves back to the sector. But the picture was patchy - Cadbury-Schweppes lost 2 to 463p in a volume of 1.7m; Tate &amp; Lyle moved down 2 to 384p; J. Sainsbury lost 2 to 484p in a small volume; and Tesco gave up 2 to finish at 217p on 2.9m traded. Volex was one of the best performers in the electricals/electronics areas of the market, the shares racing up 18 to 405p after the doubled profits. News that Quality Software, recently launched on the market, had won its first order for its Universal Olas systems triggered a surge of buying interest in the company's shares, which closed 32 higher at 558p.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Brains without power: John Major's politics only partly explain the decline of UK think-tanks Think-tanks in Britain were never going to have it so good under Mr John Major as they did under his predecessor, Mrs Margaret Thatcher - at least not those of the right-of-centre variety. Mrs Thatcher was a founder of the free-market Centre for Policy Studies; would invite early advocates of privatisation from the Adam Smith Institute to weekend seminars at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence; and would read Institute of Economic Affairs pamphlets in bed. But under a prime minister elected Tory leader partly because he was less ideologically driven than Mrs Thatcher, the role of think-tanks in influencing government policymaking has receded. Mr Andrew Tyrie, a director of the Social Market Foundation, founded by members of the defunct Social Democratic party, says the change of leader explains the think-tanks' 'collapse of influence. They played a crucial role in forming the consensus that put markets first. It's only natural that they are less important now,' he says. But attributing the decline of think-tanks solely to Mr Major's more pragmatic political philosophy is misleading. Their difficulties have been compounded by the Conservative Central Office's Pounds 19m deficit, which is expected to lead to cuts in the budgets of its two internal research wings, the Conservative Research Department and the Conservative Political Centre. At the same time, Tory rifts over the Maastricht treaty have spread beyond parliament. At the Institute of Economic Affairs, the split over Mr Major's European policy led to the defection of its director, Mr Graham Mather, last year to set up the European Policy Forum. The declining importance of think-tanks in Whitehall policymaking has not dissuaded people such as Mr Mather from setting up rival institutions in an attempt to provide the 1990s with a post-Thatcherite agenda. The Social Market Foundation, which tries to link market economics with social policy, was set up in 1988 but relaunched last year with finance from Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of the retail supermarket chain. Earlier this year, Mr Martin Jacques, former editor of Marxism Today, and Mr Geoff Mulgan, former assistant to Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, launched Demos, a non-party-political but left-leaning research centre. To thrive, the new institutions will have to learn the lessons of the 1980s. Mr John Gray, the Oxford fellow who has been closely involved with both the IEA and the Centre for Policy Studies, and is now on the board of the SMF, believes rightwing think-tanks became too dogmatic - promulgating 'Thatcherism on autopilot'. 'There was a hubristic element to policymaking. With the poll tax, considerations of social equity were unimportant and it got to the stage where only policies, not society, mattered,' Mr Gray says. But will the think-tanks regain the influence they once had under the Conservatives? Arguments over the Tories' main targets for reform - trade unions, nationalised industries, health and education services - have mostly been fought and won. And, unlike in Germany, France and the US, there is little movement of people between government and think-tanks, which would have offered a better guarantee that their impact would not be diluted when political leaders changed. In France, ministers' private offices often include representatives of independent think-tanks, while in Germany, the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, the international affairs think-tank in Ebenhausen, does contract work for the government. In the US, think-tanks offer life after government for deposed politicians. 'There will always be a market for think-tanks in the US because politicians now join them when out of office: the Brookings Institution for Democrats, the American Enterprise Institute for Republicans,' says Professor Nick Wahl of New York University. In contrast, Mrs Thatcher took a deliberate decision that private think-tanks should be kept at arm's length from government. In 1982 she rejected proposals to merge the Number 10 Policy Unit (set up by Mr Harold Wilson when he was Labour prime minister in 1974) with the Central Policy Review Staff, created by Mr Edward Heath, the Tory prime minister, in 1970, as an independent source of advice for Downing Street. Merger would have bought a permanent foothold in Whitehall for the non-civil servant advisers at the CPRS. Mrs Thatcher regarded the CPRS as too institutionalised and abolished it the following year. 'As time went by it (the CPRS) concerned itself less and less with central issues and became a meddler in departmental business,' says Sir Douglas Wass, a former permanent secretary to the Treasury. Mrs Thatcher's decision had little impact during the heyday of the rightwing think-tanks that lasted until the mid-1980s. But in the 1990s think-tanks have found themselves on the political periphery. 'Think-tanks have established their place in the sun. We're semi-detached observers who do useful work and provide ideas,' says Mr Mather. 'But it's not with the same red-blooded vigour as under Mrs Thatcher.'</p>

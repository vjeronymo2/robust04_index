			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EARTH DAY PROTEST  </P> <P> Earth Day, 1990. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric? General Dynamics? The Republican  Party? What were they doing there?  </P> <P> Carolyn Chase, director of the San Diego Earth Day Coalition, rationalizes that  people who are part of the problem need to be part of the solution.  </P> <P> Perhaps, but they do not need (nor deserve) to be part of an environmental  event.  </P> <P> SDG&amp;E, General Dynamics and the Republican Party are responsible for  immeasurable harm to our environment. Not only were they allowed to set up  sizable booths, but they were given prominent exposure, whereas the grass-roots  environmental groups were positioned close to a mile away from the main event.  </P> <P> Allowing SDG&amp;E, General Dynamics and the Republicans to participate at the  Earth Day event is like making the racist South African government the guest of  honor at a "Human Rights" event.  </P> <P> Shame on you, San Diego Earth Day Coalition!  </P> <P> BARBARA GARTNER  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Asserted that requiring the agency head to complete the application is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary step in the application process because it would require Board of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supervisors' action (``head of the agency'') and signature of the Chairman;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Argued that voter registration and voter list maintenance are entirely decentralized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in many states and controlled by local elected officials, the vast majority of whom have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no staff or office resources, and that imposing additional administrative requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulk mail will eliminate the use of special bulk rates in counties and municipalities that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least able to afford the full rates;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Proposed that the ``Chief Election Official'' designated in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NVRA of 1993 should be permitted to submit to the Postal Service the names of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration offices and post offices where special bulk rates would be needed, or that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state officials might file a request for all county and local officials to mail under the NVRA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Suggested that the application be revised to require the applicant to submit only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant material to establish eligibility to mail at the special bulk third-class rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postal laws have long required mailers to apply for authorization to mail at special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulk third-class rates before entering mail at the special rates. See former 39 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4452(d). This application process ensures that only qualified mailers enter matter at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special rates and that the matter entered is eligible. The Postal Service has no objections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to state and other officials providing advice and assistance to local voting registration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials in qualifying to mail their materials at the special bulk third-class rates. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Postal Service will continue to require voting registration officials to obtain an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization to mail at the special bulk third-class rates at the post office where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials will present matter for mailing at the special bulk third-class rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters appear to misunderstand the proposed procedure for applying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to mail at the special bulk third-class rates. The state or local voting registration official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who will be presenting bulk third-class mailings will be required to apply to mail at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special bulk third-class rates and will be considered the ``official head of the government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency'' (voting registration official).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An organization authorized to mail at the special bulk third-class rates may mail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only its matter at those rates. The Postal Service is not requiring state officials to file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests for local voting registration officials to mail at the special bulk third-class rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, state officials may assist local voting registration officials in preparing their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications if the applications are submitted to the post office where the local voting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration officials will make mailings at the special bulk third-class rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the comments received, the Postal Service is also revising the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application form to reduce the burden on voting officials applying to mail at the special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates. PS Form 3624, Application to Mail at Special Bulk Third-Class Rates, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised so that election officials will have to supply only minimal information. The revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form will be printed in the Postal Bulletin. The information required will be far less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that required from nonprofit mailers seeking to mail at the special rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Postal Service.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

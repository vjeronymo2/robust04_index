			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Bank reserves down Pounds 4.4bn THE BANK of England's reserves fell by Pounds 4.4bn (Dollars 7.7bn) last month, but analysts said that did not reflect the true extent of intervention by the authorities as they attempted to prop up sterling. Although the underlying fall was a record, it was only a fraction of the Pounds 15bn of foreign currency reserves allegedly spent shortly before the pound's devaluation. Treasury figures show that Britain's overall gold and currency reserves were Dollars 42.7bn at the end of September compared with Dollars 44.4bn at the end of August. The net final fall of Dollars 1.7bn was much smaller than the underlying fall because the government was able to draw upon Dollars 6.1bn - about half  -of the special borrowing of up to Ecu10bn of foreign currencies arranged at the beginning of September to boost the pound. Overall reserves were also boosted by Dollars 1.2bn of Ecu Treasury bill proceeds. The Treasury said the changes in reserves were not an exact mirror of Bank intervention. The figures are the only official indication of what took place last month. They fail to reveal a number of factors, including: How much intervention was carried out by the Bundesbank on behalf of the Bank of England? Earlier this week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, pointed out that total compulsory D-Mark sales in support of EMS currencies during the week of 'Black Wednesday' came to more than DM44bn (Pounds 17.6bn), 'the greater part of which was accounted for by interventions vis-a-vis sterling'. How much the Bank may have raised on the so-called forward market, where it is possible to buy sterling a number of months ahead, and where deals do not have to be settled until delivery falls due. 'The only conclusion you can draw from these figures is that either we all got the scale of the intervention completely wrong, which seems unlikely, or that more Bundesbank funds were used to try and prop up the currency than we thought at the time,' said Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities.</p>

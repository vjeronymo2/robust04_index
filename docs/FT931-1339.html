			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Court blow to contracting-out THE High Court yesterday delivered a further blow to the government's contracting-out programme when it declared that the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations (Tupe) did apply to a prison education service being transferred from a Local Education Authority. The Brussels-inspired Tupe regulations aim to protect the pay and conditions of employees when undertakings are transferred from one employer to another. But there is wide disagreement about precisely when Tupe applies in contracting-out. The Home Office had advised that Tupe would not apply in the case of prison education services, and education providers had tendered on that basis. Yesterday's judgement from Sir Michael Ogden that Tupe did apply in the case of Kenny versus South Manchester College contradicts that Home Office advice. Lawyers also said it casts doubt on the recent guidance from Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, who said Tupe would not normally apply when the new employer conducts the operation without making significant use of previous staff, premises or equipment. The case was brought by two members of the college lecturers' union Natfhe, Mr Peter Kenny and Ms Helen Woodruff. They were challenging the fact that South Manchester College, which has won the contract to provide education at the Thorn Cross Young Offenders Institute, was not committed to taking on staff who had been providing the education and were offering different contracts. South Manchester College, which may appeal, will now have to take on staff who had been employed by Cheshire County Council and on the same terms and conditions. The prison service will have to meet demanding performance targets when it becomes a semi-autonomous agency in a week's time, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, said last night. He made it clear that he expected standards to improve but warned that there would be no extra resources and stressed the need for more efficient working practices.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Tax increases lift headline inflation rate Tax increases pushed up the headline rate of annual inflation to 2.6 per cent in April, from 2.3 per cent in March, but there was an encouraging fall in the underlying rate. When mortgage interest payments are excluded, the annual inflation rate fell to 2.3 per cent in April, from 2.4 per cent in March, according to the Central Statistical Office. This is the lowest level of underlying inflation since November 1967 and means that the underlying rate has dropped below the headline rate for the first time since February 1991. With inflationary pressures generally subdued, the impact of tax changes means that April is now by far the most important month for price increases. The all-items retail price index rose by 1.2 per cent between March and April, the largest monthly increase for two years. Prices rose more in April than in the previous 10 months from May 1993 to March 1994 combined. Although the Budget has been moved from March to November, April remains the key month for many local and central government tax changes. The introduction of value added tax on fuel was the most important factor, adding 0.35 percentage points to the retail prices index. The CSO decided not to take into account the pre-payment of fuel bills by consumers in calculating the effect. It cited a 1986 RPI advisory committee ruling which said that the 'time at which the liability for payment was incurred', rather than the time at which the payment was made, was the crucial factor. The reduction in mortgage interest relief (Miras) from 25 to 20 per cent added 0.24 percentage points to the index in April, while increases in local authority rents and the council tax pushed up the RPI by 0.18 and 0.08 points respectively. A further 0.07 percentage points were contributed by increases in water and sewerage costs. This increase in housing-related costs obscured the improving inflationary trend elsewhere in the economy. In April, the annual increase in all items excluding housing, at 2.3 per cent, was the lowest since February 1964. Individual sectors are still showing price falls. Prices of household goods, such as furniture, fell by 0.5 per cent in the 12 months to April, the first negative annual rate since records began in 1974. Prices of leisure goods, such as audio-visual equipment, also fell. Analysts generally welcomed the inflation figures, although they were slightly overshadowed by the increase in average earnings. Mr Ian Shepherdson of HSBC Greenwell estimated that the Bank of England's measure of core inflation, RPI (Y), which excludes taxes as well as mortgage payments, fell to 1.6 per cent in April from 1.9 per cent in March. Mr Adrian Cooper of James Capel said that services inflation was collapsing, with the annual rate now down to 2.3 per cent from 5 per cent during much of 1993.  --------------------------------------------        UK INFLATION RATE: +2.6 PERCENT  -------------------------------------------- Food (seasonal) (20)          +2.0 percent Food (non-seasonal) (142)     +0.6 percent Catering (45)                 +4.1 percent Alcoholic drink (76)          +2.1 percent Tobacco (35)                  +7.7 percent Housing (158)                 +4.1 percent Fuel &amp; light (45)             +5.7 percent Household goods (76)          -0.5 percent Household services (47)        0.0 percent Clothing &amp; footwear (58)      +0.3 percent Personal goods, serv.

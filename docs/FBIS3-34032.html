			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-Rumayhi, chief editor of Kuwait's </F> AL-'ARABI magazine: "Mountains Don't Meet, People Do"]  <H5>  [19 Jan p 15] </H5>   [Text] A transmitted proverb or common saying that recurs  in numerous languages says something to the effect that two  mountains cannot meet, but two people can. In other words,  mountains cannot meet, whereas people can. This saying or  proverb is reiterated on occasions when adversaries, estranged  people, and people in disagreement meet, especially when the  desire or ambition to meet exists.    This idea comes to mind when one sees and hears what  millions  saw and heard via the live television relay of the meeting  between U.S. President Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad in Geneva last Sunday.    Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, which must have  been drafted in advance because it is not for nothing or just to  drink a cup of coffee together that prominent leaders  meet--regardless of the outcome, we say that this meeting in  itself gives a good idea of the developments occurring in the  current policy.    Each of the two men who met amid strict security measures in  Geneva came from a different land, different time, with a  different legacy, and also with a different dream. But they met,  and in this contrast lies the essence of the harmony that will  perhaps dominate the political logic of the post-cold war world.  In this contrast lies the fall of the ideological givens and the  collapse of the old guard in today's, and perhaps in tomorrow's,  world    At the press conference held after the meeting, President  Clinton said that he had heard about the Syrian president's  endurance and that he became certain of this endurance through  the discussions which lasted more than four hours between the  two of them and after which he had to take a break to rest.  President Clinton added that despite this, the two men were able  to discuss numerous issues.    This reference shows not only what news agencies reported on  the eve of the meeting about the personal qualities of each of  the two presidents but also indicate, if we dive beyond the  surface of the words, the degree of difference in the makeup and  aspirations of each of the two presidents. But despite this, the  meeting went on and continued. It did not break up the way the  Reykjavik summit in Iceland between Gorbachev and Reagan near  the end of the cold war broke up.    The world has changed to such a degree that decisionmakers  in  all parts of this world seek to meet, in spite of their  differences. Reports, the likes of which President Clinton must  have read before meeting with al-Asad, say that the Syrian  president is the last Arab radical, that he is the "cunning  ascetic" who is characterized by "patience, cunning, and the  determination to maintain a vital role for himself in the  regional and international arenas." The reports add that he is  an "Arab nationalist with a penetrating insight and one who  always clings to the long-range view of affairs."    On the other side, the U.S. President seems to be the  antithesis of his partner at the meeting. In addition to the  difference of generations to which each of the two presidents  belongs and the nearly two-decade difference in their ages,  Clinton is as far from radicalism as can be. He is closer to the  impetuosity characterizing the members of his generation, which  was raised in the embraces of the boundless U.S. liberalism and  of the pragmatism that hallows no particular tactic or strategy  and that emanates from the dynamic U.S. spirit which moves with  extraordinary flexibility within the framework of the immediate  moment and interest.    It may be said that personal dimensions are nothing but a  narrow margin on the cards of the major players at the political  table. What is fundamental and more important in their cards  lies in the legacy of government in their countries and in  certain strategies that are not determined by individuals,  regardless of the degree of their influence, but by their  countries' major interests. Even in this regard, the distance  was immense between the two leaders at last Sunday's summit in  Geneva.    Al-Asad went to Geneva, carrying in his quiver arrows aimed  at certain targets, which have been defined by observers as:  refraining from bargaining on any pan-Arab constants, especially  land. Land is sacred in the political education that was  received by the Syrian president's generation and which has  continued to be disseminated among subsequent generations,  especially in Syria. This is a pan-Arab strategy. The Israelis  are aware of this. Gad Ben Ari, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak  Rabin's spokesman, has said, "I don't expect any flexibility to  develop in the Syrian position and I don't expect Syria to  reduce the price it demands in return for peace." The same view  is reflected in a statement made by Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's  ambassador to Washington, who said prior to Sunday's summit,  "There is a difference between the hopes that Syria and the  United States attach to these meetings. Of course, there is a  difference between the Syrian hopes and Israeli hopes." It is  well known that Rabinovich heads the Israeli delegation to the  bilateral talks with Syria--talks which have been running in  place for more than a year.    So, the Golan is not just a strategic Syrian plateau from  which it is difficult for Israel to withdraw. Rather, it is a  symbol of the immense disagreement within the meeting and a  stumbling block on the path of the peace negotiations. It is  also evidence of the new logic that calls for continuing the  dialogue despite the evident impossibility of reaching  agreement. Even though the new Israeli Government accepted the  principle of withdrawal from the Golan Heights for the first  time in September 1992, it said that this withdrawal would not  be a complete withdrawal. A week before the Clinton-al-Asad  meeting, Rabin declared, "To date, I have only talked about  withdrawal from the Golan, not from the entire Golan. This is my  position." Yosi Beilin, the Israeli deputy foreign minister, has  said within nearly the same context, "I am convinced that the  establishment of Jewish settlements in the Golan Heights or in  any other territories after the 1967 war was a mistake. But now  that the settlements exist, we cannot erase them from the map so  simply." The Golan, where 12,000 Israeli settlers live in 33  settlements next to 16,000 Druze citizens, continues to create  obstacles. Israeli settlers have sent Clinton a message through  the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv to ask him not to pressure Israel  to withdraw from the heights. Sammy Bar-Lev, a leader of the  settlers in the occupied Syrian heights, has said, "The U.S.  diplomat who received the message has asserted that the U.S.  policy is based on not pressuring Israel."    So, the obstacle is huge. But the endeavors have not ceased,  especially when we learn that those who have taken over the  Middle East dossier in the Clinton administration are friends of  Israel, which Clinton characterized in his election campaign as  the "strategic and democratic ally." In one of his messages to  voters, Clinton said, "Yes, Israel and the United States are at  a turning point.... We ask you for generous financial support.  Will you help me restore logic to the U.S.-Israeli relationship?  Please, answer today and be generous. I swear that if I am  elected president, I will never disappoint Israel." Figuring  prominently among those who have taken over the Middle East  dossier is Martin Indyk, an ex-chairman of Washington's Middle  East Policy Institute, which is close to AIPAC [American-Israel  Public Affairs Committee]. He was asked to draft an analysis to  help formulate Clinton's Middle East plan. Indyk was helped in  this regard by Les Aspin and Samuel Lewis. The former is a  member of the advisory board of JENSA [as transliterated], a  Jewish institute, and the second was a U.S. ambassador to Israel  and then worked as chairman of the Israeli Bank Leumi. For the  negotiations, Indyk proposed a U.S. policy that would embrace  the Israeli viewpoint to the letter, whether on bilateral or  regional negotiation issues. Indyk also insisted on rejecting  the PLO and the idea of a Palestinian state and emphasized the  need to besiege and pressure Syria and to give absolute priority  to Israel's needs.  <H5>  [20 Jan p 15] </H5>   [Text] In view of all of these circumstances, it may seem  to those who experienced the old-style politics that any meeting  between Clinton and al-Asad would be futile and a waste of time.  But there are new considerations that become revealed when  matters are viewed from a new angle.    For Syria, and we mean President al-Asad here, there are  fundamental developments that make the world one that is  different from the world in which Syria set the ceiling of its  pan-Arab aspirations. The main support for Syria's military  capability, and we mean here the Soviet Union, has nearly  evaporated. The Arab system in which Syria formed a main axis  has disintegrated and broken down since Iraq's invasion of  Kuwait and since the subsequent breakdowns, as a result of which  the Arab system has nearly collapsed. All these developments  make the Syrian determination to cling to patience and obstinacy  some sort of a miracle, especially Syria's rejection of  'Arafat's performance in the Gaza- Jericho accord. Syria  bargained on the meager chances of success of the big hopes  attached to this accord. It won the wager when the day for  withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Jericho arrived without the  accomplishment of this withdrawal. This point was added to the  miracle of the Syrian obstinacy which borders on being some sort  of extraordinarily sensitive political intuition or some sort of  lucky strikes that come only to those who deserve them.    So, there are changes in the shape of the world around  Syria.  Despite its proficient intuition or its good luck, Syria is  aware of the dimensions of this change.    As for Clinton's United States, there is something new here  too, despite the U.S. strategic constants. Peter Tarnoff, U.S.  undersecretary of state, has said, "Washington's international  role will diminish because of the end of the cold war and  because of the domestic U.S. economic crises." Even though U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher hastened to refute his  deputy's statements, saying, "The United States holds, and will  continue to hold, its distinguished place at the top of the new  world order," Tarnoff's statements are profoundly significant.  They are similar in nature to facts revealed by a slip of the  tongue and they provide an indication of dimensions of the  crisis experienced vis-a-vis the developments which the new  Democrat U.S. administration is trying to absorb after a long  absence from the White House. In addition to the strategic  surprise embodied in the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, a  collapse which has put the United States in the labyrinth of one  who is looking for his next foe after the disappearance of a  stubborn foe--in addition to this state of political ambiguity,  the new administration lacked young cadres capable of keeping up  with the consecutive developments emanating from the  disappearance of the foe who had determined the power of the  United States itself and who had mobilized its latent strengths.  This is why Clinton has been compelled to rely on numerous  figures from Carter's administration. Moreover, the Democrats  have had to give up many of their conventional ideas and to  adopt some Republican ideas and, consequently, they have had to  deal with the U.S. foreign tendencies selectively and on a  case-by-case basis. Therefore, it has become possible to ignore  conventional constants in the Democrats' policy (such as  sovereignty, democracy, human rights, and the UN's role) to  adopt some sort of interventionism, which is called in the  Democrats' new literature a "new kind of international  intervention." But this intervention is indebted essentially to  the Republicans' conventional tendencies.    Between the constant and the changeable in the new U.S.  strategies, there arises to the surface a question about the  Middle East's place in this state of affairs. The answer is  summed up in that the United States will not confine itself to  dealing with Israel as just a strategic ally, but will also deal  with it as a "strategic partner," according to Dr. Muhammad  al-Sayyid Sa'id, an expert on Arab strategy, who has added that  the U.S. view of Israel as a strategic ally in the Middle East  "means large possibilities of expansion in concluding joint  weapons development programs, especially anti-rocket missiles.  The important difference here is that the doves in the U.S.  international military strategy are hawks where Israel is  concerned, and they are loyal allies of Israel in particular."    All these circumstances make the observer who examines what  is below the surface closely realize that Israel's strategic  weight is increasing, not decreasing, in the body of the U.S.  policy. But the careful observer must also realize that the  Arabs' refraining--especially by Syria which stands on the  frontline with Israel--from dealing with this state of affairs  represents silence on a tumor that grows and spreads until it  becomes able to devour the entire body or it represents silence  on a benign tumor that could become malignant if precautions are  not taken to avert its further transformation.    It seems that the Syrian president has chosen to deal with  this condition without delay. Meanwhile, the U.S. President  seeks to move efficiently with his administration beyond just  rearranging the affairs of his house to dealing with the world  outside this house. It is no coincidence that Sunday's summit in  Geneva came as a stop in a trip that took Bill Clinton to the  den of his old foe to peacefully clip this foe's last claw in  return for a few billion to be paid in installments. Clinton  succeeded in wresting and disassembling the Ukraine's nuclear  missiles and in purchasing the uranium they contain. He also  succeeded in staging a scene that is of profound significance to  the Americans--a scene embodied in turning the direction of the  nuclear missiles of the former Soviet Union, which are found in  Russia currently, away from U.S. cities. Perhaps at his meeting  in Geneva, Clinton sought to eliminate the threat from a region  that is of fundamental concern to the U.S. strategic interests.  At a time when the new U.S. administration views Israel,  according to its advisers' vision, as a strategic ally, it  realizes that the ignition of any fires in the region will burn  some of its interests. This is why the endeavor to launch a  state of peace in the region is a sincere endeavor, even if it  has been coupled with securing the "highest ceiling" of  conditions or price in favor of Israel.    Yes, there are conflicting and intersecting interests in the  Arab-Israeli condition. But by changing the perspective and  taking the new developments into account, the examiner can find  fine threads of joint interests if peace is accomplished, even  if at the highest ceiling of the conditions of the parties  concerned. The worsening danger of religious radicalism is  something that all can see, be they Arabs, Americans, or  Israelis. Transforming the battlefields into open markets  provides numerous or some opportunities, even to the weaker  parties within these markets, provided that the will to be  industrious is there. It seems that "Syria's merchants" are  confident of their skill and aren't afraid of opening these  markets.    The world has changed swiftly in recent years, and it is  still changing at an accelerating pace. It seems that all have  developed the conviction that woe will befall those who fail to  catch up with this train.    Sunday's meeting in Geneva between al-Asad and Clinton was  some sort of catching up with the train of the speeding changes.  All concealed results not withstanding, it suffices that this  summit has produced a declaration of readiness to come out of  the old fortresses and an acceptance of the logic of change. The  U.S. President stated most explicitly that Syria is the key to  comprehensive peace in the region and President al-Asad  expressed his readiness to shoulder all the consequences of  peace with Israel.    Truly, mountains do not meet, but people do. Mountains  collapse if they move. But the outcome of every endeavor by men  is an addition, or at least an addition in which there is no  loss. We are confident that the meeting was a gain for all, or  so we hope.</p>

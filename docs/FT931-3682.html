			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Cautious US backing for Yeltsin: Clinton unhappy with other countries' response THE Clinton administration has not sought to advise Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, on how best to handle his current confrontation with the Russian parliament, according to Mr Les Aspin, the US secretary of defence. Interviewed on television yesterday morning, Mr Aspin reported that Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, had told his opposite number in Moscow, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, on Friday only that the US hoped that whatever course of action Mr Yeltsin chose was 'consistent with reform and human rights'. President Bill Clinton himself sent a further signal to other industrialised countries on Saturday that more needs to be done financially and economically to help the cause of economic reform in Russia. He said other nations with a vital stake in the future of Russia had given him what he called 'an inadequate response to date'. He added that 'a more co-ordinated and aggressive approach' was required but did not indicate whether he thought progress had been made at the meeting of Group of Seven and Russian officials in Hong Kong over the weekend. Asked if he was putting too much faith in Mr Yeltsin, the president responded: 'We will work with what we have to work with, whatever happens. But I think we should support him because he has been elected, after all. 'No-one knows what is going to happen, but the man is an honest democrat, small 'd', and he's passionately committed to reform. I'm going to keep working with him.' Mr Clinton and Mr Yeltsin are due to meet in Vancouver on April 3-4. He sidestepped questions about Mr Yeltsin's possible recourse to emergency powers, including the use of the Russian military, to circumvent the parliament and pursue reform. 'I don't think it would serve any useful purpose for me to try and interpet the Russian constitution right now,' he said. Neither Mr Clinton and Mr Aspin minimised the importance of the power struggle in Moscow. The defence secretary said that arms control agreements, such as Start, co-operation in foreign policy from Bosnia to Iraq, and the proposed reductions in the US defence budget were potentially at risk. Some senior officials have suggested that the US would not formally object if Mr Yeltsin resorted to special powers, including the suspension of the parliament, but would draw the line at a military crackdown. This seems to be the broad import of Mr Christopher's message to Mr Kozyrev on Friday. Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican from Indiana, said yesterday that the US could 'conceivably' accept the temporary use of military power, but only if it was invoked as an explicit prelude to proper elections in Russia. He thought an early session between the US and Russian finance ministers would be useful. Senator Bill Bradley, the Democratic from New Jersey, also said it was important for the US to keep open all lines of communication with other centres of power, including the parliament, the army and the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>

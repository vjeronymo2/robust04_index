			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Holiday brochures under attack BRITAIN'S biggest holiday companies are producing misleading brochures two years after the Association of British Travel Agents introduced a code of practice on the subject, according to a study by Holiday Which? magazine, Michael Skapinker writes. Thomson, the UK's biggest tour operator, described Faliraki on Rhodes as a former fishing village which had retained its atmosphere. Holiday Which? said it was 'a sprawling, Costa-style resort'. Enterprise, part of Owners Abroad, the second biggest holiday company, told potential visitors to some apartments that shops, tavernas and nightspots were within easy reach. In fact it was half a mile's walk to the nearest, solitary bar. Airtours, the third biggest operator, published a brochure with a picture of a beach on the same page as a description of a hotel. Holiday Which? found the beach was 12 miles from the hotel. The magazine found brochures from other operators with photographs taken in such a way as to hide unsightly features.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Russia makes drama out of economic crisis: Politics holds the centre stage AN AIR of unreality has crept into the tortured debates on how to save the Russian economy from catastrophe. Politicians talk about merging economic programmes which are little more than rival collections of slogans, while economists are unable to tackle real economic problems because politics get in the way. The most imminent danger for the country is hyperinflation, which could destroy most of the real progress made in building a market economy. Yet the melodramatic nature of Russian politics means that most of the government's energies are focused on surviving the December 1 session of the super-parliament which has threatened to remove it from office. In the interim, the government's policy consists of talking in reassuring tones but acting in a manner which suggests chaos within, even as it continues to make slow headway in building a market econmy with privatisation and other structural changes. The ambitious aim of its six-month anti-crisis programme, announced on Monday, is both to boost social welfare spending and to stimulate collapsing output with a selective industrial policy. With inflation running at more than 25 per cent a month, the government has just come up with an equally unrealisic 1993 budget that assumes 70 per cent inflation for the whole of next year and a deficit of just 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product. But neither financial stabilisation nor an industrial policy are possible until Russian authorities make the cruel choice of closing down enterprises and making more selective use of scarce resources. It is not even clear how far the anti-crisis plan is a real policy. In another symptom of what one western academic called 'programmitis' - a Russian habit of producing programmes which are discarded two months later - Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, last week agreed to make alterations to the anti-crisis plan with the help of Mr Arkady Volsky, the head of the industrialists' lobby and a key figure in the Civic Union opposition group. The picture is not all dark, though. Privatisation is going ahead, and enterprise managers are gradually changing their behaviour in response to market notions like demand and supply. But this fragile progress may be severely disrupted if hyperinflation becomes an everyday reality. The government will then face a choice of trying to reimpose state price controls and the centralised distribution of goods and services, or of trying to get its printing presses to keep up with soaring wages - something they failed to do earlier this year when prices were liberalised. Some of the problems facing the government have no easy answers and will take time: for instance, establishing normal relations with the other former Soviet republics which are now independent states. This includes the need to establish a clearly defined rouble zone and concerted monetary policies with republics that continue to use the rouble, and keep trading links with those which opt for their own currencies. On Monday, President Boris Yeltsin ordered his government to enforce world prices supplies of Russian energy to other republics. However, Russia has very little choice but to create credit for these mostly bankrupt republics if it wants to continue receiving supplies from monopolistic factories built originally in those republics on the assumption that the Soviet Union would remain a single country. Meanwhile, the west is saying that Russia must observe undertakings to the International Monetary Fund before it can get access to more of a Dollars 24bn aid package. Yet this package in itself is nothing near the sort of help Russia needs to face unprecedented challenges The US, for instance, is pushing for a rapid debt rescheduling which will be paid for largely by the Germans, but is closing its own market to Russian exports like uranium and telling Russia which countries it cannot sell arms to.</p>

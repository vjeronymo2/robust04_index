			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / 110,000 more building jobs forecast to go A FURTHER 110,000 construction jobs could be lost before employment in the industry picks up in 1995, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said yesterday in a gloomy assessment of the industry's prospects. Quantity surveyors' workload is continuing to fall in spite of signs earlier this year that levels were beginning to stabilise, the institution's latest statistics show. During the past quarter the workload has fallen by 1.5 per cent compared with 0.7 per cent in the previous quarter. Workload is down by 10 per cent over the past 12 months. Mr Christopher Vickers, the institution's construction spokesman, said: 'These figures are very disappointing. They show little improvement in construction activity for at least the next six to nine months . . . It appears earlier hopes that a recovery was under way were premature.' The institute's forecast of a further 110,000 job losses comes on top of the 300,000-plus jobs already shed by the construction industry in the current recession. Employment was about 1.35m at the end of last year. Mr Vickers said that although more people were considering building, few were committing themselves. He said: 'A return in confidence is desperately needed if these projects are to get past the initial feasibility stage.' The institute's forecast is gloomier in tone than the one from the Council of Building Material Producers on Monday. That predicted an upturn for the industry in the second half of this year, but only if public-sector spending was maintained. Sir Alan Cockshaw, the chairman of the construction group AMEC, agreed with the institution's figures, 'which do suggest there is little hope of any apparent recovery this year or, indeed, before 1995'. But he warned against 'interpreting these figures across the totality of UK construction, as there are areas of the industry where prospects are far more positive, such as process and civil engineering'.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SO. BAPTIST GROUP TO START SEMINARY AS A RESPONSE TO FUNDAMENTALISTS  </P> <P> The Southern Baptist Alliance has decided to start a seminary in Richmond, Va.,  in response to the fundamentalism now dominating the Southern Baptist  Convention.  </P> <P> The alliance, which is a faction of about 43,000 people within the  14.7-million-member denomination, approved the move 462 to 42 at its third  national convocation, held at First Baptist Church here.  </P> <P> Backers said the seminary will champion women in ministry and will cooperate  with other Baptist denominations.  </P> <P> The new seminary was seen as a partial answer to actions of the new  fundamentalist majority on the board of Southeastern Baptist Theological  Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C. The former president of Southeastern, the Rev.  Randall Lolley, told the alliance meeting that he was "a lucky Baptist to be at  a time and a place where some free church Baptists said no to fundamentalism."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Offers Prediction  </P> <P> Elizabeth Barnes, professor of theology at Southeastern, predicted that she  will be the last woman faculty member there "for a long, long time to come."  She urged a positive vote for a new seminary because "there is no Baptist  seminary in existence which has the vision of the Southern Baptist Alliance."  </P> <P> Voting against the new seminary was the Rev. Harold Cole, executive  secretary-treasurer emeritus of the South Carolina Baptist Convention.  </P> <P> "I want the Southern Baptist Alliance to stay in the convention and to remain  loyal to the convention," Cole said. He said he wants the alliance to remain as  "a protest movement, but one within the denomination."  </P> <P> The alliance seminary will cooperate with a black Baptist seminary already in  Richmond and with seminaries of the American Baptist Churches. It will open  when plans are implemented and about $500,000 is raised. An interim board of  trustees is being established, and the school will open with about 150  students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Drop 'Southern'  </P> <P> Members also voted for the Southern Baptist Alliance to study the idea of  dropping the word "Southern" from the name to reflect the fact that it has  members in 40 states.  </P> <P> The alliance heard a greeting from John Sundquist, who chairs the American  Baptist Task Force on the Southern Baptist Convention. American Baptists want  "to appropriately stand with our moderate brothers and sisters, whom we feel so  close to," he said. "We feel your pain. Our prayers are with you. We wish you  God's very best."  </P> <P> The alliance also voted to have its directors study whether the group might  become a representative body rather than a participatory democracy. The  directors had proposed a general assembly or house of delegates from each state  or region to attend the national business session, but the proposal did not go  over well. Baptists hold annual state and national conventions in which  "messengers" sent by churches are free to vote their consciences.  </P> <P> Another issue that surfaced at the three-day convention was whether the  Southern Baptist Woman's Missionary Union should publicly favor the ordination  of women. The group, reportedly the largest women's organization in the world,  promotes foreign missions. It has shied away from endorsing women as pastors or  preachers, but it has affirmed the right of each local church to choose its own  pastor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Delegate Walks Out  </P> <P> The Rev. Ginny Britt, with Crisis Control Ministry in Winston-Salem, N.C.,  walked out in protest when Woman's Missionary Union leader Catherine Allen  spoke. Later, Britt spoke to the group and urged that the union "make an  affirming comment on the role of women as pastors in the local churches and as  local preachers."  </P> <P> Allen defended the union, saying that it has "very effectively cut a pathway  for women" for 100 years.  </P></p>

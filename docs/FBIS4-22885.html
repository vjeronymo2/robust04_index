Environmental degradation, or ``stress,''  was broadly defined as anthropogenic or natural ecological  deterioration sufficient to interfere with normal human  activity. Different sets of criteria were developed and  elaborated for land, marine, and river ecosystems. These  criteria were not considered exhaustive. The different regions  were ranked on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 representing  environmentally pristine regions, and 5 representing regions  with severe environmental problems. None of the regions were  considered environmental disaster areas. An analysis of the map  yielded the following conclusions: 1) Most of Russia is not  suffering from appreciable environmental degradation, including  the northern zone of European Russia; 2) No regions were given a  ranking of 5, with the exception of some major reservoirs; 3)  Regions with a ranking of 4 were found only in European Russia;  4) Regions of moderate environmental stress (up to a ranking of  2) were found in territories that were otherwise considered to  have few or no environmental problems. Analogical conclusions  were drawn for river systems, inland seas, and coastal waters. A  considerable number of geographical locations were explicitly  identified, regardless of the degree of environmental damage. No  direct correlation was found between human morbidity indices and  the degree of environmental degradation, with the exception of  areas with exceptionally high morbidity rates, the causes of  which were too complex for the scope of this study.

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Kohl backs bombers for Bosnia Chancellor Helmut Kohl will today throw his political weight behind a decision to send German Tornado fighter bombers to Bosnia by telling MPs that Germany owes it to its allies to become involved in former Yugoslavia, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn. In an interview with Bild Zeitung, Germany's best-selling newspaper, Mr Kohl appealed to deputies, who must approve any deployment, to set aside their party affiliations and listen to their consciences. The cabinet is expected to decide tomorrow whether it will send the aircraft, medical facilities, engineers and naval units. Two German navy frigates are already part of a fleet enforcing an embargo. However, officials said Germany would continue to resist pressure to send combat troops.</p>

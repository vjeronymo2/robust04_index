			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'AIR AMERICA' STALLS IN FINDING ITS FOCUS  </P> <P> It used to be said that Vietnam was the great undeclared war both in real life  and on the screen. Until the last decade or so, the war was virtually absent  from our screens. Now, of course, it's rare that a month goes by without some  Vietnam-themed feature or television movie. While the general run of such films  is of a rather high quality, the themes and subject matter have become  repetitive.  </P> <P> That's one reason why "Air America," (citywide) which stars Mel Gibson and  Robert Downey and is about the CIA's secret airline operating in Laos in 1969,  seems so invigorating at first. It's a great, untapped movie subject, and the  director Roger Spottiswoode works up the material in high style. At its best  it's a luxuriant black comedy. The buccaneer aviators who maneuver the  experimental prop planes and huge, lumbering transports above the lush Laotian  highlands are juiced by their own adrenalin. They're all a little high, and the  movie itself has a slightly delirious, narcotized quality.  </P> <P> The black comedy arises naturally out of the material. The CIA kept a secret  mercenary anti-communist army in Laos for more than a decade, and Air America  was its air support. As a covert, CIA-run, civilian-operated airline in charge  of transporting everything from pigs to opium, Air America did not even  officially exist. The pilots, recruited both from civilian life and from the  military, were generally not told about the nature of their missions, or even  that they were working for the CIA. (That doesn't mean they didn't know.) But,  if the dangers were extraordinary -- more Air America pilots died in Laos than  in Cambodia or Vietnam -- so were the financial rewards. Pilots got paid by the  flight, and often there were dozens per day.  </P> <P> The wacky disassociation of working for a non-existent airline in a  non-existent war is what gives "Air America" its tone of funhouse grisliness.  (The film opens with Nixon on TV telling the world there is no American  presence in Laos.) These non-people don't even have the solace of having their  heroism recognized. Their exploits, like their deaths, go officially  unrecorded.  </P> <P> As long as the film is racking up its absurdist points, it's a free-wheeling,  sporty entertainment. The shots of huge porkers being parachuted to earth in  crates, of Buddhist priests blessing the planes before lift-off, or the sight  of a miniature golf course carved out of the jungle, have a special kind of  comic charge. They reflect what really happened in Laos. The absurdity isn't  tacked on to the story; it is the story. And there are moments when the  nuttiness has a majestic sweep, as when a storm-tossed plane emerges from dark  clouds and into the huge, looming face of a Buddhist shrine.  </P> <P> As the film floats along, however, it remains essentially without focus.  There's a conflict built into the script all right: Gene Ryack (Mel Gibson), a  veteran of 15 years flying in Southeast Asia, tries to live down the guilt of  transporting opium as a routine part of his job. Billy Covington (Robert  Downey, Jr.), recruited from L.A. after botching his job as an eye-in-the-sky  air traffic pilot, arrives in Laos with only the most naive assumptions about  his job. When he discovers the extent of the corruption, he goes in for some  free-style sabotage and, in the process, forces Gene into a moral reckoning.  </P> <P> But the conflict is a case of too little too late and, in any event, it seems  de-fanged. Robert Downey, Jr. gives a wonderfully open and engaging performance  but, the way the film has been set up, his arrant innocence seems like a plot  convenience. It's true that the Air Americans were kept in the dark about a  great many things, but, with a mentor like Gene, who is so supremely cynical  that he can't say anything to anyone without smirking, Billy seems not so much  callow as dumb.  </P> <P> "Air America" has a political consciousness: the battle sequences have gravity  and the shots of the Laotian peasants are stunningly empathetic. The film  exhibits a healthy "MASH"-like disrespect for the dangerous baloney of  officialese. But the "48 HRS"-style buddy-buddy badinage and rough-housing  between the aviators doesn't fill out the film's visual grandeur. It diminishes  it. (So do the numerous what-the-hell anachronisms, like references to Mother  Teresa and General Ky's liquor store in Orange County. In 1969!)  </P> <P> Mel Gibson gives a cocky, assured performance -- a star performance. But he  doesn't provide the kind of shadowings that might make Gene's guilt-ridden  con-artistry resonate. Or maybe the shadings were edited out. There's so much  voluminous detail and incident in "Air America" that at times the film  resembles a vast swatch of footage; you get the feeling 10 other movies could  have been made from what was shot. Some of the characters, like Burt Kwouk's  deliciously corrupt General Lu Soong, are given ample display; others, like  Nancy Travis' refugee camp coordinator, are barely in the movie, even though  their roles seemed conceived on a much fuller scale.  </P> <P> It's possible that the filmmakers got so high on the exhilarating possibilities  in the material that they just let the cameras run, waiting for it to all come  together in the editing room. "Air America" is far from a disgrace, but it's so  rare to see a film with this much panoramic verve that you want it to deliver  the real goods and not this cargo-load of tinkertoy war-is-heck ironies.  </P></p>

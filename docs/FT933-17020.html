			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UN to extend peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslav Republics THE UN Security Council last night unanimously approved a three-month extension, until September 30, of peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslav republics, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. Croatia, where 25 UN soldiers have been killed and 246 others wounded, had wanted only a one-month extension while a broader enforcement mandate to deal with Serb attacks might be negotiated. But Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, advised the council that this was not practicable. He also rejected 'for the moment' the option of withdrawing UN peacekeepers entirely from Croatia. Earlier yesterday the council rejected a resolution to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems. The US backed the measure, parting company with Britain, France and Russia, who abstained in the vote. As a result the motion fell three votes short of the minimum necessary.</p>

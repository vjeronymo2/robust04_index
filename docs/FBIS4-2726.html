			<p>BFN     [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party  committee, recently gathered responsible comrades of the  agriculture and industry committee of the municipal party  committee, the municipal agriculture commission, and pertinent  departments to conscientiously study the guidelines of the  recent central rural work conference and the important speeches  of Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng and to conduct investigation  and study on ways to strengthen Tianjin's agriculture and rural  work. Gao Dezhan pointed out: Agriculture is the foundation of  the national economy. As the suburban-type agriculture holds a  particularly important position in Tianjin's entire economy, we  should all the more attach great importance to it. We should  conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central rural  work conference and make sure that we truly attach importance to  agriculture and exert efforts to make agriculture and rural work  successful. At present, we should concentrate on spring  plowing, spring sowing, and wheat field management, conquer the  drought, and strive for a good harvest this year to make  contributions to Tianjin's reform, development, and stability.    During a discussion, Gao Dezhan and the participants  conscientiously analyzed Tianjin's current development of  agricultural production and rural economy and studied ways to  implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference  rapidly. He said: The rural work conference recently held by  the party Central Committee was a very important conference.  Conscientious implementation of the guidelines of the conference  not only has very important significance in the endeavor to  achieve success in agriculture and rural work for this year and  for some time to come, but, in particular, it also has important  immediate significance in accomplishing the general task of the  work of the entire party, promoting sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development, and safeguarding social stability.  We must conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central  rural work conference and, proceeding from Tianjin's reality,  make earnest efforts and adopt effective measures to address the  existing problems and weak links and promote Tianjin's  agriculture and rural work with great efforts.    Gao Dezhan said: To successfully implement the guidelines of  the central rural work conference, the municipal party committee  held a meeting of secretary and deputy secretaries to study and  arrange this work, which, it decided, will be carried out in two  stages. In the first stage, beginning immediately, we will  conduct investigation and study on Tianjin's agricultural  production and existing problems and concentrate efforts on  spring plowing. In the second stage, we will hold a municipal  rural work conference in early April to tackle some fundamental  problems in line with the guidelines of the central rural work  conference and Tianjin's reality.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: Tianjin has won great achievements  in agriculture and rural work over the past few years, but to  win greater development in the new situation of establishing the  socialist market economy system more rapidly still requires  large amounts of painstaking work. We should first solve well  ideological problems and acquire a new understanding of the  position of agriculture as the foundation not only of the  national economy but also of reform, development, and stability.  Reform and development need a stable social and economic  environment, which first depends on the stability and  development of agriculture and rural areas, the ample supplies  of farm and sideline products, and the basic stability of the  market. As ours is a suburban-type agriculture, we should all  the more attach importance to the production of grain, cotton,  and oil-bearing crops, and we also have the conditions to make a  success of it. The "vegetable basket" is the key link of the  suburban-type agriculture. We should strive to raise the  quality, improve the efficiency, and expand the scale of this  type of agriculture. Agriculture should be restructured on the  premise that the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing  crops is stabilized. To increase the income of peasants, we  should rely both on the development of township enterprises and  diverse production and on the great development of agriculture  and rural economy.    Gao Dezhan pointed out: The basic task of Tianjin's  agriculture and rural work for this year is to conscientiously  implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference  and achieve success in 1) ensuring the production and supplies  of grain, cotton, edible oil, and the "vegetable basket," 2)  developing the rural economy in all sectors to increase  peasants' income, 3) strengthening rural spiritual civilization  and maintaining rural social stability, and 4) further improving  rural grass-roots organizations.    Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should further strengthen party  leadership over agriculture and rural work. Ideological  understanding and all work should be in place. When work is not  in place, we cannot say that we have attached importance to or  strengthened leadership over agriculture and rural work. We  should conscientiously institute the system of responsibility  for work targets and assign tasks and targets to lower levels  and to every person. Districts and counties engaged in  agriculture should hold responsibility for the planting areas,  output, and peasants' income. Success in agriculture is a task  for the entire society. All trades and professions should  attach importance to and support agriculture, voluntarily do  practical work for agricultural development, and serve it well.  We should send a group of cadres to rural areas as soon as  possible to help with their work.    Gao Dezhan particularly emphasized: As we have entered the  crucial period for agricultural production, we should seize the  right farming season and concentrate efforts on stabilizing the  areas sown with grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops and on  winter wheat management, spring plowing, and spring sowing. We  should mobilize the masses to combat drought to plant crops and  protect seedlings and strive for a bumper harvest of summer  grain and a bumper harvest for the whole year. The municipal  party committee and government decided to adopt resolute  measures in the near future to make sure that rural comrades  have sufficient time and energy for spring farming. Pertinent  departments of the municipality should be determined to reduce  meetings and go down to rural areas to help solve problems.  Responsible comrades of the districts and counties engaged in  agriculture should avoid going out of town. They should devote  more time to rural areas and concentrate on the current spring  farming.    Fang Fengyou, standing committee member of the municipal  party committee and director of its organization department; and  Zheng Zhiying, standing committee member and secretary general  of the municipal party committee; participated in the  investigation and study activities.</p>

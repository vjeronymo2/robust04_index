			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is to make a  TV series recalling the city's humanitarianism towards European  Jews trying to escape from Hitler's holocaust in the years  before and during the second world war.    The history series is to be called "Shanghai Ark." It will  show how Shanghai people helped the Jews and sheltered them  while many other countries and ports refused to accept the  Jewish refugees.    About 10,000 Jewish refugees from European countries came to  Shanghai from 1933 to 1941. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin said in a visit to Shanghai in 1993 that when the Jews  were being killed by the Nazi regime and forced to leave home  and wander about, the Shanghai people gave refuge to them.  Rabin expressed gratitude to the people of Shanghai.    The TV series is expected to be shown at the end of the  year.  It will be dedicated to the commemoration of the 50th  anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>

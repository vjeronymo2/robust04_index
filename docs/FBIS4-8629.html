			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--The government of the  Republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] has described the Croatian side's  proposal regarding future talks on economic relations and  traffic links as "hardly acceptable at this point".    According to ISKRA [Krajina Serb news agency], the  government  has prepared its platform--which will be presented to the  assembly committees--based on the modified Article 20 of UN  Security Council Resolution 820, which envisages export and  import of goods from and into the RSK under the control of  UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] civilian services.    The possibility of providing water supplies for Zadar is  envisaged as a gesture of good will, in exchange for parts for  the hydroelectric dam in Obrovac. After that, other  problems--particularly traffic problems--would be addressed.    With regard to the assembly's decision that the  government--which is currently being reappointed--should not  hold talks with the Croatian side, the government has decided to  accept this decision, noting that, if necessary, it will send a  delegation only with a written order from the president of the  RSK and the president of the assembly.</p>

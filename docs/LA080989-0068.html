			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "thirtysomething," noted for occasionally flouting TV dramatic conventions with  dream sequences and offbeat fantasy episodes, may break the mold again next  season with a live episode, producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick said  Tuesday. Although they would not reveal the plot, Herskovitz said, "So much of  what we do in our show is to interpret reality for people. The notion of doing  something live . . . gives us certain opportunities you can't get on film." The  episode would air live on the East Coast and be seen on tape delay here in the  West.

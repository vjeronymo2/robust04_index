			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / British Gas cuts prices 2% BRITISH GAS yesterday cut its prices to 18m domestic and small business consumers by 2 per cent from October - the second reduction in three months  -in spite of recording a Pounds 82m current cost loss for the second quarter. Announcing its first results since calling in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to carry out a comprehensive review of the UK gas market, British Gas warned that 500 more jobs would be lost as part of its existing cost-cutting programme by the end of 1992. This would bring the year's total to 1,500. The price cut follows a 3 per cent reduction in July. Mr Cedric Brown, newly appointed chief executive, said British Gas had indicated in March a cut of up to 5 per cent might be possible, but had delayed until it knew the result of the general election. Subsequent inflation forecasts had allowed it to make the full 5 per cent cut in two stages. Ofgas, the industry regulator, said the move vindicated its call earlier this year for substantial cuts, and the continuing pressure it had put on the company. British Gas agreed a formula with Ofgas last year limiting price rises to 5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. Mr John Dorken, deputy director general of Ofgas, said he hoped the cut 'indicates British Gas is at last beginning to take its responsibilities towards its monopoly customers seriously'. British Gas said the combined cuts would mean a saving of nearly Pounds 27 a year for a three-bedroom semi-detached house with gas central heating, or Pounds 36 for a four or five-bedroom house. It blamed exceptionally warm weather, recession and increasing competition for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 82m on a current cost basis in the three months to June 30. In the same period last year, it reported a Pounds 183m profit. Mr Brown warned that despite the pressure on margins, further cost-cutting in addition to that already planned would be difficult until the results of the MMC inquiry were known. Speaking at his first press conference since becoming chief executive, he promised a policy of 'frankness and honesty' and conceded that perceptions of British Gas as bureaucratic and resistant to change 'may be based on some reality'.

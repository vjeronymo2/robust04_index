			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. We have become aware of some confusion regarding the definition of the terms ``applicant'' and ``bidder'' as they are used in our anti-collusion rules, and we wish to clarify our rules on this issue. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Section 1.2105(c)(1) of the Commission's Rules prohibits ``bidders'' from cooperating, collaborating, discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies, but &sect;1.2105(c)(2) and (3) provide exceptions to this rule so as to allow ``applicants'' to make changes in ownership that do not result in a change in control of the applicant, or to bid jointly with other applicants, as long as they have not applied for licenses in any of the same geographic license areas. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Though we intended the terms ``bidder'' and ``applicant'' to be used interchangeably, we now recognize that it would be less confusing simply to use the term ``applicant,'' and we are amending the rules accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See November 4, 1994 letter from Kathy L.

In addition, it has been suggested that &sect;1.2105(c)(1) of our rules should be interpreted to mean that parties holding attributable interests in bidders are not prohibited from engaging in the discussions addressed in that section. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  We wish to make clear that this interpretation is an incorrect reading of our rules. For purposes of our anti-collusion rules, therefore, we clarify that the term ``applicant'' will include all holders of attributable interests in an applicant. For this purpose, ``attributable interest'' shall have the same definition as that used in &sect;24.204(d)(2)(i) of our Rules for purposes of defining interests subject to the spectrum aggregation limits: ``[p]artnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest amounting to 5 percent of more of the equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant will be attributable.'' <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  In addition ``[o]fficers and directors of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant *&blank;*&blank;* shall be considered to have an attributable interest in the entity with which they are so associated.'' <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  This is entirely consistent with the intent of the anti-collusion rules. Indeed, if holders of attributable interests were not considered applicants, collusive arrangements would be possible simply through the creation of a separate entity to act as the ``applicant.'' Further, this clarification conforms with other Commission rules regarding the competitive bidding process. For example, &sect;24.813(a) requires parties applying to participate in broadband PCS auctions to provide, among other things, information with respect to ``any person holding five percent or more of each class of stock, warrants, options or debt securities *&blank;*&blank;*.'' <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See November 4, 1994 letter from James L.

We believe, however, that allowing holders of non-controlling attributable interests in an applicant greater flexibility to form agreements with other applicants may enable applicants to acquire the capital necessary to bid successfully for licenses. Our anti-collusion rules are intended to protect the integrity and robustness of our competitive bidding process. In pursuit of that goal, however, we do not wish to restrict unreasonably the formation of non-collusive bidding consortia. For example, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> we added to our Rules &sect;24.833, which provides that parties that after the auction hold non-controlling ownership interests in more PCS spectrum than a single entity is entitled to hold may divest sufficient properties to come into compliance with the spectrum aggregation limits. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  Section 24.833 clearly contemplates entities holding ownership interests in two applicants for licenses in the same markets. Nevertheless, when one entity holds an attributable interest in more than one applicant for licenses in the same geographic license area, the potential for collusion is present because of the opportunity for the common owner to influence the bidding of the applicants. Thus, our rules permit applicants to change their ownership, enter into joint bidding arrangements and form consortia after the filing of short-form applications only if the parties to such arrangements have not applied for licenses in any of the same geographic areas. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR 24.833. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR 1.2105(c)(2), (3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 11. We believe that so long as collusive conduct can be reliably prevented, the public interest favors allowing holders of non-controlling attributable interests in one applicant for a particular license to obtain ownership interests in or enter into consortium arrangements with a second applicant for licenses in the same geographic area(s). Accordingly, we will amend the anti-collusion rules to permit a holder of non-controlling attributable interests in an applicant to obtain an ownership interest in or enter into a consortium arrangement with another applicant for a license in the same geographic area, provided that the attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission that it has observed and will observe certain restrictions on communication concerning the applicants in which it holds an attributable interest or with which it has entered into a consortium arrangement. The attributable interest holder must certify that it has not communicated and will not communicate, with the applicant or anyone else, concerning the bids or bidding strategies (including which licenses an applicant will or will not bid on) of more than one applicant for licenses in the same geographic area in which it holds an ownership interest or with which it has a consortium arrangement. As described above, ``applicant'' for this purpose includes all holders of attributable interests in an applicant. Thus, if the attributable interest holder has discussed the bidding strategy of the applicant in which it holds an attributable interest (Company A), or of any other entity that also holds an attributable interest in Company A, the attributable interest holder may not acquire an attributable interest in another applicant for a license in a geographic area in which Company A (or any other attributable interest holder in Company A) has applied for a license unless it certifies that it has not communicated concerning the bids or bidding strategies of the applicant in which it wishes to acquire an attributable interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos remains in critical condition  after an operation to drain an abscess on his pancreas. But a hospital  spokesman in Honolulu said he is making normal progress. Marcos, 71, who has  suffered heart, lung and kidney problems, underwent the three-hour operation  Tuesday at St. Francis Medical Center to try to reduce a fever. "Although  Marcos remains in very critical condition, there are no complications from the  operation," the spokesman said. Marcos, forced out of Manila and into exile by  a popular uprising in 1986, has been in the hospital for four months. A U.S.  government prosecutor said Marcos is too ill to stand trial on charges of  stealing $109 million from the Philippine treasury and fraudulently borrowing  $165 million from New York banks.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROMANIANS PULL DOWN STATUE OF LENIN  </P> <P> Demolition workers in Bucharest today finally succeeded in pulling down a  30-foot statue of V. I. Lenin in Bucharest that had resisted all efforts to  budge it over the weekend.  </P> <P> A squad including workers who recalled dismantling a statue of Josef Stalin in  1970 after an earlier change in the political wind tried unsuccessfully  Saturday and Sunday to shift the seven-ton bronze effigy with hoists, a  demolition ball and blowtorches.  </P> <P> But after more work to detach it from its red granite plinth, cranes swung it  free today as a crowd of several hundred clapped and cheered.  </P> <P> The new authorities in Bucharest have called the giant likeness of the father  of the Soviet state a redundant symbol of Romania's Communist past. Mayor Dan  Predescu says he hopes to auction it off with a starting price of $1 million.  </P> <P> If no buyer is found, it may be melted down to make a memorial commemorating  the December revolution that swept away the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu.  </P> <P> Predescu said there has been no complaint from the Soviet Embassy.  </P> <P> "The Russians are not very happy," he said, "but they told us that if this is  what we wanted to do, it is our country."  </P></p>

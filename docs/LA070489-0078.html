			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET FREEDOM RING IN CHINA  </P> <P> We must count the three weeks of nonviolence in Tian An Men Square as a triumph  in the evolution of human society. The students set a record -- organizing  their large numbers into a community, claiming that square as "a holy land for  democracy" and living in it as free men and women for three weeks. A new,  hopeful generation tested whether peaceful means -- reasoning, singing,  "parading," fasting, the posting of "big words" -- could accomplish a good,  peaceful end: transforming China into a country to live in freely.  </P> <P> The students' ideas of freedom burgeoned from the conditions of their daily  lives. They live six, eight, 10 to a room; they are outdoors studying at  daybreak for light to read by; they do not have enough electricity and food. In  another, "segregated" part of the dormitory, foreign students on larger  stipends live two to a room, and will leave soon for the outside world.  </P> <P> Chinese students have abided by the tradition that one must make sacrifices for  the family and also for guests and for the greater good. They agree to major in  fields of study which the elders deem indispensable to society. (I met graduate  students in English who have to write their thesis on some seemingly irrelevant  author such as Thackeray or one of the Sitwells.) They have to look forward to  being assigned a job at graduation and sent to a part of the country that needs  their skills. By law, they cannot marry until their mid-20s, and then spouses  are separated by work assignments.  </P> <P> There are many short stories about idealistic doctors, women who sacrifice  everything -- family life, money, health, status -- to toil as the lowliest  workers in the hospital's hierarchy. I hear the young people's longings for  freedom in the rumors that they can't help repeating. There's one about a  swimmer who was picked out of her cradle by Olympic scouts, taken from her  family and trained like the opera stars of old. "She was lucky enough to get  into an accident that ruined her swimming career," they say to one another.  "She's free to do something else with her life."  </P> <P> Families make large sacrifices, such as aborting female fetuses and forgoing  sons for the sake of population control. And on top of the life or death  hardships, many small deprivations cumulate. After the Cultural Revolution, no  sooner were pet birds and kung fu allowed back in the parks and streets, but  pet dogs and cats were banned from the cities. I saw a bicycle tip over and a  puppy jump out of the basket; the crowd laughed, watching its owner try to  catch his dog before he himself got caught by a policeman. That dog was like a  farmer from the countryside trying to sneak into Beijing without a permit. I  knew that a new friend trusted me when she told me that she had two pet cats  hidden in her apartment. Most people follow rules that are good for them. On No  Smoking Day, I saw only one man -- a rebellious type with a mustache -- light  up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Crisis of Belief'  </P> <P> Five years ago, I was among a group of American writers invited to Canton  University. Our meetings with students were canceled because "no one will take  responsibility for you." A British teacher invited us to her apartment, where  half a dozen students came two nights in a row. They confessed to a "crisis of  belief"; they spoke ashamedly, as though the loss of trust in the government  were their own shortcoming. The specific freedom they spoke about most was the  freedom to make friends. Because of "rumormongering," a boy and a girl cannot  become friends; nobody can trust anybody else.  </P> <P> They admitted to having read "Love Must Not Be Forgotten" by Zhang Jie. It is a  controversial story about undeclared love. Though Canton University (or perhaps  the Communist Party of Canton, according to rumor) had canceled Allen  Ginsberg's public reading, his reputation and his poetry fascinated people. He  was asked to stay another six weeks teaching at various schools. His students  were daring to consider sexual freedom and whether the freedom to speak wildly  and to love openly "spiritually polluted" this veteran of bohemianism -- and  themselves for listening.  </P> <P> I did not want to think that all the many regulations, for which I could very  well see the justifications, added up to a society that let no part of  anybody's life alone. The last straw was the schools and hotels putting on  disco dances and authorities trying to control them. Why do they have to  regulate this frivolous activity, too? On another trip in the spring of last  year, our group of Americans tried to get into a dance, but was turned away at  the door. The officials asked us to come back the next night to the foreigners'  dance. My son said that without our group, he and I, looking as Chinese as the  next person, could have gotten in. But we would have had to unknot and unwind  red tape and know the right people.  </P> <P> Even professionals from the West who are temporarily working in China are  supposed to "socialize with one's own work unit." To take an outsider to a  party, one has to make applications and get permits. At the foreigners' dance,  we watched as Chinese students were turned away. Then, a few weeks after we got  home, Beijing students rioted against African students, who brought to a dance  townies, or, according to rumors, prostitutes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Question of Character  </P> <P> During the past year, the students changed character. Perhaps some of the very  students who went on the racist rampage changed their ways, defining higher  principles and how to act on them. At a dozen colleges throughout the United  States, Chinese students asked me, "What is the essential Chinese character?  What is essentially Chinese? What is the essence of being Chinese?" One young  man said that deep inside, he felt a Chinese to be somehow weak. As a motherly  woman who has Confucian responsibilities, I told him that forbearance and  endurance are strengths; the willingness to make sacrifices is a strength. To  have the imagination and practicality to try the craziest social experiments is  a strength.  </P> <P> Twice I listened to young women wondering whether the Chinese language has a  word like the English word privacy. To carry out the one-child policy, there  are charts on walls listing every woman in the village and the dates of her  periods and her use of birth control. In the cities, waiting lists for housing  are years long, and young couples and their one child share a one-room  apartment with parents and grandparents. These women were searching for a word  to help legitimize their self-interest. The only term they came up with was a  legalistic one, "right to privacy."  </P> <P> A survey says that 76% of the 40,000 Chinese students in the United States,  most of them graduate students, want to stay. I questioned some of them about  brain-draining China. A smart freshman answered, "If I leave here, I'd be  draining the American brain." Like many others, she asked me about the '60s in  America. (That period in China was the start of the Cultural Revolution.)  Wasn't it a time when people passively sat like Thoreau at Walden Pond? I told  her that not so much "Walden" but "Civil Disobedience" had been our field  guide.  </P> <P> As if my counseling had political effect, days later -- ideas change, grow and  spread in moments -- I saw on TV among the walkie-talkies, floppy disks and fax  paper being packed for the protesters at Tian An Men Square a two-inch-thick  Xeroxed volume with the title "Manual for Nonviolent Action." Orville Schell,  who just returned from China, reports that students discussed with him Martin  Luther King Jr. on civil rights and Satyagraha. I loved hearing "We Shall  Overcome" again, sung by the students in Hong Kong. Later in San Francisco at  memorial services for "the martyrs for democracy," we sang "We Shall Overcome"  with a new verse, "China Will Be Free."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Culture Bound'  </P> <P> I was in Boston when the students there heard that the ones in China declared  that they would fast and sit-in and "parade" and give out flowers until June  20, the date the People's Congress met. Some graduate students in anthropology  on their way to hear Liu Binyan, dissident journalist and author of "Man or  Monster," wondered about freedoms being "culture bound."  </P> <P> Marx and Lenin were Europeans, yet China's communism is its own. Freedom is a  universal human want that takes forms peculiar to nations. A free press in  China would simply and practically allow the people to tell the bureaucratic  leaders about their hardships and to give suggestions for improvement. The  government ought to have set up hot lines earlier, and for a better purpose  than citizens informing on one another.  </P> <P> An important meaning of the Communist Revolution was women's liberation --  unbinding feet, ending slavery, the right to choose one's husband. Just so,  free speech will be a Chinese freedom -- the freedom to make friends, the  freedom to declare love, the freedom to dance with whomever you please.  "Democracy" is shorthand for freedoms that are specific and heart-deep.  </P> <P> Too bad "democracy" is a word too closely associated with "capitalism" and  "anti-communism." After the first breathtaking view of "The Goddess of  Freedom," I worried that it was the wrong symbol. Chinese call the Statue of  Liberty "The Goddess of Freedom." Their Goddess of Freedom had a stance of her  own and the students sang "The Internationale" when they unveiled her; they  were trying to integrate two political systems that have divided the world this  century. (A Statue of Liberty continues to stand in Canton; she had been built  with contributions from cities and towns all over North America and the Pacific  to honor 72 martyrs of the 1911 Revolution.) A world at peace is a vision so  rare, its symbols have hardly been invented.  </P> <P> The students did the right thing, dismantling guns and pouring the gasoline out  of the Molotov cocktails. And holding up their fingers in the 1960s V-for-peace  sign. And sitting beside a flower in front of the row of seated soldiers. And  wearing a slogan painted in red on the back of one's jacket -- in the  4,355-year-old tradition Gen. Yue Fei the Patriot, whose parents dedicated him  to China by cutting vows on his back. (The two consulate members who defected  in San Francisco did so during the week of the dragon boat races, a festival  honoring Chu Ping, a courtier who was banished in about 300 BC for protesting  the emperor's war plans.) And walking up to the tanks with nothing but one's  life and ideas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nonviolence Amid Tumult  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the students performed nonviolence in the midst of tumult.  Before their sit-in, riots broke out in Xian, where 130 policemen and uncounted  others were hurt. During the sit-in and hunger strike, a teacher at Cornell  showed me a letter from China; a student had been killed, and many students  beaten. It would have been best for the practitioners of nonviolence to have  waited for a lull in events when their purity of motive would be obvious. But  that may be an impossible circumstance.  </P> <P> The three weeks of nonviolence inside that square was itself to have been an  example of how the government and the workers, unionists, unemployed could  negotiate differences, how the elders could make changes without resorting to  yet another revolutionary civil war. Chai Ling, the 22-year-old woman student  who was "Supreme Commander of the Defense of Tian An Men," said after the  massacre, "Ours was a struggle between love and hate. Our objective was to make  a peaceful petition, and our chosen method would peacefully achieve this. It  wouldn't be a battle of weapons because we were making a peaceful petition."  </P> <P> The Chinese in the United States are devising inventive political actions in  response to the massacre of June 3-4. They are interviewing witnesses to  document what they saw happen. They are starting a newsletter and a video and  preparing a presentation to the U.N. They are jamming the informers' hot lines  while speaking and arguing with the operators and reporting Li Peng as a  criminal. They are sending news and encouragement via fax and posting  announcements and exchanging thoughts on computer bulletin boards. They are  nominating Chai Ling for the Nobel Peace Prize.  </P> <P> With its genius for community, San Francisco's Chinatown has organized the  Foundation for Chinese Democracy, 1118 Grant Ave., 101, San Francisco 94133, to  raise and distribute funds and to coordinate and support "activities and  programs that promote Democracy and Democratic Rights for ALL Chinese." The  immediate aims are to lobby for work permits, and for liberalization of the J-1  visa so that students would not have to go home for their two-year residency.  At a safer time, there will be more direct nonviolent help for the students in  China.  </P> <P> Describing the young man who danced in front of the tanks, and stopped them for  minutes, novelist Betty Bao Lord, wife of former Ambassador to China Winston  Lord, said, "His ancestors are with him." Yue Fei the Patriot and Chu Ping of  the Dragon Boat Races are his ancestors. His ancestors are also Thoreau, Gandhi  and Martin Luther King Jr. His relatives were with him, too, and they include  all of us on whose behalf he was braving a way of peace.  </P> <P> The students at Tian An Men (the Gate of Heavenly Peace) -- our children -- are  the latest evolution of human kind toward being a peaceful species. In China  and in every country we will have to repeat the nonviolence that those students  accomplished until we establish peace, until we establish love.  </P></p>

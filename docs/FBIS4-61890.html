			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aydyn Mekhtiyev report under the "Conflict" rubric: </F> "Shusha as Jerusalem. Azerbaijan Signs Russian Peace Plan With  Reservations"]    [Text] Azerbaijan has joined the protocol on a cease-fire  in the area of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, which was  earlier signed by the Armenian parliament chief, representatives  of Nagorno-Karabakh, and also mediators from the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly.    While affixing his signature to the Bishkek document,  Azerbaijani Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev voiced two  reservations. The Azerbaijani side requested that the term  "occupied territories" be replaced with "seized territories."  The Azerbaijani side also changed the passage setting forth the  need to bring in CIS observers into "international observers or  international forces." Ambassador Vladimir Kazimirov, Russian  special envoy, said in a press conference in Baku that these  amendments should not be seen as changes to the text itself,  because "for all those who signed the document in Bishkek the  text will remain just as they signed it." When asked why the  cities of Lachin and Shusha were not included in the list of  regions to be freed from a troop presence, he said: "The  situation of Shusha is somewhat reminiscent of Jerusalem's. The  Azerbaijani side says that this is its city, but the Armenian  side does not agree." So far, the Russian plan calls for the  cities of Agdam, Dzhebrail, Fizuli, Zangelan, and a number of  others to be freed. Kazimirov denied a statement that Russia is  trying to realize its imperial ambitions. He said that Russia's  objective is to put an end to the drawn-out conflict. The  Russian envoy recalled that the Moscow-proposed plan includes  three stages: a cease-fire and the cessation of hostilities  within six days; the release of all seized territories (except  for Shusha and Lachin), a speedy exchange of hostages and  prisoners of war, and the restoration of communications within  34 days. The third stage involves negotiations on the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh.    Meanwhile, the decision by the Azerbaijani parliament  leadership to sign the Bishkek protocol has drawn a negative  reaction from many opposition forces. On 10 May, a joint  statement was passed by 12 of the republic's political parties.  "Azerbaijani political forces do not recognize the protocol  signed in Bishkek, because it runs counter to the interests of  the Azerbaijani nation and effectively legally formalizes the  separation of the cities of Shusha and Lachin from Azerbaijan,"  the appeal says. The document stresses that disengagement  forces may only be brought into the region under the aegis of  the United Nations and the CSCE. Representatives of 12  political parties called on People's Assembly deputies to voice  a protest against the Russian Federation peace plan and to annul  Rasul Guliyev's signature under the protocol.    In Baku, the possibility of implementing the Bishkek  protocol  is assessed pessimistically, because after Rasul Guliyev signed  the protocol, David Shakhnazaryan, the Armenian president's  special envoy, said that the Karabakh forces were not going to  leave the occupied Azerbaijani territories in any event unless  peacekeeping troops are brought into the region. Azerbaijan,  however, opposes this approach, believing that if any  disengagement forces are to be brought in, this move must be  preceded by a complete withdrawal of Armenian troops from the  occupied territories.</p>

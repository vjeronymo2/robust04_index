			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi this  morning received (Chan Chichan), the charge d'affaires at the  embassy of the People's Republic of China in our country.    They discussed developments in the Yemeni arena and ties  between the two friendly countries.    During the meeting, the Chinese charge d'affaires underlined  his country's concern for Yemeni unity since it is a factor of  stability in the region.    For his part, the brother deputy prime minister voiced  appreciation for China's position on the events and developments  in our region. He also expressed the hope that the ties of  cooperation between the two countries will improve for the  benefit of the two friendly peoples' mutual interests.    The meeting also touched on the discussions that will be  held  at the UN Security Council and our country's position, since  these discussions run counter to the UN charter and constitute a  precedent that will affect not only Yemen, but also other  countries with worse internal situations than those in Yemen.</p>

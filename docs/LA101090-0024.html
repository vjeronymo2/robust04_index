			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: ROCKING DEVICE GETS KINKS OUT OF THE CALF  </P> <P> ProStretch is a rocking device intended to stretch calf muscles before and  after exercising to help prevent injury. The plastic, U-shaped rocker was  designed by a former hockey player and is endorsed by former world-champion  miler Marty Liquori and several professional athletes.  </P> <P> It is used by placing one foot in the heel cup of the device, standing an arm's  length from a wall or other support and slowly rocking the foot backward until  you feel a slight tension. Hold the heel in place for 15 seconds. Manufacturers  advise doing the exercise at least three times for each leg.  </P> <P> Randy Fodero, vice president of the New Jersey-based ProStretch company, said  the device is used by professional basketball and football team members,  including players from the Los Angeles Clippers, San Francisco 49ers and  Seattle Supersonics. Otho Davis, head trainer for the Philadelphia Eagles, said  he has seen many leg-muscle stretching devices in his 35 years as a trainer and  "nothing works as effectively as this."  </P> <P> ProStretch is available in selected sporting goods stores nationwide and  retails for about $30. If you can't find it in your area, contact ProStretch,  125 Broadway, Long Branch, N.J. 07740; (800) 535-3629.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dad's Drip Strip Removes Latex Paint  </P> <P> Tired of scraping bits of dried latex paint from the floor or woodwork after  painting? Consider Dad's Drip Strip, a multipurpose, nonflammable remover that  removes latex paint and appears to have little or no effect on oil-based  paints, varnishes, shellacs or lacquers.  </P> <P> To use, apply Drip Strip to a soft cloth or paper towel and blot away spots.  Then rub lightly. It dries fast and leaves no film or residue. It is a remover,  not a stripper, said Phil Bradley, president of Sansher Corp. in Ft. Wayne,  Ind., manufacturer of the product. It can be used on wood, glass, ceramic tile,  Formica, metal, carpet and other fabrics and concrete.  </P> <P> Dad's Drip Strip also can clean up glue, caulking, grease, tar, wax, crayon,  ink, shoe polish, lipstick marks, and adhesive tape. An 8-ounce can retails for  about $2.99. It's also available in quart and gallon sizes. The remover can be  purchased in selected home, hardware, paint and building supply stores  nationwide.

It now comes in a 22-ounce spray  bottle, for small spills and touch-up cleaning on cupboards, etc., and retails  for $1.89; $3.49 or a 64-ounce refill.

			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WASTELAND REVISITED  </P> <P> Rick Du Brow is an excellent addition to The Times television  coverage/commentary. He brings a fresh perspective to Calendar, and he is an  interesting read.  </P> <P> I particularly liked his comments regarding TV news in his Feb. 10 column. I,  too, have wondered just when we (as viewers) would begin to see some really  in-depth discussion regarding the collapse of communism around the globe. The  conservative/liberal debate on communism has dominated all the political  differences we have in the United States. Most candidates have been judged upon  their perception of this ideology and how they might cope with it.  </P> <P> As Du Brow asked: "Who was closer to the truth about communism?" This is an  important subject for debate, facts, detail. We need the benefit of serious  consideration of these issues, and we need men of stature (as Du Brow wrote)  from both liberal and conservative views to present them. It might help  eliminate a repetition of past mistakes as we deal with what we hope are the  remnants of this disastrous philosophy.  </P> <P> PATRICIA MERRILL, Los Angeles  </P></p>

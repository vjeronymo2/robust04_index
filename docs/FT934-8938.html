			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Double-digit rise at The Gap THE GAP, the US casual clothing store chain, impressed Wall Street yesterday by reporting a double-digit increase in earnings despite a flat retailing environment. Net income advanced to Dollars 78.9m, or 54 cents, compared with Dollars 62m, or 43 cents, in the corresponding period of 1992, when excessive inventory forced the clothing chain to mark down many prices. The results exceeded the forecasts of analysts, who had expected earnings of 47 to 50 cents, and triggered so much buyer interest that stock trading was briefly suspended. When activity resumed, the share price shot up Dollars 3 1/4 to close at a 52-week high of Dollars 39 5/8 . In the three months to the end of October, sales rose by a moderate 8.6 per cent to Dollars 898m, against Dollars 829m in the year-earlier quarter. The gain comes during a disappointing season for some US apparel retailers. Mr Thomas Kully, an analyst with William Blair, a New York securities firm, said the chain maintained a tighter grip on its inventory this autumn by limiting its collection to the most popular items. In the nine months to end October, net income was up to Dollars 149.1m, or Dollars 1.03, on revenues of Dollars 2.23bn, a 10 per cent gain.</p>

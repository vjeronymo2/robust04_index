			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE OFFERS FREE CLASS ON SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN  </P> <P> A free class on sexual abuse of children and adolescents is being offered to  county residents at Cypress College.  </P> <P> The instructor, Valerie Bradford, is a professional counselor with a graduate  degree in social work from USC.  </P> <P> She has a private practice in Orange.  </P> <P> Most class members have either been victims of sexual abuse themselves or have  been affected by the impact of abuse on others.  </P> <P> Of all substance abusers, 80% have been victims of sexual abuse, Bradford said.  </P> <P> She told the class that she too was a victim of abuse at the hands of a member  of her family.  </P> <P> Although a 1985 Los Angeles Times survey of more than 2,500 U.S. adults  indicated that 27% of women and 10% of men were sexually abused as children,  Bradford believes that the true number is much higher.  </P> <P> "When you include non-touching abuse (exhibitionism, pornography, etc.) the  total is closer to 50%," she said.  </P> <P> Sexual abuse occurs "when a person has been exploited by someone more powerful  than he or she for the perpetrator's sexual stimulation," Bradford said.  </P> <P> She added that the exploitation can be "either by an overt or covert sexual  contact."  </P> <P> The course is held Saturday mornings in Room AE7 at Cypress College, 9200  Valley View St. in Cypress and will continue to meet through mid-March.  </P> <P> Topics to be covered in future meetings include: theories regarding the causes  of sexual abuse, the impacts on victims, the law regarding disclosure and  treatment.  </P></p>

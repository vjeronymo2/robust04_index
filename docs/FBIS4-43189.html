			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of "exclusive" interview with Turkish Cypriot </F> community leader Rauf Denktas by Gul Demir and Niki Gamm in  Istanbul; date not given]    [Text] [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] -- Would you describe your  reactions to the Butrus-Ghali report last week? Are you  satisfied with the actions being taken by the United Nations  Secretary General and his staff or do you think it would be  better if some mechanism could be found for the Greek and the  Turkish Cypriot sides to talk together without being compelled  or threatened?    [Denktas] "Frustration" I think is the word!.. We had worked  hard with the representative of the Secretary-General until  23.00 hours on 31 May 1994 and gave our views to him in writing.  We had said "yes" to almost everything and yet, next day, in  spite of the seven hours' difference between New York and  Cyprus, the effort of 31 May was not even referred to by the  Secretary-General, whose report was dated 30 May. He did not  think it necessary to put a new paragraph in his report and thus  inform the Security Council of the latest developments. We have  now requested the Secretary-General to make a second report and  give the Security Council a full picture of the latest position.  (Yesterday the Secretary-General announced that he would submit  a supplementary report to the Security Council which outlines  the further progress made towards a settlement to the Cyprus  problem.)    The report has created great uproar amongst the Turkish  people, both in Turkey and in the TRNC [Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus]. This is not helpful for the negotiations.  Loss of confidence between the parties to the conflict and the  secretariat should be avoided.    The Secretary General has proposed that a new way be found  for tackling the problem. I would say that what we need is a  new diagnosis of the problem. The problem arose in 1963 when  the Greek Cypriot partner in the Partnership Republic tried to  convert a bicommunal republic into a Greek Cypriot Republic.  The problem became utterly intractable when the Security  Council, in its wisdom, treated the wrongdoer as the legitimate  government of Cyprus. The problem has not been solved for 30  years because Greek Cypriot preference is to keep the title of  "the government of Cyprus" and reap the political and monetary  benefits which go with this title... As the Turkish Cypriot  partner refuses to recognize the Greek Cypriot pretence to be  the government of Cyprus the problem drags on...    Under the 1960 Agreements and the Constitution of the island  one community cannot rule the other nor can any one community  claim to be the government of the whole island... but for the  recognition afforded to the Greek Cypriot regime by the Security  Council, the pretenders to power in Cyprus, would by now be  facing charges for offenses against humanity before an  international Court of Justice.    I have asked for direct talks with Mr. Kliridhis but he  refuses to meet me, saying that if he meets me his status will  be lowered or mine be elevated to his status... Fear of losing  what he knows is not his prevents him from talking to me face to  face.    [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] You have been quoted in the Turkish  press within the last two weeks as saying that: you believe it  is time to consider some form of union with Turkey; it might be  a good idea to sign an agreement with the Greek Cypriots  pledging not to attack each other; and you are willing to  continue talking about the Confidence Building Measures  including those aspects which were agreed upon during the Vienna  meetings. Would you comment on these please?    [Denktas] The Greek Cypriot application for admission to the  European Union (EU) as "Cyprus" is an unacceptable, legally void  act... By this act the Greek Cypriot side is trying to integrate  with Greece via the EU! This is contrary to the Treaty of  Establishment.    This act is contrary to the principles of modern democracy.  In Cyprus, even under the 1960 Constitution the two communities  elected their representatives separately. Legitimacy in the  Executive and in Parliament arose when the democratically  elected representatives of the two communities took up office  jointly! In his December 1963 coup, Makarios aimed to destroy  the democratic institutions of the Turkish Cypriot partner but  failed to do so. Turkish Cypriots continued to rule themselves  through their democratically elected representatives even after  the destruction of the 1960 Republic... That is why the Greek  Cypriot leaders cannot represent the whole population of the  island... The Secretary-General, fully aware of this situation,  ruled that any application for EU membership should be through  separate referenda of the two communities.    In spite of all this, the EU is encouraging the Greek  Cypriots to believe that their acceptance "as Cyprus" to EU  membership is a matter of months. If this process continues and  we see a real danger that it will materialize then we have to  make a counter move in order to avoid one sided integration with  Greece... We have to find ways and means of integrating with  Turkey. "What is good for the goose should be good for the  gander" is a good saying!...    Look at what the Greek Cypriots are doing vis-a-vis Greece.  Defense agreements; giving sea and air bases to Greece;  agreement to speak with one voice on Cyprus; social, educational  economic agreements with Greece.    All these are between the Greek Cypriots and Greece... and  all, for the advancement of the national "cause." All these in  complete disregard of the views, feelings and rights of Turkish  Cypriot side!... If we do not plan a counter action we shall be  wiped off the map of Cyprus like the Cretan Turks in the  1900s!... We have to take counter action in self-defense... We  shall integrate with Turkey in line with Greek Cypriot  integration with Greece... There is no other way. We do not  want to be colonized by Greece and the Greek Cypriots have no  right to pull us into the EU when economically and politically  we are not ready for it!... We have our democratic institutions  able to express the political will of our people on such  matters. But we have not even been asked our views by the  so-called Government of Cyprus.    If the EU wants a settlement in Cyprus it should tell the  Greek Cypriot leaders that they have no right to apply for EU  membership in the absence of a separate mandate from the Turkish  side!...    I have repeatedly invited the Greek Cypriot leaders to sign  a  non-aggression agreement with us so that people on both sides  relax and peace initiatives are given a better chance... I  invited Kiprianou, Vasiliou and now Kliridhis... Each time their  answer has been the same: if they sign such an agreement with  us, this will be tantamount to recognition!... But my  initiatives are on a communal basis. I say let us sign these  agreements as community leaders and let us put a clear clause  with them that such agreements in no way mean recognition for  either party... Their answer is the same... The fear of losing  the "title" of the government of Cyprus is too deep in their  hearts... They know that they have no legitimate right to  present themselves as "the Government of Cyprus" and they fear  that the smallest mistake may cause this false title to slide  away from them!...    The Vienna accord has to be part and parcel of the 21 March  paper... If so, we are ready to start negotiating on this  paper...    [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] The Greek Cypriots have been arming  themselves ever further and a Jane's Defense Weekly article has  just appeared in which it is written that they spent over 500  million dollars this past year on arms which included offensive  weapons. Would you comment on this? What about the report over  the weekend in Turkey that the Greek Cypriots and the Greeks  have, at least for the time being, abandoned the idea of signing  a mutual defense pact?    [Denktas] The purchase of arms is in its fourth year.  Countries which are permanent members of the Security Council  keep on selling arms to what they consider to be "the Government  of Cyprus" while the Security Council calls upon the two sides  not to do anything which might exacerbate the situation!... Each  day Greek Cypriot leaders tell us why they are arming! They will  carry the Greek flag to the north! How can anyone talk of a new  partnership government with these people when such war cries go  on.    If the Security Council does not review the facts of Cyprus  and does not have a look at the Rule of Law, this dangerous  trend will continue and the Greek Cypriot attempt to convert  Cyprus into a Greek island will not stop... That has to stop if  the two sides are to be good neighbors in the future. The news  item that the Greek Cypriots and Greece have abandoned the idea  of signing an initial defense pact for the time being is no  comfort to us. Greek generals come and go to south Cyprus for  the implementation of this agreement. Greece is clandestinely  sending 90 renovated tanks to Cyprus under this agreement.  Search and preparation for air and sea bases continue  unhindered... Are all these compatible with what the  Secretary-General is trying to do in Cyprus? Of course not!...  But the "good Greeks" are never censured for these misdeeds.    [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] There have been two shooting  incidents at Lefka in which shots were fired at Turkish  positions from the Greek Cypriot side. At the same time two  Turks who were in southern Cyprus were killed last week. Has  any explanation of either incident been forthcoming from the  Greek Cypriots (as opposed to what has been written in their  newspapers)? Do you think these were ill-considered attempts to  provoke the northern side into reaction?    [Denktas] Hardly 300 Turkish Cypriots live in the south.  Twenty-two of them have recently been severely beaten and forced  to walk over to the north under threats of being shot. A few  days ago, masked Greek Cypriots brutally killed two Turkish  Cypriots living with them in the south.. And border  disturbances, firing shots at random are becoming more and more  "popular pastimes" on the Greek Cypriot side... "The best Turk  is a dead Turk" is a popular saying amongst Greek Cypriot  youth!..    [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] Is there anything NATO can do to bring  about a just settlement to the Cyprus problem? Or would it be  better if that organization didn't become involved at all?    [Denktas] This is the shape of things... and these are the  difficulties which confront us and perfectly frustrate the  Secretary-General... But I am adamant in my view that what  prevents a settlement is the treatment of the Greek Cypriot side  as the legitimate government of Cyprus.    Some authority has to tell the Greek Cypriot side that this  title does not given them any authority over the Turkish Cypriot  partner of the defunct State who now live in the North under  their own democratic regime... The way to a settlement is to  talk face to face and seek a solution which will be just, viable  and permanent. Mr. Hugo Gobbi, the former Special  Representative of the Secretary- General in Cyprus, has just  written a pamphlet under the eye-opening title of "Rethinking  Cyprus." Mr. Gobbi loves Cyprus and has good friends in North  and South. He writes passionately from his experience and  points out the way to peace. His recipe is short and sound.  "Land for recognition and cooperation as good neighbors" is  what he says. The rest should be left to time, to evolution.</p>

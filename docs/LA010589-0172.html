			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> CITY MANAGER WARDEN FIRED BY CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> Citing philosophical differences, the City Council fired City Manager Murray L.  Warden at the Council's regular meeting Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "This was essentially a parting of the ways," said Mayor Charles V. (Chuck)  Smith, who added that Warden, who was hired 8 months ago, and the council  "never clicked." The termination was effective immediately.  </P> <P> The decision was announced after Warden met with council members in a closed  session to discuss his job performance, Smith said.  </P> <P> Warden accepted the position of city administrator, but the job later was  modified, with the City Council's approval, and he was given the city manager's  title.  </P> <P> "Murray had his way of doing things, and they didn't always coincide with the  council's way," Smith said. "We didn't really clash, but we didn't really have  a meeting of the minds as to how things were going to get done."  </P> <P> Jerry Kenny, public works director, was to become interim city manager  immediately.  </P> <P> Kenny, who has been employed with the city 15 years, is a former community  development director and former director of finance.  </P> <P> Warden could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P></p>

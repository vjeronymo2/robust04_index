			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES PROMOTE SWANSON TO MEDIA DIRECTOR  </P> <P> Jerry Kapstein, wasting no time in making changes in the Padre front office,  Saturday promoted Mike Swanson to director of media relations.  </P> <P> It's Kapstein's first move since he was named Thursday by Padre owner Joan Kroc  to oversee the daily operations of the franchise.  </P> <P> Sources have said Kapstein will continue making employee evaluations upon his  return to town Tuesday.  </P> <P> Those expected to be most closely evaluated are President Dick Freeman; Bill  Adams, executive director of ticket sales and operations; Jim Winters, director  of broadcasting; Andy Strasberg, director of marketing, and Chuck Gelman, vice  president of communications. The five executives earn a total of more than  $700,000, sources said.  </P> <P> Swanson, 35, assistant director of media relations since 1984, fills the  vacancy left by Bill Beck in January when Beck became administrative assistant  to Jack McKeon, manager and vice president/baseball operations.  </P> <P> "He's in the top of his field," Beck said of Swanson. "There's certainly no  better stat man I've ever been around."  </P> <P> Swanson, who attended the University of Kansas, previously worked for the  Kansas City Royals, ABC and NBC.  </P> <P> He was the statistician for a CBS radio crew, including Padre broadcaster Jerry  Coleman, that covered the 1984 All-Star game in San Francisco. Coleman returned  to San Diego raving about his new acquaintance, and a month later, Beck  requested Swanson's assistance in preparing the post-season media guide.  </P> <P> "Once the World Series was over, Bill asked me if I'd stay," Swanson said.  "Even though I loved by job with CBS working mostly football and basketball, I  knew all along baseball was my first love, and what better place than this?"  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): Regions will diverge as the rally slows - Bonds / The US is out of recession, but Germany hasn't bottomed. And European markets should be assessed on an individual basis SO FAR, it has been a bumper year for international bond investors, and while the three-year global bond rally appears to be slowing, most observers say it is still far from over. Bond yields worldwide have slid sharply, and, amid sluggish growth and high unemployment, continued disinflationary policies in most countries are expected to pressure real and nominal yields further, keeping bond prices firmly supported. Moreover, given the high valuation of most equity markets, the attractiveness of fixed-income investments remains intact. 'If you don't buy bonds, what are you going to buy?' asks Philip Saunders, fixed interest investment director at Guinness Flight Global Asset Management. However, increasing regional divergences  - with the US economy well out of recession, while Germany still hasn't bottomed  - will affect global bonds and currencies very differently in coming months. While the the end of the easing cycles in the US and Japan is in sight, European bonds are likely to benefit from further easing. However, Europe's markets should be assessed on a more individual basis since August 2, when the fluctuation bands for most currencies in Europe's exchange-rate mechanism were widened to 15 per cent. In many countries, the effective suspension of the ERM brought to light the fundamentals that the old-style system had masked. A case in point is Belgium, which was considered a hard-core currency thanks to its peg to the D-Mark, but whose bond market has come under increasing pressure as its underlying problems  - spiralling debt and political uncertainty  - have become more apparent. Nevertheless, 'Europe still has considerable mileage, partly because real interest rates are still quite high by historical comparison,' says Mr Saunders. For unhedged sterling-based investors, currency considerations indicate that 'they couldn't do much better than by staying in the UK,' says Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets. For one, gilts offer attractive yields compared with most European core markets. In early October, the 8 per cent gilt due 2003 yielded some 97 basis points over Germany's 6.5 per cent Bunds due 2003. Moreover, Mr Jessop says that, despite higher-than-expected August RPI, underlying inflationary pressures remain subdued. Lastly, he notes that the currency is undervalued. 'With economic recovery under way in the UK and most continental economies in recession, sterling has scope to appreciate against most European currencies on a three- to six-month view,' agrees Nick Henderson, head of fixed interest at Gartmore Investment, which manages about Pounds 1.4bn in its bond funds. Gartmore's Henderson favours gilts with maturities between seven and 10 years, which, he says, stand to benefit most from further interest-rate cuts. Although the bulk of issuance is being done at the intermediate part of the yield curve, the fact that roughly two-thirds of this year's estimated Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement is already funded indicates that the market will absorb further supply with relative ease. For those investing in currency-hedged funds, other European bond markets may offer even better returns, however. Many fund managers are still keen on high-yielding Italian bonds, which have been Europe's star performer in the past two quarters. The combination of a weak economy, improving inflation prospects and fiscal tightening is expected to lead to substantial interest-rate cuts, further boosting bond prices and narrowing Italian bonds' yield gap over other markets. At the beginning of the month, Italian 10-year bonds currently yielded some 310 basis points over German bunds and 215 over 10-year gilts. The only cloud on the Italian horizon is political uncertainty amid the current budget debate and ahead of national elections, expected next spring. However, the market is widely expected to recover from any sell-off, supported in the long term by its solid fundamentals. Some 25 per cent of Guinness Flight's Dollars 25m European bond fund is invested in Italy, says Mr Saunders. Another quarter is invested in Ecu bonds, which 'trade in a similar fashion to French bonds but offer a reasonable yield pick-up.' Some 40 per cent of the fund's currency exposure is in sterling, 40 per cent is in Italian lire and 20 per cent in Swedish kronor. TO INVESTORS shying away from Europe's higher-risk high-yielders, French bonds still offer an attractive alternative among the hard-core markets. Bond strategists at UBS expect French bonds to outperform Germany, with the yield on French 10-year bonds seen falling as much as 30 basis points below its German counterpart as the Bund rally stalls. In many markets, the absence of inflationary pressures, prospects for a sustained period of low short-term rates andinvestors' desire to boost their returns will act as powerful incentives for moving along the yield curves, note economists at SG Warburg Securities. Meanwhile, many investors are reducing their bond exposure to the US and Japan. The two markets make up only 20 per cent of Guinness Flight's global bond fund, with European bond markets accounting for the remaining 80 per cent, though the fund's currency exposure is dollar-oriented, with 65 per cent exposed to the dollar bloc, 10 per cent in yen and the rest in a mix of European currencies.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: World Commodities Prices: Market report The PLATINUM price rose Dollars 2.50 yesterday to Dollars 360.25 a troy ounce, reaching the highest point for three weeks and widening still further its premium over the GOLD price, which was up only 40 cents at Dollars 334.45 an ounce. Dealers said platinum had run up on the back of a six-day rally in Japanese stocks, fresh violence in South Africa over the weekend and hopes that recent signs of a US economic upturn would be confirmed by data this week. But it lacked the momentum to break through resistance in the Dollars 360/Dollars 362 area. Trading on the London Metal Exchange was active with markets ending mixed after retreating from highs. Dealers said profit-taking, hedge selling and technical sales crept in from midday onwards, attracted by the extent and the speed of the recent rally. London COCOA futures ended with extended losses, depressed by long liquidation of prompt December contracts before that position became tenderable today. March cocoa ended at Pounds 727 a tonne, down Pounds 10. Compiled from Reuters</p>

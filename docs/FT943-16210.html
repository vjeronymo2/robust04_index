			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Aid for coal and steelworkers A total of 5,000 coalworkers and 13,000 steelworkers in Belgium, Germany and Britain will benefit from a European Commission aid package, announced yesterday by Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner. The aid - available for such areas as retirement, unemployment, vocational training and redeployment - amounts to Ecu38m (Pounds 29.7m). It will benefit workers who lost their jobs in the past two years. The commission also said it would add Ecu21m to a Ecu60m grant given last year for steelworkers made redundant as a result of the EU steel restructuring plan. Last year some 23,000 steelworkers in Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and Britain benefited from this programme. Mr Flynn said the aid would ensure that ex-miners and steelworkers received a high level of social protection and would also be given a helping hand into new jobs.</p>

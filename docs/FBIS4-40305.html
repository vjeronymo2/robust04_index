			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Kyzyl, 16 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- "The Russian regions  are starting at different levels and need differing approaches  to building their statehood," said Russian President Boris  Yeltsin on the results of his working trip to Blagoveshchensk  and Tuva at a meeting with the leadership of that republic.    "We must not create `standard republics'. They are never  going to be the same, they all have their own features," the  president believes. "When implementing economic policy we have  to take account of the regional particularities of each  component of the Russian Federation. We will be working out a  specific line for relations with every republic, oblast, and  kray," Boris Yeltsin noted.    Life in the Republic of Tuva depends on its relations with  the outside world. Many difficulties could have been avoided if  ties with the regions of the Russian Federation had not broken  down. Tuva, the president noted, borders on Mongolia and has  contacts with China -- these ties must be developed. The  republic can only be brought out of its grave economic situation  through pushing ahead with the development of contacts with  other regions, in part through taking part in the "Siberian  Accord" interregional association.    President Yeltsin stressed that strengthening the Russian  Federation is the president's most important task. "The state  must have a single economic space and a single body of  legislation," he said. "This means opening up unique  opportunities for every part of Russia on this basis."    Moving on to the economic state of the republic, Boris  Yeltsin noted that basic indicators in Tuva are considerably  worse than the average in Russia. This means the Republic of  Tuva is unable to live by its own means.    Touching on his working visit to Amur Oblast, which ended 15  May, Boris Yeltsin said that this oblast should not, by virtue  of its economic structure, be subsidized. It can get out of  that situation. But the president is not setting Tuva the same  task: "The difference is too great between specific indices and  the people's standard of living. It would be unfair to tell  them to live by their own means. The people and the leadership  there cannot do that and nobody is blaming them for that. That  is how the structure of Tuva's economy has developed.  Therefore, we must help the republic do enough to bring the  standard of living of its people up to the standard of living of  people throughout Russia."    Moreover, the president noted, he does not intend to confine  himself to promises alone, but has given a guarantee to the  leaders of Tuva that there will be solid assistance from the  Russian budget.    The president called on the people of Tuva to work more  actively on assimilating market relations and moving the reforms  forward.    He noted the rich natural resources of Tuva. In the  president's opinion, the republic could supply itself with  timber and electricity and develop resort tourism. The most  acute problem for the region in all this is developing the  infrastructure and transportation links.    Boris Yeltsin expressed hope that the population in the  republic will get their "second wind" following this meeting  with the president of Russia.    In conclusion, the president said that two decrees which he  signed in Tuva for the development of the economy and the social  sphere in the republic must be implemented. The president noted  that the former lack of trust between the center and the Tuva  leadership has now been overcome and that the strained  atmosphere among nationalities of two years ago no longer exists  in the republic. The main thing now is therefore to act  together to bring the republic's economy out of crisis in order  to establish normal social conditions for the population of Tuva.</p>

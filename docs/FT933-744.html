			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / SA to begin loan payback next year SOUTH AFRICA is next year to begin repaying international borrowings which have been frozen since 1985, under an arrangement it has concluded with creditor banks resolving the debt standstill. Addressing an investor conference in New York yesterday, Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, said South Africa would repay, over eight years starting in January 1994, the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.33bn) that is still affected by the standstill arrangements. The third interim arrangement between the government and creditor banks expires at the end of this year. The agreement should improve the country's credit rating in international capital markets and assist the negotiation of new loans. It will alleviate the balance of payments constraint - the need to run a current account surplus to finance capital outflows of more than Dollars 1bn a year - that has hampered economic growth over the past eight years. It also represents a further step in the normalisation of South Africa's relations with the international financial community following the call on Friday by Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, for the lifting of remaining economic sanctions against the country. Politicians around the world have responded quickly to Mr Mandela's call. The US Senate on Friday approved in record time legislation lifting US sanctions and Mr David Dinkins, mayor of New York, submitted similar legislation to the city council. He also said he had sent letters to mayors across the country requesting them to follow his example. The European Community and the Commonwealth have also indicated that they will follow suit. One notable characteristic of the latest debt agreement is that it was endorsed by all the main political forces in South Africa. This was in response to the demands of creditors who said that, unlike the three previous arrangements which were purely technical affairs, this agreement required political consensus. Government officials are anxious to stress that this enhanced co-operation among South Africa's main political groupings about the country's international financial relations also extended to its recent revised offer on trade liberalisation made to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and to an application for an Dollars 850m loan from the International Monetary Fund in terms of its compensatory and contingency finance facility. The main terms of the 1994 debt arrangement are that it will run until August 15 2001, with an initial payment of 10 per cent (Dollars 500m) and the balance payable in 15 half-year instalments. Approximately 40 per cent of the amount of outstanding debt subject to the standstill arrangement will be repaid during the first five years and the remaining 60 per cent during the last three years. The debt standstill arose in September 1985 when South Africa defaulted on the repayment of Dollars 13.6bn of foreign debt, which was over half of its total outstanding foreign debt at the time. The standstill was precipitated by creditor banks, led by Chase Manhattan of the US, demanding repayment of their loans as apartheid political attitudes hardened. South Africa's total foreign debt was Dollars 17.2bn at the end of 1992, or 15 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 43 per cent when the standstill was declared.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGER NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> PUNTER TRADED, OFFENSIVE GUARD ACQUIRED  </P> <P> Two trades, hardly of the blockbuster variety, three cuts and three injury  settlements put the Chargers' roster officially at the required 60-man limit  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Punter Keith English, who averaged 41.7 yards during the first three exhibition  games, was traded to the Rams for a 10th-round draft selection, General Manager  Bobby Beathard said. English, cut by the Raiders in exhibition season last  year, doesn't have the same versatility as starter John Kidd, who also holds on  place-kicks and played quarterback in college.  </P> <P> After acquiring English, the Rams basically handed him a job by cutting former  Charger Hank Ilesic and Kent Elmore, a seventh-round draft pick.  </P> <P> In the second trade, the Chargers acquired offensive guard Mike Zandofsky from  Phoenix for a low-round draft choice. Zandofsky, 24, started seven games last  season as a rookie from Washington.  </P> <P> "He looks pretty good to us on film," Beathard said. "He's a real tough  aggressive football player. We liked him when we were down there scrimmaging  against Phoenix."  </P> <P> The Chargers will be required to make another roster cut when Zandofsky  arrives.  </P> <P> In other moves Tuesday, the Chargers agreed to injury settlements with tackle  Joey Howard (knee), running back Joe Mickles (knee) and wide receiver Troy  Johnson (punctured lung). This means all three are released but will be on the  team's payroll until it is determined that they are healthy enough to practice.  </P> <P> Of the three, Beathard says Mickles is the biggest loss. A second-year running  back from Mississippi, Mickles had established himself as a valuable special  teams player.  </P> <P> "He's been playing well, but he does have a knee that's going to need surgery  sooner or later," Beathard said. "He was playing on it, but it was only a  matter of time before it went."  </P> <P> Beathard said the Chargers would consider bringing either Mickles or Johnson  back if there are injury problems during the regular season. But it appears  Howard is gone for good.  </P> <P> "Joey had opportunities," Coach Dan Henning said. "He was struggling early (in  camp). I think he needs a change of scenery. He's got talent, and I think he's  capable of playing. He's got to believe he's got it. Sometimes, I'm not sure he  does believe he has it."  </P> <P> Also waived Tuesday were defensive end Leonard Johnson, wide receiver Lee Allen  and kicker John Carney.  </P> <P> The release of Carney wasn't surprising. Henning had indicated Sunday that the  Chargers were leaning toward Fuad Reveiz, who kicked for the Miami Dolphins  from 1985-88 before missing last season with an injury. Beathard said releasing  Carney allows the Chargers another week to evaluate players at other positions.  </P> <P> Junior Seau, the Charger's first-round draft selection from USC, spent his  first full day at training camp Tuesday, and Henning said he fit right in.  </P> <P> "He's been excellent," Henning said. "He's not where he wants to be, obviously.  He's got a lot to remember now to get back into the comfort zone of being able  to go out there and not think.  </P> <P> "He raises up the tempo of everybody around him. He's shown quickness, and he's  shown strength."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning is concerned with depth at three positions: offensive tackle,  cornerback and tight end. All have been depleted by injuries. . . . Asked about  his primary objective in Saturday's final exhibition against the Raiders,  Henning said: "Get out of it healthy."  </P></p>

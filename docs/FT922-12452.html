			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: Resurrection of optimism as recession is receding - The Australian market is ready to advance after a poor showing in the last quarter THE AUSTRALIAN Stock Exchange has suffered a severe attack of vertigo over the last three months, wiping out the modest gains made during rallies in November and January. But brokers remain confident that a substantial advance is likely over the remainder of the year as the domestic economy recovers from recession. The Australian market has been one of the world's poorest performers since the global crash in 1987, when the All Ordinaries Index slumped from 2,300 to 1,150 in a couple of months. In spite of repeated attempts to talk up the market, the index has never since exceeded 1,800, and is currently trading at around 1,580 - roughly the level it reached in mid-1988 at the end of the initial post-crash upswing. It closed on Thursday at 1,590. There were hopes of a solid advance in the second half of last year, and again in January, when the index looked likely to break through the psychologically important 1,700 barrier. But both rallies petered out in the face of recession, political instability, and weakness in overseas markets. Much of the nervousness is related to a flood of disappointing results from major companies for the six months to December, which were combined with warnings that little improvement could be expected in the current half. Investors have also been deterred by bad economic news from the US, the UK and Japan, which tend to set the tone for the Australian market. There is particular concern about the possibility of a recession in Japan, which takes about 26 per cent of Australian exports, mostly in the form of raw commodities which form the feedstock for many of Japan's consumer industries. For this reason, the recent dramatic fall in the Tokyo market has done much to unsettle Australian investors, in spite of indications that the Japanese economy will continue to grow over the coming year, albeit at a modest rate. Optimists also point out that most of Australia's exports to Japan are commodities such as iron ore and coal which are the subject of long-term contracts. Japanese buyers have sometimes varied the terms of the contracts in difficult periods, but none has ever been cancelled, probably because it is in the buyers' interest to maintain secure sources of supply in Australia. Even if Japan does move into recession, the impact on Australia should be offset by increasing sales to the rest of Asia, which now takes about 19 per cent of Australian exports (excluding New Zealand). Most of the dynamic economies of the region are expected to continue to grow quickly in the short term, whatever happens in Tokyo. The domestic economy is also looking healthier than for some time, as it emerges from six successive quarters of flat or negative growth - the worst recession since 1983. Changes in statistical definitions have clouded the picture, but gross domestic product grew by 0.4 per cent on the income-based measure in the three months to December, and further growth is confidently predicted by most economists for the quarter to March. Most of the indicators are now pointing in the right direction - housing finance approvals, for example, jumped by 13.7 per cent in February, and the widely watched Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment has improved by 21 per cent since January. In addition, a ADollars 2.3bn public spending stimulus announced in February should shortly begin to have an impact on the depressed construction sector. A slow recovery is taking place in the rural sector - still an important export industry - and some analysts say there is substantial potential for a significant improvement in the resources sector as base metals producers reap the benefits of forecast falls in inventories of metals such as copper, lead and tin. Both farm producers and miners will be helped by a fall in the value of the Australian dollar, which is trading at around 76 US cents, compared to a peak of more than 80 cents in September. Most economists believe improvements in commodity prices will continue to prop up the Australian dollar, in spite of a fall in official interest rates to 7.5 per cent from a peak of 18 per cent in late 1989. Many think the resilience of the dollar, combined with a fall in inflation to 1.5 per cent, has opened the way for a further 0.5 per cent in cut in official rates in the next few months. The bond markets have begun to reflect that view in recent weeks, pushing short-term bills down to 7.3 per cent. All these factors should add up to a return to sufficient growth to guarantee the formal end of the recession when the March quarter figures are released in June. If that happens, it may be enough to trigger a recovery in confidence, which many brokers feel would propel the index towards the elusive 1,800 barrier. But after the disappointments of the last couple of years, few investors will be willing to bet their shirts on it.</p>

Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth below, the Commission finds that approval of the Exchange's proposed rule change, for a temporary period ending on April 30, 1994, is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of sections 6 and 11A of the Act. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The Commission believes that the Amex proposal is reasonably designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, further investor protection and the public interest in fair and orderly markets on national securities exchanges, as well as facilitate the linking of qualified markets through appropriate communications systems and execution of investors' orders in the best market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7&blank;14 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;78f and 78k&hyph;1 (1988). See Amex AHT Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 4, for a complete description of the AHT procedures and the Commission's rationale for approving the proposal on a pilot basis. The discussion in that order is incorporated by reference into this order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Commission's release approving the New York Stock Exchange's (``NYSE'') Off-Hours Trading (``OHT'') facility, the Commission noted the benefits that would accrue to investors through the development of an after-hours trading session. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  By allowing Amex members to enter single-sided and coupled orders into an after-hours facility, as well as permitting the migration of certain limit orders (GTX orders) from the regular 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session for possible execution in the AHT facility, the Amex is providing a mechanism for maintaining its own individual marketplace on a competitive level with the NYSE and the regional exchanges. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Accordingly, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change which enables members to enter both proprietary and agency orders in Exchange-traded equity securities, including stocks, rights, warrants, primes and scores, ADRs, and non-option equity derivative products, for execution at the Exchange's last closing regular way price should be extended until April 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8&blank;See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29237 (May 24, 1991), 56 FR 24853 (May 31, 1991) (approving File Nos. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;52 and SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;90&hyph;53). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9&blank;Concurrently with this order, the Commission is also approving proposals submitted by the NYSE, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'') and the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''), to extend, through April 30, 1994, the respective pilot programs in place on those exchanges which provide for executions of securities during after-hours trading sessions. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32362 (May 25, 1993) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;23); 32365 (May 25, 1993) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;10); 32368 (May 25, 1993) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;93&hyph;06); 32364 (May 25, 1993) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;16); and 32367 (May 25, 1993) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;93&hyph;6). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991, the Commission approved proposals submitted by the BSE, CHX, Phlx, and PSE which require their specialists to provide primary market protection to limit orders, designated as executable after the close of the regular trading session, based on volume that prints in the primary market's after-hours session. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29301 (June 13, 1991) 56 FR 28182 (granting temporary accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;91&hyph;04; 29297 (June 13, 1991), 56 FR 28191 (granting temporary accelerated approval to File No. MSE&hyph;91&hyph;11); 29300 (June 13, 1991), 56 FR 28212 (granting temporary partial approval to File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;91&hyph;26) and 29749 (September 27, 1991), 56 FR 50405 (order granting temporary accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;91&hyph;32); 29305 June 13, 1991), 56 FR 28208 (granting partial temporary accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;91&hyph;21); and 29543 (August 9, 1991), 56 FR 40929 (order granting accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;28). On May 25, 1993, the Commission approved extensions of the Amex, NYSE, CHX, BSE, PSE, and Phlx pilots until January 31, 1994. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32365 (May 25, 1993), 58 FR 31560 (June 3, 1993) (order granting accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;93&hyph;10); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32363 (May 25, 1993), 58 FR 31558 (June 3, 1993) (order granting accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;93&hyph;19); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32368 (May 25, 1993), 58 FR 31563 (June 3, 1993) (order granting accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;MSE&hyph;93&hyph;6); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32367 (May 25, 1993), 58 FR 31570 (June 3, 1993) (order granting accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;93&hyph;6); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32364 (May 25, 1993), 58 FR 31574 (June 3, 1993) (order granting accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;16) and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32362 (May 25, 1993), 58 FR 31565 (June 3, 1993) (order granting accelerated approval to File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;23). All of the after-hours pilot programs were scheduled to expire January 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its orders approving and extending the Amex AHT pilot program, the Commission requested that the Amex provide the Commission with specific data and a report regarding the operation of the Amex's AHT pilot. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10&blank;Among other things,the Commission requested that the Amex monitor and report on GTX, single-sided and coupled order executions in its trading floor to ensure that Amex specialists are not taking unfair advantage of information derived regarding which orders on their books are designated GTX and the priority among those orders. In addition, the Commission requested that the following information (broken down by month) be included in the Amex report: trading volume (trades and number of shares) in after-hours session; the number, if any, of (1) single-sided orders; (2) coupled buy and sell orders; and (3) GTX orders executed in the after-hours session; the number, if any, of single-sided and coupled orders comprised of primes and scores or comprised of equity derivative products that are executed in the after-hours session; the number, if any, of (1) single-sided orders; and (2) single-sided GTX orders that remained unexecuted at the end of the after-hours session; the number and percentage of GTC orders on the book that were designated ``GTX''; the number of member firms participating in the after-hours session; whether the Amex marketplace has experienced any increased volatility during the last hour of the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session after the initiation of the after-hours session; whether there were greater (wider) quote spreads during the last hour of the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session after the initiation of the after-hours session; whether there was a diminution in the number of block transactions during the last hour after the initiation of the after-hours session; and the degree to which transactions were entered in the after-hours session to avoid the restrictions of the short sale rule in the 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. trading session. Furthermore, the Amex's report should also indicate: (1) How its after-hours facility could link with the NYSE's OHT facility and any other systems approved during the 16-month period; (2) how orders entered on the other marketplaces could interact with orders in the Amex's after-hours facility; and (3) how the intermarket issues discussed in the Commission's order approving the AHT pilot would be addressed. In this connection, however, the Commission underscored its strong belief that resolution of intermarket issues would not be solely a responsibility of the Amex, but would fall equally upon all self-regulatory organizations proposing after-hours sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Commission stated that it expects the Amex, through use of its surveillance procedures, to monitor for, and report to the Commission any patterns of manipulation or trading abuses or unusual trading activity resulting from the new rule. Specifically, the Commission requested that the Amex monitor closely the trading of primes and scores and equity derivative products in the AHT facility to ensure that trading in these issues is not subject to any patterns of manipulation or trading abuses or unusual trading activity. Finally, the Commission requested that the Amex keep the Commission apprised of any technical problems which may arise regarding the operation of the pilot program, such as difficulties in order execution or order cancellation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

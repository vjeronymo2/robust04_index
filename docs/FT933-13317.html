			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Maastricht's last stand LORD Rees-Mogg's attempt to challenge the ratification of the Maastricht treaty in the High Court will be an important test of British constitutional theory and practice. His arguments raise serious questions of principle, and deserve serious consideration. It is obvious, however, that Lord Rees-Mogg's appeal is not motivated purely by solicitude for the niceties of constitutional procedure, but is rather a political stratagem mounted for the purpose of blocking the substance of the treaty. This must to some extent overshadow the merits of his arguments. Lord Rees-Mogg argues that the government's ratification process is constitutionally flawed because the bill does not cover the whole of the Maastricht treaty. In particular, it does not cover the social protocol, nor the chapter setting out the programme for a common foreign and security policy. The reason why these aspects are not in the bill is that, in line with traditional legal principles, parliamentary approval is only needed for those parts of an international treaty which require domestic legislation or domestic public expenditure. This is the centre of the argument. The British government will no doubt argue that the missing elements will not involve legislation and expenditure, Lord Rees-Mogg that it will, and it is on this antithesis that judgment will turn. But there could be a broader case for questioning whether these traditional legal distinctions, between domestic and foreign, are any longer really appropriate for the ratification of a European Community treaty. Much of what is in Maastricht is framed as plans for future action; in the case of foreign policy, it does not specify what that policy will be, because it cannot; we cannot be sure in advance, therefore, whether it will call for domestic legisla-tion or expenditure. The government opposes a referendum, on the grounds that parliament is and remains the appropriate locus for democratic decision-making. Yet this claim is hardly consistent with a ratification procedure which is explicitly designed to exclude parliament from those parts of the treaty which in theory are purely foreign or inter-governmental. It is obvious that Maastricht is a far-reaching agenda for the future direction of European integration, in which the whole is more significant than the sum of the parts. If we rely on parliament to express democratic approval of the treaty, at the very least it ought to be able to express its political approval of the whole of the treaty, even if this involves an innovation in British constitutional procedure. None of this alters the fact, however, that the most pressing need is for the treaty to be ratified with the procedures as they exist. The government is obviously in great embarrassment over the danger that it may on Thursday be voted down on the social chapter, by an unholy alliance of the Labour party and its own party's Euro-sceptics. But it should not allow this event to deflect it from its top priority, which is the completion of the parliamentary procedures required for ratification. The FT opposes the social chapter because this is not the moment to run any risk, however small, of adding recklessly to Europe's labour costs. This may well be a week, however, when the government frightens its own rebels with the prospect of a treaty which removes Britain's opt-out. The bottom line on Maastricht is that the government will be justified in using whatever tac-tics are required to complete what has been a mostly unilluminating parliamentary process. Stratagem must be matched against stratagem.</p>

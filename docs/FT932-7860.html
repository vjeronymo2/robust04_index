			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / People: Non-executives What type of Guinness are you - draught or overdraft? British Nuclear Fuels' chairman, John Guinness, 57, (right) is used to being asked the question and is rather proud of the fact that he has reasserted his ties with the overdraft side of the family by becoming a non-executive director of Guinness Mahon, the city merchant bank founded by Robert Rundell Guinness. His father and grandfather were partners in the bank and his elder brother, Sir Howard, spent a couple of years there before joining S G Warburg. However, John Guinness is not the family's sole representative in the bank, now owned by Japan's Bank of Yokohama. Tim Guinness, 45, joint managing director of Guinness Flight Asset Management, has kept the family name alive, but he's a descendant of the brewing side.</p>

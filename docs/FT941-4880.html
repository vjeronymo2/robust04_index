			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / The hazards of bringing home the harvest Distance lends enchantment to the view - at least, it does when there is a bull market and the money is flowing freely. Last year the further-flung securities markets tended to outperform handsomely. In 1994 so far, however, it has paid to stay closer to home. That is the viewpoint of the US investor, anyway. Supposedly the recent shakeout in the global securities markets has been all about a quarter-point rise in short-term US interest rates signalled on February 4 (admittedly with the hint that there is a good deal more tightening to come). The paradox is that although short-term rates have risen nowhere else (and have fallen in several European countries), the damage to the markets has generally been worse outside the US. While the US equity market has only retreated about 3 per cent - as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Index series - the UK index has fallen by twice as much, while Mexico is off 11 per cent and Hong Kong by 15 per cent. Only Tokyo has managed to show some slight appreciation. As for bond markets, the ten-year US Treasury bond yield may have shown a sharp upward move of some 56 basis points, but once again things have proved to be tougher elsewhere, with sentiment in Europe taking another turn for the worse late yesterday. Returns in the UK have risen by more like 60 basis points, and the yield on Spanish ten-year government bonds is up by a full percentage point. Interestingly, Japan has fallen in line as far as bonds are concerned, with a sharp back-up in yields (the ten-year yield is up more than 100 basis points since early January). The Latin American debt markets, so fashionable and lucrative last year, when the Brady Bond index was up 44 per cent, have taken a tumble. There are rumblings of further trouble connected with Banco Latino, the failed Venezuelan bank. All this presumably says something about the speculative positions that were built up during the 1993 bull market, as well as the relatively poor liquidity of some of the smaller national securities markets. The stop loss selling of hedge funds and investment banks has created more damage in the minor markets. The central banks this week decided that the hedge funds were not big enough to pose any systemic risks. Nevertheless, the changing global patterns should be watched closely. Volatility is clearly being exported from the US through cross-border investment. Last year the US equity market varied by less than 5 per cent either side of the mid-point, much the same pattern as in 1992. The action shifted with a vengeance to more exotic locations. When big money is moving in, the risks of investment are clearly seen to be less, and the riskiest markets show the highest returns through a process of progression towards the mean. It becomes attractive to chase the highest-yielding paper and there is a convergence of returns: curiously, the government paper of European Union member states showed narrower yield differentials after the effective collapse of the exchange rate mechanism than before. When the money moves out, however, the marginal markets tend to be sold first, as the pricing of perceived risk tends to rise - so that Spanish bonds, for instance, are hit harder. Or, you could say, the fattest profits are likely to be cashed in first. The global investment themes have not been terminated, however, but are more subdued. We have seen the exit of the hedge funds, which were front running the pension funds and mutual funds. The US pension funds will probably act as a stabilising force, seeing higher income returns as attractive. But the third big group of players, the US mutual funds, may be another matter. The boom in net receipts continued through to January, at about Dollars 30bn for bond and equity funds combined, but the February intake may have been more problematical. The danger arises from the way that mutual fund investors have been chasing short-term gains, almost as eagerly as the hedge fund managers. Already the sharp sell-off in Hong Kong and elsewhere in south east Asia will have inflicted damage and prompted profit-taking. Global investment can be exciting, but home is where the heart is.</p>

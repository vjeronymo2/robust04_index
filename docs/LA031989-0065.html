			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIRCUMCISION DEBATE  </P> <P> The March 6 article on circumcision ("Circumcision: Clear Benefits, Some Risks"  by Allan Parachini) ignores a major issue -- the cost, and cost effectiveness,  of performing a routine surgical procedure on all male newborns.  </P> <P> The current average cost of circumcision in California is probably $100 per  operation. Cost of complications aside, circumcising all male newborns each  year in California would easily be several million dollars. Is this cost  justified in order to prevent less than 1% of males getting serious urinary  tract infections?  </P> <P> This matter needs to be clearly addressed, especially because MediCal currently  classifies circumcision as a cosmetic surgery, which is not covered. However,  if the Academy of Pediatrics says that the procedure is medically justified,  then MediCal will have to pay for the surgery. Hence it is the taxpayers who  are going to have to foot much of the increased medical bill that will result  if we return to the 80%-90% circumcision rate existing in many areas of the  urban and suburban United States in the late '50s and early '60s.  </P> <P> JOHN M.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F> correspondent Shlomo Raz at the Prime Minister's Office in  Jerusalem -- live]    [Text] [Raz] Mr. Foreign Minister, are you going to Cairo  tomorrow?    [Peres] I hope so. We still have to clarify a few things.    [Raz] Where do the contacts with the PLO stand? Is there  any chance of concluding matters in the present round of talks?    [Peres] Israel has prepared a complete agreement. Now we  have to also reach agreement with the PLO.    [Raz] Will 'Arafat arrive tomorrow?    [Peres] I cannot answer for him.    [Raz] Mr. Peres, where do the major obstacles lie?    [Peres] In the complexity of the situation on the ground, in  the various scenarios, concerns, fears, and aspirations.  Whoever thinks we are negotiating over where a policeman should  stand or not is simply deluding himself. These negotiations are  about the crux of the matter, about peoples' emotions, fears,  and hopes. The fact that this is expressed in arguments about  the stationing of this or that policeman merely serves to  highlight the difficulties in bridging the existing gaps between  the Palestinian and Israeli positions.    [Raz] Mr. Peres, do you really think that the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] is throwing a monkey wrench into the works, as  one newspaper headline stated?    [Peres] No one ever heard me make such a statement or use  such a remark in the course of the past week. Many of the  things attributed to me are mere assumptions based on groundless  psychological analyses.    [Raz] Do you have any reservations with the IDF's degree of  involvement in the current stage of the process?    [Peres] I think it is important that the IDF be involved.  The negotiations definitely have their security and military  aspects and I have no complaints about the IDF's involvement.    [Raz] Thank you Mr. Peres.</p>

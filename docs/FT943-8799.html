			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Paris fine-tunes timing for Renault privatisation - International offerings As preparations for the privatisation of Renault gather momentum, share analysts and investors are running their slide rules over the French state-owned motor vehicle group. For the most part, they like what they find. 'It is an attractive company,' says Mr Eric Michelis, motor vehicles analyst at Kleinwort Benson in Paris. He predicts strong interest in shares in the only significant public sector vehicle group in the western world. Before interest can be turned into equity, however, there remain a number of important questions. Most obvious is the timing of any operation. The political sensitivity involved in the sale of Renault, a symbol of state ownership and an erstwhile union stronghold, means that the French government is approaching the planned privatisation with great caution. While officials at the economics ministry acknowledge that the preparations are now in place for a privatisation this autumn, they say that no decision has yet been taken, and point out that Assurances Generales de France, the insurance group, is also prepared for sale. A second uncertainty concerns the scale of the operation. The centre-right government has given little indication concerning how much of its 80 per cent stake it is seeking to sell, except to say that it will not reduce its holding below a 34 per cent minority blocking stake. The retention of a substantial stake by the French government is not welcomed by some potential investors. 'Ideally, it is better for the investment community if we see a total privatisation,' says one US fund manager. He says that a complete sale of the state's holding would ease concerns that the government might still seek to influence decisions at the company, concerning, for example, the protection of jobs and industrial alliances. For most investors, however, the continued presence of the French government on the shareholder register does little to dampen the attraction of Renault's privatisation. This is partly because of the fundamental strengths of the group, and also because of the present stage in the industry cycle. In terms of financial results, the company has staged a remarkable turnround since the mid-1980s, when a series of heavy losses earned it a reputation as the sick man of the European industry. It was one of the few vehicle manufacturers to remain profitable during the recession in the sector over the past few years, and is expected to report a sharp increase this year on the net profits of FFr1.1bn (Dollars 206m) achieved in 1993. As a study by Lehman Brothers argues, the emerging recovery in the market also makes a Renault sale an attractive proposition this year. This, and Renault's relative diversification - unlike Volkswagen and Peugeot, it also builds trucks - prompts Lehmans to value the company at between FFr55bn and FFr60bn, above many earlier estimates. The ultimate valuation decided by the French government, and hence the price per share attached to the company, will clearly determine the attractiveness of the investment. But the sensitivity of the sale, and the French government's interest in gaining momentum for its programme to sell 21 state-owned groups, suggest an attractive price is likely. 'With the presidential elections looming and with harder privatisations to come, this has to be a success,' says one analyst at a Paris-based merchant bank. 'They won't be taking any chances with the pricing.' As in some of the previous privatisation issues, however, the frustration for foreign investors may be the limited tranche of shares for which they may apply.</p>

"Our country regards its membership of the IMF as a logical  continuation of its policy of wider involvement in global economic  cooperation," Shevardnadze told IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus,  according to the Tass news agency. Camdessus responded positively to  Shevardnadze's proposal for talks, Tass said.  </P></p>

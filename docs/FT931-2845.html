			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Equities slip back but sterling gains: Budget wins mixed reception in parliament and markets FINANCIAL markets continued to treat the Budget warily yesterday as traders and investors struggled to digest its many complex elements. Sterling again made modest gains against the D-Mark and the dollar as currency investors were reassured by the chancellor's statement that the level of UK base rates was appropriate to current economic conditions. UK government bond prices also bounced back from the lows reached on Tuesday as markets re-assessed the impact of the Budget and shrugged off the chancellor's announcement that the public sector borrowing requirement for next year would be around Pounds 50bn. However, Mr Norman Lamont's decision to leave interest rate policy unchanged triggered a small setback for share prices. Equities were unsettled as the market tried to assess the impact of the government's planned changes to advance corporation tax. The share prices of many overseas-earning companies were particularly depressed as their income may be affected by foreign income dividend proposals. On the London stock market, the FT-SE 100 Index closed 29.4 down at 2,889.9, although trading in shares was not heavy. There had been some speculation before the Budget that Mr Lamont would announce another cut in UK base rates to help stimulate economic recovery. However, the pound's strength in recent days has also been triggered by a growing belief in financial markets that the Bundesbank will ease its important Lombard and discount rates at a council meeting today. Sterling gained 1 1/4 pfennigs in London to DM2.4150, but eased in New York to DM2.4136. Longer-dated gilts advanced as dealers expressed relief that Mr Lamont had relaxed the full-funding rule to allow purchases of gilts by banks and building societies to count towards the PSBR.

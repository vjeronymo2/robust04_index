			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lin Shaoqin (2651 1421 3830), Law Department, </F> Xiamen University: "Incentives in Foreign Investment Laws  Analyzed"]    [Text] Since China opened up to the outside world in 1979,  its effort to attract foreign investment has been so successful  that the whole world has paid attention.    The substantial flow of direct foreign investment has  injected new life into economic development in China. However,  we must see that the pattern of the sources of direct foreign  investment, which directly determines where investment goes in  the Chinese economy, is not ideal, thereby adversely affecting  Chinese economic development. This article offers a preliminary  analysis of China's foreign investment incentives from a legal  perspective.  <H3>  I. How the Pattern of Origins of Foreign Investment Affects  Distribution </H3>   The bulk of direct foreign investment in China comes from  Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Little originates in Japan and  United States and even less comes from developed nations in  Western Europe.    It should be noted that the imbalance in the origins of  direct foreign investment undermines our effort to utilize  foreign capital effectively and speed up economic development in  a way that cannot be ignored.    1) Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are related to China's  southeastern coastal provinces geographically and through  consanguinity in myriad ways, which explains why investors in  these places are so inclined to pour capital to China's  southeastern coast, particularly the two provinces of Guangdong  and Fujian, creating a striking geographical imbalance in the  distribution of foreign investment. Furthermore, since there is  a dire shortage of natural resources in China's southeastern  coastal region, the restaurant, hotel, and other service  industries naturally became the destinations of most of the  investment dollars. According to statistics, the tertiary  sector accounted for 54.96 percent of the total value of  projects involving foreign capital that were approved in the  period between 1979 and 1988. Within the tertiary sector itself,  more foreign investment went into the building of hotels and  recreational facilities and real estate than anything else,  constituting 57.57 percent of all foreign investment in the  tertiary sector. In other words, geographically foreign capital  is over-concentrated in the southeast and industrially it is  over-concentrated in nonproductive industries. It is only too  obvious that this pattern of foreign investment hampers the full  utilization of the abundant natural resources in the interior,  the optimalization of the industrial structure, and the  achievement of balanced economic development in China.    2) Most foreign investment projects are small projects. Take  1991 for instance. Projects with a price tag over $10 million  each accounted for just 2 percent of the total value of foreign  investment projects negotiated in that year; between $500,000  and $1 million, 24 percent; and under $500,000, 52 percent. The  main cause of this phenomenon is the influx of Hong Kong, Macao,  and Taiwan capital financing small projects. With so many small  projects, economies of scale do not come into play.    3) Most direct foreign investments come from Hong Kong and  the bulk of them are destined for labor-intensive projects. Of  all enterprises financed with foreign investment and approved in  the past dozen years or so, an overwhelming majority of those in  the primary and tertiary sectors were labor-intensive projects.  In the secondary sector labor-intensive projects such as those  in the light and textile industries also accounted for a  substantial portion. These labor-intensive projects were  technologically low-grade and few were at an internationally  advanced level. According to statistics compiled by the  departments concerned, only 660 projects were rated  "technologically advanced" by late 1990, a mere 4.55 percent of  all enterprises financed with foreign capital that opened for  business in the period concerned. This militates against our  drive to create an export-oriented economy and participate in  international economic competition and cooperation.  <H3>  II. How Incentives in China's Foreign Investment Laws Impact  Pattern of Origins of Such Investment </H3>   The imbalance in the pattern of origins of foreign  investment  adversely affects the distribution of foreign investment by  industry, thereby constraining the nation's economic  development. While there are many factors behind such an  imbalance, I think the law plays a major role in steering the  flow of investment. The reason is that of the numerous factors  shaping direct foreign investment, the legal factor is most  critical. Direct foreign investment has been increasing steadily  in recent years, which proves that incentives written into  China's foreign investment legislation have been enormously  effective. Yet they are precisely the reason why the pattern of  origins of direct foreign investment in China has been so  lopsided.    1) Tax incentives. Most tax incentives in China's foreign  investment laws are contained in provisions regulating corporate  income taxes. They include not only lower tax rates than those  found in other developing nations or regions, but also longer  tax abatement periods, something absent from other nations.  Nevertheless, China's tax incentives do not tie in with the  appropriate tax laws in the United States or Europe. All these  countries take a compensation and exemption approach toward the  issue of double taxation on foreign investment, which means that  it is the government of the investment-originating nation, not  the investor, which gets to enjoy foreign investment tax  incentives. Therefore even though China has reached an agreement  with some nations aimed at avoiding double taxation, China's tax  incentives have only limited appeal to investors from the United  States and Europe. In contrast, China's tax incentives,  especially its array of liberally applicable tax exemptions and  tax cuts, are tremendously appealing to capital in Macao,  Taiwan, and, particularly, the free port of Hong Kong. Moreover,  China's foreign investment legislation discriminates in favor of  investors from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. Both Article 11 of  the "State Council Regulations on Encouraging Investment by  Taiwan Compatriots" and Article 11 of the "State Council  Regulations on Encouraging Investment by Overseas Chinese and  Compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao" stipulate explicitly that  enterprises financed by compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan are not required to pay import tariffs or the combined  industrial and commercial tax on imported machinery, vehicles,  and office equipment essential to the operations and production  of their enterprises. Also exempt from import tariffs and the  combined industrial and commercial tax are the articles of daily  use and means of transportation imported for the personal  consumption of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  during the period of operations of their enterprises provided  such imports are within a reasonable quantity. With the  exception of products whose export is restricted, enterprises  are allowed to export their output without paying export tariffs  and the combined industrial and commercial tax. These incentives  are not available to enterprises financed by other foreign  investors. Not only are such practices inconsistent with  international tax rules, but they also do nothing to improve the  pattern of origins of direct foreign investment in China.    2) Non-tax incentives. China's foreign investment laws also  confer more nontax incentives on Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  investors than their counterparts from elsewhere. About the  methods of raising capital, for example, when an enterprise  financed by a Hong Kong, Macao, or Taiwan investor applies for a  loan from a financial institution on the mainland or overseas,  it can "use its own assets and rights as collateral." In  contrast, most Sino-foreign joint ventures are required to  report to the State Administration of Exchange Control or one of  its branches for the record when they want to borrow foreign  exchange funds from a foreign bank. Furthermore, things are  easier for Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan investors when it comes  to entry/departure procedures. All of this facilitates the  influx of investment from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.    3) China distinguishes among three kinds of enterprises  involving foreign investment, namely Sino-foreign joint  ventures, Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures, and  enterprises wholly owned by a foreign investor, and treats them  differently, its incentives in such areas as taxation, methods  of raising capital, and degree of market openness becoming  progressively less generous as we go down the three kinds of  enterprises. This arrangement is a magnet for Hong Kong, Macao,  and Taiwan capital because as a form of investment, the joint  venture is the right choice for most investors from those places  who are small-time investors or who want to build small or  medium-sized enterprises. In contrast, most investors from the  United States and Europe are well-heeled multinational  corporations which have a long investment history, which are  technologically advanced, and which traditionally invest heavily  overseas. For these corporations, setting up a wholly  foreign-owned enterprise in China is better suited to their  needs. The practice of favoring joint ventures helps attract  capital from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan but works against the  effort to woo investors in the United States and Europe.  <H3>  III. Measures To Improve the Pattern of Origins of Foreign  Capital </H3>   Laws adopted to encourage an inflow of Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan capital into China are well-intentioned, but objectively  the results have not been satisfactory. To improve the pattern  of origins of direct foreign investment and hence eliminate  their negative effects on the distribution of foreign  investment, it is proposed that:    1) Enterprises financed by foreign investment should be  regulated by a single set of rules. China distinguishes among  three different kinds of enterprises financed by foreign  investment and has adopted different legislation to regulate  them separately. The idea is to encourage foreign investors to  invest in China by setting up joint ventures. However, in recent  years it is foreign-funded enterprises that have been growing  the fastest. As enterprises financed by foreign investment  mature and develop, the formulation of a single law  for"enterprises financed by foreign investment" has become a top  priority in foreign investment legislation in China. Moreover,  no time should be wasted in preparing related legislation, such  as an "Insurance Law," "Anti-Illegitimate Competition Law," and  "Mortgage Law."    2) Considering the fact that Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  capital makes up an excessive share of all direct foreign  investment and that most of it goes into small projects, China's  investment incentives should bias in favor of large- and  medium-sized projects. The larger an enterprise financed by  foreign investment, the more extensive its area of related  operations, the more advanced and scientific its methods of  management, and the greater its overall social benefits. Thus,  building more large- and medium-sized enterprises financed by  foreign investment will accelerate the modernization of China's  industry and is in line with the need for China to participate  in global competition and cooperation. Accordingly, we must  offer special incentives to large- and medium-sized enterprises  financed by foreign capital, giving priority to their  applications to ensure that production needs are met. Needless  to say, to be effective, the policy of favoring large- and  medium-sized enterprises must go hand in hand with the  industrial incentive policy.    3) Open up the domestic market selectively, step by step. It  is the large markets inside developing countries that mainly  attract developed nations in Europe and the United States to  invest in them. In this repect, China, with its vast territory  and huge population has an overwhelming edge. In my opinion, we  should target large- and medium-sized projects,  technology-intensive projects, and projects in primary  industries such as agriculture, energy, and transportation as we  open up the domestic market. In view of the fact that China's  price system has not been sorted out and the practice of  underpricing certain primary products, including energy and raw  materials, we should give enterprises financed by foreign  capital more leeway in setting the prices of their products. In  industries whose development the government is trying to  promote, foreign enterprises should be allowed to charge higher  prices than official prices.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> PRIME PLANS TALK WITH SUITOR MAI  </P> <P> Prime Computer said Tuesday that it will meet with MAI Chairman Bennett S.  LeBow for the first time since MAI launched a hostile bid for Prime nearly  seven months ago.  </P> <P> Prime, a Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker, also said that, in light of a  recently revised offer by MAI, it has rescheduled its annual meeting from June  14 to July 26.  </P> <P> Analysts said the moves are likely a sign that Prime has been unable to come up  with a "white knight" bidder or another plan for escaping MAI's offer. The  postponement of the annual meeting, at which time MAI had planned a proxy fight  to try to replace Prime's board, will buy the company more time to find an  alternative to MAI's offer, analysts said.  </P> <P> Prime said its three-member executive committee will meet with LeBow. A date  was not specified.  </P> <P> MAI, a Tustin computer maker, launched a bid of $1.3 billion, or $20 per share,  for Prime in November. The takeover bid has been stalled much of the time since  by various legal challenges thrown up by Prime.  </P> <P> After Prime challenged MAI to show that it could obtain financing for the deal,  MAI lowered its bid last week to a combination of cash and securities. MAI  values the new bid at $19.50 per share, although several analysts have  estimated the value at about $17 to $18.  </P></p>

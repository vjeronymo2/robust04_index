The meeting heard that imports accounted for 1.2 billion  U.S.  dollars of this amount.    Sources at the meeting said 458 million U.S. dollars-worth  of  exports and 890 million U.S. dollars-worth of exports were  handled by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and  Export Corporation.    That made the corporation's accumulated export since its  founding ten years ago 5 billion U.S. dollars, the sources said.    Over the decade the corporation developed 45 subsidiaries in  China, and 17 companies and representative offices abroad. Its  annual business volume rose from 77 million U.S. dollars-worth  in the beginning to 1.35 billion U.S. dollars-worth in 1993.    With mines and factories all over China as well as in the  United States and Australia, and its powerful Hong Kong  subsidiaries, the corporation is quickly growing into a large  international group, the sources said.</p>

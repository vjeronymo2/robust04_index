			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Cadbury responds to CBI hostility SIR Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, has explained why he believes the Confederation of British Industry has objected to the committee's proposed enforcement code. 'They may think it will be like the Takeover Code, which began as a code and has grown into a rule book,' he said. That was certainly not the intention of his committee. Sir Adrian conceded that a code based on voluntary compliance without the support of CBI members would have little future. The CBI may seek approval from its members for an endorsement of the report at its annual meeting in November. 'I see our report as a key first step - a very important first step if we can get the backing for it,' Sir Adrian said while explaining the hazards of trying to overhaul corporate behaviour through voluntary means. The committee, formed more than a year ago at the instigation of the Financial Reporting Council, the Stock Exchange and the accountancy bodies, has recommended a voluntary code aimed at improving the performance of company boards. Some shareholders have criticised the report for not going further in giving them both access to information and a voice in corporate affairs, while some companies and directors have said it goes too far. Two principal objections have surfaced in the 209 responses to the committee's draft report, issued in May. They concern the suggestion that non-executive directors have a role in monitoring the activities of executives, and a proposal for a Stock Exchange listing requirement under which companies would have to publicise the extent to which they comply with a proposed code of best practice. The full Cadbury committee will meet later this week to consider the responses. Sir Adrian said that he had been taken aback at the public interest in the work of his group. 'When we were set up, we didn't expect to be the centre of all this attention,' he said. In explaining the public fascination with the issue of corporate governance, Sir Adrian said the present economic climate had played a role. The enduring recession had exposed managerial weaknesses in companies, which had been masked during the more prosperous late 1980s. Yet the recession was not the only cause of weakness. 'The question remains: why aren't boards better run?' Sir Adrian said. 'I think the final straw has been Europe. The corporate governance debate started in the US and moved to the UK because we are the two countries which have lost out most competitively.' Concern for the UK's competitive position, he said, had concentrated the minds of government, industry and shareholders and led to increasing focus on what goes wrong at corporate board level.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIKINGS BEAT FALCONS, LEAD DIVISION BY GAME  </P> <P> Chris Doleman doesn't think it's the least bit rude when a quarterback turns  his back on him.  </P> <P> Twice in the third quarter Sunday, the Minnesota Viking defensive end came  around the blind side of Atlanta Falcon quarterback Chris Miller, forcing  fumbles that were returned for touchdowns by Keith Millard and Tim Newton. The  Vikings beat the Falcons, 43-17, to move within one victory of their first NFC  Central title since 1980.  </P> <P> "He (Miller) turns his shoulders so much when he's looking downfield, he's  blind to the pressure," Doleman said. "Most quarterbacks have their head on a  swivel, and they can sense you. But he's just a young guy. We went into the  game knowing he is blind to his backside."  </P> <P> Doleman, who is unhappy with his $400,000 contract and is threatening to leave  Minnesota, had four sacks for 55 yards. He has 18 sacks this season and has  forced 15 fumbles in his career.  </P> <P> The Vikings, 9-5 overall and 7-0 at home, have a one-game lead over Green Bay  with two weeks to go. Chicago, five-time defending division champion, was  eliminated Sunday by Detroit.  </P> <P> Minnesota, which holds the tiebreaker advantage over the Packers, has games  left at Cleveland and at home against Cincinnati. Green Bay visits Chicago and  Dallas.  </P> <P> Atlanta, 3-11 overall and 0-8 on the road, stayed in position for the  first-overall draft choice. Although Dallas has the worst record, the Cowboys  forfeited their top pick when they selected Steve Walsh in last year's  supplemental draft.  </P> <P> The Vikings led, 20-10, at halftime, but Miller threw a 17-yard touchdown pass  to Shawn Collins on the fourth play of the third quarter to pull the Falcons  within three points.  </P> <P> D.J. Dozier, playing for the injured Herschel Walker, rushed for 54 yards and  threw a 19-yard, halfback-option scoring pass to Anthony Carter.  </P></p>

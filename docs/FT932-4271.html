			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Builders increase housing starts THE REVIVAL in the private housing market is encouraging builders to increase new housing programmes, official figures published yesterday show. With housing sales and prices steadily rising, construction activity is recovering after one of the worst periods for new house building for more than a decade. Builders are also reporting large price increases for some development land. Although figures vary between building societies, the country's largest mortgage lenders agree that house-sale activity and prices have resumed an upward trend earlier than many had originally expected. Builders have also been encouraged by a reduction in the large number of empty homes, which have inhibited revival in the housing market. The Department of the Environment said that total housing starts in the three months to the end of April reached 47,400, a 20 per cent rise from the previous three months and 6,800 more than in the same period a year earlier. In April alone, building started on 16,400 homes, compared with 14,000 in April last year. Builders also completed 14,200 homes for sale during the month, nearly 2,000 more than a year earlier. Last year private housing starts reached 121,000 - 100,000 less than the 1988 peak of 221,000. The latest figures suggest output this year will rise sharply.</p>

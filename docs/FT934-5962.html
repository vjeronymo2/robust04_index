			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (5): High flyers encounter turbulence Two companies represent Gloucestershire's high profile in the aerospace equipment sector - Dowty and Smiths Industries, writes David White. Although both remain world leaders in some technologies, as well as being principal industrial employers in the Cheltenham-Gloucester area, they have both been hit by a cruel combination of cuts in defence expenditure and depression in the airline business. Dowty, with unique status as a home-grown Gloucestershire company of international standing, succumbed last year to a Pounds 497m hostile takeover by the TI group. The old headquarters building at Arle Court, Cheltenham, has been put on the market. The company is now based with TI at Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Focusing on core aerospace businesses, TI has since September sold Dowty's fuel systems subsidiary to Lucas and its electronics interests to a new company, Ultra Electronics, in a management buy-out. This leaves Dowty Aerospace with activities in landing gear, propellers and hydraulics. The military share of sales has dropped from 60 per cent in 1985 to about 25 per cent, partly reflecting the large share of landing-gear work now done for Airbus. The three sites now employ 1,700, a reduction of 15 per cent since the takeover, and barely a fifth of the Dowty workforce in the region in the early 1980s. Cheltenham also has Smiths Industries' largest aerospace factory, employing about 2,300. Its civil side supplies avionics for Boeing and other airlines, and its military side makes displays for fighter jets, including several US aircraft. About 1,000 are engaged at Cheltenham in each of these activities, with a further 300 in a separate product support operation. Unlike most companies involved in defence, Smiths says it has not tried to lessen its dependence on the military sector, and is eager to exploit opportunities for upgrading existing combat aircraft. In the medium and longer term, the company is optimistic about both prospects in both the civil and military markets. A Pounds 5m investment in a new 60,000 sq ft repair facility, being opened today, testifies to its confident mood.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY CONCERT HALL COLUMN WINS PRAISE  </P> <P> Sam Hall Kaplan's column (Dec. 11) was an important advance article regarding  the selection process of an architect for the Walt Disney Concert Hall. His  encouragement of the Frank Gehry proposal meant a great deal to the committee  in making its final choice. I want to thank him for writing about the selection  process in such a positive way and for his early encouragement of what I hope  will be an important cultural project for Los Angeles.  </P> <P> RICHARD KOSHALEK  </P> <P> Director, The Museum of  </P> <P> Contemporary Art and  </P> <P> The Temporary Contemporary,  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

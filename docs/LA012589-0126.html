			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAST CHARGES DISMISSED IN NEWPORT DRUG CASE  </P> <P> A controversial case involving a confiscated boatload of marijuana in 1985 --  the largest drug seizure in Newport Beach history -- ended Tuesday with  dismissal of charges against the fourth and final defendant.  </P> <P> Harbor Municipal Court Judge Frances Munoz dismissed the case after the  prosecutor said he could not proceed against defendant Bruce Patrick Malley  because a witness was missing.  </P> <P> Later, outside the courtroom, Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Borris said  his office has given up trying to prosecute anyone in the case.  </P> <P> "It's a shame we were unable to prosecute, but at least $22 million in drugs  have been kept off the streets," Borris said.  </P> <P> Five tons of marijuana were seized from the Sea Dolphin, a boat that was tied  up at a Newport Beach municipal slip. Estimates of the street value of the  marijuana have ranged from $13 million to $22 million. The marijuana smuggling  cases against the three previous defendants were dismissed after a judge ruled  that police had no legal authority to search the sailboat. That ruling, later  upheld by a state appellate court, reportedly sparked a feud between the Harbor  Court judges and Newport Beach police.  </P> <P> Borris on Tuesday declined to identify or give any details about the missing  witness. "The witness was not a key witness, but part of a chain of witnesses,  and when any part of that chain is missing, we could not proceed," he said.  </P> <P> Although Borris said he objected to the dismissal of the case, he added that it  might as well end in Municipal Court at the preliminary hearing level "because  we could not have proceeded in Superior Court without this witness."  </P> <P> The affair began on Jan. 21, 1985, when a Newport Beach police officer spotted  the 45-foot Sea Dolphin tied to a city slip and resting low in the water. There  is a 20-minute time limit for the use of such slips, and the officer cited  people aboard the sailboat for staying too long. Police then made a search of  the vessel and discovered the huge cache of marijuana.  </P> <P> The three original defendants in the case were Richard W. Nelson, Victor Paul  Lucini and David Paul Choy. Their lawyers successfully argued that the  20-minute-limit sign at the slip was not clearly posted. Thus, the lawyers  said, the police never had a basis for searching the boat.  </P> <P> Harbor Municipal Judge Russell A. Bostrom was the first judge to rule that the  search of the Sea Dolphin was unconstitutional. Bostrom's ruling, later upheld  by the state Court of Appeal, reportedly triggered a feud between Newport Beach  police and the Harbor Municipal Court, several sources have told The Times  Orange County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Investigation of Judges  </P> <P> The sources also said the feud ultimately led to the investigation of some of  the Harbor Court judges, including Municipal Judge Brian R. Carter. Carter, who  has been under investigation by the state Commission on Judicial Performance,  announced earlier this month that he will resign in February.  </P> <P> The fourth defendant, Malley, 32, a commercial artist from Santa Cruz, was not  arrested with the original three from the Sea Dolphin. Police had a fugitive  warrant for him, and Malley turned himself into Harbor Municipal Court on Dec.  21, 1988.  </P> <P> Malley's attorney, Robert Weinberg, on Tuesday sharply criticized the district  attorney's office for trying to prosecute Malley. "The district attorney said  there would be new evidence, when in fact there was not," Weinberg said. "Mr.  Malley went through needless anxiety and legal expense."  </P> <P> Newport Beach Police Officer Bob Oakley, a spokesman for the department, on  Tuesday said the dismissal of the case against the final defendant "was not  exactly unexpected in view of the (earlier) decisions to disallow the  evidence." Oakley said the rulings that the boat search was made illegally had  in effect thrown out the evidence in the case.  </P></p>

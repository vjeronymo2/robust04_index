			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Weakness in sterling and gilts, higher than anticipated money supply figures together with political uncertainty in the UK combined to cast a shadow over the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, traders initially attributed the poor opening in the June contract on the FT-SE at 3,129 to a 'correction' after Friday's strong finish. Light buying in the first hour saw the contract touch 3,140 but this faded after the release of the money supply data. The figures were higher than anticipated, increasing doubts about a further reduction in UK interest rates. The decline of sterling and the retreat in bonds increased the selling pressure, as did nervousness about the outcome of tomorrow's local elections in the UK. It left June to trade at a substantial discount to cash for a large part of the session. Monument Securities and Goldman Sachs were said to have been among the day's main sellers. June closed at 3,091, down 43 on its previous close. Volume was 12,878. The June mid 250 contract finished at 3,760 after trade of 101 lots. Traded options were particularly dull with a mere 21,119 lots dealt by the close. Volume in the FT-SE 100 option was 6,818 contracts and 1,547 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. HSBC was the most active stock option with a total of 2,163 lots dealt.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Bill to endorse treaties published THE government yesterday published the short bill that will implement the Maastricht agreement on economic and political union, Philip Stephens writes. The bill makes clear that a separate decision by parliament would be required before sterling could be absorbed into a single European currency. It also signalled its determination to press ahead quickly with preparations to put in place its privatisation programme with the publication of the bill to pave the way for eventual sell-off of British Coal and British Rail. The British Coal and British Rail (Transfer Proposals) Bill empowers the two corporations to take whatever steps are necessary to prepare for privatisation. It will be followed, probably in the autumn, with separate bills providing for the implementation of plans for the sale of British Coal and for private operation of train services. A third bill tabled yesterday will implement the changes to the Uniform Business Rate announced in the Budget.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: The loneliness of the long-distance sponsor  -How ADT could have to foot the Pounds 1.7m bill for a City school DIFFICULTIES in finding other backers for a planned City Technology College mean that ADT, the Bermuda-based car auctions and security group, may spend up to Pounds 1.7m on the project. ADT, which is being sued in the US by Laidlaw, a Canadian transport services group that is its largest shareholder, is by far the largest corporate sponsor of a City Technology College. Mr Kenneth Baker, formerly education secretary, planned 20 of these high-technology secondary schools for urban areas, to be 'mostly' financed by private industry. Few corporate donors have been found, however. Most lead sponsors of the 12 CTCs due to be operating by this September are wealthy individuals or charitable organisations, rather than businesses. ADT College, based in the London borough of Wandsworth, is the only one to bear a corporate sponsor's name. Its pupils will wear uniforms with the ADT logo. The company provided the initial Pounds 1m contribution required of all lead sponsors. It has also agreed to provide Pounds 150,000 of operating funds each year for the life of the school, according to Mr Richard Painter, an ADT official who is chief executive of the school. Mr Painter said that, in addition, ADT has agreed to underwrite the remaining Pounds 700,000 cash needed to bring private sponsorship up to the Pounds 2.2m, or 20 per cent, of capital costs required by the Department of Education and Science. The department allows up to Pounds 500,000 of contributions in kind to be counted towards the Pounds 2.2m figure. So far, donors have provided Pounds 250,000 in contributions of equipment. If ADT cannot persuade other companies to make cash donations, it will end up investing Pounds 1.7m in the project's start-up costs. Mr Painter said education department officials warned ADT in January that government funds to complete construction would not be forthcoming unless the company guaranteed the remaining private-sector contributions. Such guarantees have been required of all lead sponsors for the past year. All except ADT, however, have been able to raise enough cash from other sponsors to avoid the need to call on the guarantee. By last week, ADT had been unable to raise any cash contributions from other sponsors. ADT College is based on a three-building site formerly occupied by a comprehensive school. It will admit its first 300 pupils this autumn. Enrolment will gradually rise to 1,200. The school is to be furnished with the latest computer technology, and language laboratories. Applications for the first year have outstripped places by five to one. Mr Painter says ADT is sponsoring the college because 'We think there is a need to support education'. He says the company was approached by Sir Cyril Taylor, chairman of the charitable CTC Trust and the government's chief adviser on CTCs. Mr Painter says that ADT College apart, the company's only educational programme has been a Pounds 60,000 donation to the Grant Maintained Schools Trust, a body that encourages schools to opt out of local authority control. Mr Michael Ashcroft, ADT's chairman, is chairman of the trust which runs the school. Mr Ashcroft lives in Florida. Mr Painter said that when the school's board held one of its obligatory meetings last December, the venue was somewhere in Europe.</p>

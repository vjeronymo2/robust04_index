			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREEDOM IS OBTAINABLE, BUT THE PRICE IS HIGH  </P> <P> Defending the right of immigrants to settle in the San Gabriel Valley, Barkley  Lee wrote in a letter to the editor (Times, June 22): "Wouldn't most people in  the world want to live in a free country?" saying we should "embrace everyone  into the American mainstream."  </P> <P> Lee is wrong for assuming that freedom can only be found in America. Democracy  is not a rare plant that can only grow in the U.S.A.; it could grow in China,  but freedom is not free. It is a tree whose roots must be nurtured by the blood  of patriots.  </P> <P> Americans died during our War of Independence with England, but other patriots  didn't give up, and we won our independence.  </P> <P> Why do Chinese patriots give up so easily?  </P> <P> England faced certain defeat by the Nazis in the Battle of Britain, but,  refusing to give up, Winston Churchill spoke for all patriots, no matter what  their country, when he said that even if the Nazis won, "We will fight in the  streets. We will fight in the hills; we shall never give up."  </P> <P> England lost some battles, but won the war.  </P> <P> Chinese patriots should follow his advice. If they want democracy, they should  stay in China and fight for it.  </P> <P> Nothing, not even tanks and machine guns, are as effective in war as an idea  whose time has come. If it is time for democracy in China -- I think it is --  then now's the time for the Chinese people to take it -- if that is what they  really want.  </P> <P> FRANK J. ARCURI  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

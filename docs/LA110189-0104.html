			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRUSTEES' PANEL ENDORSES 5% FEE HIKE AT CAL  STATE  </P> <P> The cost of an education at California State University would increase about 5%  next year under a proposal approved Tuesday by a trustee's committee.  </P> <P> Fees for the academic year would be $744, or $36 more, for a full-time student  and $426, or $18 more, for a part-time student at the 20 campuses in the Cal  State System, if the plan, approved by committee members meeting in Long Beach,  survives review by the Legislature and governor. Those figures do not include  costs for room, board, parking or books.  </P> <P> The fee increase was part of a $1.89 billion 1990-'91 operating budget request  from the finance committee of the Cal State Board of Trustees. That budget,  which would be 15.2% higher than this year's, is expected to win approval from  the full board today . In addition, the trustees will ask the state government  for $214 million for building projects and at least $38 million more for pay  increases.  </P> <P> The 360,000 students in the Cal State System saw their fees increase 3.6% this  year. An unexpected surplus in the state budget led to a rollback from what was  supposed to be a much-protested 10% jump this fall.  </P></p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bonds Markets: New York Renewed declines in the dollar sent US bond prices reeling on Friday. In spite of yields that just a few weeks seemed attractive, few investors were willing to take the plunge into the market with the dollar in such a precarious condition, and traders were busy selling in anticipation of further falls in bond prices this week. By the end of the day the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond had reached 7.52 per cent, its highest since mid-May. The direction of bond prices in the days to come will again be linked to the dollar, and with currency traders predicting that further central bank intervention will be insufficient to relieve the pressure on the US currency, the portents do not look good. If investors do manage to tear their eyes away from the dollar, they will find plenty of statistics on the state of the US economy. Perhaps the most closely-watched gauge will be the National Association of Purchasing Management's business index for June, due out on Friday, which will give an assessment of manufacturing conditions in the economy. Bond market bulls, however, may find little comfort in the figures, which are likely to show that demand and inflation gauges remain disturbingly high. Salomon Brothers predicts that the overall index will be up 0.3 points to 58, a four-year high.</p>

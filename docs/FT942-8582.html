			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains reversed after latest earnings data - Market report The joy with which the London stock market yesterday greeted the decisive action overnight by the US Federal Reserve proved shortlived. Early gains soon melted away when the latest data on UK average earnings undermined any lingering hopes for a base rate cut and US markets opened the new session on the downside. The FT-SE 100 Index jumped to 3,157.5 as soon as trading opened, but it was soon clear that investors were not prepared to buy shares at these levels. The news that average earnings in the UK had risen by 4 per cent in March hit the market early, and although British government bonds remained very firm, shares gave further ground as base rate hopes were well-nigh extinguished. By the close the FT-SE 100 was a net 7 points off at 3,116.5, virtually the day's low. Gloom deepened at the close when the Dow Industrial Average was showing a fall of 14 points and US Federal bonds were struggling to hold early gains. The very modest buying support at the opening was replaced in the second half of the session by some determined selling. Seaq volume of 722.4m shares compared with only 638.5m in the previous session. Tuesday's equity business was worth Pounds 1.25bn at retail level, maintaining the healthy turnover levels of recent sessions. In technical terms, it was a disappointing day. Dealers noted that there was heavy selling of stock index futures when the Footsie index reached the 3,150 area, which is seen as the top end of the current trading range. The past few trading sessions have seen selling of put options on the FT-SE 100 Index, and yesterday's performance appeared to be a further indication that investors remain cautious on UK equities. London was caught between the move to higher rates in the US and to lower rates in Europe. German money market repo rates were trimmed again and hopes rose of a cut in rates in France today. But the increase in domestic earnings levels, which is known to be one of the Bank of England's chief concerns, provided a sharp reminder for the market that the next move in domestic interest rates will probably be upwards. Nervousness over the interest rate outlook was heightened by publication of details of the routine meeting between the Governor of the Bank of England and the UK chancellor of the exchequer at the end of March. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less affected by stock index futures considerations, held on to part of its early gains to finish a net 4.5 higher at 3,711.7. Analysts said that the near-term outlook for equities will depend on how the bond markets settle down now that the Federal Reserve has suggested that it has achieved its preferred stance on US monetary policy. Stable yields on UK bonds are seen as the necessary underpinning for any sustained advance by equities beyond the Footsie 3,100 mark. Traders were prepared to see yesterday as a day of technical manoeuvring following the widely expected move by the Fed. Some profit-taking was inevitable and it may take the market several sessions to stabilise itself. While corporate statements played a less prominent role, there was strength in the generating sector, where a higher dividend from National Power emphasised the safe yield attractions of the utility sectors.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / German far right gains in polls: Republicans benefit from protest votes in Hesse local elections GERMANY'S extreme rightwing Republicans stole votes from mainstream parties to make sweeping gains in local and city elections in the state of Hesse yesterday. The results stunned the Social Democrats (SPD) and gave an unexpected lift to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), especially in large cities. Against all expectations, the SPD share of the vote tumbled by 8.4 percentage points, while the CDU lost 2.3 percentage points, according to provisional results. The CDU displaced the SPD as the largest single party in the Frankfurt and Kassel city councils, exit polls showed. In Frankfurt, the largest and richest city in the state, the Republicans, led by Mr Franz Schonhuber, a former SS officer, took 9.5 per cent of the vote. In one depressed part of the inner city, they gained 14 per cent. The CDU, which won 33 per cent against the SPD's 31 per cent share, ruled out any coalition with the Republicans. The likely outcome appeared to be a governing coalition comprising SPD, CDU and the Greens, the environmental party. Fewer than 70 per cent of voters went to the polls, compared with 77 per cent in the last election in 1989. Statewide, the Republicans were calculated to have won 8.3 per cent, against less than 1 per cent for far-right parties last time. However heartening for the embattled Mr Kohl, the result - in one of the richest German states - will fuel domestic and international fears about the rise to respectability of Germany's extreme right wing. The result is likely to concentrate efforts by the government and opposition in Bonn to fill the political vacuum at the centre before next year's state, European and federal parliamentary elections. The ruling coalition and opposition are divided on a range of issues, including a solidarity pact to pay for German unification and the flood of asylum seekers. Voters are also growing anxious about unemployment and the economy's slide into recession. While the Republicans gained support for their policies of containing immigration and deporting 'criminal foreigners', other smaller parties also benefited from protest votes. The Greens, who are not represented in the federal parliament, increased their support in Frankfurt from about 10 per cent to 14 per cent. The liberal Free Democrats failed to take enough votes to gain representation on the city council, but they improved their standing statewide with an estimated 6 per cent of the vote.</p>

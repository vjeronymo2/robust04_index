			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Trade News: US steel faces Mexican duties MEXICO yesterday imposed final duties of 2 to 81 per cent on three types of US steel that were allegedly being dumped in Mexico below cost. The move follows recent duties of up to 1,000 per cent on Chinese goods allegedly sold below cost, and reflects a new willingness by Mexico to use its trade laws to keep out subsidised exports. The government will impose duties of 4 per cent to 40 per cent for rolled steel plate, 18 per cent to 38 per cent for hot-rolled steel sheet, and 2 per cent to 13 per cent for cold-rolled steel sheet. The announcement follows an official investigation,concluded in February. Mr Pedro Noyola, the under-minister for foreign commerce, said the decision to impose duties was not connected with similar duties brought against Mexican steel by the US - which have still be made final. Mr Noyola said provisional duties from 5 to 81 per cent would be applied to galvanised sheet, but no final decision had been made in this case. He hinted that more dumping cases might be brought. 'In as much as other complaints justify the presumption of dumping practices (and) harm to national production. . . . the trade ministry may open new cases against other foreign exporters,' he said.</p>

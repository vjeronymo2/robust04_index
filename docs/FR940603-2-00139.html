			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Oil Transporter's Certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first certification requirement for which CWTI/NTTC seek a finding of preemption is Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 26.10.01.16.D. This regulation, issued pursuant to general statutory authority in Environment Article &sect;4&hyph;405, Annotated Code Maryland, prescribes that ``[a] vehicle used in the transport or transfer of oil shall be operated by a driver possessing a valid Oil Vehicle Operator's Certificate'' issued by MDE. Read in conjunction with COMAR 26.10.01.17.A, the requirement applies only to operators of oil cargo tank vehicles. Further, it applies only to vehicles into which oil is loaded, or from which it is unloaded, in Maryland; it does not apply to operators of vehicles that simply pass through the State. COMAR 26.10.01.17.B. The certificate is issued ``after the driver has completed an examination and has obtained a passing grade indicating his knowledge of the procedures employed for the safe handling of oil, oil spill control measures and oil spill reporting requirements.'' COMAR 26.10.01.17.A(2). The operator must carry the certificate whenever engaged in the transfer or transport of oil. COMAR 26.10.01.17.A(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An operator must preregister for the examination, which is given at five in-state locations and at out-of-state business locations as approved by MDE. There is no fee for the examination or the certificate. The certificate is valid for five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Controlled Hazardous Substance Transporter's Certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second certification requirement for which a finding of preemption is sought is COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(1). This provision, enacted pursuant to Environment Article &sect;7&hyph;252(b), Annotated Code of Maryland, states:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A person may not transport any CHS [controlled hazardous substance] from any source in the State or to any CHS facility in the State unless a driver certificate has been issued for the vehicle driver. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A ``controlled hazardous substance'' (CHS) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Any hazardous substance that [MDE] identifies as a controlled hazardous substance under th[e] subtitle; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Low-level nuclear waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Env't Article &sect;7&hyph;201(b), Ann.

Env't Article &sect;7&hyph;201(m)(2). Although the definition of CHS is broader, CWTI/NTTC states, and MDE does not contest, that Maryland applies the certification requirement only to transporters of RCRA hazardous waste. See also COMAR 26.13.04.01.A(1) (``These regulations establish standards which apply to persons transporting hazardous waste within the State.'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The certificate is issued on evidence of ``satisfactory completion of an approved training program,'' COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(3)(c), which must cover: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Training in the requirements necessary to transport hazardous waste. Emphasis should be placed on the ability to verify proper DOT shipping names, hazard class and EPA waste codes. Special attention should be directed to the Maryland Hazardous Waste Manifest, other state manifest requirements, and the proper disbursement of manifest copies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Training in the required labeling and marking of all containers of 110 gallons or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Training in Placarding.

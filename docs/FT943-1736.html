			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Sydney moves further into futures - Derivatives / The Australian exchange has far-reaching ideas On Monday, investors will not just be able buy and sell shares in Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's biggest resources groups  - they will also be able to trade futures contracts covering the same underlying stock. As with all futures contracts, this will mean that exposure to the shares can be 'leveraged' so that a relatively small movement in Western's share price is magnified into a much larger movement in the stock future. Moreover, complex trading strategies will become possible - at least in theory. For example, WMC, which is still a fairly good proxy for the gold price, could be bet against the Australian stock market. The WMC futures contract is one of four new contracts being offered by the Sydney Futures Exchange from September 26. The other companies involved are MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals company; BTR Nylex, the diversified conglomerate controlled by Britain's BTR group; and Westpac, one of the big four Australian banks. These contracts will augment the three existing individual share futures contracts - covering Broken Hill Proprietary, National Australia Bank and News Corporation - which started to trade in May. Another three contracts are due to be unveiled before the end of the year. But the SFE's ambitions do not stop there. The 10 contracts introduced in 1994 all require settlement in cash, not scrip. In other words, investors are not required to deliver the underlying physical stock. The SFE has made clear that it would like to introduce 'deliverable' share futures contracts as well, and is talking to the Australian Securities Commission about this. The regulator would need to give permission before such a product could be launched. Secondly, while Mr Les Hosking, chief executive of the SFE, sees the number of Australian share futures contracts being pegged at 10 for the foreseeable future, he holds out the prospect of introducing SFE-traded contracts for companies whose physical stocks change hands on overseas exchanges. 'Imagine an IBM or General Motors contract,' he says. 'Imagine' may be the key word. All this is highly ambitious and totally uncharted territory. Sydney is the only market in the world where futures contracts are available on individual shares in any meaningful fashion. In the US, such contracts are specifically prohibited, in part because of price manipulation concerns. Even in Sydney, the SFE's go-go approach has run into some stumbling blocks. For a start, in spite of the publicity surrounding these new derivative instruments, trading volumes have not been large. During the first three months, the BHP/NAB/News share futures traded 14,046 contracts. 'I'm patient about these things - development is very dependent on the cash market,' says Mr Hosking, pointing out that the stock market itself has been sluggish in recent months. Nevertheless, even the SFE concedes that many institutional investors are reluctant to get involved with the new contracts until liquidity has developed. The SFE's second problem is a continuing turf battle with the Australian Stock Exchange over who should run this type of derivatives market. No sooner had the SFE got permission for its three initial contracts than the ASX's derivatives department countered with a new type of options contract called the 'Low Exercise Price Option' (or LEPO), and was simply a very deep 'in-the-money' call option, whose exercise price could be as little as one cent. LEPOs were designed to trade in line with the physical stock, but - thanks to the options market's margin system - the full price would only be payable on expiry. The ASX's LEPOs covered five stocks - including the three targeted by the SFE. Since then, the ASX has come out with a more sophisticated rival offering: share ratios. These, it claims, are an entirely new equity-based derivative, which allow investors to gain exposure to a share based on how it performs relative to the stock market, not on whether it goes up and down in price. However, by giving investors a chance to punt on whether BHP, say, betters the stock market generally, the share ratio contract will compete directly with one of the main uses for share futures contract. The problem for the ASX, however, is Australia's Corporations Law. This currently imposes a fairly rigid divide between 'futures' and 'securities', making these products the concerns of the SFE and ASX respectively. Earlier this month, the attorney-general proffered a helping hand when he proposed some amendments which, if passed into law, would permit share ratios to start trading. His office, while emphasising that this is a decision in respect of one product only, suggests that the legislative adjustments could be made by the end of this year. But this has not stopped the SFE from fighting a fierce rearguard action. It has already taken court action over the proposed LEPOs, for example. Any decision would probably be open to appeal, so this product is unlikely to be available before the end of this year. While jockeying between the exchanges continues, some of the companies whose stock is involved in these new contracts are less than enthralled. When the first trio of contracts got under way, BHP pointed out that promotion of futures contracts on its shares tended to cut across its own investors relations department's efforts to promote the underlying physical stock. For the exchanges there is the additional concern that they are playing in an international marketplace and that if their products are held back, other overseas exchanges will throw caution to the wind and take the initiative.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ernesto Zedillo, presidential </F> candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, in Jalapa,  Veracruz, by reporter Javier Alatorre at Azteca Network's Mexico  City studios; from the "Early Morning" newscast -- live]    [Text] [Alatorre] Mr. Zedillo, a few minutes ago we read  details of this antipoverty plan. We can see that it is a very  ambitious plan. How will the plan be financed? Where will the  money come from?    [Zedillo] Javier, the plan will be financed with money that  we hope the process of economic growth will begin to provide in  1995. It will also be financed by better distributing the money  within the federal government. We are going to do what has been  done in the past few years; we are going to reallocate  nonpriority expenditures to those areas of a social nature, such  as those contemplated in this plan. We are also going to  finance the plan by asking the civilian population, those  organizations interested in working to solve this problem, to  contribute as well. It is a good plan, a plan that can be  financed. The plan will be expanded as we receive more money,  without creating inflation, to support the plan.    [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, do you plan to get money through the  sale of state enterprises that have not been privatized yet?    [Zedillo] The money received from privatizing state  enterprises will basically be allocated to the fund for the  promotion of the infrastructure, which we announced last week as  a suggestion. These would be huge works aimed at unleashing the  country's economic growth. For the antipoverty plan, we will  use the fiscal resources that will grow with time and the money  that we receive through better public administration, as well as  through contributions from the people.    [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, we understand that with this plan to  fight poverty, you will try to help 14 million people who live  in poverty. I rounded up the figure when I said 14 million; if  I am not mistaken the number is actually 13.6 million, according  to the information you provided. Will this represent some  changes in the economic policy the current administration has  followed? Will there be new changes? In other words, what will  you retain from this current administration, and what will you  change?    [Zedillo] Javier, that is a very broad question. Last week,  I presented my economic plan. At that time, I said it is very  important that we maintain overall economic discipline and good  public finances, but that we have to move to a phase of economic  promotion. We must promote investment to create the new jobs  that our country badly needs. I have presented an antipoverty  plan. This is a more ambitious plan. This antipoverty plan is  possible precisely because we have that material base. This  will allow us to help many people and implement much more  specific measures to attack poverty.    I believe this policy, the economic as well as the social  policy I am promoting, is the result of the fact that for the  past few years very solid bases have been built. It would have  been impossible for us to set such ambitious goals six years  ago; however, today we can do it responsibly.    [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, what happened in Chiapas State is  perhaps an example of the poverty that exists in some areas of  our country. Will the plan be a response to this very old  problem?    [Zedillo] Definitely, Javier. Poverty is expressed in  specific ways. Poor health, lack of food for children and  mothers, lack of education, lack of the essential services such  as drinking water, electricity, and sewers, and lack of job  opportunities. Had the country been capable of developing a  plan such as this one many years ago, I doubt if today we would  be regretting those tragic situations that concern us.    [Alatorre] Is violence a justifiable response to extreme  poverty?    [Zedillo] Definitely not. I said this earlier this morning,  and I have said it on several occasions. We understand the  problem, and we must solve it; however, nothing is an excuse for  violence or unrest. Mexico is a country that has laws and  institutions, a country with a Constitution we must all respect.    [Alatorre] Dr. Zedillo, we know that you have had a very  active day. We learned about your program to fight poverty in  Ecatepec, and we know you are going to be in Veracruz tonight.  You have a tight schedule for tomorrow as well. Before bidding  you farewell, I would like to ask you about the incidents at the  National Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM] this morning,  the attacks against the candidate of the National Action Party  [PAN]. What is your opinion?    [Zedillo] It is very regrettable. I do not have the details,  but I believe it should be condemned. This is something that  should not be done, but I also believe we cannot make a poor  overall judgment of our national university because of the  actions taken by an irresponsible, aggressive minority. I was  at the UNAM a few weeks ago during a very interesting,  participatory, and respectful meeting with a considerable number  of students. But when I was leaving the university, I was the  object of an act of aggression. It was an act of aggression,  which by the way, was organized by a party that is participating  in these presidential elections. I would expect these  regrettable incidents not to be linked to that party as well,  otherwise it would represent an intolerable situation that would  not promote civilized political life in the country, which all  Mexicans want. I, therefore, condemn this incident. I convey  my solidarity with the PAN candidate, and I also reaffirm that  this in no way reflects the true feelings of the UNAM. The UNAM  is the most important university in the country. Mexico owes a  great deal to the UNAM, and these incidents of violence in no  way discredits our highest education center.    [Alatorre] We thank you for this interview. You are now in  Jalapa, Veracruz. We invite you to accompany us here at the  studios of Television Azteca in Mexico City.    [Zedillo] Thank you, Javier, and I will be in your studios  soon. It will be my pleasure.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'MAJOR LEAGUE' IN A LEAGUE BY ITSELF  </P> <P> "Major League" (citywide), an amiable and amusing hot weather diversion, trusts  mightily that the Cleveland Indians and their fans are blessed with a good  sense of humor.  </P> <P> Taking note of the fact that the Indians haven't won a pennant since 1954,  writer-director David Ward imagines that the team has been inherited by a  hard-hearted ex-Vegas show girl (Margaret Whitton). Her notion is to hire such  a bunch of losers that attendance will plummet and she'll be able to move the  franchise to Miami, a city with a climate much more to her liking. (There will  also be a Palm Beach mansion for her as part of the deal).  </P> <P> You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to deduce that the recruits won't turn out  to be the deadbeats Whitton expects them to be. Ward, who won an Oscar for his  script for "The Sting" and more recently adapted "The Milagro Beanfield War,"  deflects predictability with admirable deftness. He does this with generous  doses of humor and affection, a clear love and extensive knowledge of baseball  and the Indians -- who he says he's rooted for since he was 5 years old -- and  a starry cast that gets into the good ol' boy spirit of the story.  </P> <P> Tom Berenger's Jake Taylor is a playboy now in his 30s with such bad knees he  hopes for just "one more season in the sun." Charlie Sheen's Rickie Vaughn is a  punker, just finishing doing time for car theft, a kid with a fast ball but no  control. Corbin Bernsen's Roger Dorn is a talented third baseman whose mind is  more on money than baseball; he's more interested in preserving his profile for  TV commercials than with exerting himself. Burly, seen-it-all manager Lou Brown  (James Gammon, always a pleasure), recruited reluctantly from his tire business  -- and unaware of his employer's true intentions -- has his work cut out for  him in shaping up a team that also includes Wesley Snipes as a rookie with the  wonderful name of Willie Mays Hayes and Dennis Haysbert as a voodoo-practicing  Cuban emigre. Bob Uecker, a canny, witty standout, is the Indians' jaded but  game radio announcer, and elegant newcomer Rene Russo is the beauty that Jake  let get away and is determined to win back.  </P> <P> Ward directs his actors as adroitly as he has written for them, and the  vulnerability that he allows his three stars to reveal is really what makes the  movie work. No one, not even baseball fans, should go to "Major League" hoping  for "Bull Durham's" sex, raunch and sophistication. But "Major League" (R-rated  for language) has its own ingratiating charm.

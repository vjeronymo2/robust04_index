			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCIENCE;  </P> <P> MARS' ATMOSPHERE ONCE THICKER  </P> <P> New calculations show Mars may have been stripped of a thick atmosphere that  allowed water to flow over the now-desolate planet because it was bombarded by  comets or asteroids, scientists reported today.  </P> <P> Mars, the planet that is fourth closest to the sun, currently has a very thin  atmosphere with a surface pressure less than one-hundredth of Earth's. But  geological forms on the red planet suggest it once had atmospheric pressure  great enough for water to run over its surface.  </P> <P> H. J. Melosh and A. M. Vickery of the University of Arizona, in a study  published in the British journal Nature, presented computer calculations they  said showed that collisions with large, fast-moving bodies, such as comets, may  have triggered Mars's atmospheric loss.  </P></p>

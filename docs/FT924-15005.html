			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Tax body warns of poor legislation: Budget Submission THE TIME between the Budget and the legislation arising from it should be extended to curb poorly drafted legislation, the Institute of Taxation has warned. The institute, which represents tax professionals, said in its annual representation on the Budget to the Inland Revenue that there had been a decline in the quality of legislation in the past few years. It said government proposals on reform of the Budget would reduce the period during which tax legislation is open for discussion from 90 days to 70 days and would increase the risk of poor legislation. The institute said the finance bill should be published in January, but with its second and third readings as at present in order to extend the consultation period. It also backed the idea of a technical financial bill outside the normal Budget timetable. Mr Ian Luder, chairman of the institute's technical committee said: 'This is a golden opportunity to improve the quality of legislation,' He said some recent attempts to introduce legislation had been 'farcical'. The institute also criticised the growing use of extra-statutory concessions and statements of practice as a substitute for legislation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban March 31 SAPA -- Natal security forces,  including the kwaZulu Police [KZP], are due to hold a meeting in  Durban on Friday [1 April] to discuss policing in the province  under the state of emergency announced by State President F.W.  de Klerk on Thursday.    According to KZP Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During, the  emergency regulations would be known on Friday and they would be  discussed in a meeting between himself and leaders of the SA  Police and SA Defence Force. "We have to discuss the precise  nature of the regulations. It's obviously of necessity and our  policing methods will have to be adapted because it becomes law  and you have to abide by that," Gen During said.    The KZP worked in "close conjunction" with other security  forces and Friday's meeting would definitely arrive at joint  policing strategies for certain areas, he said.    The emergency would probably allow greater movement to  security forces and give them greater access to violence  flash-points, he added. "It may have the effect of stabilising  the situation, and we sincerely hope that it will have that  effect."    Gen During said he did not expect Inkatha leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi, as kwaZulu minister of police, to defy the emergency  because it was the law and Mr Buthelezi was a "Christian and  law-abiding citizen".</p>

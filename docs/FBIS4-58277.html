			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russian Sources Tell AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT: Syrian-Russian Military Agreement Serves Peace"]    [Excerpts] Damascus, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Russian sources  in Damascus told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that the return of  military cooperation between Syria and Russia will serve the  issue of peace and stability in the Middle East and help to  implement the UN and Security Council resolutions in order to  achieve peace.    The Syrian and Russian sides signed a military cooperation  agreement on the evening of the day before yesterday which  political circles described as the first of its kind in this  sphere since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the  establishment of the Russian Federation. [passage omitted]    Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Kolov [name as  transliterated] stressed the day before yesterday that, while he  understands the Israelis' concern over selling weapons to Syria,  he confirms that the Syrians too are concerned over the sale of  modern Western weapons to Israel. He added that, "if arms sale  deals are not concluded with Syria, other states are bound to  make offers. It is out of the question that the Russians are  going to offer anything except the sale of defensive weapons and  spare parts for weapons sold to Syria under previous deals."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 7 Apr--Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski  said in the Sejm today that Poland might get the status of a  European Union [EU] member in about 2000. According to him, the  road to the EU will be long, difficult, and uncertain.    The minister presented the reasons behind Poland's decision  to strive for EU membership. He said that he will hand an  application for membership to the Greek foreign minister in  Athens tomorrow.    The minister said a sounding among 12 EU members indicates  favorable reception of Poland's application. He added that over  70 percent of Poles favor Poland's membership in the EU.    According to the Polish Government, Poland meets the EU  conditions for membership application. These conditions are:  the existence of stable democratic institutions, the observance  of human rights, the rule of law and order, legislation being  adapted to EU standards, and a market economy.</p>

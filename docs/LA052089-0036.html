			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WHOLE WORLD WATCHED  </P> <P> "The Chinese people have stood up," proclaimed Mao Tse-tung in Beijing's Tian  An Men Square 40 years ago as he celebrated the triumph of the Communist  revolution. This week, in that same place as well as in other cities around  China, the people stood up once more. They did so in widely supported  student-led protests that defied authority, challenged the political legitimacy  of the nation's rulers and demanded guarantees of free speech and an end to  official corruption. A divided and clearly disturbed leadership responded first  by sternly ordering the demonstrators in Beijing to disband, then by pleading  with them to do so, finally by sending in troops, ostensibly to protect  government and party offices. The threat to those camped in the square was  implicit, but the protesters remained uncowed.  </P> <P> In a midnight speech announcing the regime's decision to take a hard line,  Premier Li Peng referred repeatedly to "rioting" taking place in Beijing and  elsewhere, warned that the entire country was threatened by anarchy and  instability and denounced what he said was a small band of "agitators" who are  intent on misleading and manipulating large masses of people. In fact, the  protests were broadly based and, from all appearances, determinedly peaceful,  thanks to the self-control that held in check the anger and frustration that  sent so many into the streets.  </P> <P> At the core of the demonstrations was the hunger strike by as many as 3,000  young people, and the undisguised fear on the part of top leaders that any  deaths among these protesters would be a moral and political calamity for the  regime. Thanks in part to the expanded presence of the international news media  in Beijing, drawn there originally to cover the visit by Soviet leader Mikhail  S. Gorbachev, the world was an eyewitness to the regime's growing  embarrassment. The protesters, a large number of whom spoke fluent English, did  not hesitate to press their demands in front of the television cameras.  Foremost among them was a demand for guaranteed freedom of speech, the freedom  that authoritarian regimes most fear to grant.  </P> <P> In the hours immediately following Li Peng's speech, the issue remained in  doubt. What is already clear, however, is that the regime has been shaken to  its foundations by the protests that began more than a month ago as part of the  mourning for the late former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang and built to the  climax of recent days. Not since Mao proclaimed the People's Republic in 1949  has China seen such open expressions of popular discontent. It has been an  astonishing episode, perhaps a watershed, in China's history, and this week the  whole world has been watching.  </P></p>

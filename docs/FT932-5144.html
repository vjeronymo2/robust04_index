			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Major to use veto on Euro work councils THE UK will use its veto to block the introduction of mandatory works councils in large trans-European companies, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday. Mr Major warned that if the controversial draft directive requiring such companies to set up elected works councils were revived, Britain would prevent any unanimous agreement needed for approval. Britain insisted last week that the plan be taken off the agenda for the meeting of labour and social affairs ministers. It now hopes the threat of a veto will head off any plans to press ahead with the move during the Belgian presidency which begins next month. Speaking at the Conservative women's national conference, Mr Major was unequivocal in his message to the other 11 EC countries. 'Let me spare them some trouble, let me tell them now: they are wasting their time. We have a veto on this issue, and I intend that we will use it,' he said. While Britain can block the directive under existing EC procedures, once Maastricht has been ratified and the social protocol comes into effect, the other 11 countries can introduce it. Even though the UK has 'opted out' of the social chapter, British companies could still be affected by the plans, since many have operations in continental Europe large enough to require them to introduce the new procedures for their operations outside Britain. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, used his speech at the same conference to highlight the UK's concern that the EC was making itself uncompetitive. He also underlined Britain's continued opposition to the working time directive passed by the social affairs council. He told the conference that he was taking over responsibility for women's issues within the government, but sounded slightly defensive when he emphasised he would work closely with his predecessor, Mrs Gillian Shephard. Last month's reshuffle left Mr Major with the dilemma of putting Mr Hunt in charge of women's issues or leaving those responsibilities to Miss Ann Widdecombe, a junior employment minister.</p>

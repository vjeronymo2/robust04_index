			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / International Company News: Salomon proves resilient as earnings achieve record SALOMON, the Wall Street securities house, yesterday reported second-quarter after-tax operating earnings of Dollars 375m, the best three-month performance in the group's history and the clearest sign yet that it has recovered from last year's bond trading scandal. However, the burden of a special Dollars 185m charge to cover costs related to the settlement of the bond market-rigging allegations reduced net income to Dollars 211m. Even with the charge, net income was still higher than a year ago, when Salomon reported a profit of Dollars 178m, thanks partly to the return to profitability of Phibro Energy, the group's oil trading and refining subsidiary. The second-quarter charge, taken alongside the Dollars 200m charge the company took in the third quarter of 1991, means Salomon has set aside a total of Dollars 385m to cover the costs related to the scandal. A large part of that reserve has gone towards paying the Dollars 290m in fines and compensation levied on Salomon as settlement of allegations that the firm broke Treasury rules during bond auctions in 1990 and 1991. The remainder will help pay for the penalties and legal costs of the lawsuits filed against the company in the wake of the scandal. Under the new leadership of chairman Mr Deryck Maughan, the securities subsidiary, Salomon Brothers, provided the bulk of Salomon's profits during the second quarter. Such was the strength of the firm's underlying performance, that if the charge and taxes were excluded, Salomon Brothers' earnings totalled Dollars 647m in the three months, the highest recorded by a publicly held US securities firm. Against the background of a highly favourable interest rate environment, strong sales and trading activity in Salomon Brothers' core bond business made the biggest contribution in the quarter. Even investment banking, hardest hit by the uncertainties surrounding the bond trading scandal, staged a recovery, with revenues exceeding the preceding two quarters due to the heavy flow of corporate bond issues. On the oil trading and refining side of Salomon, Phibro recorded pre-tax earnings of Dollars 19m in the quarter, a turnround from the losses of the previous six months. Most of its revenues came from its crude oil trading and derivatives department.</p>

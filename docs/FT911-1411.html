			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Wall Street): A quixotic attempt to lead by example THE good news this week was an unexpected cut in US interest rates. The not-so-good news was the economic background which prompted the move. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve took Wall Street by surprise and cut the discount rate - the rate charged when banks borrow reserves directly from the central bank - by half a percentage point, to 5.5 per cent. That cleared the way for it to engineer a quarter point drop in the key short-term Fed Funds rate, to 5.75 per cent, and for the commercial banks to drop their prime lending rates by half a point to 8.5 per cent. All this was welcome news to the equity market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 53 points over the two-day rate-cutting period; and to the White House, as the Bush administration has been repeatedly calling for an easing of monetary policy to combat the recession. The US government spent much of last weekend in a quixotic attempt to persuade other leading industrial nations to co-ordinate a round of rate cuts. Beneath the market's enthusiasm lay an undercurrent of concern: many analysts had expected the Fed's monetary stance to remain on hold, while it weighed up conflicting signs as to where the economy was heading. So what prompted it to act now? The answer seems to be concern over recent statistics showing no indication of a recovery in industrial production and capital goods spending, on top of weak consumer demand. The Bush administration and many economists still say they expect a gradual recovery from around the end of the second quarter. They may be right, but not so long ago the consensus was that the recession would be short and shallow, and it is now in its 10th month. At the start of the year, the White House claimed the worst of the recession was over, yet figures last week showed that real GNP fell at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the first quarter, compared with 1.6 per cent in final three months of 1990. There is still little hard evidence to suggest a recovery is just around the corner. It is true a very modest upturn seems under way in residential real estate, while the latest Fed survey of regional economic trends said this week that there were 'some indications that the decline may be bottoming out'. Figures yesterday on the April jobs market showed a surprising drop in the unemployment rate, but government statisticians cautioned against reading too much into this. A further decline in non-farm employment suggests that the economy has yet to reach the bottom of the trough. Nor are there any glimmers of light on the industrial front. John Akers, chairman of International Business Machines, warned this week that it had yet to see any evidence of an improving business climate. Similarly, the Big Three Detroit car makers accompanied dreadful first-quarter results with some cautious remarks about the outlook for the year. Both General Motors and Ford forecast a gradual second-half recovery for the US economy, but this may have been based on hopes following the economic consensus rather than concrete evidence from dealers' forecourts. GM suffered a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.17bn (Pounds 690m) (excluding one-off gains), while Ford lost Dollars 884m and Chrysler Dollars 598m. Large losses are also expected in the second quarter. Wall Street does not expect any second-half recovery to be sufficiently strong to put the Big Three back in the black for the 1991 financial year. Of course no recession lasts for ever and sooner or later the optimists  - most of the economics profession - which has been constantly predicting a recovery will be proved right, probably some time this summer. The equity market has been discounting a resurgence of economic activity for so long now, and shares are sufficiently expensive (on a 17 plus historic price/earnings ratio) for the dearth of recovery signs to be producing a little edginess. This feeling has been underscored by an enthusiastic response by investors to certain new share issues, notably a listing on the New York Stock Exchange this week by Duracell International, the battery manufacturer. It saw its shares surge to a 38 per cent premium in heavy first day trading. until the economic signals are more positive, there seems little to push the Dow much above 3,000 again, but equally the 2,850 floor that has stood for the past 12 weeks seems relatively strong. More sideways crawling may be in prospect.  ---------------------------- Monday    2876.98 -    35.4 Tuesday   2887.87  +  10.89 Wednesday 2930.2   +  42.33 Thursday  2938.61  +   8.41 Friday    2938.86  +   0.25  ----------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEZY'S NATIONALITY CONTEST CALLED RACIST  </P> <P> A radio contest in which listeners guess the nationality of convenience store  clerks is drawing fire from immigrant activists who say the game is racist.  </P> <P> Called "Foreign or Domestic," the contest by KEZY-FM (95.9) has morning host  Chris Little telephone clerks, and listeners guess whether they were born in  the United States.  </P> <P> After a chat with the salesclerk, Little asks the clerk's nationality and  contestants find out if they predicted correctly.  </P> <P> Little said the game didn't work one time because the clerk spoke little  English. He said that 40% are American-born and that he teases them too.  "People have always made fun of 7-Elevens," he said.  </P> <P> Don Simmons, a board member of Cambodian Family, a Santa Ana refugee support  organization, said: "It's a tacit form of racism disguised as humor."  </P> <P> Mary Ann Gaido, a human relations specialist at the Orange County Human  Relations Commission, said no complaints had been received but said the contest  "sounds extremely divisive."  </P> <P> The game has been on the air since mid-September and runs about four times a  week. So far, there have been about 30 to 40 winners of prizes such as concert  and television show tickets, Little said.  </P> <P> "It's supposed to be a benign little game," he said.  </P> <P> Station manager Peri Corso said the game may be dropped as part of a  fine-tuning of the station's format.  </P> <P> "No matter what you seem to do nowadays, it offends someone," she said.  </P></p>

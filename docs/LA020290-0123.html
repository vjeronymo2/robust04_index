			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW: 'INDIANA JONES' RELEASED IN 7 VIDEO FORMATS  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Indiana Jones is always adventuring into areas where no other explorer dares to  go, so it's fitting that "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" represented a  video-industry first when it was released Thursday. The Steven Spielberg film  is the first to be released simultaneously in seven versions: regular VHS,  Beta, pan-and-scan LaserDisc, letterbox LaserDisc, Super-VHS, 8mm, and  Spanish-subtitled VHS.  </P> <P> That is especially good news for anyone who has laid out big bucks for a  Super-VHS VCR, only to find that pre-recorded material in the improved-image  format is almost non-existent. The news gets even better: The Super-VHS version  of the 1989 summer blockbuster is the lowest-priced S-VHS movie-on-tape yet --  only $39.95 -- and it's in the letterbox configuration (wide screen, with black  bands at top and bottom).  </P> <P> "Last Crusade" is the first S-VHS release from Paramount Home Video, offering  hope that other S-VHS tapes will be coming from this major and others in 1990.  </P> <P> Prices are even lower for the other versions -- $29.95 for each of the  LaserDisc versions and $24.95 for all others.  </P> <P> Harrison Ford is back as Indy, with Sean Connery on hand as his father. Also  starring Denholm Elliott, River Phoenix, John Rhys-Davies and Alison Doody,  "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" is MPAA-rated PG-13.  </P> <P> Other new movies-on-tape:  </P> <P> "High Hopes" (Academy, $89.95, not MPAA rated). Critically acclaimed 1989  British comedy-drama from director Mike Leigh about the class system in  Thatcher-era Britain.  </P> <P> "The Fastest Guitar Alive" (MGM/UA, $19.95). Did you know that singer Roy  Orbison starred in a Civil War drama back in 1968? He did, and here it is --  though this tame movie will be of interest only to curiosity seekers.  </P> <P> "Eat a Bowl of Tea" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13). Comedy set in New York  City's Chinatown, circa the 1940's. Directed by Wayne Wang ("Slamdance").  </P> <P> "Night Visitor" (MGM/UA, $79.95, R). No one believes a compulsive liar when he  reports a gruesome murder. This 1989 film with Elliot Gould shouldn't be  confused with 1970's "The Night Visitor," which starred Max von Sydow and Liv  Ullmann.  </P> <P> "Time Trackers" (MGM/UA, $79.95, PG). Weak time-travel comedy that gets waylaid  in medieval England too long. Ned Beatty, Kathleen Beller.  </P> <P> "Another Chance" (Republic, $89.95, R). Obscure 1988 romantic comedy with Bruce  Greenwood, Vanessa Angel and Anne Ramsey about a playboy who suddenly has to be  faithful to one woman.  </P> <P> "Jesse James Rides Again" and "G-Men vs. the Black Dragon" (Republic, $29.95  each). Two double-cassette packages compiling 1940s serials.  </P> <P> NEXT WEEK: "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Wired" (both Wednesday).  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> They're baa-ack. Those masters of mayhem, the Three Stooges, wreak havoc in six  more videos containing three shorts each. Volumes 27 through 31 feature Larry,  Moe and Curly; Volumes 26 and 31 have Larry, Moe and Shemp. The tapes are  $14.95 each from RCA/Columbia.  </P> <P> Another sort of mayhem is on view in "Rolling Stone Presents 20 Years of Rock  &amp; Roll" (MGM/UA, $19.95), a 97-minute retrospective featuring performers  ranging from the Beatles to Madonna.

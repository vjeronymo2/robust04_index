			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Monday Interview: Builder of a social pillar - Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, talks to Michael Prowse As a former governor of the Bank of France and director of the French Treasury, Mr Michel Camdessus has the perfect credentials for his present post as managing director of the IMF. Yet he is far from a typical product of central banks and finance ministries. He is more affable, more extroverted and markedly less conservative than most of his peers. At least, that is how he struck me in an interview at his Washington office on the eve of the IMF/World Bank annual meeting. I was also impressed by his unfailing optimism and good humour. Mr Camdessus faces an array of formidable problems yet betrays no trace of strain. As he smiles and gesticulates, he spins the illusion that the world's most vexing problems will readily dissolve if only the protagonists show a modicum of goodwill and common sense. Leaving for later the sensitive issues - Maastricht, Europe's exchange rates, Russia's stalled reforms - I delved first into Mr Camdessus's personal economic philosophy, a fascinating realm in its own right. Speaking recently in New York, Mr Camdessus said policymakers had exhausted themselves in the past decade talking about macroeconomic reforms, development strategies and trade liberalisation. It was high time they focused on 'social policy', which he depicted as the essential 'fourth pillar' of a system of international co-operation. Warming to his theme, he said the international agencies (including the IMF) had failed to pay 'sufficient regard to the short-term human costs involved during adjustment or transition to a market economy'. The social component of interventions was sporadic, financially inadequate, late and disorganised, he said. Few of Mr Camdessus's peers can bring themselves to utter the words 'social policy', let alone demand more of it. Were his words intended only for rhetorical effect? Mr Camdessus seemed horrified. It would be 'just indecent', he said in his lilting English, to say things one didn't mean. All his experience at the IMF was that if you ignore social problems, 'you can forget about the efficiency of your programmes'. In pushing his social agenda, Mr Camdessus has repeatedly urged industrial countries to meet the United Nations target for development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product. Did he realise he was demanding a doubling of Britain's foreign aid budget? He chuckled, but did not retreat. 'I would give you to the end of the century.' The increase, he said, was necessary and could easily be afforded given the scope for military spending cuts - another favourite theme. Since his arrival at the IMF in 1987, Mr Camdessus has struggled to lengthen time horizons - to coax his staff to think less about short-term ways of 'stabilising' economies and more about promoting long-term growth. Recently, his campaign has seemed to intensify. At the Rio earth summit in June, he announced that the IMF's goal was no longer growth per se, but 'high quality' growth. What did he mean? 'Monetary discipline does not make sense if it is not to lay the ground for sustainable growth,' he explained. But different forms of growth were not equally desirable. By 'high quality' growth he meant growth that has 'a rich content in poverty alleviation', brings 'improvements in income distribution' and is environmentally friendly. The IMF was having to adapt, he added, because 'public opinion has told us that growth without poverty alleviation is nonsense'. Was there anything in his background that explained his unusual sensitivity on such issues? Mr Camdessus roared with laughter. 'I will see a psychologist,' he promised. Growing more serious, he said travelling in Africa as a senior French civil servant had opened his eyes. 'I believe we don't do enough. This is an anxiety of mine.' But how did he square the IMF's meagre Dollars 1bn loan to Russia with his strictures about needing to do more to ease human suffering in the transition to capitalism? He responded in two ways. The IMF loan was only part of a total relief effort for Russia that already amounted to Dollars 12bn-Dollars 13bn. More important, it represented 'just the beginning of our work'. True to his nature, he was resolutely optimistic about Russia's prospects. Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's reforms were on track, he declared. The IMF had just dispatched a team to negotiate a full standby agreement for 1993. 'We have a strong determination to do the maximum and to encourage others to do the maximum.' In theory the maximum means an IMF loan of about Dollars 3bn, he indicated. Turning to Europe, I asked whether the French vote on Maastricht was really crucial to Europe's future. He smiled and conceded that his countrymen had a tendency to exaggerate their own importance. He then plunged into a passionate defence of the treaty. A European single currency was the 'single most important step toward the reconstruction of an orderly monetary system since the breakdown of Bretton Woods in the early 1970s,' he said. Maastricht was 'good for Europe, good for the world, and very good for France.' He felt certain that common sense would prevail on the day of the vote. But what was the logic for a single currency? Why make Europe homogenous? Were not small countries - Switzerland, for example - often prosperous? Mr Camdessus was firm. 'The logic is to make transactions easier and disciplines common.' Because Europe is a community, it is essential that fiscal and monetary policy be 'conceived, managed and implemented in common'. Taking a wider view, while Maastricht would not allow 'Europe to dominate the world with a currency stronger than the dollar,' it would create 'a position of equal partnership with other key currencies'. It would enable Europe to do more to promote global monetary stability. The treaty, moreover, would reduce inflation and budget deficits and stimulate saving and investment. It would turn Europe's 'totally unacceptable' current account deficit into a surplus, thus providing the savings needed to fuel the economic transformation of eastern Europe. How did he react to the turmoil on European foreign exchanges? Didn't the shock of German unification provide a textbook justification for a realignment of currencies in the exchange rate mechanism? Mr Camdessus conceded that a realignment had been an option 'at the moment of unification'. But that course had rightly been rejected because it would have undone much good work. 'Credibility in monetary affairs takes a long time to build but is very rapidly destroyed.' The future lay not in a realignment but in putting in place macroeconomic policies that 'truly supported' current parities. In Germany this required 'convincing budgetary action'. Italy faced 'the moment of truth'; it had a last chance to take 'extremely strong fiscal action' and demonstrate its commitment to the Maastricht convergence criteria. Talk of Maastricht reminded me of the bewildering variety of claims on the time of IMF managing directors. Yet it is often possible to identify a single 'defining task'. In the case of Mr Jacques de Larosiere, his predecessor, it was the third-world debt crisis. Did Mr Camdessus agree that his defining task was overseeing the historic shift to capitalism in former Soviet republics and eastern Europe? He was far too canny to be comfortable with that risk-laden gauge of job performance. 'The republics are quite important. But I still spend a great deal of time on debt.' And working toward 'a better co-ordination of policies among major countries' was also a top priority. With any luck, the affable Mr Camdessus will hit at least one of these targets. In the meantime, expect more extracurricular ruminations on social policy. PERSONAL FILE 1933 Born in Bayonne, France.

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Business Travel (Update): Russian travel Thomas Cook has opened what it says is the first business travel management centre in Russia. Thomas Cook Rus, in Moscow, provides travel planning, bookings and visas for companies doing business in Russia. It also plans to offer foreign exchange facilities. Mr Bill Kirkwood, sales and marketing director for Thomas Cook Travel Management in Europe, says that, while other travel groups have had a presence in Moscow for a number of years, they do not offer a comprehensive service for business travellers. Thomas Cook Rus says its clients so far include IBM, Schlumberger, Deutsche Bank, Bosch and Mistubishi.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee sees big plunge Funds and speculators baled out of coffee in New York and London yesterday, sending prices plummeting. The late sell-off in New York was largely technical, the market falling through previous resistance points with the same ease with which it soared after the two Brazilian frosts in June and July. The absence of roaster buying did not help and both markets were anticipating Friday's publication of USDA figures on frost damage to the 1995/96 Brazilian crop, which traders expect to be less than Brazilian government estimates. 'It's a cascading technical sell-off,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, coffee analyst at Merrill Lynch. 'From a purely technical perspective, the close indicates this market has topped out.' The December position in New York closed at 184 cents a pound, down 22.50 cents, or nearly 11 per cent. Earlier in London, the November contract ended Dollars 160 lower at Dollars 3,390 a tonne, but above the recent low of Dollars 3,310 on July 29.</p>

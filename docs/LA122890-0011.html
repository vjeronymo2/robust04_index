			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> U.S. Border Patrol agents seized 760 pounds of marijuana from a pickup whose  driver crossed the border but escaped back into Mexico on Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> Agents said they saw a 1986 blue Ford Ranger pickup with a camper shell drive  through a hole in the border fence about a mile west of the San Ysidro Port of  Entry.  </P> <P> Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg said the agents tried to head off the  pickup, but it made a U-turn back to Mexico. When the truck got stuck in the  sand about 100 feet north of the border fence, the driver jumped out and  escaped into Mexico, he said.  </P> <P> Gregg said Thursday's seizure has a street value of about $1.2 million.  </P> <P> He said members of Operation Alliance -- a task force of agents from the  federal Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Border Patrol and U.S Customs  -- have seized more than 3 tons of marijuana, worth an estimated $9.7 million,  since Oct. 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year.  </P></p>

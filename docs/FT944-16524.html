			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Watchdog suggests spot market for household gas Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, asked energy companies yesterday to consider plans for setting up a daily spot market in gas sales to encourage competition in the household supply market when British Gas's monopoly is removed in 1996. The regulator published a consultation document setting out proposals for the operation of daily spot sales and called on operators to give their views on what steps should be taken to develop a market. 'In order to successfully introduce sustainable competition . . . a daily market for gas has to evolve which is fully effective and efficient,' said Mr Mark Higson, Ofgas' director of network operations. In the US, where the market was deregulated just over 10 years ago, a spot market developed rapidly and now almost half the gas used is bought and sold on a daily basis. A natural gas futures contract also trades on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Ofgas is keen for a similar liquid and transparent market to develop in the UK. Gas companies would have access to a marketplace for balancing customer requirements through daily sales and purchases. The Ofgas document discusses a balancing mechanism put forward by TransCo, British Gas's pipelines operation, and a gas exchange suggested by Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, Eastern Natural Gas and Manweb Gas, the gas supply arms of the regional electricity companies, as well as other proposals. The regulator believes a spot market will play an important part in the development of long-term competition and ensure that balancing the system takes place efficiently and at minimum cost. The need for balancing gas requirements in this way arises from the removal of British Gas's monopoly over household supply. That will leave independent gas distributors competing for household business, demand for which can fluctuate sharply during the day and year. Independent companies can ensure they meet customers' needs more effectively if they have access to a daily source of supply. Ofgas has called for responses by November.</p>

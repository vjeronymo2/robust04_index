			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: WH Smith nervous Shares in high street retailer WH Smith were under pressure in nervous trading ahead of today's publication of the group's full year figures. Investors remain cautious following the group's disappointing interim figures earlier this year. The 'A' shares eased 11 to 455p, in trade of 1m shares. Profits are expected to be in the range Pounds 106m-Pounds 111m (excluding proceeds from the sale of its stake in Yorkshire TV), with high street sales expected to show a recovery. However worries about the group's US operations remain. Cazenove and Nomura were reported to have urged investors to buy the shares.</p>

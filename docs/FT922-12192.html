			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Management: Bending the ear of your MP - Charles Batchelor offers advice on how businesses can best make their voices heard in Westminster The response of the hotel and restaurant owners of Presteigne, Powys to the recent raft of food hygiene laws was to call on the services of their local Liberal Democrat MP. Two meetings were arranged for them to explain their difficulties to the MP, Richard Livsey, who then held a third meeting to put their views to the local environmental health officer. Beryl Darsley, licencee of The Farmers' Inn and organiser of the campaign, says that the pressure the caterers brought through their MP led to a more consistent approach by the environmental health officials. Unfortunately for Darsley and her supporters, Livsey lost his seat earlier this month. If the campaign is to continue, they will have to brief their new MP. The election may have caught Darsley and her group in mid-campaign but for business generally the changes wrought by the election and the influx of more than 120 new MPs present an ideal opportunity for businesses to strike up a relationship with their new representative in Westminster. Despite the belief that lobbying is the preserve of the larger company with its own full-time public affairs department, the smaller business can achieve results - if it goes about it the right way. 'Our members sometimes think they will achieve more if we write on their behalf, but nothing carries more weight with an MP than a letter from a company in his constituency,' says Stephen Alambritis, parliamentary officer of the Federation of Small Businesses. Business owners often forget that they have something to offer their MP, says John Warburton, head of the parliamentary office of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). 'Businesses provide MPs with information, so they can come to more balanced judgements, and give them an opportunity to raise their profile.' Many of the professionals say that the best method is for the business to establish contact with its MP before it has a problem so that if an issue arises he or she will already be familiar with the company. Inviting the MP to visit a factory or getting him to present certificates to apprentices may give him a welcome chance to get his picture in the local paper. If an issue does come up which requires the MP's help he should be contacted either by phone or letter through his constituency office or his office in Westminster. (Dod's Parliamentary Companion lists MPs' Westminster office numbers and addresses. The House of Commons switchboard number is 071 219 3000. Its public information office number is 071 219 4272). Small business owners frequently become emotionally involved in issues and do not always put their arguments clearly. 'Often they don't prepare a constructive case,' says Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield. 'They unload huge amounts of paperwork on their MPs. They should set out their case on two sides of paper; the facts should be accurate and they should not exaggerate.' Provided the business makes a sound case to its MP, his response is likely to be a letter to the minister involved. The minister will reply to the MP who will pass the response on to his constituent. If this does not produce a satisfactory reply the MP may then press for a meeting between the constituent, the minister and the civil servants. When Ian Guthrie, owner of Rombalds hotel and restaurant in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, protested about being fined Pounds 2,000 by Customs &amp; Excise for filing his VAT returns three days late, Max Madden Labour MP for Bradford West put detailed questions on VAT penalties to the Chancellor the Exchequer. Businesses should always start their lobbying with their constituency MP, says Alambritis. But many MPs espouse particular causes (MP's interests are listed in Dod's) and will take up a campaign for non-constituents. Guthrie wrote to his own MP, as well as to local business organisations and the Yorkshire Post newspaper. This prompted Madden, MP for a neighbouring constituency, to take up his case. Professional lobbyists suggest an informal league table of factors which will influence the enthusiasm of MPs for their constituents' causes. MPs from the ruling party keen on making a ministerial career are less likely to rock the boat than long-standing back-benchers from the opposition. This tends to rule out effective action from parliamentary private secretaries and whips. MPs with small majorities may also prove more active than those in very safe seats. One businessman who supplies car phones feels his Conservative MP did not take up his complaint about the 1991 tax on portable phones partly because of his 20,000-plus majority. The determined small business owner can make some progress by using his MP, but may improve his chances of achieving results by broadening his campaign. The more general the issues the more likely he will gain the backing of his trade association or business lobby group. 'We will only take up the broader issues,' says the CBI's Warburton. The London Chamber of Commerce has a seven-strong policy studies department which spends much of its time on 'representation' work. 'We find it difficult to take up local issues but we do pick up regional and national matters,' says Jacqueline Ginnane, who heads the department. Businesses sometimes turn to professional lobbying consultancies though their fees are too high for some small firms. 'We tend to work for large companies or trade associations,' says David Robertson, joint managing director of Political Relations. Robertson believes it is more cost-effective for a small business to lobby through its trade association. Paying a professional lobbyist to monitor forthcoming legislation can cost between Pounds 500 and Pounds 600 a month; providing a briefing service to MPs and civil servants, Pounds 7,000 to Pounds 8,000 a year; and a full-blown campaign from Pounds 20,000 upwards. How effective is lobbying? Small firms must be realistic in their expectations, the experts stress. They may ensure that the rules are interpreted in a favourable fashion but only rarely can they force a change in the rules themselves. The London Chamber of Commerce believes its lobbying contributed to an easing in the last Budget of the terms of the Uniform Business Rate though the government did not grant all of its demands. However David Robertson points to a successful campaign by the contract cleaning industry to open up local authority cleaning contracts to commercial bidders. 'There are occasions when you can help because departments do make mistakes,' says Henry McLeish, Labour MP for Fife Central. 'More often it is a question not of getting the answer my constituents want but of getting an answer more quickly.' McLeish may be being too modest. Government departments do not like to admit they have got something wrong even when an effective lobby convinces them they have.</p>

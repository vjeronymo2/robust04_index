			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA recognizes that vehicles are often used for periods longer than the useful life period specified in the applicable regulations. In California, over 40 percent of onroad light-duty vehicles have over 100,000 miles on their odometers. EPA is concerned about the emissions of vehicles after the end of the vehicle's useful life because, although such vehicles will still be subject to I/M testing, manufacturers will be no longer responsible for ensuring that the vehicles remain in compliance with the in-use recall standards. Comments are requested on whether other in-use compliance programs such an enhanced OBD, which remain effective beyond the vehicle's statutory useful life, are feasible and may result in equal or greater emission reductions than the proposed enhanced in-use recall program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For heavy-duty engines (discussed in section B. below), which are rebuilt several times and are used significantly longer than the useful life specified by the manufacturer on a regular basis, EPA is proposing rebuild regulations (see section B.) for engines beyond their originally certified useful life. EPA requests comments on adopting comparable rebuild provisions for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles that are certified to chassis-based standards in order to ensure that these vehicles continue to meet in-use recall standards throughout their operating lives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e. Vehicle family selection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with the 49 state recall program, EPA may select vehicle families for enhanced in-use compliance recall testing at its discretion. For the 49 state recall program, EPA examines a variety of items when choosing a vehicle family for recall testing including testing data from certification and production line audits, production volumes, and defect reports. EPA is likely to also examine these items for the enhanced in-use compliance recall program. Additionally, EPA is planning to examine enhanced I/M testing results for patterns of failure within exhaust engine families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also plans to track the various technologies being used to meet enhanced in-use standards. If EPA believes that a technology may be more susceptible to in-use emissions performance deterioration, EPA may choose to proceed with recall testing of vehicle families using that particular technology. Special concerns may arise related to the use of a particular fuel or, more likely, related to the complexity of a technology and therefore its additional areas for failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f. Criteria for requiring recall. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   EPA proposes to, at its discretion, require a manufacturer to recall vehicles and take remedial action if the average emissions of the test vehicles for any regulated pollutant exceed the applicable emissions standard. EPA proposes to retain the discretion not to order a recall if it determines that a recall action is not warranted. Manufacturers would be able to present data and reasoning to EPA for the Agency to consider in making a final decision on whether or not to proceed with a recall. However, EPA is concerned that the recall program may not be viewed as a strong enforcement tool if its authority is too discretionary. EPA wishes to make clear its intent to hold manufacturers responsible for in-use failures of essentially all vehicles except those that have been subject to obvious abuse or tampering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also recognizes that outlier vehicles in the recall sample could cause an inappropriate recall. The impact of an outlier on the results of a recall test could be substantial because the recall test sample could be relatively small (about 10 vehicles). EPA would allow manufacturers to provide additional test data showing that a vehicle is unrepresentative (i.e., an outlier), and this data may then be considered by EPA in making a final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also concerned that vehicles representing a small percentage of the engine family population (e.g., 5 percent or less) could exhibit such relatively high emissions as to cause the average emissions of the entire engine family to greatly exceed the enhanced in-use standards. For example, if five vehicles per one hundred failed to their pre-control levels of 7 or 8 g/mi NMHC and the remaining vehicles had zero emissions, the engine family would still exceed its standard by 100 percent. EPA is concerned about the emissions impact of this engine family, but is also concerned about the cost, inefficiency and vehicle owner inconvenience of a traditional recall where 95 out of 100 vehicles would be returned to the dealer but require no repair. While the enhanced I/M program will reduce the likelihood of occurrence, such situations may still be common. Comments are requested on alternatives to conventional recall in such cases. Comments on innovative onboard diagnostic capabilities or other screening techniques are also requested. One such approach is discussed in section (j).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comments on the recall criteria and authority described above for the enhanced in-use compliance recall program. EPA encourages any recommendations for adopting different criteria be supported by data and detailed rationale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> g. Mandatory owner participation in recall repairs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the potential large negative impact that vehicles exceeding the standards have on air quality, EPA believes that owners should be required to bring their recalled vehicles in for repairs. While EPA's 49 state recall program does not require owners of recalled vehicles to go to a dealership for needed repairs, California does require recall repairs to be performed (see section 2129 of title 13 of the California Code of Regulations) and the requirement is enforced by denying vehicle reregistration until the repairs have been made. (Driving unregistered vehicles is, of course, unlawful and prohibited.) California currently begins to deny reregistrations six months after the manufacturer begins its remedial action plan. EPA proposes that vehicles subject to the enhanced in-use compliance program also be subject to the same mandatory repair requirements as other California vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

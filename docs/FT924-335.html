			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Weinberger hits back over pardon MR Caspar Weinberger, a former US secretary of defence, yesterday accused the Iran-Contra special prosecutor of pursuing a 'totally unethical' vendetta against presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. In a series of television interviews Mr Weinberger said it was 'ridiculous' to suggest that Mr Bush's Christmas Eve pardon of himself and five others was intended to cover up the then vice-president's own involvement in the scheme to sell arms to Iran in return for the release of US hostages in Lebanon and then illegally to divert the proceeds to rebels in Nicaragua. Mr Weinberger, in effect, said Mr Laurence Walsh, the special prosecutor, had indicted him for lying to Congress about his knowledge of the affair as a way to get at Mr Reagan and, now, Mr Bush. The charges, he said, would have been dropped if he had implicated either Mr Reagan or Mr Bush. A spokeswoman for Mr Walsh said yesterday that Mr Weinberger was not asked to incriminate anybody else. Mr Weinberger, 75, conceded he may have misled Congress but denied he did so with criminal intent. He agreed that Mr Bush attended meetings at which the sale of missiles to Iran was discussed but said it was 'a matter of opinion' whether the discussions also embraced Iran's help in securing the release of US hostages. Mr Reagan, he noted, had asserted they did not. The stage is set for a bitter confrontation between Mr Walsh and Mr Bush over the president's private notes of his knowledge of the Iran-Contra affair, which Mr Bush has said he will release. Congress may also get into the act by holding hearings on the affair. Mr Walsh's ire was exacerbated by Mr Bush's justification for the pardons. In his statement the president accused the prosecutor of exploiting 'a profoundly troubling development in the political and legal climate of our country: the criminalisation of policy differences.' This so outraged Mr Walsh that on Christmas Eve he revealed for the first time that Mr Bush was a subject of his investi-gations. Mr Weinberger's notes, which he insisted he had never sought to conceal from Mr Walsh, suggest Mr Bush was in favour of the missile sale to Iran and, by implication, the whole Iran-Contra-hostages scheme which Mr Weinberger, along with Mr George Shultz, then secretary of state, vigorously opposed. There had been heavy lobbying, mostly by former Reagan administration officials, for Mr Bush to pardon Mr Weinberger before Mr Bill Clinton takes over as president next month. A central argument of their campaign was that justice would hardly be seen to be have been done if Mr Weinberger, an opponent of Iran-Contra, were found guilty while its chief architect, Lt Col Oliver North, were roaming free, his conviction having been overturned on appeal. Mr Clinton has been careful not to comment on the Weinberger pardon, although it has been sharply criticised by some prominent Democrats in Congress. An exception is Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House, whose tacit approval seems to have been secured in advance by the White House. However, the incoming Clinton government will have on its plate a number of outstanding investigations related to the Reagan and Bush administration dealings with Iran and Iraq, as well as to the search of Mr Clinton's passport records. Mr Clinton has said, generally, he favours the renewal of the statute, which expired earlier this month, authorising the appointment of independent special prosectors.</p>

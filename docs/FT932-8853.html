			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Management: Quick off the mark if disaster strikes - A look at contingency planning Recent bomb attacks on both sides of the Atlantic gave an added twist to two events in London last week. One was a visit on Friday from Charles Maikish, director of New York's World Trade Centre, who went out of his way to praise the local response to the disaster in February. Maikish said that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the centre's landlord, employed stress counsellors in the lobbies, issued bulletins to tenants about the safety standards in the building, which included certificates of the building's structural integrity, and held daily press conferences in an effort to keep tenants and the public informed. The need to reassure its 350 commercial tenants was seen as paramount by the Port Authority. 'We were very vulnerable to tenants looking for release from their leases,' said Maikish. In order to mitigate any economic impact on the tenants the Port Authority organised the temporary relocation of tenants, paid their moving costs, and suspended their rent obligations on the existing offices. The landlord was particularly anxious to satisfy tenants about the safety of their offices. With 40,000 employees evacuated from the building, tenants were concerned about their employees' willingness to return to their offices. The Port Authority, which organised its response to the bomb on the evening of the attack, has stopped short of setting up a disaster contingency plan. However, it has designated another site for people to report to in the case of disaster and it has set up an alternative telecommunications system. It is also reviewing its security systems. The other event in London was a conference organised by the UK's Institute of Directors, which served to remind companies that bomb damage is not the only disaster for which organisations need to plan. Routine maintainance work by the water board recently caused a disaster for the Bank of Finland when a burst main flooded its basement and shut down its computer. No sooner had the bank recovered from that disaster than a second one struck; a few days later an unrelated electrical mishap closed the system down again. The Bank of Finland, along with Commercial Union which was a victim of last year's City bomb, is now a veteran on business recovery. In common with most other financial organisations in the City, the Bank of Finland had a contingency plan already in place which included the transfer of all its computing facilities to a disaster recovery centre. Its experience was a happy one: after each upset, business was kept going with only the briefest interruption. According to Peter Mobsby, assistant general manager, the bank learnt the following lessons: The time and money involved in setting up contingency plans was well spent. The recovery time from the second disaster was far quicker than for the first, demonstrating the importance of a full dress rehearsal. The bank has moved its computer out of the basement to reduce future risk of flood, and has resolved to mount full electrical tests after any power failure. Beds and showers are needed at the disaster recovery site, as staff are likely to work through the night. The fastest way of getting documents to the recovery site may also be the cheapest - the tube might be quicker than taxis. Lightening may strike twice. The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, the Computing Services Association, and Survive, the disaster recovery group, announced last week that they are working to provide an Emergency Help Desk for the City of London. This will be opened in the Guildhall to offer guidance and support to companies with IT problems in the event of a disaster such as the recent Bishopsgate bomb.</p>

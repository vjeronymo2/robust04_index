			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Europe Energy turns in Pounds 145,532 deficit Europe Energy, the USM-quoted mining company which reversed in to Moray Firth two years ago, announced a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 145,532 for the six months to end-September. That compared with a loss of Pounds 148,494 last time and came from turnover up by Pounds 245,000 to Pounds 982,633. The directors pointed out that because of the high overdraft the company was now supporting, the interest charge had risen considerably, from Pounds 11,579 to Pounds 53,089. However, they added, October and November 1992 were the first two months in which mining activities produced net profits after all financing and depletion costs.</p>

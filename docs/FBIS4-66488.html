			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shuzo Kanzaki, GIRI, Nagoya, and Hideaki </F> Matsubara, Japan Fine Ceramics Center]    [Text]  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Attempts to use ceramics as high-temperature structural  materials were accelerated by the oil crises of the 1970s.  Government projects in the United States and West Germany began  one after the other with the goal of developing a ceramic gas  turbine engine. In Japan as well, the Fine Ceramics Project was  initiated in 1981 under the system of R&amp;D Projects of Basic  Technologies for Future Industries in order to establish R&amp;D  technology for the manufacture and processing, evaluation,  design, and use of silicon nitride and silicon carbide ceramics.  Although projects overseas placed their emphasis on the  development of systems, the major feature of the project in  Japan was that its chief objective was material development. We  clearly remember that this not only had a major impact on  foreign R&amp;D thereafter, but it was also the impetus behind  the  development of ceramic fibers in Japan. In March 1993, after 12  years, R&amp;D on the Fine Ceramics Project drew to a close.  During  the course of this project steady advances were made in  technical development of ceramics for structural use. Material  properties were dramatically improved through advances in the  development of highly pure raw material powders, forming and  sintering technology, and technology for controlling the  microstructure of sintered bodies. For example, silicon nitride  material was realized with a compressive strength surpassing 1  GPa or fracture toughness surpassing 10 MPa m[.sup]1/2[/].  Moreover, Weibull strength coefficients greater than 20 have  become commonplace.    Recently, however, it has become clear that we are facing  energy and environmental problems on a global scale, and when we  look at prospects for technological development in the 21st  Century, the most important challenge we will face is the  transition from the environmentally destructive technologies of  the past and their consumption of mass quantities of natural  resources to sophisticated, energy-saving, clean technologies of  the future that will enable the conservation and effective  utilization of natural resources. The materials used in these  new systems must be especially safe and reliable, both in terms  of thermal and mechanical properties and in terms of  functionality, under much harsher environments than in the past.  We believe previous methods of developing ceramics, which mostly  set out to enhance a single function, are severely limited if we  are to satisfy these high-level demands on materials in terms of  mechanical and other functions.    Several years ago, after considerable discussion Japan's  universities, national research institutes and ceramics-related  companies decided to pursue a new concept in materials  development that would enable researchers to create multiple  functions in the same material. Thus, preliminary research on  ``Hierarchical Structure Controlled Fused Inorganic Materials''  was initiated under the system of R&amp;D Projects of Basic  Technologies for Future Industries to study the potential for  creating future projects through experimental verification of  this new concept of Hierarchical Structure Control. In this  article we will introduce this concept and details of research,  as well as discuss the direction of research projects in the  future.  <H5>  2. Structure Control of Ceramics </H5>   2.1 Classification of Structure    We can say that all materials, not just ceramics, have  something in common: their unique functions (properties) are  intimately related to their structures (organization).  Therefore, we can say that the true course of materials  development research is to express stable functions and new  functions as well by meticulously controlling the structure of  the material. Therefore, we will begin our discussion with the  question of how to look at the structure of ceramics.    Generally when we think about the structure of inorganic  materials like ceramics, we consider electron orbitals, chemical  bonds, crystal structure, lattice defects, particle boundaries,  dispersed particles, porosity, fibers, crystal grains, layers,  and so on. These are referred to as structural elements. To  actually describe material structure, it is necessary to talk  about the state of these structural elements. However, the  methods of expression are quite varied, depending on the  structural elements themselves and on the researchers, so  definitive descriptions are not easily obtained. Therefore, one  method we can employ for clarity is to classify the structural  elements using a kind of measuring scale; in other words, to  arrange the structural elements in a hierarchy.    Figure 1 shows one way of classifying structures in ceramics  and their control methods. As ways of classifying the structural  elements (arranging them in a hierarchy) we have chosen size,  shape, distribution, arrangement, and orientation. We believe  the easiest measure to understand in this hierarchical  arrangement of material structure is size. However, when it  comes to the problem of ``controlling ceramics structure,''  elements of electron theory such as electron orbitals and  chemical bonds do not come into play. Therefore, when we look at  ceramics structure in terms of control and what is controllable,  we are dealing with the atomic/molecular level or larger. As a  result, we decided to classify size into four levels or  hierarchies--(1) ultra-ultra-micro, (2) ultra-micro, (3) micro,  and (4) macro--to clarify structure. In this diagram we have  expressed schematically which levels the various structural  elements belong to. We have also placed the various structure  control methods on the levels at which they are mainly  performed, and we have indicated with arrows where the other  measures such as shape and distribution must be taken into  account in the size hierarchy.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-05A>      Figure 1. Classification of Ceramics Structure and Control </FIG>     2.2 Structure Control in the Past    Let us look at previous types of ceramics from the  standpoint  of structure control. First, in the case of single unit  (monolithic) ceramics for structural use, we have been able to  create sophisticated materials with quite uniform crystal grain  microstructures at the micro level by experimenting with  sintering conditions and minute amounts of additives. Moreover,  research has been conducted recently on composite ceramics using  dispersed particles, whiskers and long fibers, and we are  discovering that these are promising materials in terms of  strength and toughness. In the case of functional ceramics,  structural control such as expression of functions inherent in  the characteristic crystal and electron structures of materials,  and control of grain boundary structure is being performed on a  lower hierarchical level than with structural materials.  Regardless of whether they are structural or functional,  however, we can say that with previous types of ceramics we have  mainly controlled structure on a single level.    The outstanding feature of structure control on a single  level is that a specific function can be expressed to the  greatest extent possible. Structure control on a single level is  limited, however, because it is extremely difficult to express  multiple functions simultaneously. Materials that can withstand  use in harsh environments must be heat resistant, corrosion  resistant, and strong, as well as reliable and durable.  Furthermore, these properties must all be in balance (harmony).  It is extremely difficult to obtain both balance and high-level  properties with structure control at a single level, so to  overcome this we must perform structure control across multiple  levels simultaneously.  <H5>  3. Hierarchical Structure Control </H5>   3.1 Concept    If we attempt to describe hierarchical structure control as  simply as possible, we can say that it is ``controlling the  structures (structural elements) at two or more levels in the  same material.''    Figure 2 shows an example of hierarchical structure control.  Here, if we describe the desired structure control beginning  with the level of greatest size, the material's interior is  reinforced by short fibers (orientation is also controlled) and  long fibers, and a structure control layer is formed on the  surface of the material (micro-/macro-level). In addition,  particles are dispersed at the matrix grain boundaries and  within the grains (ultra-ultra-micro level), and distribution  control on the atomic level (ultra-ultra-micro level) is carried  out in the matrix.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-06A>      Figure 2. Model of Hierarchical Structure Control </FIG>     We will explain functions that are expressed by hierarchical  structure control using the schematic drawing in Figure 3. If we  look at strength and toughness as examples, because structural  uniformity is required to increase strength, and structural  non-uniformity is required to increase toughness, it has been  very difficult to obtain both of these properties using the  single level structure control of the past. Recently, however, a  control technique called nanocomposite has been created in which  nanoparticles are dispersed inside microparticles as in (b).  Related research has begun on techniques to control crystal  grain orientation as in (a). As a result, the possibility has  emerged for a material like (d) that is both strong and tough  through hierarchical structure control that is performed by  employing these two control techniques simultaneously. In  addition, it will also be possible to realize mechanical and  other properties at the same time. For example, we can express  magnetic properties as in (c) by structure control on the  ultra-ultra-micro level. With past methods in which magnetic  particles were dispersed that were the same size or larger than  the matrix particles, strength dropped considerably (due to  increase in defect size). However, if we use the control  technique of nanoparticle dispersion as in (b), we can expect a  very strong, magnetic material with a structure like (e).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-06B>      Figure 3 Schematic Diagram of Hierarchical Structure </FIG>     3.2 Examples of Hierarchical Structure Control  Research    Recently, there have been several examples of research  conducted both in Japan and overseas that could be called the  beginnings of hierarchical structure control. Here we would like  to show some examples of the preliminary research mentioned  above.    Figure 4 shows an example of a material using  Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], a typical oxide ceramic, as a  base. When highly pure alumina is sintered, a material is  obtained with the fine, uniform structure shown in (a). As shown  in (c), for alumina this sintered body is very strong, but it  has a low fracture toughness. On the other hand, structure  control can be performed to obtain the material shown in (b) by  adding a trace amount of SiO[.sub]2[/] (ultra-ultra-micro  level) to highly pure alumina under a gel-sol process and  growing the Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] grains in plates while  precipitating  La[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-11Al[.sub]2[/]O3 (micro  level) in the plate phase at the same time. As a result, a  material that is both very strong and very tough is obtained.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-07A>      Figure 4 Example of Hierarchical Structure Control of </FIG>     In previous Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] materials, those  with microparticles were very strong but not very tough, whereas  coarser materials were ordinarily very tough but not very  strong. As shown in Figure 5, however, if we synthesize short,  thick, rod-shaped monocrystalline  _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] particles beforehand and add  them in trace amounts, the sintered material has very small  maximum defect dimensions, is very strong, and also has  excellent toughness.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-07B>      Figure. 5 Example of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] </FIG>     Figure 6 shows an example of SiC material. In the structure  in (a), TiC grains were dispersed (micro level), and some of the  dispersed Ti grains were replaced with W (ultra-micro level). As  we can see from the comparison of the mechanical properties of  various SiC-based materials shown in (b), with SiC-(Ti,W)C a  harmony of mechanical properties is present that cannot be  obtained in other materials.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-08A>      Figure 6 Example of Hierarchical Structure Control of SiC </FIG>     Naturally, these cases are results of initial or preliminary  research on the concept of developing materials using  hierarchical structure control. Unless we plan for  wider-ranging, more sophisticated developments in the future in  terms of structures and materials, material design must be based  only on structure, function, or process. Below, we would like to  consider the material design techniques where hierarchical  structure control is likely to be most effective.    First calculations that predict the crystal structure and  basic properties of chemical compounds are important. More  specifically, these are calculations from basic formulas on the  atomic/molecular or electron level that use molecular dynamics,  molecular orbital theory and so on. Moreover, when we  investigate new or complex series of materials, there are many  instances in which we cannot come up with an experimental phase  diagram, so a technique to predict the experimental phase  diagram is needed. As far as the synthetic process is concerned,  there are also many phenomena on which it would be useful to  conduct computation experiments. If we take the sintering  process for example, this can be done with the process of cavity  elimination, movement of particle boundaries, particle growth  and so on. Figure 7 shows a multiple phase particle growth  simulation by the Monte Carlo method that includes a single  phase and particle dispersion. It clearly shows that particle  growth is suppressed by particle dispersion. If these kinds of  methods can be developed further, it will be possible to predict  controls for particle arrangement, crystal orientation and so  on. Simulation techniques are related as well to evaluation and  analysis techniques, and they can be used to predict fracturing,  deformation, environmental degradation and so on. In addition,  it is possible to anticipate optimal material structures for  various properties by the analysis of computational results.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-08B>      nnot&gt; Figure 7. Monte Carlo Simulation of Particle Growth </FIG>     Needless to say, to make these prediction techniques  effective for hierarchical structural control, we need holistic  associations among the various simulation techniques and  verification by model experiments.    4.2 Evaluation and Analysis Techniques    Support technology for hierarchical structure control must  be  approached from the standpoint of evaluation techniques. What we  need is not the evaluation techniques of the past that were  created for evaluation in general, but evaluation and analysis  techniques that are directly connected to materials development.  One important initiative is a technique for evaluating and  analyzing dynamic behavior and mechanisms such as fracturing and  structure formation. In-situ evaluation techniques that can  capture constantly changing structures or properties will be  extremely effective as support technologies for hierarchical  structure control.    Another important initiative is evaluation and analysis  technology that is closely related to material design. Figure 8  shows an example of such research. First, in (a) a material was  designed in which the Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] matrix is  reinforced by the SiC-series fibers, and at the same time, some  of the fibers or matrix phase is replaced by an electrically  conductive ceramic. In (b) we see the results of material when  some of the fibers are replaced by graphite fibers, and in (c)  we see results when part of the matrix is replaced by a  Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]-TiN continuous phase. Thanks to  the reinforcement by long fibers, we can see that these  materials not only exhibit non-linear fracturing, but also a  change in electrical resistance in response to localized  fractures. More specifically, with the material in (c) we can  detect a major change in electrical resistance at relatively  early stages of deformation. By measuring the residual  resistance in the material after adding and removing an electric  charge, we can detect the extent of cumulative deformation  (damage). Thus, the design and development of materials that are  easy to evaluate or whose degradation behavior can be predicted  and detected as needed will be very effective in improving the  reliability of ceramics. The wide variety of properties of  ceramics--electrical, magnetic, piezoelectric, dielectric,  acoustic, optical, and chemical--can be widely utilized for  detecting material fracturing, damage, wear, property  degradation, corrosion by the environment and so on.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-09A>      Figure 8. Design and Evaluation of Fracture-Detection </FIG>   <H5>  5. Spread of Hierarchical Structure Control Techniques </H5>   Compared with materials such as metals and polymers,  ceramics  have a diversity of bonding forms, crystal structures,  microstructures and so on, so the functions that each substance  or material exhibits are also quite diverse. With hierarchical  structure controlled ceramics we can expect effects such as  presence of multiple functions (coexistence), which is difficult  to achieve with other materials, and mutual enhancement of  functions (synergy). Therefore, we would like to use the  expression ``synergy ceramics'' to describe the image of  materials that have undergone hierarchical structure control  (hierarchical structure controlled fused inorganic materials).  In so doing, we include the idea that we would like to see more  material development that breaks down previous barriers and  boundaries between structural and functional materials.    Figure 9 (not reproduced) is a conceptual drawing of the  spread of synergy ceramics. Properties such as strength,  toughness, heat resistance and the like are balanced with  sophistication by hierarchical structure control. Moreover,  materials that realize multiple functionality such as combined  electromagnetic and chemical functions can be expected to find a  wide range of applications in many fields. We can expect them to  solve major energy and environmental problems as materials with  the kind of high reliability not normally found in functional  materials.  <H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>   Recent R&amp;D in ceramics has developed a reputation both  at  home and abroad as having become rather lethargic. However, that  does not alter the basic fact that ceramics hold tremendous  potential as advanced materials. As is the case with all  materials, in charting a course in ceramics material development  it is important to consider diverse phenomena and events from  new points of view and break new ground.    The preliminary research to present experimental  verification  of the potential of hierarchical structure control draws to a  close this year, and the ``Synergy Ceramics'' Project is  scheduled to start anew in 1994. Based on the unique concept of  hierarchical structure control, this will correspond to a  national ceramics project involving the cooperation of industry,  government and academia as we move toward the 21st Century. We  must recognize once more the importance of the role Japan will  play in the future.    The details presented in this article are not necessarily  complete and certainly will be widely discussed in the future.  We welcome the opinions and comments of our coworkers in this  field.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Labour's tax error IF THERE is little to separate the main parties in their overall economic stance, the same cannot be said for personal taxation policy. Now that both parties have published detailed budget plans, voters can choose between two clearly diverging approaches on taxation. Whichever party wins the election, most employees will continue to pay tax at a marginal rate of 34 per cent: income tax at 25 per cent, plus 9 per cent national insurance contributions (NICs). If the Conservatives are re-elected, the top rate of tax on income and capital gains will remain at 40 per cent, at the bottom of the range for EC countries. This structure was put in place by Mr Nigel Lawson's 1988 budget and has created a simpler and more transparent tax system. Distortions have been reduced by eroding the differences between the tax treatment of income and capital gains and between corporation tax and income tax. Together with the gradual elimination of many tax breaks, the ground has been greatly cut from under the tax avoidance industry. It is a pity that nothing has been done to remove the dip in marginal rates from 34 per cent to 25 per cent at the Pounds 21,060 upper earnings limit for NICs. And the chancellor's proposal for a new lower rate income tax band of 20 per cent, while it may have seemed politically astute, will yield small benefits for taxpayers on low incomes while creating an administrative tangle. If he wants to help those on low incomes, Mr Lamont should steal Labour's clothes and replace the 20 per cent band with higher personal allowances. Sharp change However, the Conservatives deserve credit for having modernised and streamlined the UK tax system since 1979. Labour, in contrast, would introduce a sharp change of direction, with a significantly redistributive programme which requires a return to much higher marginal rates. To raise almost Pounds 5bn of additional revenue, an additional 50 per cent tax rate would be introduced on earnings in excess of Pounds 40,000 a year, and the NIC upper earnings limit would be removed. This effectively adds another 9 per cent tax to all earnings over the limit. For employees, there would be three tax rates: 34 per cent on taxable income up to Pounds 23,700; 49 per cent on taxable income between Pounds 23,700 and Pounds 36,375; and 59 per cent on the rest. A top rate of 59 per cent is not so very different from those charged in comparable countries. And even in the UK, the top rate of tax was 60 per cent until 1988. Although comparisons are difficult, it is broadly true that for most families the higher rates would bite at lower income levels than in Germany and France; for single people the reverse is true. For married taxpayers the new top rate of 59 per cent would also bite earlier than in the 1970s when Mr Denis Healey squeezed the rich. There would be far fewer of the exemptions and tax breaks which made Mr Healey's even higher tax rates largely fictional. Salary inflation The Conservatives will rightly make much of the impact of such an increase in taxation. While there are arguments about the impact on incentives, a higher tax regime will not encourage an enterprise culture. Salary inflation is inevitable. And the effect of such tax rises on the budgets of the 17 per cent of households which would face them would be very painful. It is inconceivable that this would not have a delaying effect on economic recovery - especially in the already depressed housing market. The purpose of the shadow budget was to defuse what the Conservatives have dubbed 'Labour's tax bombshell' - the fear among voters that Labour would put up taxes across the board. By demonstrating to the majority that they have nothing to fear from a Labour government, it may have done the trick. But as the details sink in throughout the more affluent areas where it will bite hardest, the increases could deny Labour victory in key marginals. The proposals do, after all, offer a strong incentive to a quarter of voters in London and the south-east not to vote Labour. If that happens, Mr Smith's tax gamble will have failed, and Labour will pay the price for its misjudgment. Labour's strategists would be wise to think beyond such immediate electoral considerations. There is an implicit contract between government and taxpayers that sudden, large increases in taxation should be avoided. A blind spot on this point led to the poll tax blunder. Labour appeared to recognise the argument in its policy review documents, when it promised that tax changes would be introduced in ways which did not disrupt household budgets. Mr Kinnock still has time to fulfil that pledge. If he fails to do this, wavering voters will conclude that he should not be the next prime minister.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 18 Jan (PL) -- Pedro Ross, secretary general  of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], affirmed during a meeting  with workers in the western Province of Matanzas that Cuba will  adopt measures that will benefit the country economically while  keeping people's sacrifices as low as possible.    Ross said it is necessary to give a political tenor to the  workers' assemblies initiated one week ago so that workers may  discuss how to improve the nation's economic situation and put  the country's domestic finances in order.    The island's most important labor leader said that the  country wants to overcome the current crisis in such a way that  it will be able to continue defending the achievements of the  people and of socialism, the daily GRANMA reports today.    A similar position has been taken by Ricardo Alarcon,  president of the Cuban Parliament. He said that this phase of  discussions about measures to put the country's domestic  finances in order and other key matters of the economy also  forms part of the political battle for island development.    The country's authorities have promoted collective debates  in  search for a national consensus on the adoption of decisions  capable of balancing a fiscal deficit of approximately 4.2  billion pesos (the peso is equivalent to the dollar at the  official exchange rate) and decreasing the excess 10 billion  pesos now circulating.    In the assemblies that have been held the members of labor  unions have spoken in favor of reducing subsidies on some state  products and services, eliminating undue free services,  increasing the prices of nonstaples, and offering social  security only to people who really need it.</p>

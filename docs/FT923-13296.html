			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Partners thank each other for the memory: The growing trend towards global alliances in the semiconductor industry Semiconductor memory chips have long been the subject of bitter trade tensions between the US, Japan and Europe. Now these crucial computer components are at the centre of a series of international collaborations as some of the world's largest electronics companies seek to share the rising costs of development and manufacturing. Two agreements announced yesterday are the latest examples of a growing trend to-wards international co-operation. First, International Business Machines of the US, Toshiba of Japan and Siemens of Germany have agreed jointly to develop 256-megabit dyn-amic random access memory (D-Ram) chips. Memory is the cornerstone of digital electronics. The reductions in cost and size together with increased reliability which can be achieved by compressing more memory on to a single chip are dramatic. As more of the added value in electronics comes from information stored in chips, larger memories contribute hugely to the development of a wide range of electronic products from 'personal assistants' to mobile phones. The second agreement yesterday, between Advanced Micro Devices of the US and Fujitsu of Japan will set up a joint venture to make 'flash' memory devices, which are expected eventually to replace the disk drive in personal computers. In spite of the fiercely independent and nationalistic nature of the semiconductor industry, manufacturers are being drawn into collaborative arrangements by the need to share both the escalating costs and the risks of remaining on the leading edge of semiconductor technology. 'The costs now exceed what any single company can bear,' said Mr Tsuyoshi Kawanishi, senior executive vice-president of Toshiba, a leading Japanese chip maker. This is particularly evident in the Dollars 7bn global D-Ram market, where the cost of development and manufacturing is soaring while prices are in a steep decline. With research and development of the 256MB D-Rams expected to exceed Dollars 1bn, the world's chip makers are looking for partners. The trend towards cross-border alliances was signalled last year when NEC, Japan's largest semiconductor maker, and AT&amp;T, the American telecommunications group, agreed to work together on advanced technology needed to develop 64MB D-Ram chips. Today, 16MB chips are the most advanced high-capacity devices commercially available, but 64MB chips should be ready in about two years. Hitachi of Japan and Texas Instruments of the US are also working together on future generations of D-Rams while IBM already has a D-Ram technology-sharing agreement with Siemens as well as a joint manufacturing alliance in France with Siemens. Toshiba similarly has links with Siemens, and in Japan with IBM. While yesterday's agreement between IBM, Siemens and Toshiba currently focuses on research and development, joint manufacturing would be a 'logical extension' of the alliance at some point in the future, Mr Jack Kuehler, president of IBM, acknowledges. Notably absent from the D-Ram venture are any of the rising stars of the Korean semiconductor industry which has become a big supplier of D-Rams over the past four years. However, the partnership may be open to additional participants. They could come from among competitors such as the Japanese companies NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu, and Samsung of Korea. Although sharing the huge costs of developing 256MB D-Ram technology is one advantage of the agreement, Mr Kuehler stressed that reducing risk was also a primary motivation. 'You have to make technology decisions before you are ready,' he said. The alliance brings a larger pool of expertise to bear on research work. The number of such alliances reflects the importance of D-Rams as a 'technology driver' and the size of the market. More important than the design of the D-Ram chip is the development of technology used to manufacture it. To achieve a density of 256m memory cells on a single chip will require shrinking the size of the circuit elements to just one quarter of a micron, about half the size of today's most advanced chips. This will require significant advances in materials and production eq-uipment, tools and processes. Once they are achieved, the technology will be applicable to all types of semiconductor devices. What are the commercial prospects for megachips? With prices for 4MB parts at rock bottom and huge overcapacity because of the recession, no semiconductor manufacturer is making money out of D-Rams at present. The semiconductor industry, however, is notorious for its 'boom to bust' commercial cycle. Manufacturers pour in research and development funds to develop a product which can be sold at a premium price. As the technology matures, prices fall. Manufacturers, therefore, have to cream off the profits in the early stages of a chip's life. The hope is that competition will reduce the number of players in the market, giving survivors a better chance of profitability. Entry into the emerging market for flash memories, devices that are eventually expected to replace disk drives as the data storage medium of choice in portable personal computers and facsimile machines, is also costly and involves considerable risk. 'In the future it will become increasingly difficult to succeed if a company is going to play by itself,' said Mr Hikotaro Masunaga, managing director at Fujitsu, yesterday. In many ways, the deal between Fujitsu and Advanced Micro Devices carries co-operation in the semiconductor industry furthest, and most clearly illustrates the reasons why companies are seeking partnerships. In very Japanese style, Fujitsu and AMD will purchase a small equity stake in each other. Mr W J Sanders, chairman of AMD, said he insisted on this because this would give Fujitsu, 20 times bigger than AMD, an interest in seeing AMD succeed. At the same time, the two companies will jointly spend Dollars 700m on a 50-50 joint venture to manufacture flash memory devices. AMD has the technology for flash memory devices, but lacks the resources to build on its own a facility of the scale required. Fujitsu, on the other hand, lacks the technology for flash memory. But it does have the expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, the capital to invest, and access to the Japanese market. By pooling resources, the two companies are able to contemplate a large-scale facility that will produce 20,000 eight-inch semiconductor wafers a month, thereby allowing for considerable economies of scale and setting a standard which the competition will have difficulty matching. 'You are going to see more and more alliances,' Mr Kuehler predicted. 'Alliances are the way of the future.' Whether these will be international depends upon where the centres of particular technological expertise lie, he suggested. 'The issues are skills, people and money, and ways to bring them together, whether that involves international agreements or not.'  ----------------------------------       BY COMPANY (PERCENT)               1991  ---------------------------------- Toshiba                   14.0 Samsung                   12.3 Hitachi                   10.2 NEC                       10.0 Fujitsu                    8.8 Texas Instruments          7.6 Mitsubishi                 7.0 Oki                        5.2 Micron Technology          4.8 Siemens                    3.8 Others                    16.3  ----------------------------------</p>

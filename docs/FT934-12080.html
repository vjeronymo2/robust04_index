			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A night of hype at the opera Sir, I was struck by David Murray's determinedly favourable review of the Wexford Festival production of the opera Zampa (October 19), echoing the conventional wisdom around the town. It was hyped up for me by the production team located in the row immediately behind where I sat in the Theatre Royal, laughing, clapping and stamping at the sheer ingenuity and vitality of it all. Indeed, it was quite a relief at the end that they left to bask in the curtain calls they had helped to generate. I rather shared the opinion of the lady accompanying a senior UK operator, overheard during the interval, who said the production was a cross between Gilbert and Sullivan and Hello, Hello. I fear the contrasting reticence of the note-taking producer of the Barber of Seville and her team sitting mutely in front of us the previous evening will result in an equally undeserved review - the cognoscenti in that case appearing to give it the thumbs down, without appreciating the quality and originality of the production. The producer, designers and general hangers-on should stay back stage during performances, failing which they should not indulge in what might, in other circumstances, be described as talking up the share price.

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / EC union proposals raise Delors' hackles LUXEMBOURG'S proposals on political union risk turning the Commission into a mere 'secretariat to the other (EC) institutions', Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, warned yesterday. At the same time, members of the European Parliament expressed fears that they would be given only a limited new role in the legislative process under the plans tabled by Luxembourg, which holds the European Community presidency, on Monday. The two attacks on the proposals revealed the deep-seated concerns of the two EC institutions about where democratic decision-making power will lie in a united Europe. The draft treaty on political union drawn up by Luxembourg proposes increasing the powers of the parliament by giving it the right of 'co-decision' with the Council of EC governments on certain legislation. At the moment the parliament's legislative role is principally advisory. It is the Commission in Brussels which initiates laws, and later attempts to broker compromises between member states and between the council and the parliament, which can propose amendments to legislation. The Commission is worried that it will be squeezed out of the legislative process altogether under the new proposals. 'How can one explain the willingness on the part of certain of the Community's founder members to weaken one of the institutions of the Treaty (of Rome) - the Commission?' asked Mr Delors, in yesterday's debate on the progress of the inter-governmental conference (IGC) on political union. MEPs concede that the Luxembourg proposals are superficially attractive for them, but they are worried because the draft limits the right to co-decision to a new category of EC act called 'laws'. These EC laws would deal with 'fundamental principles and general rules', undefined in the Luxembourg paper. Mr David Martin, British Labour MEP for Lothians and a member of the parliament's committee on institutional affairs, said after the debate: 'The draft treaty is better than we anticipated but that's only because our level of expectation was pretty low. It's far short of what parliament would accept in terms of treaty reform.' Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's foreign minister, apparently believes that the draft proposals would win the support of nine of the 12 member states. Although he has not named the dissenters they are thought to be the UK, Denmark, and either Ireland or Portugal.</p>

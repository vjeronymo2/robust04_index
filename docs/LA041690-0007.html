			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER COMBAT;  </P> <P> MILITARY: MARINES USE COST-EFFECTIVE ELECTRONIC WAR GAMES TO TRAIN COMMAND  OFFICERS FOR THE REAL THING.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. Bob Robichaud's men are dying somewhere and he's moving around in his  dusty command post, anxiously awaiting field reports.  </P> <P> He fidgets with his helmet's tight chin strap, chewing and spitting so much  tobacco juice on the ground that there's almost no safe place to step any more.  </P> <P> Robichaud's Marine battalion had been fighting elusive bands of guerrillas in  the Honduran countryside when a large enemy force suddenly began pushing up  from the south.  </P> <P> He ordered part of his battalion to rush south and block the enemy, but  something went wrong. A key bridge was blown, stalling the Marine's advance.  When the clash finally occurred, it was in a strategically weak position, far  from where the Marines had plotted to engage.  </P> <P> The field report was chilling as it came to Robichaud's cramped command post  over the radio: "We are all wounded or in hiding or KIA. Please advise."  </P> <P> A 40-man Marine platoon had been mauled, and, although the clash then broke  off, enemy troops were scurrying to flank the main Marine units and pass  northward to a key objective, a city where they could hold out in long  house-to-house combat.  </P> <P> The situation was critical, and it called for a harrowing, decisive command  decision.  </P> <P> Just the time to take a break. Talk about the day's events and maybe relax for  a spell. Wander over to the Coke machine or watch the plump black cat that  coyly meanders, quite unimpressed, through these tense proceedings.  </P> <P> You can do that when war is a game, serious, but still a game in which winning  and losing is less important than how well it's played.  </P> <P> Robichaud is real, right down to his beard stubble, dropped verb endings and  Red Man chewing tobacco. And his staff officers are real, too. But otherwise,  this is a battle using computer simulation and largely phantom forces.  </P> <P> More Camp Pendleton command staffs are training this way as the new stability  in Europe brings military budget cuts that have persuaded the top brass to rely  on cheaper ways to teach war.  </P> <P> This program is called the Tactical Warfare Simulation Evaluation Analysis  System, and the man who runs it, Lt. Col. Hugh O'Donnell Jr., figures the  paltry $150 cost for a battalion-level staff exercise is far less expensive  than turning a 900-man Marine battalion out for maneuvers.  </P> <P> "It costs money to take people out into the field," he said.  </P> <P> The system was used nine times in the last fiscal year, but with the changing  budgetary climate, O'Donnell expects 20 exercises this year.  </P> <P> While the computer is vintage 1960s technology, O'Donnell said a faster, more  sophisticated system is due in mid-1992.  </P> <P> The greater emphasis on computer simulation reflects another peacetime reality  -- with the Vietnam War over for 15 years, most Marine officers and senior  sergeants with combat experience have left the corps.  </P> <P> O'Donnell and Robichaud believe the computer-aided exercises come closer than  anything to real war, even though the stage for these exacting military mind  games is fairly simple.  </P> <P> At a scruffy and remote part of Camp Pendleton is a tight group of trailers  that contain the Marines who maneuver the troops, fire the artillery and  mortars, wage air combat, handle intelligence, and manage logistics for the  unit being tested.  </P> <P> About 100 feet away is the command post for the Marine battalion command staff,  whose leader, a lieutenant colonel like Robichaud, decides what skills will be  tested and sets up the tactical situation.  </P> <P> The "enemy" has its own command post in a trailer, and the commander is a  member of O'Donnell's staff, an intelligence officer who knows how foreign  armies fight and gives the Marines a realistic challenge.  </P> <P> Two opposing commanders decide the moves, and the computer simulates the  outcome. For example, the Marine leader may launch an attack with ground forces  supported by aircraft. But the enemy might shoot down the aircraft and cut off  the Marines from retreat.  </P> <P> The computer outlines the situation to the Marine commander, forcing him to  then consider options such as how to resupply the trapped Marines, evacuate  them or get a relief force through to them.  </P> <P> Through these weeklong exercises, Marine commanders improve their tactical  decisions, staffs learn to work together, and the unit's readiness is  evaluated.  </P> <P> "We want people to come out here and feel they can make mistakes and innovate,"  O'Donnell said. "We don't give a unit commander a report card."  </P> <P> The computer simulation hasn't done away with full-scale maneuvers, during  which a commander's performance is put under a microscope, but the war game  gives a command staff intense intellectual batting practice without using mass  troops.  </P> <P> Last week , Robichaud, commander of the Third Battalion, First Marine Regiment,  took about 65 actual Marines and a phantom force of 1,600 into a mock battle in  Honduras, where the Marines have conducted operations.  </P> <P> Robichaud, a serious, courtly man with 20 years in the Marines, has put his  staff through long days and some sleepless nights to realistically practice  what he calls "the little things that make the difference."  </P> <P> He's not as interested in smashing the enemy commander as in having his staff  master the critical basics of military operations. Those include staging an  orderly advance, gathering and using accurate information, and making sound  decisions.  </P> <P> "What's important to me is procedure," said Robichaud, who, like his staff, is  dressed in battle gear to create the mood. The simulation is "the most  effective and efficient way to train a staff."  </P> <P> Soon, Robichaud and his battalion are in combat with guerrillas in the Honduran  countryside and have the situation under control until he learns that a large  enemy force is moving up from the south.  </P> <P> The Marines race south, hoping to confront the enemy before they advance far  enough to take control of a city. But the bridge is blown, the Marines meet the  foe in the wrong place, and the chaos of battle reigns.  </P> <P> The enemy commander, 1st Lt. John Lutkenhouse of O'Donnell's team, watches the  fight as depicted on a computer screen.  </P> <P> "If he can stop my advance he's achieving his mission," Lutkenhouse said. "If I  can draw away from his main force (and reach the city), I'm achieving mine."  </P> <P> In the trailer where Robichaud's company commanders are transmitting battle  reports, the action picks up, and suddenly it's not at all like a game.  </P> <P> Company commanders have panic and frustration in their voices as they report  that the enemy is trying a flanking maneuver around the Marines. Within  moments, the room begins to smell of sweating bodies in camouflage.  </P> <P> (Enemy commander Lutkenhouse takes satisfaction in the Marines having detected  and communicated to base that he is trying to flank them. "The fact they  figured it shows they're using their intelligence and anticipating my moves,"  he said.)  </P> <P> There's also tension back at Robichaud's command post as the reports on enemy  movements come in. Robichaud tells a visitor, almost good-naturedly, "go ahead,  I'm shot. The executive officer is running things for awhile."  </P> <P> Robichaud's operation's officer, Capt. E.C. Holt, is examining the battle maps  and complaining about inaccurate field reports that caused delays. This may be  a game, but, Holt observed, "it's got all the friction you can handle."  </P> <P> This was Robichaud's third simulation, and he remarked, "the troops really get  into it hot and heavy. They're real competitive, but that's not the purpose."  </P></p>

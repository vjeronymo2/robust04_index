			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Alberto Fujimori by Guido Lombardi </F> at the Panamericana Television studios in Lima on the "Panorama"  program -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Lombardi] Engineer Fujimori,  Peru is about to commemorate your fourth year in power. How do  you feel about it? Are you tired of exercising power?    [Fujimori] No. Do you think I look tired? [laughs] I am  enthusiastic. I like what I do. I am feeling increasingly  energetic and want to resolve problems. One of the things I  like to do best is to face problems. I do not know if this is  explicitly stated in the book written by [name indistinct]. We  have overcome some of the macroeconomic and terrorist problems  and are now concentrating on social issues, like fighting  poverty.    [Lombardi] Will this be your priority issue in the last year  of your term?    [Fujimori] A few months ago we adopted specific measures in  this regard. Perhaps some critics ignore this and I am sure  they are unaware of it because they never go where these actions  take place. There is still a lot to be done, not just next year  but also in the years to come.    [Lombardi] Are you announcing that you will seek reelection?    [Fujimori] That is not what I meant. Presidents must seek  the well-being of people and this entails a process. Some say I  am campaigning but this is what presidents should do. I would  say that all future presidents should constantly work toward  achieving this goal, not just at cocktail parties and at the  social level.    [Lombardi] Well then, I will pose my question more directly:  Engineer Fujimori will you seek reelection?    [Fujimori] I believe this is the fourth time you have asked  me the same question. [laughs]    [Lombardi] But we are 12 months away from the presidential  elections...    [Fujimori, interrupting] I believe it would be good for the  country if these electoral issues were set aside for the time  being. We should address electoral issues only as election time  gets near because the country needs people to work hard. If we  distract our attention with electoral issues, we will be unable  to do a good job.    I will continue to exercise my duties as president. I have  not yet announced my candidacy and I am still not a  fully-fledged candidate.    [Lombardi] Were you referring to anyone in particular when  you said that future presidents and eventual presidential  candidates should be working in the field and not at the  cocktail party level? Whom were you referring to...    [Fujimori, interrupting] I was not thinking about anyone in  particular...    [Lombardi, interrupting] There is no one...    [Fujimori, interrupting] No, but that was the traditional  way  the issue was handled. Was it not?    [Lombardi] No official candidacies have yet been announced.  You have not announced your candidacy and no one has announced  it either. But there are some obvious candidacies. What are  your views on this? Whom would you like to run against next  year? On 15 May [1995], Peru will have elected a new  president...    [Fujimori, interrupting] Yes, if I decide to run, that is...    [Lombardi, interrupting] If you decide to do so...    [Fujimori, interrupting] If I run. [laughs] It makes no  difference to me at all. I believe...    [Lombardi, interrupting] Do you think Perez de Cuellar would  be a good candidate?    [Fujimori] Well, I would like to see him here in Peru. Only  then we will be able to assess the situation and his  possibilities of leading Peru. I believe protagonists must be  at the site of events not abroad.    [Lombardi] The fact that he is not here does not mean we  cannot make an assessment...    [Fujimori, interrupting] That is perfectly fine. I also  believe it is not good for the country to be abroad for a long  period of time, particularly when handling national issues --  more specifically regarding the war on poverty. One must be on  site to know the situation first hand. It is one thing to see  the issues from Government House and another completely  different issue to see the situation in (?Piquichaca) or  (?Ancaray), which I visited today. The problems are viewed in a  completely different light. To see how terrorism had destroyed  these towns and the simple solutions that can be found. This  can only be done at the site of events.    [Lombardi] Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont is a potential  presidential candidate who is here in Peru and who is trying to  resolve problems affecting Lima. Apparently you dislike him and  even at the government level you have blocked any possible  solutions that Belmont has come up with to resolve problems  affecting Lima.    [Fujimori] The government has adopted technical measures  seeking to decentralize power and this is being increasingly  understood by people.    [Lombardi] What are your views on (?Fidel Montes) as a  presidential candidate?    [Fujimori] Well, they have announced their candidacies and I  hope many others will do the same. It is not just a question of  these two personalities, but of other mayors as well ...    [Lombardi, interrupting] Former mayors...    [Fujimori, interrupting] Another candidacy was announced  today. All this will be very lively. But we should leave all  this activity for next year.    [Lombardi] Not that long because the candidacies must be  registered by October and the campaigns must be launched ...    [Fujimori, interrupting] Yes, but the elections will be held  in April. Let me remind you that I started to move only by  March.    [Lombardi] Let us talk about [pauses] ... but you will not  be  an unknown candidate like in 1990.    [Fujimori] No, of course not. [laughs] But you are implying  that I am going to be a candidate.    [Lombardi] Let us discuss an issue which you have said will  be your main concern this year -- social problems, an area that  has greatly benefited from the resources obtained from  privatizations. These huge resources were unthought of a few  months ago. How will you spend these resources and how will  people, the media, and Congress follow how these sources will be  used?    [Fujimori] Never before this century have resources been so  well invested. The savings that have been made by using these  sources are tangible. I would like to give a couple of examples:    We saved over $100 million in an irrigation project. Imagine  the significance of $100 million. I can build 300 schools with  it.    [Lombardi] What project are you referring to?    [Fujimori] Chabimochic.    [Lombardi] But that means that the project was totally  overvalued.    [Fujimori] Ah, there are works that were overvalued, others  [word indistinct], and still others were incomplete. The  Chimbote dock, for example, was overvalued. Fancy spending $19  million to build a dock that is useless.    Look how we spent our resources. There was a long  discussion and a campaign was launched criticizing the purchase  of patrol cars. I read in one newspaper that this project was a  crooked deal, that certain brands were to be preferred over  others. That is not true. The bid was awarded to a given brand  and we are purchasing Japanese pickup trucks to be used as  patrol cars, with power steering, at $10,600...    [Lombardi, interrupting] And the example set by some  municipal districts such as [words indistinct]?    [Fujimori] No. Sorry, we are only talking about one  example. I take the example of the patrol cars because I think  the people will understand it better. We purchased ambulances  for social projects. For this we purchased new Toyota (?Hiway)  vans delivered to Callao Port at $10,500. We are paying $7,600  for that type of vehicle that will be used as patrol cars.    Tell me what other government has paid that kind of prices.  This is why I maintain that our resources are not ill-spent. I  am concerned about campaigns forecasting the misuse of  resources. Usually behind these demoralizing campaigns someone  is trying to get the government to acquire this or that brand.  But we do not put up with this sort of thing. I think it is  quite clear how the government uses funds for social programs.  For example, we have CONADE [National Development Corporation].  Just look at all the electrification, potable water, and sewage  projects it has carried out in the shantytowns. As one example  I want to mention that soon I will visit a settlement in  Manzanares, in Huachos, which has existed for 40 years without  potable water or sewage systems. In Cerro San Cristobal, there  are still some people who still do not have potable water,  sewage systems, or electricity. Therefore, there is still a lot  for CONADE to do and I am certain that the social projects are  being administered efficiently.    [Lombardi] Mr. President, to talk about the good or bad use  of resources does not necessarily entail corruption or paying  more for what can be purchased for less. Sometimes it refers to  where the resources are used. You said the $100 million that  was saved in the Chabimochic project could be invested in  building a whole lot of schools. But is building schools all  that is necessary to improve the quality of the education  program in Peru or should we invest significant quantities in  training teachers, increasing teachers' salaries, etc.?    [Fujimori] Now we are talking about education?    [Lombardi] Just as an example. Just an example of what is  regarded as a good or bad use of resources.    [Fujimori] Before referring to this subject, in which I am  very interested, I want to mention that in the social field, for  example, this government has the cooperation of the Armed  Forces, the Army to build neighborhood roads. Recently we  purchased machinery worth $40 million, with a credit granted by  Eximbank of Japan, which will be used to build neighborhood  roads and second and third level highways. This is a special  program. We are also building health centers as part of the  social program.    In the education field, it has been said that I only think  about education in terms of laying one brick on top of another.  First, I want to tell those who criticize me that they are not  acquainted with the Peruvian education system, that they are not  aware of the real situation in Peru. Probably because, out of  fear of the Shining Path or acts of violence, they have not  visited shantytowns like Jose Carlos Mariategui, or [names  indistinct], to mention some.    To talk about education and maintain that this or the other  aspect must be improved is fine, but in the meantime where do  the children and teachers go? To thatch roof huts and sit on a  pile of bricks? This is one aspect we are correcting. We must  improve teacher training and salaries, we must supply books,  shoes, and even buses to the poorest sectors. The government is  doing this. Do you know that for the first time in 20 years we  have held a massive training program from which 45,000 teachers  benefited. All this is being tackled in a comprehensive manner  and this is why I believe people are wrong to criticize the  building of schools. Wherever I go I meet crowds of children  demanding a school, and they have every right to do so. We may  have to build 5,000 schools in the next few years. As you may  have seen, every Sunday there is a whole page of the newspapers  calling for bids for the construction of 20 schools. Just take a  look at yesterday's EXPRESO issue and you will find a call for  bids for the construction of 20 schools, next Sunday another 20  schools. This is one of the aspects of the social program which  is, undoubtedly, very important.    [Lombardi] Regarding the social program expenditures, the  Ministry of the Presidency is one of the sectors in charge of  administrating the expenditures of the social program. Do you  think someone like Minister Raul Vittor, who is accused of being  involved with someone who is sought by Peruvian justice, should  handle this?    [Fujimori] The charges have not been proven.    [Lombardi] No.    [Fujimori] If this were the case, then I should be removed  also because there are hundreds of charges against me. Do you  remember, during the campaign? Well...    [Lombardi, interrupting] The relationship could be  legitimate.    [Fujimori] Of course. The Ministry of the Presidency was  created precisely so the important resources be administered by  the Presidency of the Republic. I must say that in this regard  I am very distrustful. I could not bear all those resources  scattered everywhere without an effective supervision of the  expenditures by the executive branch. Experience has shown us  that the resources are being used in a very rational manner and  with the best social and economic results.    [Lombardi] Does this mean you are satisfied with Vittor's  performance.    [Fujimori] So far, I am not only satisfied with Minister  Vittor's performance but also with all heads of the various  sectors, that is, of the National Prisons Institute, National  Compensation and Social Development Fund, National Housing Fund,  the infrastructure minister, and all my ministers, whom, let me  tell you, I call my managers because they are the managers of  the government's policies.    [Lombardi] Somewhere we read that you call yourself general  manager. Sandro Fuentes, for example, is an excellent manager,  he did an excellent job...    [Fujimori, interrupting] But he tendered his resignation for  personal reasons. By the way, some believe a businessman should  be elected for this post but I disagree because what the country  needs is a greater collection of revenues. Therefore, we need  someone neutral so that the amount of revenues collected may  grow. Moreover, revenues come from the business sector.    [Lombardi] Would not you like Sandro Fuentes, whom you know  is an efficient person, in another cabinet post?    [Fujimori] I have not even thought about this possibility.  Probably [words indistinct].    [Lombardi] President Fujimori, one extremely important issue  -- you have always granted it particular importance -- is the  national pacification process. During the past few days in  Lima, obviously not with the same magnitude of the past, there  seems to be a new terrorist outbreak. There have been a few  detonated petards and bombs that have only damaged windows.  Nevertheless, it is worrisome. How does the government view  these incidents; what intelligence information on the issue do  you have?    [Fujimori] This is only normal because the Shining Path,  which is at death's door, is trying to make itself noticed with  this type of violent actions. The situation is under control.  We have the military front, particularly in the rural jungle  zone and also in the urban zones keeping close track of  terrorists. The citizenry must clearly understand that the war  has not ended. We must not be over optimistic. The war will  continue until 1995. There will be certain actions around 18  May, which marks the date on which they began their attacks.  But the important thing is the progress we have made. You have  not asked me about the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]  because, subconsciously, you have forgotten about them. That is  what will happen. Gradually we will progress in this struggle  against terrorism and the people may rest assured that we are  acting with determination, effectively against the Shining Path.  There is no turning back.    [Lombardi] We must not forget we are still at war, that the  war has not ended. Maybe you are partially responsible for this  lack of concern, convincing us that we will defeat the MRTA and  the Shining Path.    [Fujimori] I said I was going to defeat them in 1993. We are  already behind schedule. We are still missing two Shining Path  leaders. A couple of weeks ago the police arrested important  members, right? They are members of the Shining Path national  executive council.    [Lombardi] By the way, some Chileans have been sentenced  for treason to the fatherland. There is concern among  congressmen. The other day, we talked with Chilean Congressman  Pizarro, the president of Foreign Affairs Committee of the  Chilean Chamber of Deputies, who asked us how Chileans can be  sentenced for treason to the fatherland in Peru. He asked: Was  it a mistake?    [Fujimori] No, that was simply the name of the charge. It  could have been called, let us say, treason to regional  security. It is currently being described in a bill. Those  Chilean terrorists committed a crime which is described as  treason to the fatherland. Now, let us not forget that Castillo  Petruzzi and his group kidnapped and held several people hostage  in filthy cells, and they even murdered several of them. That is  why I -- I think this television channel is seen in Chile -- am  here addressing all Chileans, who should thank us. Those  outlaws are now in Peru. They are very safe, sentenced to life  without any possibility of escape. Imagine if they were  released in 15 or 20 years. It would be terrible. They would  be a threat.    [Lombardi] You referred to the military fronts that operate  in rural zones. Let us talk about the Huallaga region. What  were the objectives of Operation Scorpion Three.    [Fujimori] Two objectives. One was to eliminate, eradicate,  any final Shining Path strongholds that may exist in the  Huallaga region. At the same time, the Army is working in the  (hills) in the Ene Valley where the Shining Path has been  entrenched since 1984 and where they captured Ashaninka Indians.  The intention is to first eradicate them and then to send the  settlers and the natives back home.    [Lombardi] Have these objectives been met? How long will it  take?    [Fujimori] Near the Bolson Cuchara Valley -- by the way it  is  the place where the [words indistinct] (escaped) -- but we will  find him for sure. I hope that within a month we will have a  [word indistinct]. Many deserters are surrendering [word  indistinct] from the war. Within a month, the area will be  clean. But this does not mean totally clean. This is where the  Shining Path members who killed more than 50 people in Matucana  came from.    [Lombardi] It was like a Shining Path shelter...    [Fujimori, interrupting] It was a fortress.    [Lombardi] You said war is war. Evidently excesses are  committed during a war, and innocent people may die. Charges of  human rights violations in the Huallaga region have been raised.  Do you think excesses could have taken place? Are you willing  to investigate? Are the Armed Forces willing to punish those  who committed excesses?    [Fujimori] I do not rule out that some mistakes could have  happened. I do not rule that out. That should be thoroughly  investigated. Responsibilities must be determined, but ...    [Lombardi, interrupting] Mistakes like these affect local  victims and national security. They affect us at the  international level. An investigation should be carried out and  solved by someone trustworthy and credible.    [Fujimori] There are several organizations with jurisdiction  in this subject. They should be international organizations.  For example, I can mention the congressional human rights  organization, the attorney general's office, and any other  organization that wants to investigate the subject. But let us  not repeat mistakes of the past. The Shining Path committed  some crimes which were blamed on the Army and the police. We  have had several of those cases. We are very strict in this.  We cannot fold our arms and ...    [Lombardi, interrupting] [question indistinct]    [Fujimori] We agree that the civilian population must be  respected. There has been a radical change in the strategy of  the antiterrorist struggle because the instructions given to the  police and the Armed Forces is to first provide support for the  population so that ...    [Lombardi, interrupting] Are those instructions still in  force?    [Fujimori] Yes, those instructions are still valid.    [Lombardi] I have unconfirmed information that the military  troops in the Huallaga region are 17 or 18 year-old recruits?  There are not many, I heard there is a 300-strong battalion.  Why was this task assigned to such young men who lack  experience and may get jittery, and not to troops with  experience in the antisubversive struggle?    [Fujimori] We do not have professional troops. Our troops  are young men who, according to the law, start their mandatory  military service at the age of 18. There are also some  volunteers who are not minors. They are trained and commanded  by capable officers. I must clarify something: It is very easy  to be sitting on the sofa at home, watching television while our  military men and soldiers are in the jungle at the risk of being  the target of a bazooka or of stepping on a mine. We must  clearly recognize the effort being carried out by our national  police and Armed Forces. To whom do we owe the success of the  economic program, peace, and a social program? We owe it to  them, to the peasant self defense patrols, and to the people who  fought terrorism, sacrificing their lives. How many of our Armed  Forces are now handicapped?    When people talk to me about human rights I tell them I  defend the human rights -- you can see for yourself in our  prisons, which are the best in Latin America -- of those who  defend the human rights of 22 million Peruvians. Do you recall  any article published by international human rights organization  on atrocities committed by the Shining Path and the MRTA? I  have not read any. That is why I began an international  campaign in 1992 to make the human rights of our people be known.    [Lombardi] Apparently your campaign has been successful  because Amnesty International has begun to ...    [Fujimori, interrupting] Ah yes, it began to report on it as  of May or June 1992.    [Lombardi] (Pierre Same), the secretary general of Amnesty  International has come to Peru. The justice minister has said  you will not receive him. Why not? Given that Amnesty  International has reported on human rights violations committed  by insurrectional groups?    [Fujimori] Groups are free to carry out the investigation  they want. We have total freedom in this country. Even  International Red Cross inspectors can go into our prisons.    [Lombardi] But the Red Cross has not been allowed to enter  in  the Huallaga Region.    [Fujimori] I believe that impasse has been overcome. There  is total freedom to carry out investigations. I wonder if, for  example in other countries, the president receives  representatives of human rights organizations? Does President  Clinton receive them?. I do not think so. We are a sovereign  country in this aspect. But the country is open to any  investigation. Our government is defending the people's human  rights.    [Lombardi] President Fujimori, to ensure that the Armed  Forces effort in defeating subversion is totally and unanimously  recognized, other facts should take place. For example, the  arrest of Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, also known as Vaticano.  It was said that some Armed Forces officers stationed in  trafficking zones are linked with traffickers. Names were  given. What investigations are being carried out? How many  officers have been arrested? Do you think that given the great  power of drug trafficking, some personnel, not the whole  institution -- no one is accusing the Armed Forces or the  Peruvian Army -- but some officers could have been tempted by  the traffickers?    [Fujimori] Of course, that is human. Some have been tempted.  That is why the Military Supreme Court has sentenced several  officers for the crime of drug trafficking. These cases have  taken place. A few were tried in civilian courts. Demetrio  Chavez Penaherrera was charged for two crimes: Terrorism and  trafficking. If a civilian court tried him for drug trafficking,  where would he be right now? We would be saying that he is in  such and such place, or that he escaped from prison, or that he  is still being tried and that there is a risk that he may  escape. Now he can be tried and asked which military officers  are involved. Why can we ask him that? Because he is in a safe  prison, serving a 25 or 30 year sentence. [words indistinct]  had he been tried by a civilian court, I doubt he would still be  in our hands.    [Lombardi] Just like the case of Manrique.    Before discussing the letter of intent with the IMF, and  because people say we journalists are very sensitive about our  rights, I would like to ask you to comment on reports that you  allegedly forced a member of the international press, who  accompanied you on a trip to Puno, to erase a video tape  containing a recording of your visit to the (?Llamamallo) jail.  What happened in Puno?    [Fujimori] That report is correct because the recording  contained a diatribe by a female Shining Path member. We will  not allow the Shining Path to make rallying speeches. That was  feasible before when the media were compelled to broadcast video  and audio tapes containing calls of the so-called armed struggle.    The government will not lose such an important front as is  the psychological war. I believe Peru has the right to adopt  all the strategies it sees fit in this war. Aside from all  these issues, I believe that the achievement of peace is above  everything less...    [Lomabardi, interrupting] Mr. President...    [Fujimori, interrupting] As for freedom of the press, I  respect it and uphold complete freedom of speech.    [Lombardi] Well, here you are to exercise that same right.    [Fujimori] [words indistinct]    [Lombardi] This past week, the government published a letter  of intent with the IMF and a few days later the annexes.    [Fujimori] Correct.    [Lombardi] Some say this is merely protocol because the  content of the letter includes details of an extensive  negotiating process that lasted several months which cannot be  altered no matter what criticisms and opinions may be expressed  in the next few days. This is one interpretation of the issue,  the other interpretation is even more bold.    Some allege you do not want to sign the letter of intent,  that you want to gain time, and that you will use these opinions  to justify your not signing it. They allege you do not want to  sign it because it restricts the use of funds in social projects  to 650 million [currency not specified] and that you want to  spend more than that in the election year. What is the truth  behind the publication of this letter? Why was the letter of  intent published?    [Fujimori] The publication of the letter of intent before  its  signing is in keeping with what was ordered by the Central  Reserve Bank and the economy minister. I want to note the  importance of such a publication. These letters of intent are  normally drafted secretly and kept under cover because of  certain fears.    First, the guidelines of the economic program and its  objectives are clearly specified. Let us suppose we are unable  to amend it, but if we are a truly sovereign state we can do so  by specifying which clauses we want to amend [word indistinct].    I have to admit that although neither Central Reserve Bank  Chairman German Suarez or Economy Minister Jorge Camet are  members of the military, I have quote, ordered, unquote,  [chuckles] them not to sign the letter of intent until a  consensus is achieved.    We were about to sign it sometime ago, but I was  dissatisfied  with some terms particularly regarding the use in social  programs of resources realized from privatizations. But we have  to sign this letter of intent sometime in the future. It will  not be beneficial for Peru to refuse to sign. Peru has to sign  it...    [Lombardi, interrupting] But IPAE [expansion unknown]  Chairman [name indistinct] has said Peru should not sign.    [Fujimori] I am surprised that a businessman should adopt  such a stance. Perhaps he has ties with the previous  administration...    [Lombardi interrupting] No, he is a young man and [words  indistinct].    [Fujimori] Anyway, if Peru signs the letter of intent, we  will have a technical endorsement from the highest international  financial institution. With the letter of intent approved by  the IMF we will have the IMF's support. This would allow us to  request concessions and pardons from the Paris Club or request  say $100 million from the World Bank for social stability  programs. It is a fundamental endorsement.    Now, even [pauses] after 5 April, everyone unanimously  supported the reinsertion of Peru. Do you remember?    [Lombardi] Absolutely.    [Fujimori] We will achieve our reinsertion by signing the  letter of intent...    [Lombardi, interrupting] But two years after Peru's  reinsertion, Peruvians have started to wonder. It is true the  agreements achieved with the IMF have allowed us to pay and to  receive funds.    President Fujimori, when you assumed power in 1990 you  inherited a foreign debt totalling $19 billion. Today, after  paying part of it through the great effort of all Peruvians,  this debt has risen to $24 billion -- and this is without having  contracted any new debts because we basically paid interest  rates. In view of this, does it make sense to continue paying?    [Fujimori] There will come a point beyond which we will not  make such large disbursements. A good part of this hike in the  foreign debt was caused by interest rates contracted by previous  administrations. This is why we are paying so much interest.  Suppose the debt totals $20 billion. If we add only 10  percent, we will be throwing away $2 billion.    We must strive to reduce debt servicing. This is why we need  a letter of intent. This must be followed by a reduction in the  servicing of the foreign debt, and a condoning of our debt with  international banks. All this entails a process. Let us  discuss the Brady Plan.    Friends, the Brady Plan consists of the following: Peru owes  $6 billion to international banks, this in addition to interest.  Through the Brady Plan, Peru can refinance...    [Lombardi, interrupting] But at lower interest rates...    [Fujimori, continues] ... but condoning an important chunk  of  the debt. Suppose that after negotiations we are able to  condone 50 percent of our debt, that is, instead of a $6  billion-debt we will have a $3 billion-debt. We pay a part of  the remaining $3 billion and the rest is paid over 30 years.  This is a way of reducing the servicing of the debt.    [Lombardi] Mr. President, experts are concerned about some  aspects of the letter of intent while the majority are concerned  about other issues. For example, people say that tax revenues  should be 12.1 percent and that if this is not achieved  corrective measures will be adopted. I get goose pimples  because this is tantamount to more taxes.    [Fujimori] Well, it is those who pay taxes who should worry.    [Lombardi] Do you pay taxes?    [Fujimori] Yes I do and I believe the majority of Peruvians,  at least those with an income, pay taxes. A 12.1 percent tax  revenue is low. It is low because we should not think only from  the point of view of those who pay taxes but in terms of those  who benefit from these revenues. If we increase tax revenues --  and this is not necessarily achieved by creating more taxes or  by increasing tax rates -- it means the government will have  more resources to build schools, roads, running water systems,  sewage systems, and energy systems.    This is why the government seeks to achieve a tax revenue  totalling 12.1 percent of the GDP. Neither you nor businessmen,  however, should worry, Mr. Lombardi, because you will not pay  more taxes. Right now tax revenues total 12.7 percent of the  GDP...    [Lombardi, interrupting] But that is...    [Fujimori continues]... which means the current tax revenue  is higher...    [Lombardi, interrupting] So, we have already achieved the  objective...    [Fujimori, interrupting] Of course.    [Lombardi] This is confusing. For example, there is talk of  an increase in the GDP of 4.5 percent. But all economic  indicators -- and even the economy minister has confirmed this  -- show that the economic growth in 1994 is estimated at about 7  percent, if not more. What is the reasoning behind these low  figures?    [Fujimori] The letter of intent was drafted a few months  back  and only one of its articles, the one pertaining to the use of  resources obtained from privatizations, was negotiated. Let me  remind you that in the beginning we were talking about $250  million plus $200 million, and now we are talking about $250  million and up to $876 million. There is, therefore, a little  imbalance but we are achieving the macroeconomic goals. In  other words, we will not create more taxes because of this  clause. In view of the tax reform we now have only four taxes:  income tax, tariffs, General Sales Tax and consumer tax. We  have rationalized taxes.    [Lombardi] Just one final thing on the letter of intent. It  is very surprising that a president from an agricultural  background -- a farmer, a former Agrarian University rector --  has left aside the agricultural issue. For example, there have  been reports that the agriculture surtax will be repealed in the  next few years and the agriculture reactivation program was left  aside. What do you have to say to all this?    [Fujimori] We have defended the agriculture surtax in  arduous  negotiations with the Inter-American Development Bank and we  have publicly stated that we rejected this precondition. There  will be a surtax until 1976 ...    [Lombardi, interrupting] You mean 1996.    [Fujimori] I mean 1996 [chuckles]. In 1997, the new  government will have to renegotiate this but it will depend on  international agriculture prices. Agriculture has been  protected as never before. There are no subsidies...    [Lombardi, interrupting]...direct subsidies...    [Fujimori, continues] ...but the agriculture policy seeks to  maintain certain prices within a given bracket, with a flexible  surtax, so that if there is a sharp drop in international prices  of, let us say, rice prices, we will increase the surtax. In  view of this, rice farmers -- except for seasonal reasons -- are  guaranteed a minimum profit.    [Lombardi] Will you fulfill the privatizations timetable in  the year that is left of your administration? There have been  successes, some failures, and it has faded out at times, but do  you believe you will complete the privatization process by July  1995?    [Fujimori] I refuse to assess it in terms of success or  failure. There have been more successes than anything else. If  we make a final balance we can say that the privatization  process has been successful...    [Lombardi, interrupting] Absolutely, on balance it has been  successful. I did not mean failures, I meant temporary  frustrations. (?I was not generalizing.) What happened with  Centromin Peru [Central Peru Mining Enterprise] was not a  failure, more a frustration.    [Fujimori] No. Centromin Peru was not undervalued as people  alleged, it was just that, of the 40 or 50 bidders, no one dared  to bid the $280 million plus the $60 million needed to cover the  debt. It was not that undervalued.    But on balance, the privatization process has been  successful. Four years after its implementation, I believe I am  entitled to say that we had a good [word indistinct], a good  privatization timetable within the framework of the integral  development program because we intensified the privatization  process after achieving domestic stability, otherwise we could  have auctioned them...    [Lombardi, interrupting] Of course...    [Fujimori continues]... therefore, we will continue at the  same pace but always looking for the best prices. Look at the  $68 million we got for (?CementoYura); look at National  Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru. By the way I cannot  imagine what it must be like to receive $2 billion. [chuckles]    [Lombardi] There are those who will not believe it until  they  see the check.    [Fujimori] Ah well, I am one of them because I stand by St.  Thomas saying: Seeing is believing.    [Lombardi] We will have to wait until 17 May to verify this.    [Fujimori] But I trust the Spanish Telephone Company, it is  a  very serious company.    [Lombardi] Former President Alan Garcia's father has just  passed away. Had it been up to you, would you have authorized  former President Garcia to attend his father's funeral and  offered him guarantees that he would not be arrested?    [Fujimori] Yes. Instructions were given that if the former  president arrived, no measures were to be adopted against him.  This I believe went a little against the trial proceedings.    [Lombardi] President Fujimori, thank you very much for your  willingness to hold such a long interview on the Panorama  program tonight. We are all impatiently waiting for 17 May at  noon, when the Spanish Telephone Company will deposit a  $2-billion check. Thank you very much.    [Fujimori] Thank you very much and I know this will be a new  milestone in the history of Peru's development. Thank you and  good night.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (8): Evolution rather than revolution - Cable telephony / What's happening IN the brave new world of deregulated, liberalised, privatised and competitive telecommunications, many new services and applications are the direct result of actual market demand. The days are long gone when a monolithic PTT could present a captive business user base with an expensive new technological development that might have no relevance to real market needs. Today, business users judge the potential of telecoms applications in terms of just what practical benefit they can bring to their organisations. They can choose from a plethora of new technologies, all with their attendant benefits and some occasional, and rather less well-publicised, disadvantages. Telecoms and datacoms are converging to the point where it is difficult to tell them apart. It is now possible to have digital audio, video and data applications delivered straight to the desk-top via the public switched telephone network, a PBX, leased lines, microwave links, satellites, fibre optics, radio and Lans, Mans or Wans. However, despite the strong growth of broadband fibre optic cabled systems, most telecommunication still goes over copper wire at some point during its transmission. Many of the new technologies have been designed to provide enhanced bandwidth on existing cables and a big attraction is that they protect the large investments already made in conventionally cabled infrastructures. For example, High Speed Digital Subscriber Loop (HDSL) enables 1.544Mbit/s to be delivered over existing copper pair wires and industry analysts believe that such services will find a ready market in Europe. Regulatory issues are forestalling the development of the pan-European and cross-border carrier systems that are vital to development of business in the European single market. Very Small Aperture Terminal (Vsat) and other satellites services have been particularly badly affected. Practical Lan-to-Lan and Lan-to-Wan interconnect applications are very popular in business and there has been a concerted drive throughout the EC to deploy frame relay services for packet switched data communications. In fact, frame relay, a relatively simple and inexpensive broadband technology, is seen as a viable long-distance data carrier for pan-European corporate networks in the very near future. ISDN, on the other hand, long touted as the ideal universal telecommunications solution, has not yet proved to be as popular as expected. Take-up of the basic rate service has been slow and, until recently, there were very few ISDN products on the market. Nevertheless, ISDN has made possible the development of intelligent cell processing software in switches and advanced signalling systems such as C7, DASS and DPNSS. In 1988, the CCITT published the basic principles of broadband networking; B-ISDN. The main feature of the B-ISDN concept is the support of a wide range of audio, video, data and image applications on the same network. The target transfer mode for broadband ISDN is the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) a technique whereby digitised information is inserted in small, fixed-length cells for transmission and switching through a network. ATM, a derivative of fast packet switching technology, can carry all types of information in a common format and provide the high throughput needed for emerging broadband applications. Potentially enormous matrix-style cell switches, which do not suffer the bandwidth constraints imposed by shared media switching techniques, can be built to handle multi-media traffic. The time taken for Lan devices to process data is called latency. ATM can handle real-time signals with close-to-zero latency because the switch reads the packet address and sends it to its correct destination, probably before the end of the message has even left the originating device. Sheer speed such as this allows ATM to handle delay-sensitive traffic such as voice and video, as well as data. ATM is on trial throughout Europe now and indications are that it meets current communications needs, can carry the new video and multi-media applications well and also has the sufficient potential to cope with any likely future services. Another technology is Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) which is a new flexible transmission standard defined by the CCITT. It defines a new type of frame structure for data transport that creates additional transmission capacity and a new structure for handling different data channels. Development and trials of SDH continues but it is unlikely to be directly connected to customer sites much before 1997. Many organisations are continuing with the private networking arrangements that were first established in the 1980s. They typically involve managed bandwidth networks supporting distinct voice and data applications and telcos continue to provide leased bandwidth, in the form of private circuits, to support these architectures. However, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are more flexible, provide more capacity, and are generally cheaper. The latest popular architecture is a hybrid of traditional private and VPN facilities. It seems likely that voice applications will move to VPNs together with lower bandwidth data services. New higher bandwidth services will stay on private dedicated platforms until frame relay services such as ATM become available. Business organisations are demanding skilled, fast and responsive management of their increasingly complex networking environments. BT, Mercury and other telecoms companies could find an additional source of revenue by providing network management services in which they would be responsible for much of the day-to-day running of someone else's corporate network. Perceived corporate benefits rather than the technology itself now determine the direction that business telecommunications services are taking. Users generally prefer evolution to revolution and they want new applications and products to work with existing equipment, smooth integration into existing networks, and interoperability with products from other, different vendors. This has to be achieved at reasonable cost. They do not want unnecessary added complexity, high investment costs, and esoteric new network management platforms. Vendors and service suppliers had things their own way for a long time. Customer-centred organisations who can make telecoms easier, simpler, faster and cheaper for the users will be successful. Those that cannot deserve to fail.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONROVIA APPROVES LAND SWAP  </P> <P> The City Council decided Tuesday to negotiate with a national land conservation  organization that wants to buy 1,200 hillside acres for $648,000.  </P> <P> The nonprofit Trust for Public Lands, based in San Francisco, will pass on the  land to the Angeles National Forest in return for parcels that are less  desirable as forest land or more appropriate for development, said trust  spokesman Tom Armstrong.  </P> <P> Last year the trust completed a similar land swap, involving 634 acres, with  Monrovia. That land is now within the Angeles National Forest, which in return  gave the trust 150 acres in the Lake Hughes area. The trust later sold the Lake  Hughes parcels to the county Sanitation Districts for a sewage treatment plant,  Armstrong said.  </P> <P> The trust, which has put 460,000 acres of land into public ownership since its  creation in 1973, has started discussions with Pasadena and Sierra Madre to buy  some of their land.  </P></p>

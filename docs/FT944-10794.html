			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Time running out in Bulgaria - Tough choices on power must be made Faced with heavy dependence on nuclear power to serve growing energy demands, the Bulgarian government is urgently looking for a way out of a dilemma. Last week a report outlining options for Bulgaria's energy sector was presented to the Bulgarian authorities and to the safety regulator's office by Energoproekt, a Bulgarian institute. No decision is likely until a new parliament is in place next year, but the government is under pressure from safety organisations to act as soon as possible. Three years ago, the nuclear power plant at Kozloduy on the Danube, which supplies up to 45 per cent of Bulgaria's power, was dubbed the most dangerous in the world by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The two oldest units, Russian-designed 440MW WWER pressurised water reactors built in 1974 and 1975, were closed for two years for repairs, and work on a second plant on the Danube at Belene was stopped. The government says it has spent some Lv550m (Pounds 55m) on safety improvements at Kozloduy since then. The European Commission and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have committed Pounds 58m for further work. The Pounds 19m being managed by the EBRD is intended to facilitate the earliest possible closure of the four 440MW WWER reactors at Kozloduy. The EBRD recognises that alternative energy sources must be found before the units could close, but the pressure is on Bulgaria to find a safe, reliable and affordable alternative. The Energoproekt report sets out options ranging from closing the plant immediately, which has little support in Bulgaria, to allowing Kozloduy to work at full capacity until the oldest reactors reach the end of their design life. Ivan Ivanov, deputy manager of the plant, believes the oldest units could last until 2006. Although a great deal of safety work has been carried out, there are still concerns among western safety organisations. There are worries over weaknesses in the design of the 440MW units, including the embrittlement of the pressure vessels and an absence of containment for primary pipe ruptures The lack of storage for spent fuel at the plant is also causing concern. Russia, which supplies the uranium, used to reprocess Bulgaria's spent fuel at a nominal fee, but now charges Dollars 1,000 per kilogramme of heavy metal. The Bulgarians cannot pay this and wet storage tanks at the plant are nearly full. Prof Ivan Uzanov, at the department of nuclear physics at Sofia University, is particularly concerned about storage facilities for the 600 tonnes of spent fuel in an area prone to seismic activity. 'If a catastrophic earthquake leaves this spent fuel without cooling water, it is easy to calculate that the emitted activity could be four times more than from Chernobyl,' he says. Nikita Shervashidze, president of the government's energy committee, says several western companies have tendered for a contract to build new storage facilities, but there will be no decision until the end of the year. Yanko Yanev, Bulgaria's atomic safety regulator, says a 'medium' option of closing units one and two, perhaps as soon as 1996, and devoting more resources to thermal-powered plants, might be the best. He believes that coal-powered plants can be made economic, but that Bulgaria will need help from western agencies, such as the World Bank. Steps are also being taken to find funding for the completion of two 1,000MW WWER reactors at Belene. When these are finished, says Shervashidze, two Kozloduy units can be closed. The Bulgarians are in talks with Russian and Turkish private investors about funding the plant's completion, which would take up to 10 years. Energy consumption in Bulgaria increased by 3 per cent between 1993 and 1994, against all predictions. Such figures suggest that the time for decisions on an alternative to Kozloduy may be running out.</p>

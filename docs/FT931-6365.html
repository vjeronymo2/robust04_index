			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: When to use the national courts - European Court The European Commission has published new guidelines on co-operation with national courts in EC competition cases, designed to encourage the use of national courts in the application and enforcement of EC competition rules. Publication of the guidelines in a Commission Notice has been hastened by three recent developments: the post-Maastricht philosophy of subsidiarity; the European Court's judgment in the Delimitis case setting out the procedures which national courts may follow in EC competition cases; and the recent Court of First Instance judgment in the Automec case. The Commission relied on that case to justify exercising a discretion as to which competition complaints it should give priority. Since 1974, the ECJ has recognised that companies and individuals have the right to enforce the EC competition rules in national courts. A line of cases has established the general right to an effective remedy for infringements of Community law. The Commission Notice rather timidly says that this means that all procedural rights and remedies such as damages, injunctions and interim measures provided by national law should be available to litigants on the same conditions as would apply if a comparable breach of national law were involved. The Commission does not deal with the situation where there is no effective remedy for a comparable breach. National courts, however, have been reluctant to exercise their jurisdiction for a number of reasons, such as the Commission's exclusive competence to grant exemptions for agreements and business conduct which would otherwise be prohibited as anti-competitive, the often complex economic questions involved, and the absence of specific procedural rules. The Notice sets out to provide sufficient reassurance to overcome this reluctance. When applying EC competition law, national courts should be guided by formal Commission exemption decisions, as well as any other official statements such as comfort letters, the case law of the ECJ, other Commission decisions, general notices and the block exemption regulations. In difficult cases the national court is encouraged to stay proceedings to await the outcome of any Commission procedure relating to the same conduct, or seek the Commission's views on certain issues, or refer the matter to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling. It is envisaged that national courts may, within the limits of national procedural law, request the Commission to provide: information of a procedural nature; consultation on points of law, including an interim opinion on eligibility for individual exemption; and factual data to be used as evidence by the parties subject to availability and the principle of confidentiality. Replies from the Commission on these points will neither bind the courts nor affect their right to refer questions to the ECJ. The right to request economic market data from the Commission is one of the most obvious benefits of the Notice. Although bringing an action before a national court may be more expensive than filing a complaint with the Commission, the Commission identifies some of the advantages of court action: damages are available; injunctions may be available and interim measures may be more readily adopted; claims under national and Community law can be combined; and legal costs may be awarded. In spite of such potential benefits, however, the policy of encouraging co-operation raises almost as many potential problems as it seeks to solve. Effective decentralisation may demand a more radical approach along the lines of harmonisation.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 1: Unified market a long way off - Recession has blunted the impact of changes EUROPE'S property market, like the businesses it serves, may be at a turning point. The lifting of trade barriers, European Monetary Union and the dismantling of the iron curtain will have far-reaching implications. But the impact of these momentous changes is blunted by the recession that has swept through much of the market. The debate about property in the new Europe is dominated by planners, lobbyists and conference organisers, rather than investors, developers or tenants. Bold questions are being asked. Which cities and regions will be the gainers and losers from the vision of a united Europe and the opening of the former communists countries in the east? How far will the highly diverse practices of the European property markets converge? How can advantage be taken of these changes? The conclusions being advanced in research documents and reports should be treated with caution: many of the claims made by cities and regions amount to little more than posturing. Europe is not a blank page on which a logical plan of a united Europe can be superimposed. The diverse attitudes, traditions and regulations of its property markets will not dissolve with the lifting of trade barriers. One of the striking features of the Single European Act is the apparent absence of significant implications for the property industry. Not one of the directives which come into force at the end of this year makes a direct reference to property. For all that, there seems little doubt that the new Europe will see a more integrated property market and more direct competition between leading centres. Rather like the rivalry between cities in 15th century Italy, the cities of Europe are striving to outdo each other in their efforts to attract the headquarters of pan-European businesses. The prizes are provided by companies such as Pilkington, the UK glass maker, which has moved the headquarters of its flat and safety glass to Brussels away from St Helen's in the north of England. UK. The competition will produce losers as well as winners. 'In the context of Greater Europe, the credibility of the notion of the continuing viability of 12 or more national capitals becomes strained,' comments Jones Lang Wootton, property consultants. Individual cities will fulfil different roles; capitals of finance, politics and manufacturing are emerging from the leading cities of northern Europe. The battle is being fought on accessibility to markets and clients, and the quality of telecommunications and transport systems. A survey of 500 European executives last year by Harris Research Centre found that London was the leading financial capital, ahead of Frankfurt and Brussels. Brussels was expected to be the most important political centre over the next five years ahead of Berlin and Paris. Frankfurt was the most important city for the headquarters of manufacturing industry. London's role as Europe's pre-eminent financial centre could be under threat, not least as a result of the UK's ambivalence about a unified Europe. 'Its position of dominance is not unassailable, particularly as the competitive climate is changing rapidly,' comments Debenham Tewson Research, property adviser. Its chief rival is Frankfurt, which has been strengthened by the reunification of Germany. Frankfurt, like London and Amsterdam, is making a strong bid to host the European central bank. As well as the rivalry between cities, there is increasingly a tendency to promote trans-national regions within Europe. EC policy makers have drawn up a map of Europe's favoured cities which describes a banana-shaped zone that sweeps through London, Paris and Amsterdam, extends from southern Germany through Milan into northern Italy then spreads westwards into southern France and to Barcelona and Valencia. This zone, dubbed the 'hot banana', is likely to attract head offices and research facilities as a result of its superior transport and telecommunications links. The trend is not uniform, however. Many powerful cities within Germany, such as Hamburg, Bremen and Berlin, fall outside the zone. And the opening of eastern Europe and the agreement between the European Free Trade Assocation and the EC to create a large trade area may pull companies away from the centre. Another region that should increase in importance is the sunbelt, a strip of land running from Barcelona to Trieste by the Cote d'Azur. Its supporters expect it to outstrip the economies of the three countries it spans as a result of the modernity of its industry, its high level of training and the quality of its infrastructure. Investors should not be carried away, however. Most of the towns within the belt have illiquid property markets. And even its most fervent promoters do not expect it to challenge the triangle encompassing London, Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels as the continent's administrative, financial and business centre. Ultimately, the forces reshaping Europe will affect the costs of renting offices in its competing centres. 'Convergence may lead to a reshuffling of the first division' says Mr Stephen Mallen, head of research at Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, chartered surveyors. But for the moment, its is recession rather than the prospect of the single European market that is redrawing the contours of Europe's rental market. Rents in the City of London, long the highest in Europe, are now matched by Paris, Madrid, Frankfurt - and even Berlin and Prague where demand and shortages of office space have sent rents soaring. Even leaving aside the shifts in prosperity of Europe's cities, property investors will be affected by the move towards the single European market. Perhaps the greatest impact of the unified market will come from monetary union, which will enforce a low inflation regime on EC members. This could enhance property's investment prospects: investment allocation in 20 years of low inflation in Germany has moved money away from equities to bonds and property. There will also be more cross-border investment. In some cases, institutions are being released from regulations that tied them to their domestic markets. Reduced currency risks have made them bolder about mismatches between their assets and liabilities. Traditionally there has been little pan-European investment, except in the case of UK and Dutch investors. The sum of all cross-border flows between France, Germany, Italy, Benelux and Iberia was just Pounds 600m in 1989, according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. Although investment slumped in 1991, it is likely that cross-border activity will increase, with some large investment vehicles being created, particularly in France and Germany. Attention is focused on the countries in the former eastern bloc, although legal and planning problems are hindering investment. As investors roam across boundaries it is possible that property yields will partially converge. But the creation of a single European market will not iron out the differences between individual markets. Indeed, if regions specialise in different industries, local variations should be enhanced. 'Harmonisation of economic policies should not lead to convergence of cyclical behaviour in the case of real estate,' comments Ms Dika Alogoskoufi of Jones Lang Wootton. The diversity of different regions creates difficulties as well as opportunities for investors. There is a long history of overseas buyers overpaying in markets they do not truly understand. Even in markets that do not suffer from corruption, illiquidity or excessive bureaucracy, outsiders should be wary of the differences in lease structures, valuation methods, conduct of transactions and legal and tax regimes. The arrival of a unified property market is a long way off.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> WITCHES DISPEL SERIOUS NOTIONS BREWING UP THEIR PREDICTIONS  </P> <P> In their annual Halloween look at what's up next year, American witches today  predicted that Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Oliver L. North will record a rap  album attacking the Soviet Union and the National Endowment of the Arts.  </P> <P> Muffin juggling also will became a big fad.  </P> <P> In the 17th annual survey compiled by the New York Center for the Strange, the  witches also forecast shortages of volleyballs, garlic and chopsticks and a new  book will claim that Elvis Presley was a Soviet agent.  </P> <P> Not only that, Jimmy Carter, Michael Jackson and Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher will buy homes on Staten Island, and Dan Quayle will begin his  campaign for the presidency in '92.  </P> <P> Some of the predictions for next year:  </P> <P> * Walter Cronkite will host a TV game show based on current headlines with  Vanna White.  </P> <P> * "Inspired by his close friendship with Jane Fonda," Ted Turner will launch a  24-hour, all-exercise cable TV network.  </P> <P> * Donald Trump will franchise a pizza chain called "The Don."  </P></p>

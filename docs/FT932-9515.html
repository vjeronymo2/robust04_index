			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Bibby hit by recession in Spanish construction sector THE EFFECTS of deepening recession in the Spanish construction sector has left J Bibby &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural company, with sharply lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.5m, against Pounds 17.3m, for the six months to March 27. The sharp decline, on sales 48 per cent higher at Pounds 416m, appears to have cast a shadow over the future of the dividend following a 30 per cent cut in the interim to 2p. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said a final payment 'will need to be considered in light of the circumstances prevailing at the time'. Earnings per share dropped from 9.16p to 2.06p. Bibby's profits were depressed by a Pounds 6.9m pre-tax loss in the capital equipment division, which comprises Finanzauto, Spain's only Caterpillar distributor, and Stet, its Portuguese subsidiary. Bibby, 79 per cent-owned by South Africa's Barlow Rand group, purchased Finanzauto last summer for Pounds 86m after a hostile six-month-long bid battle. The acquisition of heavily indebted Finanzauto has also resulted in a sharp rise in interest charges from Pounds 2m to Pounds 8.2m. Mr Mansell-Jones said the immediate outlook in Spain remained gloomy. Although Finanzauto had been restructured, the beneficial effects had been masked by a further decline in the construction equipment market. Mr Mansell-Jones also warned on the group's outlook in the second half, saying recession in continental Europe and the Far East had made prospects uncertain. However, he was more optimistic about the US.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 23 (TANJUG) -- BBC radio on Monday  quoted U.N. sources as saying that the Bosnian Serbs are fully  respecting the ceasefire agreement for Gorazde, Muslim enclave  in southeast Bosnia, which the Muslims refused to sign. The  representatives of the Bosnian Serbs and the U.N. Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) on Saturday signed an annex to the agreement on  a ceasefire and the cessetion of hostilities in the region of  Gorazde. But the Muslims refused to sign it, as confirmed by  the UNPROFOR Command for Bosnia.    In a program monitored in Belgrade, BBC radio cited an  unnamed senior U.N. official in Sarajevo that the respect of the  ceasefire in Gorazde `enables the deployment of the U.N. troops  in areas from where the Serbs have withdrawn.' The only  potential problem is the attempt of the local Muslims to use the  withdrawl of the Serb forces and sieze the regions they  previously controlled, which is not allowed under the relevant  U.N. resolutions, the radio said.    It quoted UNPROFOR as saying that armed Bosnian Serb police  has pulled out of the northern part of Gorazde to 3 km from the  exclusion zone, while the remainder of the Serbs in the eastern  parts should withdraw within the next 24 hours. The Bosnian  Serbs in late April pulled out their heavy weapons to 20 km and  the infantry to 3 km away from the centre of Gorazde with the  aim of reaching a peaceful solution to the crisis caused by the  Muslims who launched a major offensive from this  `U.N.-designated safe area' in March.    Only the Bosnian Serb police remained in the Serb villages  near Gorazde to allow the local inhabitants to safely return to  their homes. Some 15,000 Muslims from Gorazde, which should  have been demilitarized last May, in late March launched an  offensive on Serb territories. In the face of a total defeat  from a Serb counterattack, NATO on April 10-11 bombed Serb  positions close to this town.</p>

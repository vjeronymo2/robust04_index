			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Ukraine takes dim view of colourful coupons FROM peers to peasants, the verdict yesterday was that with its first economic steps the government of newly independent Ukraine has fallen flat on its face. High-powered foreign advisers and locals grumbling in shop queues agree that the January 10 introduction of coupons parallel with the faltering rouble is exacerbating inflation without the palliative effect of genuine monetary reform. Notwithstanding their bright colours and a picture of Kiev's historic St. Sophia cathedral, the coupons are such an obvious misstep that they seem likely to provoke a radical re-shuffle of the largely ex-Communist cabinet members who introduced them. 'It is an inconceivably stupid system,' says Hungarian-born financier Mr George Soros, in Kiev to advise the Ukrainian government. 'The dying, moribund Communist apparat is trying to introduce monetary reform, and it is an absolute disaster.' In an effort to protect the relatively well-stocked Ukrainian market from the full impact of Russian price increases, each Ukrainian resident was issued with between 200 and 400 coupons, depending on salary. Once the system is in place, at least 25 per cent of wages are to be paid in coupons, which are the only currency valid for the purchase of food and consumer goods. In Mr Soros's view the hastily conceived system 'is a machine for inflation' because the government intends to dole out fresh coupons each month without an effective system for getting them back. Mr Soros is also critical of the one-to-one official exchange rate between the rouble and the coupon and the lack of a distinction between the two currencies in government accounts, even though coupons give priority to scarce goods. This loophole, he said, 'is an invitation to large-scale arbitrage and is responsible for the steep fall in black market rates for coupons. Initially, coupons sold for ten roubles, but now five days into the reform the street value of coupons is down to 2 to 4 roubles. Acknowledging the failure of the rouble/coupon system, President Leonid Kravchuk announced this week that on March 1 coupons would become the only currency valid in Ukraine. Mr Soros believes this measure would make the best of a bad situation, but he thinks the government should introduce a new currency as soon as possible, preferably in March or April. The inept introduction of coupons has provoked public protests and encouraged political attacks on the government. Sir Geoffrey Howe, another one of Ukraine's advisers, believes that it is not just individuals but also government structures which are to blame for Ukraine's inability to implement defective reforms. He is particularly critical of the rivalry between the parliament, the president, and the cabinet ministers, which often paralyses the state. Ukraine has set up a new bank to pay the republic's share of the foreign debt of the former Soviet Union and handle foreign economic relations, Moscow Radio said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. The new bank will take over the activities of the Soviet foreign trade bank, Vneshekonombank, in Ukraine.</p>

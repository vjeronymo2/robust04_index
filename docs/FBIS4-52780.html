			<p>BFN     [Text] All persons who appear in the Alex Boncayao Brigade  [ABB] hit list, including eight generals and government  officials, had better watch closely their backs.    Director Agerico Kagaoan, PNP [Philippine National Police]  operations director, said the communist urban terrorist group is  "very active" and determined to pursue its "mission" to  liquidate people it perceives to have committed "crimes against  people."    Last Saturday, gunmen killed dismissed Chief Inspector  Timoteo Zarcal in front of his residence in Felix Huertas, Sta.  [Santa--Holy] Cruz, Manila.    Hours later, the ABB through Felimon Lagman, chief of the  Manila-Rizal Party Committee, a breakaway faction from the  Communist Party of the Philippines, admitted responsibility.    Zarcal was ninth on the ABB hit list.    Despite the ABB admission, Kagaoan said probers have not  counted out other suspects.    Chief Inspector Jose Pring said Sunday Zarcal could have  been  killed by his detractors who were only using the ABB to mislead  investigators.    Pring and Zarcal were arrested last year at the house of  Vice  President Joseph Estrada on charges of kidnapping  Chinese-Filipinos.    Though acquitted last month by a Pasig court, they were  included in the ABB hit list released last 16 January.    Also on the list are 98 police and military personnel and at  least 170 government officials and several civilians, including  movie personalities, businessmen, and suspected drug lords for  liquidation.    The police officers include former PNP Director General  Cesar  Nazareno; Director Vicente Vinarao, chief of the National  Penitentiary; Director Manuel Roxas, Bureau of Immigration and  Deportation commissioner; PNP Deputy Director General Gerry  Flores; Chief Superintendent Dictador Alqueza, former Regional  Command 11 director; Director Marino Filart, former Capcom  [Capital Command] chief; Maj. Gen. (ret.) Ramon Montano,  presidential consultant for police affairs; Chief Supt. (ret.)  Ernesto Diokno, former WPDC [Western Police District Command]  chief.    The list also includes Speaker Jose de Venecia, former  Councilor and cager Abe King, and movie producer Cheng Muhlach.    The ABB said the personalities were involved in graft and  corruption, drug pushing, prostitution, and kidnap-for-ransom  cases.    Last month, suspected ABB members gunned down Isidro  Florentino, father of Allan Florentino, a suspect in the  rape-slay of Rosielyn Federico, a fastfood employee.</p>

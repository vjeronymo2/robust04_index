			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Iraq has completed the forced relocation of thousands of Kurds, an Iraqi  government spokesman said. Citing security reasons, Iraq announced June 26 that  it was clearing Kurdish and Arab citizens from a 20-mile-wide strip along its  borders with Iran and Turkey. Iraq has not confirmed the number of Kurds  relocated, but estimates range from 200,000 to 500,000. Meanwhile, Iraqi  officials said they hope media coverage they are arranging for a Kurdish  election in two weeks will dispel "myths" of reported suffering caused by the  relocation.  </P></p>

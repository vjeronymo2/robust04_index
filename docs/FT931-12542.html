			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / BR chief hopeful on Heathrow project SIR BOB REID, British Rail's chairman, said yesterday that BR and BAA, the airports operator, were 'within days of a solution' to the deadlock over plans for the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express project. His remarks caused confusion at BAA, however. The company said: 'We are optimistic that there will be a successful outcome, but there is still quite a bit of tough negotiation to go.' The Heathrow Express project is intended to speed passengers between Heathrow Airport and central London's Paddington station in 16 minutes. It is being developed jointly by BAA and BR. The plan is for BR to carry the train on its existing tracks for three quarters of the 16-mile journey. A private-sector consortium led by BAA would build and operate the spur needed to take the trains off the main line to Heathrow Airport. Plans for the 16-mile rail link were close to collapse last month amid a bitter dispute between BR and BAA over how it should be funded. BAA said BR was undermining the viability of the scheme by asking too high a price for use of its mainline tracks, but BR said BAA was at fault for refusing to put more money into the project. Yesterday Sir Bob told the Commons transport committee that the 'Byzantine' negotiations with BAA were probably within a few days of solution. 'John Egan (BAA's chief executive) and I are almost there,' he told MPs. Both BAA and BR, however, tried yesterday to play down the prospects of an early agreement, saying that there were difficult issues still to be resolved. The Heathrow Express is one of two big projects which have proved embarrassing to the government in its attempts to involve the private sector in providing rail infrastructure. The other is the planned Pounds 1.7bn extension of the Jubilee Line to London's Docklands. This is currently blocked by the private sector's reneging on a promised contribution to the extension of Pounds 400m. BAA is expected to file a planning application for the construction of the new Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m fifth terminal at Heathrow in the middle of next month, making fast rail connections all the more important.</p>

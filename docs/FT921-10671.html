			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Laidlaw to raise CDollars 242m with common share issue LAIDLAW, the Canadian waste services and school bus operator, is raising CDollars 242m (USDollars 206m) through a common share issue which it will use to reduce debt and provide for possible acquisitions. The Ontario-based company has agreed to sell 22.75m non-voting Class B shares to a group of Canadian underwriters at a price of CDollars 11 a share. The shares were trading at CDollars 11.63. Canadian Pacific, which has a 47 per cent voting interest in Laidlaw, will take up its proportionate share of the issue. CP earlier this week wrote down its investment in Laidlaw by CDollars 291m. In addition, it took a writedown of CDollars 101m, reflecting its share of Laidlaw's writedown last year of its 28 per cent interest in ADT, the Bermuda-based security services and vehicle auction company. The CDollars 291m writedown reflects the steep decline in Laidlaw's shares since CP bought its interest at roughly double the present price three years ago. The share price has recently recovered from a low of CDollars 8.25, reached last autumn. Laidlaw said yesterday that the issue would reduce the debt-equity ratio from 87 per cent to 68 per cent.</p>

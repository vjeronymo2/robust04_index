			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing and Daniel Kwan] </F>   [Text] Shanghai activist Bao Ge is to send an open letter  to the Japanese Embassy in Beijing today demanding a public  apology from Tokyo and reparation for the Sino-Japanese war when  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa arrives in China on  Saturday. The letter, which will be sent by express mail today,  is signed only by Mr Bao after other activist groups declined to  support a signature campaign for fear of police action. Beijing  has imposed a news blackout on the reparation movement.    In his letter, Mr Bao urged Mr Hosokawa to "use his  influence" on Chinese leaders to accelerate the pace of  democracy in China. He also said that it would be "hypocritical  and unfounded" for Japan to pledge its friendship with China  unless Tokyo first apologised and paid compensation for the  damage it inflicted on China during the Sino-Japanese war.    The medical researcher accused the Chinese Government of  violating its own constitution and acting "against the wishes of  its people" when it renounced its rights to seek reparation from  Japan in 1972. He said the renunciation was made without the  consensus of the National People's Congress--the highest  authority in the Chinese Government--and was therefore  unconstitutional. "I have to make the statement public now  because I understand they will stop me from speaking out when Mr  Hosokawa comes," said Mr Bao yesterday.    Meanwhile, Beijing student activist Wang Dan and two other  dissidents returned to Beijing yesterday after having left the  Chinese capital for the duration of U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's visit. Mr Wang said he and dissidents Zhou  Duo and Min Qi had spent the past few days in the southeastern  coastal city of Xiamen. They had gone of their own volition to  prevent the tension surrounding Mr Christopher's visit from  becoming even greater after several dissidents were detained to  keep them away from the current session of the National People's  Congress and the Secretary of State.    Mr Wang, one of the main leaders of the 1989 student  movement, said he decided to leave Beijing after"the repeated  persuasion of some friends." He also said he had been advised  that "the conflicts would become more acute" if he stayed but  refused to say who had told him this. "If the authorities had  demanded that I go, I would not have gone," said Mr Wang.    The three men stayed at a hotel in Xiamen and spent the time  touring the city. Three or four plain-clothes policemen  followed them wherever they went.    When Mr Wang arrived back in Beijing, uniformed police were  still in the reception room at the apartment block where he  lives. Nevertheless, Mr Wang said: "I'm completely free." Mr  Wang said he was heartened by the concern Mr Christopher  expressed about human rights in China but said he did not pin  much hope on pressure from outsiders.    Sources said that dissident Wei Jingsheng, who served more  than 14 years in prison before being released last September,  was unlikely to return to the capital from Tianjin over the next  few days. Mr Wei left Beijing on March 6.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry and  the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications have agreed to  maintain the 1.1 percentage point difference between rates on  ordinary postal savings deposits and ordinary banking deposits,  officials said Friday [8 April].    The difference will remain effective even after ordinary  deposit rates are liberalized, which could possibly start in  June.    But the ministries will further scrutinize some exceptional  cases such as when rates of ordinary bank deposits become  sharply lower than market rates, the officials said.    The Posts and Telecommunications Ministry have been seeking  to set the rate on its ordinary deposits in accordance with  market rates but the Finance Ministry was insisting on leaving  the difference, while narrowing the gap.</p>

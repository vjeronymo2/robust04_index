			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / People: Old Lady's Scottish ears David Shilson, a Bank of England veteran, is to replace Nigel Falls, as the Bank's eyes and ears in Scotland. He takes over as agent at the Bank's Glasgow office on 18 May. For diplomatic reasons the Bank of England has never established a full branch north of the border, but despite the small size of its Glasgow outfit, Shilson will be more important than many of the Bank's other agents around the United Kingdom. Charged with liaising with local industry, one of his main tasks will be to help monitor the health of the local economy at a particularly sensitive time in Scotland's political affairs. While not a Scot, Shilson did study classics at St Andrews University. Aged 54, he is considerably older and more experienced than Aberdeen-born Nigel Falls, 46, who spent five years as the previous agent. Having joined the Bank in 1961, Shilson has worked in the Overseas Department, the Economic Intelligence Department and the Industrial Finance Division where he was an adviser responsible for the financing of small firms. In between he was seconded to the Cabinet Office for three years and the National Economic Development Office for two and a half years. His most recent job at the Bank was as career development adviser. ***** Ruth May has been appointed Regional Liaison Manager for the Midlands and Western Region of the London Stock Exchange.</p>

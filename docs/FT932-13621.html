			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Canadian newsprint groups ahead TWO large eastern Canada newsprint companies with combined annual capacity of nearly 1.5m tonnes have posted improved first-quarter results, signalling an end to the three-year slump which has hit the industry. Donohue, controlled by Quebecor publishing and printing group, reported profits of CDollars 6.3m, or 18 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 8.3m, or 26 cents, a year earlier, on sales ahead at CDollars 135m, against CDollars 114m. Quno reduced its loss to CDollars 4.2m, or 30 cents a share, from one of CDollars 15.7m a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 127m, against CDollars 106m. The Chicago Tribune is still the biggest single shareholder and customer. Both Canadian companies cited higher prices for newsprint and strong demand from the eastern US, higher timber prices, lower interest rates and a lower Canadian dollar. Donohue, a low-cost producer of kraft pulp as well as newsprint, is seeking to diversify into higher value added products and is considering a move into the US.</p>

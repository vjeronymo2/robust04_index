			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S HOUSING: BILL TO RAISE FHA LIMIT COULD AID STATE  </P> <P> In 1961, Jack Kemp, then quarterback of the San Diego Chargers and now  secretary of Housing and Urban Development, bought his first home with a  mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration.  </P> <P> Today, however, Kemp would be unable to buy that same starter home with an  FHA-backed mortgage. The FHA's mortgage maximum loan amount has not kept pace  with the median price of housing, which has soared in expensive markets such as  Southern California.  </P> <P> Although the FHA ceiling was raised recently to $124,875, which will allow FHA  to write substantially more mortgages in high-cost areas, it will still be far  below the median cost in cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, and in  San Diego, where the median price of a house is $175,600.  </P> <P> Affordable housing has become the newest chicken-in-every-pot issue, and there  is considerable support for raising the ceiling again and allowing it to float  with the median value in each city.  </P> <P> What seems most popular and most likely to make it into the National Affordable  Housing Act is a bill sponsored by Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Alphonse  D'Amato (R-N.Y.), which would set a new ceiling at 95% of the median value of  housing within a particular metropolitan area. The ceiling could not exceed 90%  of the state median.  </P> <P> Prices are so high in some markets, Cranston argued before the Senate voted to  increase the limit last September, that the FHA was "simply knocked out of the  market."  </P> <P> Interestingly, there is no historical precedent for keeping the FHA limit below  the median value of housing in any particular area.  </P> <P> In fact, in the mid-1960s the loan limit was 70% above the median sales price  of existing homes, providing FHA coverage for all but the most expensive homes.  It wasn't until the mid-1980s that the ceiling dropped below the median. Even  at 95%, the program will still be restricted to housing in the lower half.  </P> <P> All the players are taking sides on the issues of whether to raise the ceiling  once more.  </P> <P> The realtors, home builders and mortgage bankers, backed by Cranston and other  congressmen, lined up against the private mortgage insurance industry and the  savings and loans, which are backed by Sens. Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and Jesse  Helms (R-N.C.), who fought even the new $124,875-ceiling, calling it a "fat-cat  provision."  </P> <P> Some consumer advocacy groups also have voiced concerns that raising the limit  could contribute to the national housing affordability problem.  </P> <P> The FHA was created by Congress in 1934 to make housing opportunities available  at a time when the whole housing finance system was in disarray.  </P> <P> Prior to FHA, home buyers had to make substantial down payments and finance  their purchases with short-term balloon loans. The FHA was the creator of the  long-term, amortized mortgage that we still use in one form or another today.  </P> <P> John M. Ols Jr., director of housing and community development issues for the  Government Accounting Office, told the House subcommittee on housing and  community development that the purpose of FHA "is to encourage improvement in  housing standards and conditions, provide an adequate home financing system  through mortgage insurance and exert a stabilizing influence on the mortgage  market."  </P> <P> To make it all work, the FHA, decades ago, set up its own self-sustaining  mortgage insurance fund to insure loans for single-family homes.  </P> <P> A recent GAO audit painted a dire picture of the FHA's present and future. In  fiscal year 1988, the single-family insurance fund, which constitutes the bulk  of FHA activity, lost $1.4 billion, leaving just $1.8 billion in reserve.  </P> <P> The FHA, which has insured mortgages for 17 million people since its inception,  is in for some changes. Those changes could be in down payment requirements or  in loan-to-value ratios. A permanent change in the allowable loan ceiling is  almost a certainty.  </P> <P> A big fight is brewing over which direction FHA should take.  </P> <P> Mark E. Goldhaber, vice president of General Electric Mortgage Insurance Cos.,  a private mortgage insurer, said, "From our industry's point of view, the 95%  plan will take a large segment of the market that is already being served by  the private sector and federalize it. Who are we trying to serve with the FHA?  Raising the limit, whether in Los Angeles or Boston, doesn't help the family of  four making $50,000 a year afford a house. That family still cannot afford a  median-priced house of $200,000."  </P> <P> The Mortgage Insurance Cos. of America (MICA) has released a study saying that  mortgages of more than $80,000 actually are riskier than lower mortgages, and  the FHA would be exposing itself to even greater risk of loss by increasing its  limit.  </P> <P> "If that's the case, why don't they differentiate in their fees?" asked Ols in  an interview, noting that PMI companies do not charge higher insurance premiums  for the higher, and supposedly riskier, loans. MICA's numbers conflict directly  with the findings of the GAO, which showed that higher mortgages have "slightly  lower default rates and . . . lower percentage losses when they default."  </P> <P> The PMI companies, said Kent Colton, executive vice president of the National  Assn. of Home Builders, "don't want the competition from FHA. The person who  will lose if they succeed is the consumer.  </P> <P> "It's a clear mistake to eliminate the FHA as a player in markets like  California. It is clearly discriminatory."  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Realtors supports the 95% proposal.  </P> <P> NAR senior vice president Stephen Dreisler said, "Everything in life tends to  be relative. And a median-priced house in Los Angeles ought to be eligible for  FHA financing just like a median-priced house in Louisville, Ky. A fireman in  Los Angeles ought to be able to buy a house using FHA just as his counterpart  in Louisville does."  </P> <P> Cranston's chief housing aide, Donald Campbell, explained the proposal for the  95% limit: "What we are trying to do is to provide some more equity across the  country, so that modest homes in all areas are covered by FHA."  </P> <P> Allowing the FHA to insure loans up to 95% of the median value in any  metropolitan area, up to 90% of that particular state's median value, will  strengthen the FHA fund, Campbell argued, saying it makes sense in the  insurance industry that spreading business across a number of markets reduces  risks.  </P> <P> Based on the FHA's experience with its own higher-end mortgages, the GAO study  says that a higher ceiling would expand FHA's market and probably increase the  equity in the single-family fund substantially.  </P> <P> "We have to recognize that raising the ceiling strengthens the fund by lowering  the risk of the total portfolio," Campbell said. "There are two ways to do  this: one is to expand the market to lower risk borrowers; the other is to stop  serving the high-risk borrowers.  </P> <P> "The only other option," Campbell joked, "is to start pumping in taxpayer  money."  </P> <P> In 55 years, FHA has never gone hat in hand to the taxpayer; any losses on  foreclosed property has been offset by premium income.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEW COLUMN  </P> <P> "America's Housing," a monthly report from Washington, D.C., begins today in  the Real Estate section. The column, written by journalist and author Catherine  Collins, will cover national developments in residential real estate that  affect Southern Californians.  </P></p>

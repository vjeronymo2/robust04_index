The Standards Division of CSA is responsible for the administration of the development of voluntary consensus standards. The Certification and Testing Division provides conformity assessment programs including laboratory testing, certification, inspection and quality management services. The organization started out in 1919 as the Canadian Engineering Standards Association (CESA), which was changed in 1944 to the present name. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant states that during the last 70 years, CSA has developed more than 1,400 standards and codes which cover industrial and consumer products and services in a wide range of product areas. In 1940, CSA began to test and certify products and today is an international organization with more than 9,000 volunteer members from 20 countries representing, among others, consumers, and regulators. They are supported by a staff of approximately 1,000 employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Again according to the applicant, over 14,000 manufacturers worldwide use CSA's testing and certification services, and the CSA Certification Mark appears on over one billion products a year. CSA processes some 36,000 engineering projects, and the inspection staff makes follow-up visits to some 19,000 factories in almost 60 different countries, each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Rexdale Facility contains the corporate headquarters, the Standards Division, the Finance and Administration Division, and the Certification and Testing Division. The Rexdale facility houses the Central Region Office and the headquarters of the Central Operations. Central Operations includes the Prairie Region (Winnipeg) and the Central Region (Rexdale). The explosion testing laboratory in Ottawa (under the control of the Canadian Department of Energy, Mines and Resources), where CSA performs explosion testing, is monitored out of the Central Region. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Montreal (Pointe Claire) facility houses the Eastern Region Office and the headquarters of the Eastern Operations. Eastern Operations includes the Eastern Region (Pointe Claire) and the Atlantic Region (Moncton). The Eastern Region and Atlantic Region maintain testing and inspection facilities for Eastern North America. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Vancouver (Richmond) facility houses the Pacific Region Office and the headquarters of the Pacific Operations. Pacific Operations include the Pacific Region (Richmond), and the Western Region (Edmonton). The Pacific Region and Western Region maintain testing and inspection facilities for Western North America. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Quality Assurance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Certification and Testing Division's Engineering and Quality Assurance (EQA) Office reports to the Vice President in charge of the Certification and Testing Division. The Eastern, Central, and Pacific Operations as well as each of the Regional Offices has a Quality Assurance Office. The Regional Quality Assurance Offices have a reporting relationship with the respective Operations Quality Assurance Office, and with the EQA from the corporate headquarters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regional Quality Assurance Offices are responsible for quality assurance at their respective facilities. The Operations Quality Assurance Offices are responsible for quality assurance not only of their respective operations but also of all of the regions within their operations. The Engineering and Quality Assurance Office is responsible for the Certification and Testing Division's quality assurance, including all Operations and Regions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Document Structure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Certification and Testing Division's (C&amp;T) Divisional Director of Engineering and Quality Assurance (EQA) establishes the quality assurance philosophy for the three operations, the Eastern, Central, and Pacific. The EQA uses Divisional Quality Documents (DQD) to establish Quality Assurance Procedures, Certification and Testing Division Operating Procedures (CDOP) and so-called Test Packs to provide evaluation procedures for products submitted for testing, Technical Information Letters (TIL) to document technical interpretations of standards, and Engineering Policy Supplements (EPS) to provide policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Audit Structure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The CSA audit structure is multilevel. EQA audits the regions, the Operations Quality Assurance Office audits the regions, and the Regional Quality Assurance Offices perform self-audits. In addition, outside agencies such as the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) perform yearly audits which involve EQA representation during the audit. For example, Edmonton and Moncton were subjected to at least five audits, and Winnipeg at least four audits, since July of 1991. In addition, specific technical audits of each Region are performed by the Senior Technical Engineer from the concerned Operation's Quality Assurance Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

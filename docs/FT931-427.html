			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / News Corp to save Dollars 15m a year on debts WITH the launch of its Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) refinancing, News Corporation hopes to complete the restructuring of its bank borrowings on more favourable terms, with an estimated saving of Dollars 15m in annual interest payments. The group has greatly reduced reliance on bank debt and the number of banks from which it borrows. In late 1990, it was forced into negotiations with its 146 lending banks and restructured Dollars 7.6bn of bank debt. 'In practice, News Corp has reduced its borrowing costs by around  1/2 a percentage point across the board', according to one banker involved. Its total bank debts - of Dollars 7.6bn plus a Dollars 600m short-term bridge-over facility - have been cut since 1991 to Dollars 3bn. This is being refinanced with a six-year revolving credit with Chemical Bank, Citibank and Samuel Montagu acting as co-arrangers. News Corp was keen to diversify the structure of its debt and reduce the number of lending banks involved. Since 1991 it has cut bank debt by raising equity, selling assets, and issuing about Dollars 2bn of long-dated bonds in the US. The Dollars 3bn refinancing is intended to reduce the number of banks from 146 to a more manageable group of 30-40 relationship banks, including the three co-arranging banks as well as News Corp's main banks in Australia - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac and National Australia Bank. The upgrading of News Corp's ratings recently by Standard &amp; Poor's from sub-investment to investment grade means the group can borrow at more favourable terms. Under the provisions of the 1991 agreement, lenders received 100 basis points (one percentage point) on top of their previously-agreed terms. With the new loan, News Corp will pay a margin of 100 basis points (bp) over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in the first year, provided it has an investment grade rating from either S&amp;P or Moody's. The margin in subsequent years is determined by the company's credit rating. Moody's currently rates News International as speculative grade at Ba2.</p>

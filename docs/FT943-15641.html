			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Rolling-stock companies to be sold The three companies which will own British Rail passenger rolling stock and lease it to train operating companies are to be sold to the private sector next year, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said yesterday. The government has put a value of Pounds 3bn on BR's rolling-stock assets, a high figure intended to smooth the shift towards a commercial leasing market for locomotives, freight wagons and carriages. By valuing BR's often aged rolling stock at what it calls modern equivalent asset value, the same formula chosen for the track and other infrastructure owned by Railtrack, the government believes that train operators will have an incentive to invest in new rolling stock. But this valuation should not make life difficult for operators because they will be compensated for any higher leasing charges by higher subsidies, railway industry sources believe. Under the leasing regime planned by the government, train operators would sign lease agreements, probably for about seven years. When these agreements expire the operators would renegotiate new ones with the by now privately owned leasing companies. The announcement of details of the government's proposals has been eagerly awaited by the train operators and represents a further important step in the privatisation of the BR network. The government has created three companies to own a mixed portfolio of BR's 11,000 items of passenger rolling stock so as to inject competition into the leasing sector. It is unlikely to allow any private-sector bidder to own more than one company. Bids are expected from banks, financial services companies, leasing specialists and also possibly from rolling-stock manufacturers. Consortium bids may also be made, the government believes. 'Freed from the constraints of operating in the public sector, the three companies will be able to bring private-sector expertise and commercial practice to the supply of rolling stock,' Mr MacGregor said. Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport spokesman, said the taxpayer would be the loser because the government was 'desperate to privatise some part of the railways before the next general election'. Mr Andy Thompson, secretary of the Finance and Leasing Association, said: 'There is no ready way of determining the value of rolling-stock assets and difficulties may arise if the value put on them by potential bidders does not match that of the government.'</p>

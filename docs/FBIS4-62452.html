			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich has announced he  will call for a review of the country's foreign trade policy  shortly.    In an exclusive interview with Interfax, Kebich made it  clear  that his cabinet did not like the situation in which "major  western powers are granting Belarus paltry quotas" for the sale  of Belarusian goods in the West, especially textiles, which were  used widely there, and potassium produced in the republic.    The premier said that those commodities were of good quality  and highly competitive on the world market, a fact proven by the  fact that the quotas for Belarusian cloth and fertilizers for  sale in the West would be used up as early as May.    IF Note: In April this year, a Belarusian governmental  delegation headed by Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Mechislav  Hryb visited Strasbourg in France to try to resolve the problem  in hand at consultations with a deputies from the European  Parliament. During the talks the Belarusian delegation received  pledges of tangible assistance in raising quotas for textiles  and potassium salts.    Kebich stressed: "If the West does not allow Belarus on to  its markets, why, then, should Belarus ignore the fact that  leading European firms are selling their cars, confectionery,  radios, beer and spirits, cigarettes and other commodities  without restriction in Belarus and without quotas being issued  by ourselves?" The premier was certain that "some products, for  example those manufactured by the Minsk Kommunarka  confectioners, are far superior in quality to their western  counterparts which are currently flooding the Belarussian  markets."    Kebich commented that "the problem with finding sales  outlets  exists for practically all CIS states besides Belarus.  Therefore, it would be a good feasible to resolve these matters  together." He said he intended to submit the relevant proposal  to all other CIS prime ministers at their very next summit.</p>

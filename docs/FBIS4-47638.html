			<p>The      Mongolian political climate, rising inflation and chronic  paper shortage have contributed to changes in periodicity and costs,  renaming, and cancellation of Mongolian periodicals.  Despite these  problems four new periodicals were announced in the February 1994  publications list.  A comparison of data released in the  publications lists issued in September 1993 and February 1994  indicates that four periodicals had no periodicity or subscription  rate changes, eleven have undergone either periodicity or rate  modifications, two showed changes in both, and one offered a special  rate.  The latest comprehensive list also announced the cancellation  of three periodicals.      I.   New Titles      The following are the titles of the new periodicals announced in  the subscription availability list released on 4 February 1994:      1.

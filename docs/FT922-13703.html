			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Management: Revealed, how to pull off the Italian job / Billion lire executive pay packages excite only limited Latin passions British and American executives, reeling from criticism of their 'excessive' pay rises, will draw little comfort from their Italian colleagues' recent plight. The sums earned in Italy are just as large, yet the public outcry that greeted the disclosure in the press of the tax returns of some leading public sector managers was pretty perfunctory. Despite the ritual yearly disclosures, 'top people's' pay in Italy is not particularly contentious. Topping this year's list with L1.9bn (Pounds 885,700) was Pier Giusto Jaeger, deputy chairman of the STET telecommunications group. Two state-sector bankers followed, both also declaring incomes of more than L1bn. The brevity of the salaries' storm derives from the fact that it is largely artificial. The earnings, published by the prime minister's office, represent not just pay, but total income. Many of the 'top 10' immediately emphasised that the figures included items like consultancy, dividends and royalties. Laws and culture explain why executive pay arouses relatively few passions in Italy. Unlike Britain and America, companies are not obliged to disclose directors' earnings, and annual reports are silent on the subject. Eager sleuths can drop into the local tax office, where a company's annual returns include details on executives' pay. But few take the trouble. This may be the result of the chummy relationship between big companies and the press, which stifles investigative reporting. 'People are quite well protected in that respect,' says Patrizia Macaluso of International Human Resources, the Milan-based consultants Yet some information is available. Although non-disclosure rules apply as much to public as to private companies, details on state sector pay are easier to come by. The salary of Franco Nobili, chairman of IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, and Gabriele Cagliari, who heads Eni, the second biggest holding group, are published in the Official Gazette. The latest figure, which dates back to 1987 in the case of Eni, shows the chairman earned L250m. The same figure is quoted by IRI for its chairman. Meanwhile, headhunters can shed some light on private-sector pay. Most agree that the chief executive of a quoted company, with sales of around L1,000bn, should make about L500,000m-L600,000m. But they emphasise that private sector pay levels can differ widely, even between similar sized companies. 'In the very biggest groups, earnings can easily exceed L1bn,' says Lodovico Floriani, chairman of Hay Management Consultants in Italy. The lack of uniformity stems from the very personal nature of Italian business. Most big, private-sector groups, even when quoted, are dominated by an individual or family shareholder. Top executives' pay can depend as much on owners' whims as on comparative salaries. Shareholder-chairmen like Fiat's Gianni Agnelli and Carlo De Benedetti of Olivetti are highly influential in deciding pay levels. Personal considerations are also paramount. Floriani says that while a company's performance, inflation and the general economic climate play a part, pay rates are also affected by the rapport between a hired executive and the controlling shareholder, who is usually chairman. Even at the highest levels, public sector salaries are appreciably lower, with earnings seldom exceeding L500,000-L600,000. But here too, figures can be deceptive. For high profile jobs like the IRI and Eni chairmanships, non-salary perks boost earnings that need to look restrained for political reasons. Non-salary perks can account for as much as 50 per cent of the total for some top state industry jobs, the headhunters reckon. Job security can also compensate for lower pay levels when working for the state. Italy's public sector plays a much bigger role in business than in most other European countries. Top appointments are highly politicised, with a delicate balance between representatives of the governing parties on the boards of the big holding companies and their subsidiaries. However, a senior executive belonging to one of the main parties can usually expect a job for life. Public sector pay rises appear to be handled much more objectively than for private companies. IRI uses Hay Management Consultants to advise on a 'policy line' each year, which is then implemented with a variation based on performance. Jobs are ranked on the basis of 'Hay points', to which appropriate salaries are ascribed. But the system also allows for differences of up to 20 per cent on either side of the base level, depending on personal evaluations. Both public and private-sector executives put a car first when it comes to perks. In deference to the domestic motor industry, that usually means a big Lancia Thema or Alfa 164. Chauffeurs are not uncommon, even below managing director level, and the number of aerials sprouting from the car's bodywork tends to indicate the occupant's importance. Insurance is the other standard perk. Senior executives expect both private health insurance and private pensions, along with life cover as part of their packages. More surprisingly for a country where second or even third homes are common, few managers would demand a place in the country as a perk. 'If a top executive takes some holiday, the last place he'll go is somewhere where he might risk bumping into his colleagues,' says one consultant.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER PLEADS GUILTY IN CRASH THAT KILLED 2 STUDENTS  </P> <P> A Palmdale man pleaded guilty Wednesday to two counts of second-degree murder  in the deaths of two high school students whose car he broadsided in Mission  Hills while fleeing from police in his pickup truck.  </P> <P> Ray Vargas Servin, 22, also agreed to a prison term of 20 years to life, Deputy  Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels said. Servin will be sentenced Oct. 17 in Van Nuys  Superior Court, Samuels said. Had he been convicted in a jury trial that was  scheduled to begin Wednesday, he could have received a sentence of 36 years to  life.  </P> <P> Servin, who on Tuesday listened in court to a 20-minute tape-recorded  confession he made to police shortly after the crash, entered the plea  Wednesday morning after consulting with his attorney, William M. Thornbury.  </P> <P> As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors dropped a charge of causing death  while evading police, for which he could have received an additional  eight-month sentence.  </P> <P> Servin's brother, Jose Servin, 25, of Palmdale, said outside the court  Wednesday that his brother deeply regrets causing the crash.  </P> <P> "My brother says if he could give his life for them to come back, he would,"  Jose Servin said. "But it's God's hand. I pray for the families."  </P> <P> Samuels said that despite the plea agreement, Servin will receive the same  sentence her office would have requested in the event of a jury conviction. She  said she would have asked that the murder counts, which each carry a maximum  sentence of 15 years, be served concurrently, and that he receive an additional  five years because he was on parole for a robbery conviction at the time of the  crash.  </P> <P> "All of us feel it was just an outrageously reckless act," Samuels said. "But  it wasn't intentional. It's a tragic case."  </P> <P> On June 1, Servin fired two or three shots with a pistol into the air during a  fight outside a residence and then fled from a pursuing San Fernando police  officer. He later told police that he fired the shots to scare off a man who  had pointed a shotgun at him.  </P> <P> After running three stop signs, Servin ran a red light at Chatsworth Drive and  Laurel Canyon Boulevard and struck a car carrying three students returning from  a high school football game. Aracely Hernandez, 18, of San Fernando and Uriel  Fernandez, 16, of Pacoima were killed. The third occupant, Juan Melendrez, 16,  was hospitalized with minor injuries.  </P> <P> Servin ran away after the crash and hid in bushes, but police found him a short  time later. A .38-caliber revolver was found under the pickup's dashboard.  </P> <P> Servin said he drank more than 18 cans of beer in the five hours before the  9:10 p.m. crash and did not see the red light at the intersection.  </P> <P> He told detectives that he tried to flee because he did not want to return to  prison. Servin had been released on parole less than a year earlier after  serving terms for robbery and joy riding.  </P></p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Sport: The lesson for a six-year-old - Soccer Kane Jackson, aged six, is a football prodigy - according to his agent, anyway. Whatever the merits of that, it is clear the lad has already mastered the key elements of modern professional sport: the agent and a boot contract; a disarming, photogenic smile; and a level of public exposure for which most endorsement-hungry professionals would kill. There is just one obstacle to a glittering future. Kane wants to sign for Manchester United. United manager Alex Ferguson boasted this week about his rich crop of teenage talent. This includes four members of the England squad that won the European under-18 tournament last summer - Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Chris Casper. Then there is Kevin Gillespie, a slight, tricky winger from Northern Ireland who looked the best of the lot as United's youth team marched to the FA Youth Cup final last season. Inevitably, tabloid newspapers have dubbed Ferguson's youngsters his 'babes' - an echo of United's greatest team, the Busby Babes, destroyed in the Munich airport crash 36 years ago last week. These youngsters have been given first team squad numbers, and they train and travel with the first team. Even so, this season they have made just two first-team appearances between them, both as substitutes: Butt in the league against Spurs and Neville against Galatasaray in Istanbul when the European Cup tie was already lost. Compare that with the other members of the European Under-18 squad. Robbie Fowler was in the Liverpool first team, and the club's top scorer, until he broke his leg. Julian Joachim is a regular, when fit, at Leicester City, while Darren Caskey and Sol Campbell have started most of Tottenham's games this season. It could be that youngsters playing against seasoned professionals are more susceptible to injury. And, after United beat Spurs at White Hart Lane, Ferguson noted that Tottenham's young players looked tired. Their manager, Ossie Ardiles, agreed - but added that the experience they were getting would make them better players. The problem is that picking teenagers is a risk, not just to the players but to the progress of the team - and Ferguson rarely takes that risk. Indeed, his squad contains only three established players who came through United's youth team: Ryan Giggs; Lee Sharpe, who cannot win a place in the first team; and Mark Hughes, whose Old Trafford career has been broken by spells at Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Ferguson has always preferred to buy the finished article. Earlier this season he sold his son, Darren, a skilful midfielder to Wolves. Darren's chances of first team football had largely disappeared with the arrival of the expensive Roy Keane from Nottingham Forest. Keane is just six months older than Darren - yet, by the end of last season, he had played 114 games in the top division for Forest, while Darren, a Scottish under-21 international, had played just 24 for United. In spite of Ferguson's team romping clear at the top of the Premier league, he cannot have forgotten the experience of two years ago when more or less the same squad looked a championship certainty but capitulated after Leeds put on the pressure. If he cannot work out how to keep winning while giving his youngsters experience, they could find in a few years that their manager, needing battle-hardened players in their positions, has gone out and bought such veterans as Joachim and Caskey to fill them. The lesson seems clear: if Kane Jackson really wants to play for United, he should become a junior at Forest.</p>

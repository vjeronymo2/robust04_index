Paraguay and Bolivia also stated that they are committed to  fighting the drug trade, and agreed to hold permanent  consultations between senior officers of their two countries.  The Paraguayan Government supports "the search for a negotiated  agreement" to provide Bolivia with an outlet to the Pacific  Ocean. Sanchez de Lozada has characterized this goal as "an  unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people."    In the joint declaration, which was signed at Lopez Palace,  Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada attached special significance to  the Pilcomayo River, but did not go into detail. They agreed,  however, to invite President Menem to a joint meeting to  undertake joint projects. They have not set any specific date  for this meeting. They have also acknowledged that the abuse of  and illegal trade in narcotics and dangerous substances are a  serious threat to the health and well-being of all peoples, and  noted that all nations must assume their share of responsibility  in fighting this scourge at every level and in all of its forms.  They reiterated their commitment to fighting the drug trade,  and agreed to urgently implement bilateral actions.    To strengthen friendly relations and cooperation between  their two countries, they have decided -- based on a proposal  from the Bolivian Government -- to hold consultations between  senior officers of their respective Armed Forces, through  periodic meetings to be held at least once a year, alternating  in Bolivia and Paraguay.    Regarding the gas pipeline, Wasmosy and Sanchez de Lozada  emphasized the work of the energy technical commission that is  studying the sale to Paraguay of Bolivian natural gas through  the gas pipeline project, of liquefied gas, and of gasoline.  They conveyed their desire to have the project implemented as  soon as possible with the participation of the private sectors  of both countries.    They also expressed their satisfaction over the progress and  consolidation of the democratic system both in the world and  within the region. They regard this as a guarantee for the full  exercise of human rights and a necessary condition for achieving  socioeconomic development.    They also mentioned the efforts made to find formulas that  would enable Bolivia to gradually move closer to and join  Mercosur [Common Market of the South].    They agreed on the need to strengthen the Agreement on  Coordination and Cooperation among Bolivia, Paraguay, and  Uruguay (Urupabol), which was reactivated on 16 October 1993,  and emphasized the consultations taking place among the three  countries with a view to holding, as soon as possible, a meeting  of their three foreign ministers.    Among other points, President Wasmosy informed his Bolivian  counterpart that the Paraguayan Government is studying a project  to build a dam in Bahia Negra to check the Paraguay River water  flow. He noted that this project will generate a development  process in vast areas in the region, will make the river  navigable along its entire course, and will decrease ecological  risks.    They also stated that it would be useful to improve customs  monitoring at their common border. A customs office will be set  up in General Garay. Sanchez de Lozada stated that the goal of  obtaining a sovereign outlet to the Pacific Ocean is a  fundamental topic in Bolivian foreign policy, and "an  unrenounceable right of the Bolivian people." Wasmosy voiced  his government's unwavering support in the search for a  negotiated agreement on this issue.</p>

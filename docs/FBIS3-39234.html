He described a DPA report, according to which the strength of  the Bundeswehr "will probably be reduced to 300,000 men" as  "completely unfounded." However, the news agency confirmed today  that it received the information from reliable sources. DPA  reported that, because of the bad financial situation, it will  not be possible to keep a strength of 370,000, as agreed between  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Former Soviet State President Mikhail  Gorbachev in the Caucasus.</p>

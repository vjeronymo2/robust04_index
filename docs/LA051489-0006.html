			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Please permit me to strongly reinforce David Boatman's comments. Kelly Lange  would do well to eliminate her cutesy efforts to be sparkling with the Fritzie,  Dougie, etc. Morrison would do better to wipe those grimaces off his face and  drop the "doons and oots" to portray a more serious, knowledgeable anchorman.  </P> <P> Marwin H.

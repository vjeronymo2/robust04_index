Alexander Aguirre, DILG undersecretary for peace and order  and a member of the panel, told the CHRONICLE the issues to be  resolved by the technical and ad hoc working committees of both  panels between now and the second week of February were: Muslim  representation in government, defense, administrative systems,  economic and financial systems, and education.    Aguirre said the issues were raised during a five-hour  meeting between the two committees at the MNLF headquarters in  Barangay [village] Timbangan, Indangan, Sulu last Tuesday.    In that meeting, Yusbar Jamil, the Indonesian Embassy's  Councilor-Minister, and Indonesian Ambassador Rajab Azzarouo [as  published], acted as moderators. Batangas Representative  Eduardo Ermita, vice chairman of the government panel, headed  the government's group of technical committees while MNLF  Chairman Nur Misuari himself was Ermita's counterpart.    Aguirre said the technical committees of both panels would  be  holding a series of meetings in Manila, Zamboanga City and  Cotabato City to hammer out a common stand on the issues.    The technical committees' output will then be submitted for  review and final approval by the government and MNLF peace  panels after the second week of February, in time for the  resumption of formal talks in March.    "The peace process is on course and there are positive  indications that true reconciliation will be achieved," Aguirre  said, adding that the recent meeting in Sulu was "cordial and  conciliatory."    The undersecretary also said there was a need for both  panels  to reconcile differing views on autonomy, which though granted  under the Constitution, was interpreted differently by both  sides.</p>

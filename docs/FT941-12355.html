			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Redundancy fears decline sharply in January Fears of redundancy and becoming unemployed fell sharply in January, the latest monthly survey from MORI, commissioned by the Financial Times and Industrial Relations Services, shows today. The proportion of workers who said they were 'very' or 'fairly' concerned about the prospect of losing their job during the next 12 months fell 7 percentage points to 44 per cent from 51 per cent in December. This represents the largest monthly fall in employee concern over job security since the FT/MORI survey began last April. It suggests there is growing optimism among those in work about the labour market outlook 11 months after Britain's official, seasonally adjusted registered unemployment began to decline. Mrs Lilian Bennett, chief executive of employment agency Manpower UK, said yesterday: 'Our own findings suggest a marked improvement in employee self-confidence about the future.' Mrs Hilary Skarratt, head of marketing at Alfred Marks, the recruitment consultants, said there had been a 'significant' increase in the numbers of employed people looking for new jobs. 'This indicates people are becoming less anxious about their prospects,' she added. This month's drop in the poll findings reverses the upward if volatile trend that began last October, but the proportion of employees anxious about their job security still remains high. It was lower last September at 43 per cent. While 24 per cent of workers were 'very' concerned this month about the chances of becoming unemployed compared with 28 per cent in December, 20 per cent were 'fairly concerned', down from 23 per cent in the previous month. The most significant trend in the survey was among those aged 35 to 54 who are in employment. Here there was an 11 percentage-point drop in those concerned about their job security to 43 per cent from 54 per cent in December. There was also a noticeable 10-point decline to 47 per cent in concern among unskilled and semi-skilled manual workers in social classes DE. By contrast, the proportion of employees in social classes AB concerned about job security fell by only 5 points this month to 35 per cent. Workers in the north and the Midlands are much less concerned than those employed in southern England. There was a 9-point drop in concern in the north to 43 per cent, and an 8-point decline in the Midlands to 41 per cent. Anxiety has fallen in the south, but it still remains higher there at 47 per cent compared with 52 per cent in December. The MORI survey was based on interviews with 1,045 adults aged 18 and over, who work both full and part-time, across 146 constituency sampling points throughout Great Britain weighted to match the profile of the population. Interviews took place between January 20 and 24.</p>

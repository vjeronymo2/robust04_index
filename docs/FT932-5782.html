			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Observer: Royal reject Pity Yasuyuki Tatsumi, a furniture-maker based in western Japan, who seems to have got rather carried away in his desire to please his royal client. Masako Owada, who marries her Crown Prince next week, had ordered three wooden chests from Tatsumi in February. In spite of polite refusals by the thrifty Owada, Tatsumi insisted on lining the chests with 1,500 sheets of 15 square centimeter gold leaf, and gave a press conference to show off his handiwork. But now the chests have been returned to sender and the Owadas have asked the TV stations, which last week highlighted the gift, to set the record straight. At Dollars 280,000 apiece, the royal rejects could lead to a bit of indigestion in the world's second hand chest market.</p>

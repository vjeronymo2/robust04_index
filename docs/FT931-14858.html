			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Investment cut planned by Japan Airlines JAPAN Airlines yesterday announced drastic restructuring plans aimed at reversing pre-tax losses estimated at Y50bn (Dollars 398m) for the year to March 1993. Over the next two years, the airline plans to cut investment by Y100bn a year and costs by Y100bn next year. Total investment for 1993-97 is projected at Y1,000bn rather than the original Y1,600bn. JAL says this will enable it to break even in the next financial year, return to profitability in 1994, and restore dividends in 1995. The airline made pre-tax losses of Y6.4bn last year. Restructuring plans were first announced in June, but deepening losses have made further action necessary. JAL blames its difficulties on falling international passenger demand, particularly from business travellers, and increased competition. The main target of capital spending cuts will be the introduction of new aircraft.</p>

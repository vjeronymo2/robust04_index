			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Applicants state that FKLA seeks to maintain a ratio of capital to assets that is established based on its judgment of the risks represented by various components of its assets and liabilities. Applicants state that maintaining the ratio of capital to assets is critical to offering competitively priced products and, as to FKLA, to maintaining a competitive rating from various rating agencies. Consequently, Applicants state that FKLA's capital should grow at least at the same rate as do its assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Using a corporate federal income tax rate of 35% and assuming a discount rate of 8%, the present value of the federal income tax effect of the increased deductions allowable in the following 10 years, which partially offsets the increased federal income tax burden, comes to $174.60. The effect of Section 848 on the Contracts is, therefore, an increased federal income tax burden with a present value of $81.43 for each $10,000 of net premiums, i.e., $256.03 minus $174.60. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. State premium taxes are deductible in computing federal income taxes. Thus, FKLA does not incur incremental federal income tax when it passes on state premium taxes to owners of the Contracts. Conversely, federal income taxes are not deductible in computing FKLA's federal income taxes. To compensate FKLA fully for the impact of Section 848, therefore, it would be necessary to allow FKLA to impose an additional charge that would make it whole not only for the $81.43 additional federal income tax burden attributable to Section 848 but also for the federal income tax on the additional $81.43 itself. This federal income tax can be determined by dividing $81.43 by the complement of the 35% federal corporate income tax rate, i.e., 65%, resulting in an additional charge of $125.28 for each $10,000 of net premiums, or 1.25%. However, FKLA currently intends to deduct 1.00% of each premium payment under the Contracts, which is less than its increased federal corporate income tax burden. FKLA reserves the rights to increase the charge and to deduct up to 1.25% of each premium payment of Future Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Based on prior experience, FKLA expects that all of its current and future deductions will be fully taken. Applicants represent that the maximum 1.25% charge, and the current 1.00% charge, to be deducted pursuant to the relief requested, are reasonably related to their increased federal income tax burden under Section 848, taking into account the capitalization and amortization permitted by Section 848, and the use by FKLA of a discount rate of 8% in computing the future deductions resulting from such capitalization and amortization, such rate being lower than, but assumed for these purposes to be the equivalent of, FKLA's cost of capital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. While the application states that FKLA believes that a charge of 1.00% of premium payments would reimburse it for the impact of Section 848 (as currently written) on FKLA's federal income tax liabilities, the application also states, however, that FKLA believes that it will have to increase this charge if any future change in, or interpretation of Section 848, or any successor provision, results in an increased federal income tax burden due to the receipt of premiums. Such an increase could result from a change in the corporate federal income tax rate, a change in the 7.7% figure, a change in the categorization of specified insurance contracts, or a change in the amortization period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an order to the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) exempting them from the provisions of Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4)(v) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit deductions to be made from premium payments received in connection with the Contracts. The deductions would be in an amount that is reasonable in relation to the increased federal income tax burden related to the receipt of such premiums. Applicants further request an exemption from Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4) under the 1940 Act to premit the proposed deductions to be treated as other than ``sales load'' for the purposes of Section 27 of the 1940 and the exemptions from various provisions of that Section found in Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission may by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security or transaction from any provision of the 1940 Act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and the provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits the sale of periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (except such amounts as are deducted for sales load) are held under an indenture or agreement containing in substance the provisions required by Sections 26(a)(2) and 26(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. Certain provisions of Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) provide a range of exemptive relief for the offering of variable life insurance policies such as the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

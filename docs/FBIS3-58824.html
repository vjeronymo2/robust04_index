			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Political Parties Are Already </F> Wrangling About Van Thijn's Successor"]    [Text] The appointment of Amsterdam Mayor E. van Thijn as  home affairs minister is uncontested in national politics. The  large parties value his administrative qualities. But his  departure from Amsterdam has launched an immediate struggle over  the question of which political party is to supply his successor.    D66 [Democrats 66] says that given polls of voters'  intentions, it is no longer self-evident that the PvdA [Labor  Party] should provide a candidate. D66 holds few mayor's  positions and none in the four large cities. The fact that VVD  [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] alderman P. de Grave  is to become acting mayor has raised questions, because De Grave  is also the VVD's leading candidate in the municipal elections.    On 15 January the cabinet voted unanimously in favor of the  nomination of Van Thijn to succeed minister Dales, who died last  week. PvdA party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Kok said that  in his view Van Thijn "was the first choice and the best  candidate."    Van Thijn has much political and governmental experience and  briefly held the position of home affairs minister in 1981.  Last weekend Kok let there be no misunderstanding that he  wanted a heavyweight like Van Thijn to strengthen the PvdA in  the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the subsequent  formation of a government.    Van Thijn had planned to give up his position as mayor no  sooner than next year, when his second term of office was due to  end. Kok put an end to the plan. "The PvdA needs you," he told  Van Thijn. The party leader also wants him to remain minister in  the following cabinet should the PvdA participate in government.  "Although you can neither give nor ask for guarantees on that  sort of thing," Kok said.    Prime Minister Lubbers said on Saturday [15 January] that  Van  Thijn's appointment would present Amsterdam with problems, just  before the municipal elections. "But that was no reason not to  appoint him," Lubbers said. "The problem would have occurred  soon anyway, because he had indicated that he did not want a  third term in office."    Today Van Thijn will resign formally as mayor and will be  sworn in tomorrow by Queen Beatrix. Lubbers did not want to  speculate on the political color of the future mayor of  Amsterdam. "In the first place that is a question for the  Queen's commissioner in North Holland, who is approaching a  successor in consultation with the municipal council."</p>

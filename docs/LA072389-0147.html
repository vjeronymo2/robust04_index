"I ran my 40-yard test before  camp, I went downtown to take my physical before I came here, and I was staying  at the team hotel (in El Segundo)."  </P> <P> The Raiders began camp with only six draft choices, two of whom were sent to  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for tests.  </P> <P> Wide receiver Gary Gooden of Indiana suffered a knee injury in practice Friday,  while defensive lineman Charles Jackson from Jackson State has a nagging  shoulder injury.  </P></p>

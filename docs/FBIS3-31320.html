The talks were attended  by Brigadier General Vahid Karavelic, commander of the 1st Corps  of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The subject of the talks was the UNPROFOR activity to  implement the 10 February NATO declaration on removing Serbian  aggressor's heavy weapons to 20 km from Sarajevo and putting it  under UNPROFOR control. On this occasion, Gen. Jean Cot  informed generals Delic and Karavelic about UNPROFOR activities  undertaken so far on implementing NATO's decisions, expressing  their total determination to bring to a successful conclusion  the job that has been begun.    During today's talks, Gen.

Apart from the talks on withdrawing the Serbian aggressor's  artillery from around Sarajevo, also touched upon were measures  that the international community and UNPROFOR should undertake  to stop the offensive on Bihac, a region that the Security  Council has proclaimed a protected zone.</p>

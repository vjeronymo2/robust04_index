			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (15): Easy way to Russia - Expert negotiators were vital to a new enterprise but one of their conditions was staying put, so the company set up to work remotely / Examining the technology it selected - User view MARKETING pharmaceuticals to Russia and other former Soviet states is a job that demands high-quality, specialised skills. And, as John Dyer, managing director of the Hollister Group of companies points out, most of the qualified people are of an age and experience to have established families, and are not keen to relocate, however exciting the opportunity with a young company such as Hollister. 'We use teleworking exclusively for our operations. We deal direct with large institutions, ministries and government, and for that we need experienced people who have worked for pharmaceutical companies, wherever they are,' he explains. Hollister has staff in Norfolk, north London and Hammersmith in west London, all equipped with Macintosh computers, using Mac Connect software and ISDN lines. Another is coming on-line soon in Heathrow. 'We have Macs because they are far and away the best business machines, they are quick to learn, intuitive to use and inherently simpler.' The Planet board gives access to ISDN; any alternatives, says Dyer, were painfully slow. Going into ISDN is simple, with a point-and-click menu and a list of pre-programmed numbers: the whole process can be made into one shorthand keystroke. Hollister used a local Cambridge consultant, System Support, to advise, specify and implement the system. It still provides 24-hour support and advice if needed when unfamiliar software is used. The equipment cost about Pounds 6,000 per installation. 'The business benefits of teleworking are clear' says Dyer. 'I can employ people who otherwise wouldn't work for me. We can all communicate easily, and standardise on systems.' He uses his own Powerbook system at home and when travelling. On the whole, teleworking has proved very straightforward, although the one disadvantage is that the employees miss social interaction in the office, and so regular reviews and contact is necessary. 'However, most people love it - and with ISDN we can operate all over the world,' says Dyer.                          *       *      * SUPPLIER PROFILE Software: Mac Connect's TheLink software with Planet ISDN card.

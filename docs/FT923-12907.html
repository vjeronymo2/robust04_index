			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / French row over 'rule by judges' re-opens: The latest clash between politicians and the judicial investigation system A NEWSPAPER report that the Socialist president of the national assembly - constitutionally the third most important man in France - might be charged with political corruption has provoked the latest clash between France's politicians and its judicial investigation system. The case has aroused alarm among all political parties, including the opposition, who fear that parts of the French magistracy may be running a political campaign. The magistrate in charge of an inquiry into Socialist party finances, Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke, refused to confirm or deny the report about assembly president Mr Henri Emmanuelli before taking a month's holiday to leave all involved to stew in impotent fury. President Francois Mitterrand has leapt to the defence of Mr Emmanuelli, a former Socialist party treasurer, and urged fast adoption of plans to reform criminal justice, to improve the rights of defendants and reduce the considerable powers of juges d'instruction, or examining magistrates. France cannot be allowed to 'fall under a government of judges', warns Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice minister. Magistrates' unions have replied that justice must be done, whoever stands to be charged. The row is being seen as the latest blow to the Socialists' reputation, after the truckers' strike and a court case over Aids-contaminated blood in the public transfusion service. It centres on a politically charged inquiry into alleged payments by construction companies into Socialist party coffers some time during Mr Emmanuelli's period as treasurer from July 1988 to January 1992. The case attracted national attention in January when Mr Van Ruymbeke led a raid on Mr Emmanuelli's former office at party headquarters in search of documents relating to a link between the party and Urba, a construction company in Le Mans. He arrived, embarrassingly, on the same day as Mr Laurent Fabius moved in as the party's new first secretary, a coincidence which guaranteed television coverage for Mr Van Ruymbeke and fuelled suspicions that he might be politically motivated. Mr Van Ruymbeke knows very well that the Urba case is a thorn in the Socialists' side. He took over the inquiry into possible payments by Urba to Socialist officials in western France after another examining magistrate, Mr Thierry Jean-Pierre, was asked by a tribunal in Le Mans to drop the case last year. The political opposition was enraged at the time by what it saw as government interference in a case that could harm the Socialists and demanded the resignation of the then justice minister. The judiciary, for its part, has felt that it has been the victim of political interference for years. Magistrates were deeply angered three years ago - to the extent of going on strike - when the government gave amnesty to many of the people responsible for the once widespread practice of resorting to corruption to raise cash for political parties. The amnesty was designed to allow all involved to turn over a new leaf before the introduction of tough new rules on party financing. It did not cover those who enriched themselves rather than their parties, as a result of which more than two dozen businessmen are on trial over allegations relating to the 1988 presidential campaign. Since the amnesty, the government has on the whole pursued its anti-corruption drive with determination, though it is not clear how deeply it was involved with the removal of Mr Jean-Pierre from the Urba inquiry. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, is planning to table new laws against political corruption in the autumn. At the same time, he is pushing on with the penal code reforms, to clip the investigating magistrates' wings. The wide powers of Mr Van Ruymbeke and his colleagues are an outstanding feature of the French criminal justice system. They make inquiries or can order the police to do so, question witnesses, decide alone whether to bring charges and whether the defendant should be held in custody. Often young and on moderate salaries, they take pride in staging elaborate investigations and claim to be ready to root out the truth at any cost. Mr Van Ruymbeke has even more power himself, because he is an adviser to the prosecuting court and as such does not have to account to the public prosecutor. This quietly spoken, 39-year-old, Rennes-based lawyer, who denies any political motivation, has taken on big targets throughout his professional life. One of his earliest cases was against a former Gaullist labour minister in the early 1970s, who committed suicide after Mr Van Ruymbeke examined his bank account in connection with an alleged bribe. (A subsequent inquiry cleared Mr Van Ruymbeke of any impropriety.) The advantage of giving magistrates such wide powers is that they are in theory just as interested in proving innocence as guilt, unlike the police, who are understandably more prosecution-minded. The main control on French examining magistrates' powers is that their cases must be scrutinised by a higher court before going to trial. As a result, French higher courts have a greater conviction rate than in the UK, for instance. However, the government believes that the controls on examining magistrates are inadequate in two senses. There is the often unfair damage a juge d'instruction can inflict on a person's reputation. It also believes that there are too many people held in French prisons awaiting trial or judgment  -nearly 41 per cent of the total. So the penal code reform, to be voted in parliament next autumn, would be to abandon the crude principle of charging defendants. Instead, there would be a two-step procedure: an examination followed by a summons. Defendants would have access to the magistrates' documents from the start. Examining magistrates would no longer be allowed to place their own defendants in custody. That decision would instead be made by a panel of three magistrates not involved in the case. In the meantime, Mr Van Ruymbeke and his colleagues can be expected to make the fullest possible use of their existing powers, however much this might irritate the government.</p>

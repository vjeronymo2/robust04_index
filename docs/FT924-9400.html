			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trinidad scraps duty to boost output IN AN effort to attract new and larger investors to its petroleum sector and to arrest a decline in crude oil production, Trinidad and Tobago has changed its legislation on the petroleum industry and is offering incentives to new participants. The government is repealing an oil recovery duty imposed five years ago, and is increasing the rate of its petroleum profits tax from 45 per cent to 50 per cent. Under the recovery duty, oil companies paid rates of 1 per cent if their taxable income was below Dollars 5m a year, 2 per cent on income between Dollars 5m and Dollars 15m, and 3 per cent on income in excess of Dollars 15m. According to Mr Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, the change in the legislation will cost the country about Dollars 35m this year. He said, however, that this loss was a sacrifice for the longer term benefit to the country in anticipated increased investment in the petroleum sector. He said the government intended to provide incentives 'for increasing activity in the petroleum sector, particularly activity which will help to arrest the declining trend of production'. The country needed to attract major oil companies which would be willing to drill to depths of 20,000 feet if necessary, the minister said. 'At that depth we are looking at costs of Dollars 20m per well, and such capital is not available to our small companies.' Trinidad and Tobago's crude oil production has fallen steadily from an average of 168,999 barrels a day in 1986 to an average of 138,900 b/d in the first half of this year. The country's petroleum sector is to benefit from a Dollars 411m project for secondary oil recovery and refinery expansion, which is being financed by the Inter-American Development Bank, the Japan Import-Export Bank, the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the European Investment Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the state-owned oil company.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Prices squeeze deflates Smurfit JEFFERSON Smurfit, the Irish paper and packaging group with operations throughout Europe and the Americas, yesterday reported a 16 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits which it blamed on 'continuing price erosion' and some volume reductions. Pre-tax profits fell from IPounds 60.3m (Pounds 57.9m) to IPounds 50.7m in the six months to July 31. Sales rose from IPounds 654m to IPounds 749.5m, reflecting the inclusion of UK Corrugated, Cundell and Irish Paper Products for the first time. Earnings per share dropped by 18.7 per cent to 7.4p (9.1p) but the directors declared an unchanged interim dividend of 1.2306p. The shares slipped 8p to close at 214p. Mr Michael Smurfit, chairman, said the results 'continue to reflect both the severity of the current world recession and the state of our industry'. Trading profits dropped to IPounds 39.5m, from IPounds 59.3m, but the decline was partly offset by a quadrupling of net interest receipts to IPounds 11.6m. Since the year-end, net cash declined from IPounds 150m to IPounds 24m, aggravated by currency devaluation. Mr Ray Curran, chief financial officer, said that Latin America had again been the 'mainstay'. Operating profits there slipped to IPounds 28.5m (IPounds 30.6m) but the region increased its share of overall profits from 53 to 73 per cent. The deepening recession in continental Europe resulted in lost volumes in all operations with prices deteriorating as the group struggled to maintain market share. Sales fell by 13 per cent and profits dropped by 41 per cent to IPounds 9.67m. The newly combined Ireland/UK region had a difficult first half mainly because of a 'disappointing performance' by the UK print and carton companies. Corrugated volumes in the UK were higher but that was more than offset by lower prices. Despite a slight profit increase in Ireland, the combined region posted a 20 per cent decline in operating profits to IPounds 11.5m. JSC/CCA, the US associate, suffered from the sluggish economy and excessive paperboard inventories, while improving newsprint demand had yet to lift prices. Losses attributable to the US operations increased from IPounds 4.06m to IPounds 10.7m. The US associate has announced plans for a Dollars 150m (Dollars 100m after tax) rationalisation programme which is likely to result in the group taking an IPounds 25m exceptional charge.

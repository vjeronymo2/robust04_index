			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television Amsterdam is an unusually photogenic city and Barry Foster an actor who occasionally turns in an impressive performance, yet Van der Valk has never been one of my favourite detective series. Still, the new two-hour episodes produced by ITV may prove as successful as those great slabs of 'Inspector Morse' in ratings terms. Today's story is about South American drug dealers, money laundering, diamonds - pretty much what you expect (8.00). As a conscientious objector in a non-combatant job my father taught PT. In my schooldays we did gym. When my children were at school they did PE. Now, it seems, more and more children do no form of exercise at school. Told that regular exercise is a key factor in building a healthy heart and that the seeds of heart disease are sown in childhood, Dispatches discovers that only five per cent of boys and even fewer girls are doing enough exercise to develop healthy hearts (9.00 C4). The final part of BBC1's biography, Churchill (9.30), covers the last 20 years from the end of the war until the death of the old warhorse in 1965, including his failure to win the 1945 election and his success in 1951 at the age of 76.</p>

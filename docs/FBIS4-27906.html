			<p>CSO     [Text] (London, 21 May--Hiroshi Inoue) The European Union  (EU) has made a decision to recommend to the United States  establishment of a joint project involving Japan, the United  States, and Europe to devise international technical standards  for the next-generation information highway. The EU is about to  complete work on the European edition of the "information  highway concept" by the end of this month and participate in a  joint project to develop standards with the United States which  is engaged in a similar project, but has decided to persuade the  United States of the three-region approach in view of opposition  from U.S. industry over the idea of adding Japan to the joint  effort. However, the EU has cited as a condition for the  three-region approach implementation of deregulation by Japan,  signaling the need for Japan to clearly provide deregulation in  the area of information and telecommunications as part of the  external economic measures outline to be completed by the end of  June.    According to European information industry sources, EU and  U.S. representatives met in New York last month and agreed to a  mutual linkup of the U.S. "information superhighway" and the  European next-generation high-speed communications network as  well as the joint development of applicable standards. They also  discussed joint research with Japan, but U.S. industry  representatives expressed strong reluctance to joint development  with Japan for fear of an expansion in Japan's share of related  programs.    The U.S. Government will propose the formulation of  standards  for international linkage of next-generation high-speed  communications networks at the International Telecommunication  Union (ITU) plenary meeting to be held in Japan in September.  The objective of U.S. industry sources is to have Japan adopt  standards developed under the auspices of the United States.    In previous conferences, the U.S. side appears to have asked  the EU side to collaborate in the suggested approach, after  pointing out that if next-generation high-speed communications  network standards were jointly developed with an equal voice  exercised by Japan, the United States, and Europe, the risk  existed that Japanese information and communications equipment  makers would expand their market share in Europe and the United  States.    In response, the EU pointed out that influential Japanese  computer makers are already deeply involved because of a central  role being played in European programs by British ICL, which is  80-percent owned by Fujitsu, and French Bull, in which NEC has a  4.43-percent interest, and therefore advocated that "Japan  should be included in the development of standards."    However, some sources in the EU embrace the position that  "unification of standards should be handled primarily by the  United States and Europe, and Japan should be limited to a role  of joint development," which means that in order for Japan to  gain the support of the EU, it must make major concessions on  the deregulation issue as strongly advocated by the United  States and the EU.</p>

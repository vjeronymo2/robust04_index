			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / By-election blow for Fianna Fail Two by-elections and 80 local council elections in Ireland held the same day as the European election last Thursday have badly shaken the coalition government. Fianna Fail, the senior coalition partner, has lost the two seats it was defending in the Dail (Irish parliament). One of them - a marginal seat in Dublin - has gone to the Democratic Left party. Of much greater concern for Fianna Fail, however, is the loss of what was believed to be a secure seat in the west of Ireland formerly held by Mr Padraig Flynn, Ireland's member of the European Commission, which was being defended by his daughter, Ms Beverly Cooper Flynn. The seat went to the conservative opposition candidate, Mr Michael Ring of Fine Gael. In the local elections, the Labour party, the junior coalition partner, has seen its vote slump to 11 per cent from the 19.5 per cent it obtained in the 1992 general election.</p>

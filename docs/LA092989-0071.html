			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> DOW RISES 21.85 IN BIGGEST GAIN SINCE AUGUST  </P> <P> The stock market chalked up its best gain in five weeks Thursday in an advance  led by environmental, pharmaceutical and other "growth" issues.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 21.85 to close at 2,694.91, its  best showing since Aug. 24 when it jumped 56.53 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 918 up, 536 down and 503 unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.24 million shares, against  158.40 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in  NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and  in the over-the-counter market, totaled 196.73 million shares.  </P> <P> The advance was "very selective," said Larry Wachtel, analyst at  Prudential-Bache Securities. "The theme for the day was 'out of earnings  uncertainty and into earnings certainty.' "  </P> <P> That meant, he said, a flow of money from technology stocks and other sectors  that have lately produced earnings disappointments, to groups like the drug and  pollution-control stocks regarded as holding out the promise of steady growth.  </P> <P> IBM shares, down 6 on Wednesday, dropped another 2 1/2 to 109 as the most  active Big Board issue. Digital Equipment lost 1 3/4 to 91 7/8 and  Hewlett-Packard was down 7/8 at 50 3/8.  </P> <P> In the pollution-control sector, by contrast, three firms hit new highs: Waste  Management, up 2 5/8 at 65 3/4; Wheelabrator Technologies, up 2 1/2 at 41 3/8,  and Browning-Ferris, up 1 3/8 at 41 3/8.  </P> <P> Gainers among the pharmaceuticals included Abbott Laboratories, up 1 7/8 at 64,  and Pfizer, up 1 at 68 3/8. Investors also bid up consumer growth issues such  as Philip Morris, up 4 1/2 at 165, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 3 1/2 at 120  3/4.  </P> <P> AMR Corp. rose 4 3/4 to 83 3/4. Besides rumors of domestic investors eyeing  AMR, some market watchers speculated that a deal with Lufthansa Airlines is in  the works.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks surged to a record close. The key 225-share Nikkei index  climbed 319.41 points, or 0.90%, to 35,689.98.  </P> <P> In London, stock prices fell sharply in thin trading. The Financial Times-Stock  Exchange 100-share index fell 39.5 points, or 1.7%, to 2,291.7.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices dipped slightly in slow trading.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 3/32 point, or slightly less  than $1 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price  falls, inched up to 8.25% from 8.24% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Bonds were hurt after a savings and loan dumped a rumored $800 million worth of  mortgage-backed securities on the market and buyers of them hedged by selling  bond futures contracts.  </P> <P> But the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was helped by a Dow Jones News Service  report, citing unidentified officials, that said the Resolution Funding Corp.  might not begin issuing bonds to bail out the savings and loan industry until  next year.  </P> <P> The long bond has been weighed down by prospects that $5 billion of the Refcorp  bonds could flood the market in early October.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term,  intermediate-term and long-term government issues fell about 1/8 point,  according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information  service.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.14% as the discount added 6  basis points to 7.88%. Yields on six-month bills were unchanged at 8.26% as the  discount remained at 7.83%. Yields on one-year bills increased to 8.43% as the  discount advanced 6 basis points to 7.83%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 9.25%, up from 9% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar moved mostly higher although central banks again put pressure on the  currency, acting on a belief that the dollar's advance this year could have  unpleasant economic consequences.  </P> <P> Gold bullion prices finished with minor changes in the United States after  moving lower overseas. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of  $366.90 for an ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, up 70 cents from Wednesday's late  bid.  </P> <P> John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at the New York office of the Amsterdam  Rotterdam Bank, said trading volume was moderate and punctuated by rounds of  central bank intervention.  </P> <P> Activity has slackened in recent days with dealers unwinding positions as the  month ends. Trading maneuvers tied to the close of Japan's fiscal year on Sept.  30 also has reduced liquidity in the currency markets, he said.  </P> <P> "The central banks intervened three or four times," said McCarthy. "It did have  the desired effect -- the dollar is closing lower than where it opened in New  York" but above Wednesday's late levels.  </P> <P> In earlier European trading, the dollar rose against most major currencies  despite persistent dollar selling by the monetary authorities.  </P> <P> Dealers in London said they received buy orders from traders who expressed  confidence in the dollar's underlying strength.  </P> <P> In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar closed at 140.85 Japanese yen, down from  141.35.

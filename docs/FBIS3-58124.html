Parallel to the  decision to deliver 39 former warships from the NVA [National  People's Army of the former GDR] to the highly indebted  island-state, the Federal Security Council has also approved the  export of a 209 class submarine. Bonn has also given the green  light for the options for the construction of two further  submarines. The article is based on Bonn's response to a  question from SPD [Social Democratic Party] Bundestag deputies  on arms deals with Indonesia, the paper writes (Friday [7  January] edition).    The submarines, each of which costs 665.1 million German  marks [DM], are covered by the Hermes government export credit  guarantee. At the same time, the Federal Government has  admitted that, contrary to previous statements, it has only  partially demilitarized the former NVA ships or has supplied  them as complete weapons systems to the Indonesian Navy, it is  further reported. Sixteen "Parchim" ships have thus been handed  over to the Indonesian Navy in a fully equipped state. The  delivery of the 39 NVA ships has also been guaranteed to the  tune of DM689.9 million.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Clinton in Europe: Europe undergoes change in defence identity The US and Britain were both determined that the Nato summit - the alliance's first since 1991 - should not be dominated by Bosnia. But it was Bosnia and the deal Washington was negotiating to get rid of nuclear weapons in Ukraine that took the headlines. If the substance of the meeting appeared less dramatic, it was because it was all foretold, carefully prepared over several months to avoid surprises and clashes. Apart from one addition hardening the threat of air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces, there were no last-minute changes to the joint declaration drafted in advance of the meeting. It was a contrast to previous Nato meetings at which officials have spent whole nights haggling over wording. No longer held together by a military threat, Nato could not afford confrontation. Both the US, which proposed it, and the European allies wanted it to renew their relationship. The Europeans obtained from President Bill Clinton a strong commitment to Nato and a promise to keep around 100,000 troops in Europe, a third of the US presence in the cold war. The 16 leaders endorsed a gradualist policy towards incorporating former communist countries of the Warsaw pact, inviting them and other non-Nato nations in Europe to sign up to military co-operation under the Partnership for Peace programme. They backed other US proposals to involve Nato in dealing with new threats resulting from the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and to set up new command arrangements to cope better with peacekeeping and other missions. An aspect that attracted less attention was the unprecedented emphasis given to Europe's role in defence in line with the ambitions of the Maastricht treaty. In the 26 paragraphs of the joint declaration issued at the end of the two-day metting yesterday, the mystical catchphrase 'European security and defence identity' is mentioned no fewer than seven times, 'the European pillar of the alliance' five times, and the Western European Union, the body destined to evolve as the EU's defence arm, eight times. Washington has become a firm supporter of a stronger European role, to a degree that may make British policymakers a little uncomfortable. The US, traditionally suspicious of any threat to its leadership of Nato, is no longer willing to provide the resources needed to hold the alliance up on its own - thus the need for a more solid European pillar. Mr Clinton recognised yesterday that the WEU would have an important role in future, although Nato would remain 'the linchpin of mutual security'. The planned new command structure for Combined Joint Task Forces, to be built into existing Nato headquarters, is designed to create a bridge between the two bodies. It will include the French, who are not part of the alliance's military organisation but have moved closer to the Nato mainstream in the field of 'peace support' activities, in which they provide the largest number of UN troops. The flexible command arrangements will enable the WEU to deploy task forces in cases where Nato - or the US - does not want to participate. Some European allies, however, are wary of giving the US an effective veto on WEU operations. Any use of jointly-held Nato military assets would have to be approved by all 16 allies. The joint task force arrangements could also bring in non-Nato European countries. Mr Clinton said the new structure would help to put the Partnership for Peace programme into action by providing 'a vehicle for eastern militaries to operate with Nato forces'. Multinational troop formations already form the basis of Nato's post-cold war troop structure in Europe, but it is questionable how usable they are for deployments outside allied territory. Mr Manfred Worner, the organisation's secretary general, said that the allies had 'made Nato fit for acting'. The test for the alliance will now be its ability to respond to demands beyond its borders, on missions that as recently as five years ago would have been considered none of Nato's business.</p>

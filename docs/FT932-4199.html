			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Racal spells out demerger benefits as profits treble RACAL Electronics, the communications and electronics company from which Chubb Security and Vodafone, the cellular telephone operator, demerged in the past three years, yesterday reported a threefold increase in profits. The pre-tax increase from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 51.5m followed a cut in restructuring charges and recovery in the data communications division. Margins remained modest at 3.4 per cent. Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman, said recession in continental Europe was still affecting the business, but he was looking forward to further recovery this year. Announcing its results a day after Vodafone produced another set of impressive profits, Racal underlined the benefits of the demergers to shareholders. Exceptional restructuring charges also fell by Pounds 10m. The group generated Pounds 71m of cash from operations, reducing net borrowings to Pounds 35.5m after currency adjustments. Gearing fell to 6.8 per cent from 12.3 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 4.31p to 11.52p and the group is proposing to pay a final dividend of 2.75p, giving a total of 4.25p. Racal made provisions of Pounds 13.8m including Pounds 7.1m for further reorganisation and rationalisation in defence radar, marine and radio. Sir Ernest said further provisions for restructuring should be expected. Sales for the group were almost unchanged at Pounds 946m. Operating profits in data communications rose from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 12.3m, boosting group operating profits to Pounds 60.98m. The cost of preparing a tender for the Ministry of defence's Bowman radio contract, depressed the results in the radio communications division by Pounds 2.5m. Details, Page 24</p>

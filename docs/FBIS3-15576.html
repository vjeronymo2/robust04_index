The first new passports were  issued to government members on the eve of the Turkmenbashi's  birthday. The passport for a citizen of Turkmenistan, like the  state flag, is green, and the cover portrays the country's coat  of arms. It is much larger than the old Soviet passport,  containing 32 pages. All entries are made in three languages --  Turkmen (in the Latin alphabet), Russian, and English. With the  introduction of the new passport, the need to issue foreign  travel passports lapses.</p>

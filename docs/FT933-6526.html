			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UN call to lift Haiti sanctions MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, recommended yesterday that the Security Council suspend oil and arms embargoes on Haiti and release frozen Haitian assets, AP reports from New York. The council scheduled closed consultations for yesterday evening, New York time, when it might vote on the recommendation. A UN spokesman said the recommendation was being made because of the ratification of Mr Robert Malval as the new prime minister of Haiti. Under the peace accords signed last month by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the Haitian army, the sanctions may be suspended after a new government has been sworn in. Mr Malval won final parliamentary approval in Haiti late on Wednesday. The president is to be restored to power by October 30. The sanctions were imposed in an effort to force Haitian military leaders, who overthrew Father Aristide nearly two years ago, to permit his return to the country and to power, as well as to restore democracy. They include an oil embargo and ban on sales of all weapons, ammunition and military equiment.</p>

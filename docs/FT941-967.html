			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / ANC clash with Inkatha in Natal The African National Congress said yesterday that it would escalate mass protest action aimed at ensuring free political activity in the strife-torn Natal province, where ANC and Inkatha Freedom party members clashed again at the weekend over preparations for next month's all-race elections. Government officials said Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi met President FW de Klerk for a five-hour meeting on Saturday, at which he gave assurances that free campaigning would be allowed in the KwaZulu homeland which he heads, and that elections could take place there despite Inkatha's poll boycott. However, his supporters appeared to have ignored these assurances yesterday, when armed Zulus occupied a stadium in northern Natal where the ANC was to have held an election rally. It was the third weekend in a row that Inkatha had prevented an election rally in Natal. Officials said they hoped that Chief Buthelezi's assurances to Mr de Klerk would defuse the immediate crisis over Natal, and help persuade the ANC to defer its demands that some of the chief's powers be suspended and a state of emergency declared. The ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body overseeing government in the run-up to elections, is to meet again today to discuss the crisis. Chief Buthelezi said at the weekend that a troop deployment 'could be seen as an invasion'.</p>

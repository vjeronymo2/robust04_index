			<p>BFN     [Text] Military analysts agree that an armed confrontation  between Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary  Movement] is "in the making" in the jungle area of Junin  Department. The analysts added that under the present  circumstances, there is bound to be a struggle for the control  of drug trafficking areas in Padre Abad, Ucayali; Oxapampa and  Gran Pajonal in the Pasco jungle; and in Chachamayo and Satipo  in the jungle area of Junin Department.    The analysts explained that it is essential for the two  extremist organizations to keep their control over coca-growing  areas because that is where their dollars come from. This  income ensures the survival of the two armed groups, and keeps  them ready for combat. The experts, however, pointed out a  significant difference between the two groups.    The information obtained from a repentant soldier indicated  that Shining Path leaders keep resources and funds under tight  control, and issue rations to their men that keep them hungry.  Shining Path extremists are poorly fed, and get the same food  ration for months.    "Jairo," one of the first repentants who surrendered at the  Mazamari military base two years ago, made this decision because  he was tired of the rampant corruption among the leaders.  According to "Jairo," the "lower ranks" ate corn mash while the  leaders ate canned food and drank whisky, which they obtained  from drug traffickers in the jungle area of San Francisco,  Ayacucho Department.    The internal situation of the MRTA is different. The MRTA  pays salaries to its militants to stop them from running away,  which turns them into paid mercenaries.    Thus, the two groups clearly rely on support from drug  traffickers, but there is a difference between them. The MRTA  structure seems to be more fragile. As soon as the flow of drug  money is cut, the organization will collapse because the  combatants would refuse to fight if there is no booty to share.    The Shining Path is probably not as dependent on drug money  because the leaders can actually force the soldiers to fight,  but the involvement is much more deeply rooted. The Shining  Path is seriously jeopardized by the way in which drugs and drug  money have corrupted its political and military leaders, who  some time ago used to take pride in their austerity.    According to the sources, when Shining Path militants showed  up in Padre Abad, fleeing after the defeat of the Mar Rojo  battalion on the banks of the Huallaga River, and joined other  Shining Path forces in the province, the MRTA started having  problems, and must now unleash a sustained offensive.    The analysts even predicted that the MRTA will oust the  Shining Path from Padre Abad Province and will take over Shining  Path hideouts in the region. The analysts also announced the  MRTA will try to do the same thing in Oxapampa and Gran Pajonal,  in the jungle area of Pasco, where the MRTA has a platoon (one  platoon has between 20 and 30 men), and in Pichis Palcazu.  Another MRTA platoon is operating in the area attacked a convoy  with draftees near Villa Rica a few days ago.    The analysts explained, however, that the largest MRTA  contingent is operating in Satiop, Perene, and Parihuanca in the  jungle area of Junin Department. There, the MRTA has three  well-armed platoons that have been stopping and robbing vehicles  along the Marginal Highway and killing people. It would seem  that these groups manage to blend with the local population  after their raids.    The analysts confirm that the MRTA apparently managed to set  up an operation in Huancayo to push out the Shining Path, which  was again trying to extort money from farmers. In fact, on 26  April the MRTA called a two-day "armed strike" in three jungle  provinces, according to information received. The Huancayo  police reported that strike "announcements" were painted on city  walls.    The provinces where the MRTA is trying to compel the people  to "strike" are Chanchamayo and Satipo in Junin Department, and  in Oxapampa in Pasco Department. In the past only the Shining  Path used to organize "armed strikes."    Even though certain analysts, whom the news agencies quote,  seem to believe that this could mean a possible merger of the  two subversive gangs, everything indicates that at least in the  central jungle area, a clash between the two groups seems to be  inevitable.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a Thursday session the Russian cabinet approved  on the whole a draft federal program for protecting the  territory of the Russian Federation against the appearance and  spread of dangerous infectious diseases of human beings, animals  and plants as well as toxic substances. The program covers a  period between 1994 and 1997.    The head of the State Sanitation Control Agency Yevgeniy  Belyayev, who submitted the document, said that the necessity  for the comprehensive program is prompted by the growing flow of  migrants to Russia, the worsening of the epidemiological  situation in CIS and certain foreign countries as well as a  sharp increase in imports of poor-quality, harmful goods.    Belyayev said that in 1993 his agency had to ban the sales  of  1000 big batches of imported food. A total of 18.2 percent of  imported alcoholic drinks do not meet medical standards. The  same applies to 7.3 percent of canned food.    The official said that 11 cases of cholera were registered  in  Russia in 1993, all of foreign origin. In each case three  million rubles were spent to prevent an epidemic.    The draft program provides for the formation of a network of  sanitary control bodies on the borders, sea and air ports and  railway stations.    At the federal level 77 checkpoints should be constructed or  modernized in centers for forced migrants, 10 quarantine posts  at railway stations, nine veterinary laboratories, 25 plant  laboratories and 143 plant quarantine posts on borders.  According to Finance Ministry estimates, in 1994 this will  require 26 billion rubles of spending.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: LAWRENCE FIGURES IN 6 TDS; MORSE WINS  </P> <P> Teddy Lawrence, a Times' All-County selection last year, led Morse High to a  55-15 victory late Saturday night at Hawaii's Aloha Stadium.  </P> <P> Lawrence, the Tiger's senior quarterback, rushed for 214 yards and three  touchdowns and passed for 109 yards and three touchdowns as Morse routed  Hawaii's Punahou High.  </P> <P> He was named the game's most valuable player.  </P> <P> "Teddy was able to get outside of them pretty well, and then just took off,"  Morse Coach John Shacklett said.  </P> <P> Lawrence scored on runs of 65, 42 and 67 yards. The 65-yarder came on Morse's  first play from scrimmage, an option. His scoring passes were 65 and 36 yards  to Tommy Bennett and 11 yards to running back Gary Taylor.  </P> <P> Taylor added 209 yards rushing and fullback Conan Smith 97 as Morse totaled 536  rushing yards. Morse led, 38-0, at halftime and, 45-0, before Punahou managed  to score.  </P> <P> As part of a quadruple header, Lincoln High also experienced a rout Saturday  night in Aloha Stadium, but the Hornets were the ones being routed, losing,  47-13, to Hawaii's St. Louis High.  </P> <P> St. Louis, which has the nation's second longest winning streak (55 games  dating back to 1985), scored its first two touchdowns without having run a play  from scrimmage. St. Louis returned a punt 95 yards for the game's opening  touchdown and returned a kickoff 75 yards for a touchdown after a Lincoln  touchdown made it 7-6 in the first quarter. St. Louis later increased its lead  to 40-6 just before halftime.  </P> <P> Lincoln managed just 83 yards rushing and 73 passing, and had only one first  down in the first half.  </P></p>

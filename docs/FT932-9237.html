			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BAT enhanced scrip gets 92% acceptance THE ENHANCED scrip dividend offered by BAT Industries has been accepted by holders of 92 per cent of the tobacco and financial services conglomerate's ordinary shares. The success of the offer means that BAT will retain about Pounds 308m in dividends and Pounds 89m in advance corporation tax due on the dividend. BZW, which designed the scheme, received acceptance of its cash alternative of 32.2p per share from 14 per cent of the shareholders who elected to take the enhanced scrip. A late offer of a higher cash alternative of 33.22p per share from Swiss Bank Corporation was accepted by 7 per cent of elections made under the enhanced scheme. As previously announced, both groups of shareholders will receive SBC's higher cash offer. Cheques for shareholders who elected for cash will be sent out by BZW, which will pass through all the shares to SBC. RTZ Corporation, the mining group, said it would issue 29.5m new shares in connection with its enhanced scrip scheme, which was accepted by holders of 89 per cent of the group's shares. The number of shares was determined by the value of the enhanced scrip dividend alternative at 20.25p per share, and reference price per share of 612.83p, based on the average share price between May 10 and 12. For each 1,000 shares the enhanced scrip alternative is worth Pounds 202.50, which will be rounded to 33 new shares.</p>

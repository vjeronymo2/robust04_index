			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (4): The Silicon Valley of motor sport - One of the region's success stories NORTH OXFORDSHIRE has a flourishing specialist engineering industry based on motor sports as a pillar of its economy. Partly, this is because of the proximity to racing circuits such as Silverstone, just across the border in Northampton- shire, and Donington Park further north. But at least as important, according to Mr David Richards, managing director of Prodrive, is its closeness to Birmingham and Coventry, the traditional automotive centres in the Midlands. Motor sport makes a positive contribution to the UK trade balance of at least Pounds 300m a year, according to Mr Max Mosley, president of Fisa, the Paris-based world governing body of motor sport. At least three-quarters of the purpose-built racing cars in use worldwide come from a few dozen small factories in the region. Mr Mosley himself is a former leading light of March, the Bicester-based racing cars concern. Indeed, virtually all the big Japanese carmakers, now using motor sport as a major part of their marketing armoury in Europe, have their competition cars developed not at their own factories but in these rural English outposts. As for Mercedes' world championship sports cars, the chassis were developed not far to the north-east of Bicester. Almost every car taking part in North America's most famous motor race, the Indi- anapolis 500, throughout the 1980s, was designed and built either by March at Bicester or Lola, further north in Huntingdon. According to Mr Jonathan Ashman, marketing director of the RAC Motor Sports Assoc- iation, the governing body of British motor sport, 'the UK has become the Silicon Valley of world motor sport.' That partly explains why, hanging on the wall of Reynard Racing Cars, also at Bicester, is a Queen's Award for Export. Mr Adrian Reynard, its 40-year-old chairman, and Mr Rick Gorne, managing director, control the world's single biggest purpose- built race car business. Similar awards are to be found at March and, further south at Didcot, at the grand prix team headquarters of Mr Frank Williams, employer of Nigel Mansell, the racing-car driver. Many of these small companies, often to be found in the back roads of Oxfordshire and neighbouring counties, are a breed apart. Volume car manufacturers spend years and millions of pounds developing items such as gearboxes and produce them in runs of 100,000-plus to make them viable. March, Hewland Engineering, Banbury-based Prodrive and others think little of taking, say, a complex gearbox from first design to final production in a few months and will happily supply as few as 20. However, even though recession has reached the industry, motor sport in North Oxfordshire stands to benefit from the more structured shape that its leading entrepreneurs, such as Mr Tom Walkinshaw, TWR's chairman and Silverstone controller, appear bent on giving it. At the 720-acre Silverstone complex, for example, there are plans to expand an industrial park, which already houses nearly 50 units. The intention, says Mr Walkinshaw, is to 'build up Silverstone as a hub for the British motor industry'. Mr Richards readily acknowledges that Prodrive is not, and does not want to be, in the volume business. 'We might make 10 cars in a year. We therefore need to go to specialist component manufac- turers who are prepared to make fewer than 10 gearboxes for example. Such operators can be found in the Midlands.' Since moving into its 30,000 sq ft factory right on the M40 in 1988, Prodrive has expanded its turnover fourfold up to 1991. In 1992 it is looking for turnover of Pounds 20m. Currently it employs 90 people. That figure should rise to 130 when the company completes its expansion into a 14,000 sq ft factory next door to its current site. Mr Richards says he had difficulty in finding the right kind of engineers in the immediate vicinity but that qualified people are happy to travel from Birmingham or Coventry. He says that North Oxfordshire is the best place to be for a motor sports company. Apart from the closeness of suppliers and specialist parts manufacturers, he reckons costs are only two-thirds of what they would be in West Germany. Mr Bill Donnelly, sales and marketing director at JaguarSport, a joint company formed by Jaguar and the TWR Group, agrees that the closeness to the automotive industry in the Midlands is important. 'We might need some custom-designed part for just three cars. Obviously, a company used to dealing with the volume producers would not be interested in this kind of order. But there are suppliers we can contact.' The TWR group has its own main UK base in Kidlington. In the 1970s and 1980s it was involved in racing development programmes for BMW, Mazda, Rover and Jaguar with the XJS model. Since JaguarSport was formed in 1988, one its activities has been to make 'sports' or road versions of its racing cars. Fifty models of its feted XJR 15 have been made and all were sold at Pounds 500,000 each. It is currently making 350 of its XJ-220 model as a road car and these will all be sold, apparently at Pounds 350,000 each. JaguarSport employs around 90 people at Bloxham. TWR has also diversified into other forms of specialised engineering in the motor trade. It has consultancy engineering companies on the Continent, for example, and has retail dealerships in Jaguar, BMW, Porsche, Mazda, and Nissan. It employs 500 people throughout Oxfordshire and at least 1,000 worldwide. Meanwhile Reynard, which makes between 200 and 240 single-seaters a year, mostly Formula Fords, Formula 3, F3000 and Formula Vauxhall Lotus, is venturing for the first time this year into grand prix, having already produced a prototype. The company was started in its present form in 1982, with a turnover of Pounds 250,000. In 1990, before demand started to be hit by recession, it produced 270 racing cars for a number of teams from its three factories in Bicester and Brackley and had a turnover of Pounds 10m. Mr James Linton, sales director, says: 'Being close to Silverstone is part of the reason we are here. But it is also important to be in the heart of the automotive industry. Ms Fiona Miller, media manager for TWR, estimates that outside Formula 1, around 50 per cent of the world's racing carmakers have some kind of presence in Oxfordshire.</p>

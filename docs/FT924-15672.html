			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (50): Big savings in mailing costs - User view in the financial services sector; GE Capital GE CAPITAL had plenty of systems to help it administer 6m cards in Europe, but they were all operational - 'we were unable to exploit the wealth of customer-information we held in them or archives,' explains Laurie Jeffrey, head of database development. Any ad-hoc enquiries involved DP staff writing a special report, and files were product-based, rather than focused on the consumer. GE Capital is the largest company in Europe managing retailer financial services, a subsidiary of the US-based GE Corporation which manages 50m cards in the US. GE's search for a marketing database product in 1988 drew a blank. Now, says Mr Jeffrey, Marketpulse as a package would be a serious contender - 'then, the choice was to do nothing, do a conventional in-house development, or develop using a relational database, (rdbms).' Credibility and the proven ability to cope with high volumes were important considerations - but so were cost, risk of failure, ability to meet requirements and future positioning. The benefits GE sought were reduction in mailing costs, and better-targeted mailing, but an important part of this was putting data into the hands of the user. A highly detailed rdbms evaluation of IBM's DB2 and Model 204 tested the volume criterion with a 50,000-customer database. GE wanted to use its using its existing IBM mainframe, rather than new hardware; in benchmarking, Model 204, with which the Marketpulse mainframe version works, showed a distinct advantage for the marketing applications. Impressed with the technical ability of CCA (Marketpulse's parent), GE Capital chose the team which later turned its software into the Marketpulse package. The original GE database was derived from in-house records and now updates make use of the card system, with some use of an external credit bureau. GE relied on CCA heavily for technical assistance and training, and also had its sizing predictions confirmed by an outside consultancy. Mr Jeffrey reports a considerable saving in mailing costs, and says that further savings are available for additional marketing to the best customers, who are now easily identifiable. 'We are beginning to exploit other business opportunities, particularly where the database compliments our operational systems,' he says. The system, named the Consumer Database, now holds over 200m million records with details of purchases by 6m customers. Mr Jeffrey has some valuable advice for others taking the same path: 'Our experience is that marketing and systems people can work together. Avoid the traditional development process and keep the two parties and the supplier involved throughout. Base the justification and proposal on real business issues rather than technical ones, and prioritise delivery according to scale of benefits availa ble. 'Remember that it is a specialised business area that is unsuitable to many generalised database products: avoid existing solutions looking for problems.'</p>

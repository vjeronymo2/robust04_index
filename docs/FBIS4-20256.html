			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Platform To Change Italy in 100 </F> Days"]    [Text] Rome -- Here is the platform covering the "first 100  days" of Berlusconi's government: a 25-page draft -- the  outcome of a number of meetings held by the majority --  outlining the new government's first measures. The text provides  for speeding up of the privatization process, but National  Alliance Senate floor leader Giulio Maceratini hurried to say  that he had never seen the text presented at majority floor  leaders' meetings, and that therefore it was "apocryphal."  Nevertheless, we list here some of the salient points of the  text which is being circulated.    -- Abolition of income tax on incomes up to 10 million lire.    -- Tax rebates for companies creating new jobs.    -- Rapid introduction of institutionalized temporary work.    -- Work and training contracts amended to provide more  favorable terms for businesses.    -- Full deregulation of workforce contracting, including  nominal employment offers, for companies with more than three  and less than 15 employees.    -- Urgent unfreezing of financing for the south of Italy.    -- Suspension of Article 6 of law 537/93 on tendering  contracts, a regulation which was introduced by the latest  Finance Bill.    -- Electoral reform introducing a majority system,  abolishing  the 25-percent proportional quota.    -- Introduction of a constitutional regulation for the  budget.    -- Application of only two VAT rates.    -- Review of the law on pension funds.    -- Introduction of "household allowances" for families with  low incomes and children.    -- Review of personal income tax rates to help large  families.</p>

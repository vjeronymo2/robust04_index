			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, April 5 (UNI)--The Prime Minister, Mr  P.V. Narasimha Rao, on Tuesday strongly denounced attempts by  the developed nations to create fresh impediments in the form of  "unjustified controversies" that would nullify the comparative  advantage to developing countries in the globalisation process  of their economies.    Inaugurating the golden jubilee session of the United  Nations  Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)  here, the Prime Minister said the successful conclusion of the  Uruguay Round of trade related bilateral negotiations should not  "countenance any moves to put these concerns on the trade  agenda, with the thinly veiled intention to nullify the  comparative advantage of the developing countries."    Economic and trade ministers of more than 20 countries are  taking part in the week-long 50th session which is expected to  express concern over the neo-protectionism attitude being  adopted by the industrialised world.    Referring to the new conditions being imposed on the third  world by the developed nations, Mr Narasimha Rao said the  "legitimate concern for environmental preservation and  upgradation should not, however, be made the alibi for raising  of protectionist trade barriers, since only augmentation of  trade and technology flows would provide the necessary resources  for a transition to more environmentally friendly products and  processes. On meeting the challenges posed by environment  degradation, which was going to assume "gigantic proportions" in  the coming century, the Prime Minister advised all ESCAP members  to adopt agenda 21 of the Rio declaration on environment  development.    The ESCAP session is being held here after a gap of nearly  two decades. Last it met here was in March 1975.    Referring to the role of ESCAP the Prime Minister was  confident that the deliberations would be distinctly useful and  contribute further towards promoting the spirit of regional  cooperation for the overall development of this region.    "For Asia and the Pacific region, ESCAP has been the torch  bearer and catalyst for economic and social development and has  provided an added impetus to the process of growth in this  region," he pointed out.    Drawing the attention of the gathering to the disapperance  of  the super power rivalry and the era of the cold war, he said  this had created "expectations of a peaceful future and fostered  an environment conducive to the enhancement of regional  cooperation.    "The world is witnessing a general movement of the  restructuring of economies away from command and control systems  to market-based ones. The winds of change have affected Asia  also. The unifying forces of development in the region should  cement mutual relations and create a climate of confidence and  faith," the Prime Minister emphasised. He called upon the member  countries to unitedly strive for development of the region.    Referring to the world economic scenario, the Prime Minister  said the present recession was creating economic problems. There  were other parts, though not developed as yet, that were  witnessing substantial and consistently high rates of growth.    "This establishes the complementarity that needs to be  exploited for securing overall global welfare," he pointed out.  The fast growing economies provide the opportunities that the  economies in recession require to achieve revival. It was  therefore important that this be understood by the developed and  developing countries alike.    Emphasising, that the need of the hour was "cooperation and  not confrontation," Mr Narasimha Rao said the countries of the  North should appreciate the desire of the developing countries  to catch up with the rest of the world. It would be  counter-productive to create problems on narrow short-term  considerations, he cautioned.    It was in this perspective that the free flow of resources,  capital, technology and market access had become more relevant  than ever before to give a strong impetus to global economic  growth, he said.    On the Asia Pacific region, he said for reasons of history,  geography and culture it had gained a distinct ethos which joins  together the mosaic of cultures and ethnic groups constituting  this region.    The economies of this region had achieved "some of the  highest growth rates in the world today," and become the subject  of analyses for economic and political planners all over the  world.    Trade and flow of investment within the region too had grown  phenomenally giving this region the basis for forging a distinct  Asian-Pacific identity and unity.    The development of this identity would be realised if the  sub-regional cooperation groupings such as SAARC [South Asian  Association for Regional Cooperation] and ASEAN [Association of  South East Asia Nations] could serve as building blocks towards  developing and strengthening inter-sub-regional and region-wise  cooperation, he opined. "We are observing a general tendency of  national boundaries going down. Even the sub-regional groupings  are expanding as is illustrated in the emergence of APEC (Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation)." Stating that it was necessary to  address the economic and social issues before us in a wider  framework than national/subregional perspectives, Mr Narasimha  Rao said there was need for strengthening the socio-economic  development programmes under the "one single umbrella of ESCAP"  rather than duplicating and dividing them.    ESCAP should thus play the role of a coordinator and  catalyst  for the promotion of region-wise trade and economic cooperation  and for strengthening the economic ties between the sub-regional  grouping.    The Prime Minister said a large number of countries  continued  to battle against poverty, deprivation and unemployment. "We  have to find a solution of these problems, which inevitably  involves reforms, but the reforms must have a human face. The  pace, range and scope of restructuring programmes should not  burden those sections of society least able to bear them.    Massive upgradation of education, health care, housing and  transport are called for immediately. Though implementation of  policies and programmes to alleviate poverty are primarily the  responsibility of member countries, the support of the UN  bodies in this gigantic task was essential, the Prime Minister  said.</p>

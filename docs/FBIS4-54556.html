			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dj.M.: "List of Priority Topics for `The Third </F> Round of Talks'"]    [Text] Knin -- The establishment of peace on all  territories of the former Yugoslavia is in the interest of the  Serbian people in the RSK [republic of Serbian Krajina]. We  expect the international community to respect all national  interests on the territories of the former Yugoslavia and to  acknowledge the RSK's sovereignty, along with the right to unite  with other Serbian states. We have established that the peace  agreement signed in Zagreb is being implemented successfully,  Dr. Milan Babic, RSK minister of foreign affairs, said on the  occasion of the resumption of the peace talks with Croatia and  added the following:    "My proposal to the government was -- and it has been  accepted -- to hold negotiations on the border crossing between  the RSK and the Republic of Croatia in Turanj. The Croatian side  also does not want to negotiate in some world capital, because  that would involve a great cost and require the engagement of a  large number of accompanying services. We may have resumed the  talks today, but we adjourned them until after the Easter  holidays. We shall offer the Croatian side, as well as the  international factors, a list of priority economic and  humanitarian issues that will make a more suitable basis for  successfully realizing the third round of talks on solving the  political issues."</p>

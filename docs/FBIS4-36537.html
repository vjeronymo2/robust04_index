			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Mohammad Kazem Khonsari, director </F> general of Middle East and North African affairs in the Iranian  Foreign Ministry, with unidentified correspondents after his  meeting with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri in Beirut on 8 June  -- recorded]    [Text] [Khonsari] In the name of God, the compassionate,  the merciful. Within the framework of my meetings with senior  officials in this fraternal country over the past two days, this  morning I met with His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri. After conveying condolences to the martyrs of the  recent massacre during the barbaric Zionist aggression against  Lebanon, we discussed regional and international issues, and  bilateral relations. We agreed on the need to expand and deepen  bilateral relations and joint cooperation in various spheres.    Regarding developments and events in the region, especially  the repeated attacks by the Zionist enemy on Lebanon, our views  were completely identical. We agreed that the Zionist enemy  cannot influence Lebanese policy or the resistance by the  Lebanese sons through attacks, threats, and evil acts. The  resistance is fully supported by the Lebanese Government. If  the Israeli attacks and threats have any effect, it is only to  strengthen the unity and cohesiveness of the Lebanese people and  Lebanese Government in their steadfastness against the Zionist  enemy. This was stated by His Excellency Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri who said: We support the resistance. Resistance is  the Lebanese people's legitimate right and the government will  support it.    [Correspondent] We are grateful that you have helped  Lebanon.  There are reports that there were Iranian victims among those  killed in the Israeli raid on a Hizballah position in the  Ba'labakk area. Are these reports true?    [Khonsari] This is not true at all. This is the first time  that I have heard that.    [Correspondent] Is there any new information about the fate  of the abducted Iranians?    [Khonsari] I have no knowledge of this. Of course, we expect  the Lebanese Government to pursue the right course and follow up  on the fate of these hostages, particularly as they were Iranian  diplomats kidnapped on this land. We have no accurate knowledge  of their fate. The entire Iranian people and Iranian  Government, certainly the families of these brothers, are always  waiting to hear positive news about the fate of these brothers  and the necessary measures to free them.    [Correspondent] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani says that the  abducted Iranians are in Israel?    [Khonsari] One possibility is that they are alive and  prisoners of the Zionist enemy.    [Correspondent] Are there plans for you to conclude  agreements on developing bilateral relations with the Lebanese  Government?    [Khonsari] We, the Islamic Republic of Iran, are ready to  have comprehensive cooperation in all the spheres that Lebanon  desires.    [Correspondent] Thank you.</p>

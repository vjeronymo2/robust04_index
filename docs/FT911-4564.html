			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Observer: Small business Sir Michael Edwardes, the South African-born entrepreneur, has always been a trouble-shooter in a hurry. With spells at Chloride, British Leyland, ICL, Mercury, and Minorco - where he led the abortive bid for Consolidated Gold Fields - he has tested his management skills on more famous companies than most executives. So it seems surprising he may soon join the board of troubled Porth Group, Britain's biggest maker of artificial Christmas trees. Capitalised at just Pounds 2m, it hardly sounds big enough for 5ft 3 1/2 in Sir Michael. It does have a South African in charge, however, which may explain the interest.</p>

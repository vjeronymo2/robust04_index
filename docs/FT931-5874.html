			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japan rejects liquid crystal display ruling - US trade body decides imports are harming domestic industry A DECISION by the US International Trade Commission that Japanese-made liquid crystal displays are being dumped in the US has dismayed Japanese authorities and industry. They say they will seek a fair decision. US computer manufacturers, too, have protested at the ruling. The ITC ruled on Tuesday that Japanese-made active matrix LCDs 'materially injure or threaten injury to the US industry', and decided to retain punitive duties of 62.67 per cent. An official at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry called the decision 'extremely unfair'. Japan had claimed that there was no US industry to be hurt by imports of active-matrix LCDs. Sharp, a leading Japanese manufacturer, released an official statement deeply regretting the ITC's decision which, it said, raised many questions - from the point of view of US users as well. 'We will continue to work towards a fair judgment,' the company said. In the US, Apple Computer said the ruling made no sense and vowed to continue the legal battle. 'This is an 'Alice in Wonderland' decision. It defies logic,' said Mr Jim Burger, Apple's director of government affairs. The ruling upholds part of a dumping petition filed in 1990 by the Advanced Display Manufacturers of America and its member companies. That petition led to a ruling by the ITC the following year that Japanese-made LCDs harmed US industry. However, the ITC ruled at the same time that electroluminescent LCDs were not harming US industry and that it would withdraw anti-dumping tariffs of 7 per cent. At the time of the original anti-dumping petition, US users of active matrix displays opposed the ITC ruling on the grounds that no US maker could mass-produce active matrix LCD panels. US users, which are dependent on Japanese manufacturers of these panels, went to the US-based Court of International Trade, which last year ordered the ITC to re-examine the case. In seeking to reverse the ruling, Japan could resort to an appeal to the Court of International Trade or ask the Gatt to set up a panel. LCD flat panels, which are widely used in laptop and notebook computers and medical equipment, are one of the most promising growth areas in electronics.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Right to vote 'denied to 2m' More than 2m people in England and Wales are unable to vote because their names do not appear on the electoral register, Mr Jack Straw, Labour's shadow environment secretary, said yesterday. He said it was estimated that one in five people in their early 20s and 24 per cent of black people were not on the register. He called on the government to promote the right to vote, and to introduce a computerised 'rolling' register which would be updated throughout the year.</p>

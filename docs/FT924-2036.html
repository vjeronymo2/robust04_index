			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Scottish Provident buys Prolific SCOTTISH PROVIDENT, the medium-sized mutually owned life insurance company, yesterday announced conditional agreement to buy Prolific, the UK life insurance subsidiary of Hafnia, the stricken Danish insurer, for Pounds 81.75m. The deal is one of the biggest acquisitions by any mutually owned insurer in recent years and increases funds under management at Scottish Provident from more than Pounds 3.1bn to more than Pounds 4.25bn. The first of a series of disposals planned by Hafnia since it suspended payments to creditors and transferred its assets to a new holding company in August, it ends a period of uncertainty for the Kendal-based Prolific. Mr David Woods, managing director of Scottish Provident, described the deal as a 'perfect match' and said the companies' product lines were 'very complementary'. Both companies generate most of their sales through independent financial advisers, but while Edinburgh-based Scottish Provident is known for its strength in the with-profits area, Prolific is stronger in the unit-linked, unit trust and PEP sectors. Scottish Provident is prominent in single premium with profits investment products, in which it has a share of between 4 and 5 per cent. Sales of single premium products increased by 274 per cent to reach Pounds 374m in the first nine months of 1992. New worldwide annual premiums rose by 7.5 per cent to reach Pounds 29m in the same period. Prolific's three operating companies consist of a Kendal-based life insurance company, a London-based fund manager and an Isle of Man-based offshore life insurer. Scottish Provident will pay an initial consideration of Pounds 75.5m on completion with a further payment of Pounds 6.25m on the first anniversary. The acquisition will be financed in cash from existing resources. Cash in excess of Pounds 20m is also included in the Prolific businesses. Scottish Provident's actuarial assessment of Prolific, by R Watson and Sons, showed the value of future profits on business already on the company's book to be 'well in excess of Pounds 60m', said Mr Woods. Mr David Nisbet, analyst with County NatWest, said the deal contained 'strategic benefits' and 'looks reasonable value'.</p>

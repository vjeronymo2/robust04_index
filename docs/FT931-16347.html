			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / CS details bid for Volksbank CS HOLDING, the parent company of Credit Suisse, is set to become Switzerland's largest banking group in terms of assets following completion of its agreed SFr1.6bn (Pounds 702m) bid for Swiss Volksbank. CS is offering three of its registered shares for each SFr500 nominal capital of the troubled Volksbank, which has been hurt in the past couple of years by the slump in Swiss property prices and the depressed business climate. Mr Walter Ruegg, Volksbank chairman, said trading conditions deteriorated last autumn just after the bank had set a rationalisation strategy, so the board decided the best solution was to seek a strong partner. Mr Rainer Gut, CS president, said the group was determined to maintain a sufficient presence in its home market and, in particular, a dominant position in the retail sector. The takeover plan was welcomed by Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank, as a step towards eliminating excessive capacity in Swiss banking. According to a study by consultants McKinsey, one in every 67 Swiss inhabitants is a bank branch employee. This compares with one in every 102 people in the UK. Mr Gut was vague about rationalisation plans, saying only that 'disagreeable measures are sometimes inevitable'. Analysts said branches of the two banks overlapped in more than 100 locations. Investors were unenthusiastic about the deal, and CS Holding bearer shares fell from SFr2,170 on Monday before the group indicated its interest, to SFr1,980 at yesterday's close. Analysts said the issue of shares to pay for the takeover would dilute CS earnings this year by about 10 per cent. On the other hand, the purchase price discount to Volksbank's net asset value of SFr2.2bn would boost CS equity. Both CS and Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the country's largest bank, had been invited by Volksbank last month to submit takeover bids. The Volksbank board met on Tuesday to consider them after suspending trading in its shares on Monday. Volksbank must achieve shareholders' approval in March to convert itself from a co-operative into a joint stock company. Lex, Page 16 A giant among gnomes, Page 20 Markets, Page 29</p>

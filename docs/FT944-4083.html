			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses moved by individual corporate news Corporate news was the main influence on bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Madrid and Milan were closed for a religious holiday. FRANKFURT's fall in floor trading, the Dax index coming out 13.39 lower at 2,042.21, mostly incorporated the losses on Wednesday afternoon when the key index closed at 2,044.4 in Ibis trading. Turnover fell from DM5.1bn to DM4.2bn. The session produced one big reaction, Bilfinger &amp; Berger falling DM44 or 5.4 per cent to DM775 after a further 20 per cent drop yesterday in the share price of the construction group's Hong Kong offshoot B+B Asia. This followed the unit's reported loss of HKDollars 80.6m from a major civil engineering project linked to the colony's new airport. The fall seemed belated, and perhaps arguable. B+B shares had fallen 12 per cent in Hong Kong on Tuesday, and 11 per cent on Wednesday for precisely the same reason. Furthermore, said Mr Karl Debenham, German market analyst at Williams de Broe, Bilfinger had provided amply for such contingencies with provisions of DM1.5bn against capital of DM1bn at the last balance sheet date. After hours, the Ibis-indicated Dax eased a fraction to 2,041.85. In chemicals, Henkel recovered more of its recent losses, up DM6.40 at DM539, but other selling targets like Deutsche Babcock and MAN in engineering continued downwards, losing DM5.50 at DM193.50 and DM6 at DM397 respectively; Babcock disappointed with its recent progress report and MAN, on an average rating, deserved to be there, said Mr Urs Emminger at CS Investment Research in Zurich. PARIS, having moved for most of the day in a range between 1,970 and 1,960, fell away as Wall Street opened lower, and the CAC-40 index lost 15.75 at 1,954.09 in turnover of below FFr3bn. Total, off FFr10.50 or 3 per cent at FFr319.80, was reported to have been downgraded by a domestic broker, but no details were forthcoming. This recommendation came a few days after a US broker raised its opinion on the stock. The automotive sector was generally weaker, with the exception of Valeo which staged a partial recovery from Wednesday's 4 per cent fall, gaining FFr6.70 or 2.6 per cent at FFr262. Mr Keith Ashworth-Lord, head of research at Daiwa Europe, said he believed the recent fall in Valeo's shares had been overdone. One of the reasons for its weakness, he said, was due to a perception that the company had not been able to pass on price rises in raw materials supplies, such as zinc and copper. However, he added, the company had hedged itself against volat-ility in commodities until the middle of next year, and was also showing a significant improvement in winning market share from competitors. AMSTERDAM fell back from opening levels, leaving the AEX index off 0.80 on the day at 409.29. VNU, the publishing and media group, which holds a 38 per cent stake in RTL, a commercial broadcaster, was lifted by news that it had opened talks on possible co-operation with a rival Dutch television production company. VNU's shares gained Fl 2.50 or 1.5 per cent at Fl 171.50, and analysts believed that a partnership agreement would limit further fragmentation of the industry. Talks on partnership between RTL and another broadcasting group foundered last month. ZURICH edged higher in very quiet dealings, with many investors absent for a religious holiday in parts of the country. The SMI index finished 5.0 ahead at 2,589.3. The continued firmness of the dollar attracted steady demand for industrials with large exposure to the US currency. Nestle rose SFr7 to SFr1,252, Ciba by SFr4 to SFr770 and Roche certificates by SFr40 to SFr5,850. Banks, however, remained under pressure from further switches into the insurance sector. CS Holding fell SFr8 to SFr528 ahead of news that it planned to unify its share structure in a single class of registered shares, while Swiss Re added SFr6 at SFr790. A SFr25 fall to SFr610 in SMH was attributed to concern over the watchmaker's Swatch sales. Interdiscount, the electronics retailer, fell another SFr140 to SFr1,500 in further response to a bank's bearish note. STOCKHOLM corrected recent falls, and the Affarsvarlden general index rallied 4.6 to 1,476.4. Ericsson staged a SKr4 or 1 per cent rebound to SKr405.5, supported by a higher opening for telecommunications issues on Wall Street. However, this did not fully erase Wednesday's 1.8 per cent dive, which was triggered by rumours that Fidelity's Magellan Fund was selling its large stake. HELSINKI's Hex index fell 11.8 to 1,867.7, but the country's second largest forestry group, Kymmene, rose FM5 to FM125 after calling off a global equity funding plan. Traders said that investors who had sold the shares to subscribe to the issue bought them back on the news. WARSAW fell 5.9 per cent, extending Wednesday's 4.3 per cent slide, with selling pressure so strong that the bourse scaled down many sell orders and cancelled trading in six issues. The Wig index lost 455.1 at 7,247.4 in further reaction to plans for a 0.2 per cent stock transaction tax from January. Turnover picked up by 10 per cent to 610bn zlotys which, dealers said, suggested that some bigger investors were buying stocks and that this might help to cushion further falls today.

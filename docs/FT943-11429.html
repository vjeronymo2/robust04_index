			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Low bid hits hopes for Swans survival The receiver to Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder facing closure, said yesterday that the price offered by the sole prospective bidder for the company as a going concern was significantly below Pounds 5m, and substantially less than the business's break-up value, Chris Tighe writes. The comments from joint receiver Mr Ed James of Price Waterhouse underlined how poor the prospects now are of saving north-east England's last shipbuilder. Mr James said this week's bid from Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie was less than half the Pounds 10m figure discussed earlier this year. Swans' break-up value is understood to be about Pounds 7.5m. CMN insisted its offer, including Pounds 5m relating to a tax loss deal, was worth Pounds 11m. It wants to negotiate not with Price Waterhouse but with Lloyds Bank, Swans' principal creditor.</p>

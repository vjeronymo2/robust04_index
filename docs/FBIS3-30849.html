That would be  an extreme measure that would not solve everything, this can  only be done by the warring parties themselves, he added.    Sixty-eight Sarajevans were killed and nearly 200 injured  when a Serb artillery shell exploded in a crowded marketplace on  Saturday [5 February], causing NATO and United Nations diplomats  to consider anew, now with greater likelihood, launching air  attacks against the Serb besiegers.</p>

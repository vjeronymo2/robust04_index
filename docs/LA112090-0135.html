			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HAWAIIAN AIR DEFAULTS ON LEASES, LOAN  </P> <P> The parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, a troubled firm partly owned by a  Newport Beach investor group headed by Peter V. Ueberroth, said Monday that it  has defaulted on some aircraft leases and on a loan from Security Pacific Bank.  </P> <P> The defaults came amid continued losses at HAL Inc. HAL said Monday that it  lost $13.3 million for the third quarter, bringing its loss to $56.3 million  for the first nine months of 1990. Revenue for the third quarter was $101.5  million.  </P> <P> The loss wiped out the company's net worth, which now stands at negative $50.1  million.  </P> <P> HAL's default on its bank loan is surprising, since it came less than two weeks  after Security agreed to give the firm an additional $20 million. The fresh  financing brought HAL out of default on a $111-million loan, also from  Security.  </P> <P> As previously reported, HAL at that time granted Security warrants that could  make the bank its biggest shareholder. Federal regulations, however, prevent  Security from exercising most of the warrants. Banking industry analysts have  said that Security could possibly sell the warrants at a profit should the  airline ever work out its problems.  </P> <P> HAL said that during September and October, it failed to pay $3.3 million on  leases for 17 aircraft and is in default on those leases. Glen Stewart, senior  vice president-finance, said the firm has negotiated new leases with five  aircraft lessors and that it is attempting to negotiate new agreements with  others.  </P> <P> Hawaiian leases all but two of the 36 aircraft in its fleet.  </P> <P> Stewart said the company hopes to save $2 million a year by negotiating either  lower lease payments or the postponement of payments. Stewart said HAL, with  $12.5 million in cash at the end of the third quarter, had funds needed to make  the lease payments.  </P> <P> "It is not a cash question," he said. "We thought it prudent to enter  negotiations before making the payments."  </P> <P> Stewart said the airline previously obtained concessions from its employees and  suppliers.  </P> <P> HAL was in poor shape last December when it was acquired by Ueberroth and his  associates, Newport Beach lawyer J. Thomas Talbot among them. The company board  has attracted successful businessmen such as ex-Seattle Mariners owner George  Argyros and department store magnate James F. Nordstrom.  </P> <P> But the company's condition has worsened with the sharply higher interest costs  related to the Ueberroth-led takeover. Third-quarter interest expense rose to  $3.2 million in 1990 from $855,000 in 1989.  </P> <P> HAL has also been hurt by the high fuel prices and lower travel demand  troubling the industry as a whole.  </P> <P> Hawaiian Airlines' Performance  </P> <P> Revenue  </P> <P> In millions of dollars  </P> <P> 1986: 225  </P> <P> '87: 299.1  </P> <P> '88: 354  </P> <P> '89: 348.9  </P> <P> </P> <P> Net Income  </P> <P> In millions of dollalrs  </P> <P> 1986: 3.4  </P> <P> '87: -8.8  </P> <P> '88: -8.8  </P> <P> '89*: -46.9  </P> <P> </P> <P> 9 Month Results  </P> <P> In millions of dollars  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.22IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> $268.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> $262.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net Income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -12.7*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> -56.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *includes gain of $8.4 million on June 14, 1989 sale and leaseback of two  DC-981 aircraft, two spare engines and one quick-engine-change kit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Corporate Headquarters: Honolulu, Hawaii  </P> <P> Employees: 2,750  </P> <P> Current Stock Price: $10.38  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revenue Sources  </P> <P> Mainland flights: 35%  </P> <P> Interisland flights: 35%  </P> <P> Charter flights: 20%  </P> <P> South Pacific flights: 10%  </P></p>

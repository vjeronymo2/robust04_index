			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wm Baird sees improving trend Directors of William Baird, the textile group, said yesterday that although some improvement in consumer confidence had been experienced at the end of the third quarter, trading during the final three months - including the important Christmas period - had remained difficult. That was particularly evident in branded ladies' wear where margin reductions were deemed necessary to clear stocks. Trading at the Berkertex dress business was particularly poor during December resulting in losses 'exacerbated' by the need for a stock write-off. Management changes had been made to strengthen the business. For these reasons the directors expected second half profits at Baird Textiles, the main subsidiary, to be similar to the Pounds 14.1m returned for the same period of the previous year. That would include a contribution from Richard I Racke, the ladies' wear and casual clothing company acquired in August which resulted in William Baird becoming the third largest supplier to Marks and Spencer. For the opening half year to June 30 group pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 10m to Pounds 8.77m with Baird Textiles accounting for Pounds 7.02m (Pounds 8.53m). Analysts were looking for full year profits of about Pounds 22.5m; that would be lower than last time's Pounds 23.4m but 'well ahead' after taking account of exceptional adjustments for FRS 3. Mr Donald Parr, chairman, said the group was now a 'sound clean business'. He was looking for a much improved overall performance in 1994, pointing out that the Berkertex bridal business was trading 'extremely well'. He added that with year-end borrowings expected to be nil, including the costs of the Racke acquisition, the final dividend for 1993 would be maintained. Further disposals within the Darchem business were expected in the near further, the proceeds of which would be invested in the clothing and textiles operations. The shares closed 4p higher on balance at 255p after falling to 225p in early trading.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Cash machine's missing money On May 18, I used a Woolwich cash card at an Abbey Link cash machine in Milton Keynes. I requested Pounds 30 but received only Pounds 10. However, Pounds 30 was debited from my account. I notified both the Abbey National and Woolwich. On June 17, I received a letter from the Woolwich to say that, as no fault had been found with the machine, I would not get a refund. We suggest you contact the Banking Ombudsman at 70 Gray's Inn Road, London WC1 8NB (tel: 071-404 9944) as a first step. Abbey National is now a bank and not a building society. The Building Society Ombudsman, covering the activities of the Woolwich, is based at Grosvenor Gardens House, Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1X 9AW. Tel: 071-931 0044. (Murray Johnstone).

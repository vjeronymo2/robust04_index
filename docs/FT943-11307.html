			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / How To Spend It: London shops to stock Kiehl The second time I went to New York (the first time I was too green) I headed straight over to the Bowery and dived into Kiehl's. At the time it was one of the world's best-kept beauty secrets, a cult shop for models, make-up artists, actresses, fashion designers and everybody else in the know. There I stocked up on Ultra Facial Moisturiser, Light Nourishing Eye cream, Shine 'N' Lite Groom (the explanation for many a New York model's shiny tresses) and goodness knows what else. Ever since, friends going to and fro are given orders and I stock up whenever I am there myself. Now, four shops in London will be selling selections from Kiehl. Of course it will not be quite the same as visiting that strange old apothecary in the Bowery, dipping into those lotions and potions in their plain jars and bottles. The shops that will stock them are: Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1X 7XL; Smile (Hair Salon), 434 King's Road, London SW10 0LJ; Fourth Floor (Hair Salon), Northington Street, London WC1N 2JG and Matches, 13 Hill Street, Richmond, Surrey, TW9 1FX. Kiehl's in Manhattan (109 Third Avenue, New York) also operates a worldwide mail order service and a hotline: 212-677-3171.</p>

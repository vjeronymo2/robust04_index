			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Two-pronged trade game Sir, When US President Clinton punishes the naughty Japanese by banning one of their lucrative exports, how should the Japanese respond in this gentlemanly game of tit-for-tat? Instead of refusing to buy American soya beans or oranges, why not ban the export of something - liquid display screens, for instance? As to how to prevent this slowing recovery from the recession, the European Union has shown the way. Build up an LD mountain by government purchases and sell off cheap to America's competitors.

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / PM gives charter renewed impetus MR JOHN MAJOR underlined his commitment to improving public services yesterday and gave fresh impetus to the Citizen's Charter, making clear that it would remain a priority. A discussion for cabinet ministers and senior officials at Downing Street, chaired by the prime minister, represented an important element in attempting to shake off the charter's 'pre-election gimmick' label. Mr William Waldegrave, the public-services minister, said after the meeting: 'The whole charter programme has become a fundamental part of the way Whitehall is doing its work. The Citizen's Charter is with us and with you permanently.' Mr Waldegrave emphasised that the benefits from a continuing programme of rising standards would become ever more apparent as the initiatives became more entrenched. Departments should understand that setting real standards that might be missed at first was preferable to setting targets so low they were bound to be achieved. Pointing out that raising standards could provide savings and did not inevitably involve more public spending, Mr Waldegrave said that in effect he had a veto over whether his colleagues could invoke the charter in their spending discussions with the Treasury. A white paper will be published in the autumn and there will be a further seminar early next year to mark progress. Among specific measures highlighted were: Education: fuller information about every school is to be available locally from next year, and the task of providing information is to be taken away from local education authorities. Also included is the higher and further education charter, whose provisions will include the right of students not to join the National Union of Students. Health: the aims involve an extension of the patients' charter to include standards in GP services; as well as guaranteed waiting times for certain routine operations, such as hip and knee replacements and cataract removals, to be reduced from two years to 18 months from April next year. Transport: the London Underground charter is to be published next month - it was originally scheduled for the end of March. Also included is better information for road users and a trial project of bus-stop indicators giving the arrival time of the next bus. Other measures include consideration by the Department of Trade and Industry of 'first-stop shops' to provide a point of contact for small business. There will also be a further extension of performance-related pay, and a pilot scheme in Birmingham to test the benefits agency and the employment service working together to make applying for benefits easier. However, Labour attacked the charter for failing to protect consumers from steep price rises in privatised utilities. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, said every family was paying Pounds 390 a year in contributions to the pre-tax profits of the privatised utility companies. He called for an immediate cut in prices and the introduction of ombudsmen to oversee the utilities.</p>

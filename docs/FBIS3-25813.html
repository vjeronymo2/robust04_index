			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zou Qingli (6760 3237 7787)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- The Civil Aviation  General Administration of China [CAGAC] today issued a  certificate of quality to the Yun-8 civil cargo plane developed  and manufactured by the Shaanxi Aircraft Manufacturing Factory  under the Aviation Industries of China. This indicates that for  the first time, an aircraft model developed and manufactured by  China has qualified for civil aviation.    Obtaining a certificate of quality according to the rules of  airworthiness is indispensable for any aircraft model to gain  permission for civil aviation. China has been batch producing  the Yun-8 since 1980 and added them to its military equipment.  In 1989, the former Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics  Industry and relevant departments decided to provide Yun-8  planes to airline companies as cargo planes and demanded that  the original model be improved and rebuilt so that it would meet  various civil plane requirements. By the end of 1989, the  Shaanxi Aircraft Manufacturing Factory officially applied to the  CAGAC for a certificate of quality for the improved model of  Yun-8 plane.    Over the past four years, the CAGAC airworthiness department  has conducted serious examinations of the Yun-8 civil cargo  plane and its Chinese-built engine and propeller, according to  the relevant Chinese civil aviation regulations. China's  aviation industries have invested considerable capital in the  organization of the Shaanxi Aircraft Manufacturing Factory and  relevant enterprises and have conducted a lot of analyses,  experiments, and test flights to check the aircraft's  airworthiness. The Yun-8 civil cargo plane's certificate of  quality has opened up a bright future for itself in the civil  air cargo service market. This medium-range cargo plane, built  into a medium-sized model, has a maximum loading capacity of 16  metric tons of consolidated cargo or 20 metric tons of bulk  freight. The plane has excellent taking-off and landing  functions, which allow it to take off or land on airstrips,  grasslands, gravel, or sandy roads. Two Jiefang brand trucks  can directly drive into the plane's spacious cargo bay from its  back door.</p>

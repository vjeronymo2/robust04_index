			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 28 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- According to  the government, today's strike called by Guatemalan public  administration workers to demand a 40 percent salary increase  and to reject the upcoming Sunday referendum was "a failure."  The unions, however, called the strike "a success." There were  no violent incidents during the strike. Official sources report  that the central government has approximately 180,000 employees,  with another 100,000 from decentralized institutions.    Meanwhile, the government called the protest movement  intended to undermine the referendum a "failure." If approved,  it will make possible reforming the Constitution to hold the  parliamentary elections ahead of schedule, change the Supreme  Court of Justice magistrates, and reduce the president's term  from five to four years.    Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz has reported that work in  government institutions is proceeding normally, with the  exception of two or three of them. Ortiz said the union leaders  made the mistake of calling the strike for political reasons  rather than labor-related reasons and this is what caused the  strike to fail.    Armando Sanchez, secretary general of the National  Federation  of State Workers Unions, told the press that 90 percent of the  workers went on strike and that the protest will be resumed  Monday if their demands are not met.</p>

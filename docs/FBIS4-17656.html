			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Our correspondent" report: "Without Money Life Is Bad--No </F> Good at All"]    [Text] The Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan 19th session, which  opened on Monday, has a very brief agenda. But it contains the  extremely important question of the budget message of M.  Shaymiyev, president of the republic. The mere fact that the  Tatar Parliament is considering the question of the budget when  there is as yet no Russian budget clearly illustrates the  commencement of the Russian-Tatar treaty. After all, this was  previously impossible in principle, and local members of  parliament could only discuss figures already confirmed by  Moscow.    No great joy on account of the new independence was  discerned  in the faces of the deputies, for that matter. A very gloomy  picture is already taking shape from the three reports delivered  on the first day of business of the session by the two deputy  prime ministers and the minister of finance. All the negative  trends of 1993 have only intensified in the first quarter of  1994. The decline in production, enterprises' nonpayments, and  the corresponding reduction in the tax base are making  optimization of the budget a nearly insoluble problem. This was  why the deputies had a sea of questions for Finance Minister D.  Nagumanov and F. Khamidullin, chairman of the State Committee  for the Economy, who presented the forecast of socioeconomic  development for 1994.    The question-and-answer warmup did not satisfy the deputies,  and they decided to devote the latter half of the first day of  business to a detailed study in committee of the material that  had been presented.    The morning of day two of the business of the session began  with questions to Deputy prime Minister R. Muratov, who had the  day before reported the results of foreign economic activity.  There were things to ask about. Imported food has been sold here  at prices higher than world prices, and it is hard to see in the  documents how the money earned was returned to the treasury or  if it was returned at all. There are many puzzles concerning the  petrodollars. It is now several sessions running that the  deputies have attempted to obtain detailed information on the  use of the oil money--and all to no avail as yet.    But the question of the coming reform of the Cabinet of  Ministers was the most interesting. R. Muratov had already let  slip this measure at the recent annual meeting of the Trade and  Industry Chamber, and this topic was now heard at the session.    Just one thing was said about the essence of the reform:  "Marketeers" should join the government. About everything else,  we can only guess.    The first conjecture is an unsubtle one--an increase in the  machinery of administration. We heard at the session that  expenditure on this in 1991-1993 had tripled, so the trend is  clear.    Things are more complex with regard to the "marketeers." Who  personally? And in which position?    President M. Shaymiyev is remaining silent also. The deputy  prime minister is responding to all questions in a skillfully  evasive manner. And the presentation to parliament of the most  important budget question was for some reason or other entrusted  not to the prime minister....    The subject of reform of the government was heard in the  debate also, but there was no further clarification. The main  motifs in the deputies' speeches were, for all that, demands for  money for various sectors, depending on their place of  employment. V. Mustafin defended the interests of the defense  industry, specifically the KAPO. M. Shaykhiyev put the main  emphasis on agriculture. V. Ivanov, on housing construction. O.  Vladimirov, on investments in power engineering. This could be  continued ad infinitum.    The simple question of where the money for all this was to  come from remained unclear.    Through the mouth of Deputy A. Shtanin the "Power of the  People" group moved that the budget in the form in which it had  been presented be rejected and modified, revenue from exports  and off- budget funds having been included in it. Deputy I.  Salakhov made even more drastic proposals. The main one was that  the cabinet be required before mid-May to have drawn up an  anticrisis program and that socioeconomic development be  forecast and the budget approved only then.    Somehow on the quiet and imperceptibly in the interval  between money battles the Supreme Soviet elected eight people's  judges and terminated ahead of time the authority as deputies of  I. Grachev, V. Mikhaylov, and G. Yegorov in connection with  their election to the Russian Duma. Well, bon voyage!    The evening sitting was addressed by M. Sabirov, prime  minister of Tatarstan.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Row grows over exam results league table CONTROVERSY over the government's exam results league table intensified yesterday, with a catalogue of complaints and errors, and the revelation that the government employed two private contractors to compile its statistics. The use of small private contractors to gather and process the examination statistics led last night to allegations that the government had failed to supervise its own operation and ensure that its statistics were accurate. Manchester High School for Girls is considering legal action after its league table entry stated that only 16 per cent of pupils gained five or more GCSEs at grades A to C. The correct figure was 100 per cent, and the head mistress said she 'repeatedly' told the Department of Education of the error before publication. The department said it was 'seriously investigating' all the complaints. Mr John Patten, education secretary, has not apologised publicly for errors in the league tables. He will, however, appear before the Commons education select committee next Wednesday to be cross-examined. The main contractor, PMS Communications, a Birmingham-based company employing 30 people, specialises in computer systems for the education sector. Last night it said the allegations of mass inaccuracies were mainly the result of rules laid down by the department. PMS, a niche company not well known in the data processing industry, has in the past held contracts with examinations boards, but it has no experience of conducting operations on this scale. Mr Craig Peppiatt, a director of PMS Communications, admitted there were some errors, but said: 'That is the sort of thing which is bound to happen in the first year.' He added that most of the problems arose because of misunderstandings about the basis upon which tables were compiled and lack of time for schools to check their results. The role of the second contractor, Bath university, was itself a source of controversy last night, with PMS citing it as a separate contractor and the Education Department denying any knowledge of it. Computer analysts said in PMS's defence that the principle of 'gigo' - garbage in, garbage out - seems to have applied. Specialists in data analysis emphasised the care which has to be taken in designing surveys if the right data are to be collected. The survey design appears to have been flawed by rules such as not allowing for schools which share or group their A-level classes. As a result, some schools with thriving sixth forms were shown as achieving no A-level passes. The row dominated prime minister's questions in the Commons, with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, accusing the government of having 'botched' the results and being 'so incompetent it cannot produce an accurate record of exam results'. Mr John Major said it was 'hardly surprising' there were some errors since it was 'the biggest exercise of its kind undertaken by the government', and accused Mr Smith of 'hiding the fact that you want to cover up these statistics.' Mr Stephen Byers, a backbench Labour MP, tabled parliamentary questions last night asking why private contractors had been engaged for the project. Exam table errors, Page 10</p>

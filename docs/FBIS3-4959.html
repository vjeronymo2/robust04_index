Trade problems between Japan and the United States are  expected to be high on the agenda for the talks, government  sources said.    Christopher and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner will  participate the same day in security consultations with Hata and  Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi, the ministry source  said.    The consultations are expected to take up matters pertaining  to the bilateral alliance and the issue of North Korea's nuclear  program.    Christopher, who arrives in Japan on March 9 on a  four-nation  trip to Asia and Australia, is also expected to attend a meeting  in Tokyo of the International Committee on Reconstruction of  Cambodia (ICORC).    The secretary of state said in an interview Wednesday that  he  expects political and security ties between the U.S. and Japan  will remain intact despite bilateral trade woes.    "Our relationship on the first two aspects is excellent and  I  would not expect it to be negatively affected by the economic  matters we are going to be discussing or economic actions to be  taken," he said.</p>

Coordinating Minister of Industry and Trade Hartarto listed  the potential areas of cooperation in a speech here Tuesday in a  dinner party given to some 600 participants from 20 countries  attending the three-day 10th meeting of the Pacific Economic  Cooperation Council (PECC).    The PECC meeting began Tuesday.    The minister said that the four areas relate to the  development of human resources, infrastructures, small and  medium scale industries and the private sector's participation  in economic cooperation.    Cooperation in the four areas, he said, will be concentrated  on investment and regional trade, which will be implemented in  conformity with the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs  (GATT).    "We believe that assistance and support from the governments  of member countries will make APEC activities this year useful,"  he added.    According to Hartarto, the decisions to be reached in the  forthcoming summit will have a profound global impact as APEC  will bring together the East and West countries as well as the  North and South nations.    APEC, set up in 1989, now groups 17 countries comprising  Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, the  Philippines, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, People's China, South Korea, Japan, Mexico  and Papua New Guinea.    The minister further said that the North-South dialogue and  economic cooperation will take on a global scale once the  dialogue and economic cooperation in Asia and the Pacific become  successful.    On the first day of the PECC meeting, Hartarto talked about  APEC problems, free trade areas and open regionalism.    He said that regional trade alliances is now a permanent  part  of a global trade system and that open regionalism is currently  based on regional expansion and global trade.    Although designed to support local industries, regional  trade  alliance is by no means meant to discriminate against  corporations from outside the region concerned, he added.</p>

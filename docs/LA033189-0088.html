			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Imi Knoebel is a German painter who follows in the conceptual footsteps of his  teacher Joseph Beuys with intentionally bland-to-the-point-of-stark  abstractions or installations that can look like boxes crammed in a room for  storage. Knoebel drains works of any allusive content, any reference to  experience, feelings or knowledge, locking us into strict perceptions of  materials, size, dimensions and relationships of work to environment, or work  to work. This sounds like a redo of U.S. Minimalism, but it has a neo-German  twist. Judd and company produced glistening industrial-looking ivory towers of  inbred formal theory. Like Beuys' imposing stacks of felt, Knoebel's works lure  us into highly conceptual ground with an everyday simplicity.  </P> <P> His paintings are composed of white paint faultlessly covering plywood panels  joined into large geometric groupings. In one work, two mirror-image, inverted  L shapes hug two slightly unequal rectangles that are set above two identically  proportioned ones. The whole thing reads like one self-referential structure,  with Knoebel intentionally sifting out distractions to force us to see how line  relates to line, the weight of this shape to that, the pressure of one angle to  another and how the row of balanced works acts as figure while the gallery  space is ground.  </P> <P> This can be an enlightening but ultimately dry adventure; the pieces get good  when you cast off Knoebel's will to control and just let the paintings wash  over you in all their hypnotic Malevich stillness. (Fred Hoffman Gallery, 912  Colorado St., to April 22.) MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

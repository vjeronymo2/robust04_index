			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart A of the proposed rule contains general provisions describing the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act and its coverage. Section 2604.102 describes the types of records to which the Freedom of Information Act applies, and the relationship between the FOIA and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. The proposed rule also provides that if another statute, such as the Ethics Act, sets forth procedures for the disclosure of specific types of records, the Office will process a request for those records in accordance with the procedures that apply to those specific records. However, in cases where the record is not required to be released under the specific procedures set forth in another statute, the Office will consider the request under FOIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2604.102 as proposed also explains that records which are available through an established distribution system (for example, the National Technical Information Service) should preferably be obtained through that system, rather than pursuant to the provisions of the FOIA. The terms frequently used in the rule are defined in proposed &sect;2604.104. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Public Reading Room <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B of the proposed rule describes the location of OGE's public reading room and the materials available there. The subpart would also set forth the indexing requirements as to any records OGE maintains which are required to be indexed under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Proposed &sect;2604.202 contains the Director's determination that, because of OGE's size and the relatively small number of requests for records required to be indexed, such indexes do not need to be published quarterly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Production and Disclosure of Records Under FOIA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart C as proposed contains detailed rules of procedure for requesting records under FOIA. It also describes the format to which OGE will adhere in responding to these requests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requests for OGE records have generally been directed to the Office of the General Counsel. Since this approach is administratively practical, this system is being proposed for codification. Proposed &sect;2604.301 states that requests for records should be addressed to the General Counsel of OGE. Requesters will generally be required to submit FOIA requests in writing. Each request should contain sufficient detail to allow the Office to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. If a request is too broad or too vague to allow the Office to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort, the Office would assist the requester in revising the request as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The filing of a request would be deemed to constitute an agreement to pay any applicable fees up to $25.00, unless a waiver were sought. The request could also specify a limit on fees the requester is willing to pay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The General Counsel of OGE, or his designee, has been delegated responsibility in proposed &sect;2604.302 to grant or deny requests and to determine appropriate fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the terms of proposed &sect;2604.302(b), OGE will ordinarily refer FOIA requests for records that originated in another Government agency to the other agency for response. In such cases, the requester will be notified of the referral. Section 2604.302(c) as proposed specifies that, in cases where a requester asks for a record in a format which does not currently exist, OGE will provide whatever records reasonably respond to the request, but will not create a new record in order to respond. Under &sect;2604.302(d) of the proposed rule, if a record cannot be located from the information supplied, the General Counsel will so inform the requester. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;2604.303 requires the General Counsel to notify a requester in writing of the determination to grant a request in whole or in part. The response must describe the manner in which the record will be disclosed and inform the requester of any fees which will be charged. Similarly, the General Counsel's determination to deny a request in whole or in part must be made in writing and signed by the General Counsel (or his designee). Consistent with &sect;2604.303(b) as proposed, any denial is to contain a brief statement describing the basis for the denial, including the FOIA exemptions which were relied upon. Moreover, the denial must state that requesters have a right to appeal and must explain OGE's appeal procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office's appeal procedures are set forth in &sect;2604.304 of the proposed rule. Denials may be appealed to OGE's Deputy Director within 30 days after receipt of a denial letter. Appeals must be in writing and must contain reasons or arguments in support of disclosure. The Office will respond to appeals in writing, and will specify the reason for affirming any original denial. When a denial is reversed in whole or in part, the request for disclosure will be processed promptly. The decision on appeal is the Office's final action on a request. Requesters have a right to seek judicial review of the action under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 2604.305 of the proposed rule describes the time limits to which the Office will adhere in responding to requests. The time limits may be extended up to a total of 10 working days in unusual circumstances, i.e., when the records are in a location other than the Office, the request is for a large number of records, or the Office must consult with another agency or consult with various OGE components. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

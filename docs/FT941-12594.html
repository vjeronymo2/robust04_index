			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Autonomy hopes for Bank dashed Supporters of more autonomy for the Bank of England suffered a setback yesterday when a Treasury minister told MPs that statutory moves in that direction were unlikely in the foreseeable future. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the government was 'agnostic' about the principle of a more independent central bank. But he said ministers had not decided that greater independence was 'either impossible or undesirable'. His comments came as a backbench bill to increase the Bank's independence failed to negotiate its first Commons hurdle. The bill - introduced by Mr Nicholas Budgen, the Euro-sceptic Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West - was in effect killed when time ran out at Westminster in yesterday's second-reading debate. Referring to recent changes conferring a bigger role in deciding the timing of shifts in borrowing rates upon the Bank, Mr Dorrell said the government had already 'gently embarked' down the path of greater independence. He emphasised that ministers would adopt a gradualist approach when deciding whether to move further down this path. Under current conventions, the chancellor 'fixes the level of interest rates and the Bank has responsibility for management of the changes'. Mr Dorrell warned that it was 'dangerous' for people to allow themselves to believe that any given set of institutional arrangements could be a 'panacea' guaranteeing price stability. But he rejected the notion that an independent central bank would be inherently undemocratic. It was not a question of which set of arrangements was more democratic but of which set was broadly accepted as having earned legitimacy over a long period, he argued. The central question was how people would react to an independent central bank putting up interest rates.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARASSMENT AT NAVAL ACADEMY  </P> <P> Is it any wonder that the women of Mills College will fight so desperately to  keep their college from becoming a co-ed institution when one reads of the  manner in which women at Annapolis, a co-ed institution, are treated by their  male classmates?  </P> <P> In response to those who claim that handcuffing Gwen Dreyer to a urinal was  just "good-natured high jinks" and not yet another indication of society's  tacit acceptance of violence against women, one might ask how many men at  Annapolis have been handcuffed to a urinal, photographed and then taunted?  Somehow I wouldn't be surprised to hear the answer is none.  </P> <P> Other questions: Why is it men feel compelled to engage in such brutal forms of  harassment under the guise of hazing? Why is it that not one of the students  called on the carpet for such degrading behavior had the decency to admit that  what they did was wrong? How can the U.S. Navy consider this kind of behavior  in its future leaders anything but despicable? How can it consider its response  to the situation anything but dishonorable?  </P> <P> DEBORAH BLAIR PORTER  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

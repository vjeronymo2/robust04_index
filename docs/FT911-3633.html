			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Letter: Banks should take losses on the chin Sir, Now that the banks' reporting season has mainly produced another disastrous set of results I am experiencing a rather nasty consequence. At our annual facility renegotiations with our various banks and institutions, new charges and increases in some rates are being proposed. This is despite our continuing satisfactory expansion and controlled use of funds which in the past have led to reductions at similar annual meetings. The reason given is always that profitability must be recovered. Superficially, of course, they are correct but in every case the losses have been caused by bad debts or provisions for non-performing loans following disastrous lending policies in earlier years. Their profits at the trading level continue to be more than satisfactory. Why should other more prudent customers make good the mistakes of the banks' managers? Surely such losses should be borne by the owners of the banks - the shareholders. All that such excessive zeal to increase rates will do is increase inflation and slow our economic recovery. Come on you clearing banks - take your losses on the chin and rebuild your customer base by supporting the better borrowers. If your customer accepts blindly your new charges and increased rates, maybe you would be wise not to lend to him] Ian McIntyre, chairman, Crown Timber Group, Thornhill Road, South Marston, Swindon, Wilts</p>

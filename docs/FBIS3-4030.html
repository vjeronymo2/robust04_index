			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 16 (CNA) -- The Council of Labor  Affairs will reconsider its decision to suspend imports of Thai  laborers now that Bangkok has given its assurances that it will  try to prevent irregularities involved in their hiring, a labor  administrator said Wednesday [16 March].    The council, after consulting with the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, decided earlier this month to suspend the hiring of  Thai workers unless Bangkok took steps to prevent Thai placement  agencies from exacting unreasonably high brokers' fees or  illegally sending workers to Taiwan before the start of their  contracts.    The Thailand Trade and Economics Office in Taipei, which  represents Thai interests here in the absence of diplomatic  relations between the two countries, sent a letter to the  council Tuesday expressing the Thai Government's determination  to resolve all related issues.    The Thai representative office said in the letter that the  Thai Government has revoked business licenses for 40-plus  manpower brokerage houses that have been charging unreasonably  high fees for their services. The Thai Government has also  agreed to sponsor various orientation programs to help its  nationals intending to work in Taiwan understand Taiwan's labor  laws and other regulations.    A spokesman for the Thai office said Taiwan's manpower  brokers are also to blame for high brokering fees in the  importation of Thai workers. "We hope our two countries can  cooperate to eliminate all irregularities," the official said.    Thailand also wants labor administrators from the two  countries to meet in the near future to discuss the signing of a  bilateral labor agreement, the official said.    More than 60,000 Thai laborers are working in Taiwan, making  Thailand Taiwan's largest source on alien workers. Thai workers  are welcome here because they are perceived as being diligent,  highly skilled, and obedient. If the government suspends entry  of Thai laborers, labor market sources said, some local  labor-intensive industries may be affected.</p>

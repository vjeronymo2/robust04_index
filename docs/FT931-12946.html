			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Motor industry warns Lamont THE TENTATIVE recovery in the car and commercial vehicle markets will peter out if Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, raises taxes and does not cut interest rates further, the Retail Motor Industry Federation said yesterday in a pre-Budget submission to the Treasury. The federation warned that motor manufacturers and traders could lose up to 50,000 more jobs in the 12 months to the middle of this year, bringing the total to nearly 200,000 since the new car market crashed in 1990. The federation, representing 12,000 dealers and other motor trade businesses, said it was dismayed by what it saw as the uncertainty being injected into recovery hopes by the actions of Mr Lamont's department through 'its continuous media soundings about the acceptability of some tax increase options'. Mr David Gent, the federation's director-general, said that 'encouraging pre-Budget speculation about tax changes is never a sensible way of conducting economic policy. 'In the present circumstances of continuing recession, with as yet only some  -though encouraging - signs of possible recovery, to allow the process at all is utter stupidity. It has to stop and we ask the prime minister and chancellor to see that it is stopped today.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday said 'very real signs of recovery' were helping the motor industry. He told Channel 4 News: 'Britain is being forced, like all other economies, to be competitive and we are facing the need to modernise industry to contain our costs.' Mr Neil Marshall, the federation's director of economic affairs, said the government had already lost Pounds 3bn in tax revenue as a result of the slump in car sales since 1989. Last year 1.594m new cars were sold, about 700,000 below the record 2.3m of 1989. Mr Marshall said sales could recover by 5 per cent to 1.67m this year.</p>

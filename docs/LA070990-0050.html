			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THREE'S COMPANY LO-TECH DANCE SERIES IS OFF TO A FAST-PACED START  </P> <P> Three's Company launched its Lo-Tec Series with three drop-dead dances by an  innovative pair of modernists to anchor the program. Add to that, the striking  presence of the most arresting performers seen on this summer dance series in  recent memory, and you have an opening concert that will be a hard act to  follow.  </P> <P> Lar Lubovitch principal Nancy Colahan was the featured attraction, and she  stole the show with two stunning solos from modern dance pioneer Jane Dudley's  retrospective concert.  </P> <P> Dudley (one-time Martha Graham soloist) is one of the unsung heroes of modern  dance. Fortunately, Colahan's beautifully-realized re-creations of "Harmonica  Breakdown," the choreographer's brilliant signature piece, and "Cante  Flamenco," a fiery, flamenco-inspired work dedicated to the great Spanish  dancer La Passionara, gave San Diego dance buffs an opportunity to see some of  the groundbreaking work Dudley did back in the 1930s and '40s.  </P> <P> Colahan was electrifying in the highly-theatrical dances, despite the low level  of technical support available at the Hillcrest studio. And her splendid  costumes (authentically reproduced from Dudley's marvelous originals) enhanced  the effect.  </P> <P> The choppy robotics and angular leg lifts of "Harmonica Breakdown" contrasted  sharply with the flamboyant port de bras and defiant backbends of Dudley's  flamenco-style dance. Seen together, they left little doubt about Dudley's  capacity for invention or her keen choreographic eye.  </P> <P> Although Colahan has danced in San Diego before (as a member of the acclaimed  Lubovitch troupe), it took this lo-tec appearance to highlight her powerful  stage magic. Let's hope Three's Company gets her back for an encore next year.  </P> <P> The Lo-Tec concerts also showcased a contemporary classic, "Three Tangos,"  choreographed in 1985 by the late Jack Moore. This staging, danced by a trio of  Three's Company summer interns, was set by New York-based dancer Lance  Westergard.  </P> <P> The inventive triptych of solos was cleverly juxtaposed against a musical  pastiche that underscored "Tango's" parody with refreshing wit. Nicely danced  by the well-drilled performers, it got the concert off to a running start  Saturday night.  </P> <P> Colahan's husband, Lonne Moretton, was on hand for the kick-off concert -- but  only as choreographer.  </P> <P> Moretton created "In Flight" especially for the five local dancers. And they  executed the ebullient airborne moves with admirable assurance, their student  status notwithstanding.  </P> <P> Two of the interns were invited to dance their own designs. Vicki Tolleson  (one-time Merce Cunningham dancer) performed "Some Rhythm, No Reason," which  more or less lived up to its name. Gail Olsen came up with "Breeze," a vigorous  solo that kept her jumping along the lines of a jazzy score.  </P> <P> Long-limbed Tonnie Haig snared the spotlight in Westergard's "Leaves of  Hypnos," an evocative dance that took its cues from the piano plucks of a score  by David Koblitz, and showed how far she has come in a short while.  </P> <P> The Lo-Tec series will continue to occupy Three's Company's Hillcrest studio at  8:30 Saturday and Sunday nights through mid-September.  </P> <P> If the rest of the series comes close to upholding last weekend's standards, it  will provide quite a summer bounty for local aficionados.  </P></p>

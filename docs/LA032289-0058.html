			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Former South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan has agreed to testify before  Parliament next month on the alleged abuses of his government, a key demand of  the opposition, the Joongang Ilbo newspaper said. The report after President  Roh Tae Woo announced he was postponing plans to hold a referendum on his  policies in an apparent bid to avoid a confrontation with the opposition over  Chun's authoritarian legacy. Kim Yoon Whan, National Assembly floor leader for  the ruling Democratic Justice Party, conferred with Chun last Friday and asked  for his testimony, the newspaper said. "It was learned that Chun agreed to do  anything that can help" Roh, the newspaper said.  </P></p>

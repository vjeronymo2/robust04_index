			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIMBLE RETURNS, SCORES 29 TO LEAD LOYOLA, 144-92  </P> <P> Bo Kimble made a successful return to the Loyola Marymount starting lineup  Friday night, and the Lions marked the occasion by breaking three conference  scoring records with a 144-92 victory over Portland.  </P> <P> Loyola's total set a record for West Coast Athletic Conference games, as did  the Lions' 54 field goals and 13 three-pointers. The output enabled the Lions  (15-9 overall) to stay within one game of first in the WCAC at 8-3. Portland  fell to 2-22 and 2-9.  </P> <P> Hank Gathers paced Loyola with 32 points and 9 rebounds. Jeff Fryer added 23  points, including five three-pointers.  </P> <P> However, Lion Coach Paul Westhead was happiest to see the return to form of  Kimble, the 6-foot 5-inch junior guard who has been recovering from  arthroscopic knee surgery. Making his first start since Dec. 1, Kimble scored a  season-high 29 points in 26 minutes, hitting all three three-point attempts and  grabbing nine rebounds.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, we timed (his return) just right," Westhead said. "We eased him in  a few games, and now we've got three or four games to start him. His physical  timing is back, his shot's going, his cutting is much better."  </P> <P> Loyola shot a season-high 67.4% and hit 13 of 23 three-pointers. Portland  played without leading scorer Josh Lowery, who was suspended earlier this week  after an off-campus fight.  </P> <P> Freshman guard Eric Spoelstra led the Pilots with 17 points. The Lions play  host to Gonzaga in their last home game tonight.  </P></p>

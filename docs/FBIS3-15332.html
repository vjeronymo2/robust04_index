Vello Saatpalu told Interfax on Thursday that the last round  of negotiations at which Russia said it might go back on the  previously proposed deadline for its troop withdrawal from  Estonia, had shown the senselessness of further talks on the  same lines.    Saatpalu said he was in favor of parliamentary as well as  governmental contacts. "The Estonian ambassador to Russia has  been given instructions to discuss in Moscow the possibility of  a meeting between the parliamentary commissions on foreign  affairs," he said.    Saatpalu said he objected to the proposal, made by the  Estonian delegation at the last round of talks with Russia, that  the two countries take their border dispute to the International  Court in The Hague.    He criticized the idea, advocated by some Estonian  politicians, that the Estonian-Russian border is immutable since  it was established by the Tartu Peace Treaty of 1920 and is  formalized by the present Estonian constitution.    "Those who make this assertion are either uneducated or lazy  and don't want to read," for the Constitution says Estonia's  land frontier is established not only by that document but also  by international treaties, he said.    But he rejected any compromise on social security for  retired  Russian military officers living in Estonia, an issue Russia  links to a deadline for its troop withdrawal.    "Residence permits can only be issued to elderly pensioners,  the rest must leave the country unconditionally," he said.</p>

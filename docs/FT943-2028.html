			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pearson shares fall 19p as publishing restructured Pearson yesterday announced a restructuring of its publishing interests to reflect its new strategy of concentrating on information, education and entertainment. Under the reorganisation which is due to be completed by the end of this year publishing will be grouped by theme. As a result there will be redundancies at Longman's offices in Harlow, Essex because of the consolidation of some head office functions. Pearson did not say how many jobs would go although it is believed to be about 100. Following a briefing on the reorganisation for analysts the shares fell 19p to close at 564p. The reorganisation means: Information - the business and professional publishing arms of the Financial Times Group and Longman Group will be combined to form Pearson Professional, a subsidiary with projected revenues of about Pounds 150m a year. The businesses that will be brought together include FT Newsletters and FT Conferences, Federal and Capital Publications and AsiaPacific Business and Professional. Education - the English language teaching and educational publishing interests of Longman will be merged with Addison-Wesley to form Addison-Wesley Longman with projected revenues of more than Pounds 360m. Entertainment - Ladybird Books, the children's publisher will be added to Penguin. Penguin's worldwide business has projected revenues of of about Pounds 370m. Pearson Professional will be run by Mr Peter Warwick, at present Longman's deputy chief executive. Addison-Wesley Longman will be headed by Mr Larry Jones who has recently been appointed chief executive of Addison-Wesley. Ms Paula Kahn, who has been chairman and chief executive of Longman for the past five years, will leave the company at the end of this year. Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson's managing director said that although some jobs would go 'the changes are driven by the logic of our decision last year to concentrate, as a media group, on opportunities in information, education and entertainment. Those are our key markets, and we have to line up our resources accordingly'. Pearson said that the net impact of the reorganisation on the company's 1994 financial results should not be material. Earlier this month Pearson announced a 50 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 69.3m for the six months to the end of June. The results, and hints of difficulties in the book market led to a 31p drop in the share price to 628p. Mr Richard Dale, media analyst at stockbroker Smith New Court said yesterday that the change would have little effect in the short term. 'Over the longer term, hopefully, it will engender a degree of communality.'</p>

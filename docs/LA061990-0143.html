			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET JET HIJACKED; DEFECTOR SURRENDERS  </P> <P> A man demanding to be taken to the United States today hijacked a Soviet  airliner with 60 people on board and threatened to blow it up, authorities  said. He later surrendered and sought political asylum.  </P> <P> The 55 passengers and five crew members safely left the aircraft, parked beside  a runway at Helsinki airport and surrounded by police. The hijacker gave up an  hour later after talks with Finnish officials through a cabin door of the  twin-jet Tupolev 134.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Soviet Deputy Aviation Minister Mikhail Timofeev identified the  hijacker as Oleg Kozlov, 22. Timofeev said the man had threatened to blow up  the plane.  </P> <P> Finnish Interior Minister Jarmo Rantanen said that no explosives were found on  the plane but that the hijacker "had a bomb-like object under his jacket."  </P> <P> Unconfirmed reports persisted that three people were involved, and Finnish  authorities said they were holding the 55 passengers overnight for questioning.  </P> <P> Finnish Radio reported without explanation that three men were arrested but  that only one was suspected of hijacking. Rantanen told the radio: "We thought  that he had two assistants, but we are not so sure now."  </P> <P> All the passengers were Soviets, Rantanen said.  </P> <P> The plane had been en route from the Latvian capital of Riga to Murmansk on the  northern Kola Peninsula when it was hijacked.  </P></p>

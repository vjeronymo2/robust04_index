			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has said  that UN Security Council Resolution 425 has faded from  international and U.S. memory. The UK foreign secretary may,  out of pity, pay lip service to that resolution; other  politicians elsewhere may do the same. However, the issue, with  its serious political aspects, is linked to the actual  circumstances of U.S. policy. The United States is using its  clout to ensure that the UN recommendation makes no mention of  Resolution 425. This resolution is losing its relevance with  the passage of time.    Speaking in a television interview, Fadlallah called on  Lebanese officials to exhibit toward the resistance the same  commitment shown by President Hafiz al-Asad. Lebanon is  drifting aimlessly and its political life is coming unhinged, he  stated.    Fadlallah said that Geneva summit has created a new  atmosphere, but atmosphere alone is not enough. The summit may  grease the wheels of the negotiations and cement Syrian-U.S.  ties. The Arab region is in a state of flux, he remarked.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondents Pavel Maslov and </F> Valentin Rudenko, under the rubric: "Arsenal": "The Su-33  Attacks From the Sea"]    [Text] There is no more difficult  mission today in aviation than for a fighter aircraft to land  and take-off from the deck of a ship. Here special demands are  made not only on the training of pilots but also on the design  of aircraft and combat aircraft-carrying ships.    The Americans, who know carrier aviation, did not anticipate  that Russian aircraft builders would be able to develop a  fighter aircraft with high tactical-technical specifications,  the take-off of which is carried out using a ski jump. In their  country, all carrier-based aircraft take-off using steam  catapults. But they clearly underestimated our capabilities.  That fighter aircraft has already been developed. What is more,  it is being series-produced and is being successfully mastered  not only by test pilots but also by line pilots. As you have  figured out, this discussion is about the Su-27K carrier-based  fighter aircraft. (It received the designation Su-33 at the  Sukhoy Design Bureau).    Work on the Su-33 program began in 1984. It was conducted  under the leadership of "Sukhoy OKB" [Experimental Design  Bureau] ANPK [Aircraft Scientific Industrial Complex] General  Designer Mikhail Simonov. A team of developers headed by  Aircraft Chief Designer Konstantin Marbashev was directly  involved with the carrier-based fighter aircraft's design. The  Su-33 completed its first flight in August 1987. Two years  later, for the first time in our country, Honored Test Pilot  Viktor Pugachev carried out a successful landing on a heavy  aircraft-carrying ship and a take-off from the ship's deck using  a ski jump on 1 November 1989.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-10A>           Graphic </FIG>      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Primary Flight Technical Specifications of the Su-33:                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Crew                                  |1 man                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Take-off weight,kg                    |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum                               |33,000                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Normal                                |29,940                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum speed, kph                    |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |At sea level                          |1,400                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |At altitude                           |2,300                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Landing speed, kph                    |240                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Speed when separating from the ski ju-|140                                   |  |mp, kph                               |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Service ceiling, m                    |17,000                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Operational G-load                    |9                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum flight range, km              |3,000                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Combat payload, kg                    |up to 8,500                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Armament                                                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, unguided rockets, aircraft bombs, in-|  |cendiary drop canisters and expendable cluster bomb canisters, and a 30-mm a-|  |ircraft cannon.                                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The Su-33 was developed based on the Su-27 fighter aircraft  that is well known in our country and abroad and therefore  preserved its best qualities. However, if you compare them from  the point of view of combat capabilities and design  peculiarities, they are essentially different aircraft. The  Su-33 has an integral aerodynamic layout and has been  manufactured according to the triplane design. Movable  foreplanes, which substantially improve the aircraft's  maneuvering capabilities, especially controllability and  stability during separation from the ski jump, have been  employed on it for the first time. This is the first fighter  aircraft of the Su-27 family that is equipped with an aerial  refueling system. The wing, tail plane panels, and tail and nose  fairings are folded upward to decrease the aircraft's dimensions  in the parking area.    The fighter aircraft has a very high thrust-to-weight ratio  -- greater than one. Two AL-31F bypass turbojet engines that  were developed under the leadership of A.M. Lyulka have been  installed on it.    Aircraft take-off from the ship's deck is carried out using  a  ski jump from one of three positions equipped with  gas-deflecting shields and special restraining devices which are  retracted after the engine reaches the ChR mode (emergency power  mode). Even from the shortest distance, a length of 105 meters,  the fighter aircraft easily takes-off with a full fuel load and  a full weapons load.    There are glidepath beacons, a radar landing system, and  also  an optical landing system installed on the ship to support  landing on a ship which can be accomplished both in the  automatic, directed, or manual modes. The fighter aircraft  descends along a very steep glidepath and carries out a landing  without the traditional leveling off. After touching the ship's  deck, the arresting hook engages one of the arresting gears,  which ensures rapid braking and stops the aircraft. A special  emergency barrier can be utilized in non-standard situations.    The aircraft's landing gear has been reinforced as a result  of the fact that take-off and landing are carried out at  adequately high G-loads. In the event the arresting hook does  not engage the arresting gear, the aircraft has the capability  to safely circle around a second time.    The Su-33 is designed to defend Naval ships from air attack  weapons --aircraft and helicopters, cruise missiles, remotely  piloted vehicles, and also to destroy ground-based and surface  targets and to support amphibious assault landings. The weapons  control system consists of a powerful pulse-Doppler radar that  is capable of carrying out search while tracking targets in the  background of the earth and water surface and an  optical-electronic radar with a helmet-mounted target  designation system.    At the present time, as KRASNAYA ZVEZDA recently reported,  the mastery of the Su-33 is being conducted at an accelerated  rate by Northern Fleet Aviation personnel. Not only test pilots  but also line pilots are already successfully carrying out  landings on the Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union  Kuznetsov Heavy Aircraft-Carrying Cruiser. Soon, long ocean  cruises await the heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser and,  therefore, the Su-33 carrier-based fighter aircraft.</p>

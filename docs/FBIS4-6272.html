			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Artistes of foreign  countries who have participated in the 12th April Spring  Friendship Art Festival visited various places during their stay  in Pyongyang.    They visited Mangyongdae, the cradle of revolution, where  the  great leader President Kim Il-song was born.    With deep emotion and pleasure of visiting the sacred place  of revolution, they enthusiastically sang in front of the old  home the songs "Song of General Kim Il-song" and "Let Us Sing of  Spring Holiday of April" carrying boundless respect and  reverence for President Kim Il-song who is making an undying  contribution to accomplishing the cause of global independence.    They went to the tower of the chuche idea, the arch of  triumph, the three revolutions exhibition and others.    Vice-minister of Culture of Egypt Abdul Rahman Abdul Farah,  said the tower of the chuche idea was a monumental edifice which  has been built so splendidly. He went on:    Through the visit, I have come to know well where is the  source of the Korean people's fortitude.    It is because the Korean people are firmly armed with the  chuche idea.    I wish greater success to the struggle of the Korean people  who are advancing forward under the banner of the chuche idea.    The artistes appreciated the mass gymnastic display "Great  Victory of Rural Theses" and participated in the evening dancing  party of youth and students in Pyongyang and celebrations of  April 15.</p>

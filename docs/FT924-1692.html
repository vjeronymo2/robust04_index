			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Afghan chief resists move AFGHANISTAN'S interim president, Mr Burhanuddin Rabbani, said yesterday, a day after his tenure expired, that he would only transfer power to a council of elected national representatives, Reuter reports from Kabul. 'We have a joint leadership decision that whenever the Hal-o-Aqad council is held, the affairs of the nation will be handed over to it, he said in an interview. Most other mujahideen leaders have demanded that he step down immediately and have warned that he may be trying to delay the Hal-o-Aqad in order to cling to power. The Hal-o-Aqad of nationwide representatives is to choose Afghanistan's first elected president since the Soviet invasion in 1979.</p>

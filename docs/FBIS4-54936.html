			<p>BFN     [Text] Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], which, according to the  results so far, is in the lead, evaluated the first round of the  elections at party headquarters in Republic Square.    [Begin Szekeres recording] Something important has happened  today in Hungary. At the second free elections, finally, and  once and for all, Hungary has became a democratic country. Very  many citizens, much more than expected, have participated in the  elections and no significant irregularity occurred today.  Whatever the result of the elections, the point is that this  decision has been made: Hungary, once and for all, became a  democratic country.    The MSZP hopes that when the ballot boxes are opened and the  votes counted, it will be the MSZP with the largest number of  votes. We hope that in the next three weeks the style and  content of the election campaign will change. We decided to  maintain the style, political content, and ideology that have  been represented by the MSZP candidates in the past weeks. This  is a calm and moderate political style dealing with the problems  of society and seeking professional solutions. We would like  for Hungary, after the second round of elections on 29 May, to  have a politically moderate and viable government. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Books: Provocative voice of visual integrity - Timothy Clifford dips into the wit and wisdom of Britain's most controversial art critic THE REVIEWS THAT CAUSED A RUMPUS by Brian Sewell Bloomsbury Pounds 12.99, 357 pages I do not read regularly Brian Sewell's reviews as art critic of the London Evening Standard. It is not that I cannot abide them, although there are certainly many that feel that way; it is just that I live in Scotland, and visit London only about once a week. Invariably on my return journeys I buy Brian's newspaper, and largely because of his reviews, which are at once shriekingly funny and utterly exasperating. What singles them out from almost all the others is that here we really do have a scholarly, well-informed art historian and connoisseur, writing articulate and thought-provoking stylish prose. Of course Brian Sewell adores to be provocative and controversial. And he is feared. He is feared because he cannot be crushed, bludgeoned or packaged by cliques of the contemporary Art Establishment who club so closely together to force him, and indeed the rest of us, to believe in and worship so many of their idols. Brian exclaims, albeit in tones rather too shrill and fluting, that they are 'false gods' and, often, he is right. The delight of reading the odd review of Sewell's, or indeed listening to him broadcasting, is that you are subjected to Sewell's wit, mannerisms and hang-ups in palatably short bursts. But 100 reviews on 357 pages of Brian Sewell's unadulterated ire and froth is far too rich, I suspect, for most of us to digest in one read. This is a book to dip into. The key problem is that not only can Sewell not abide fellow critic Waldemar Januszczak - I quote: 'Pupils of Johannes Wilde will be relieved to find him omitted from this farce; had Mr Januszczak read Wilde's lecture on the Sistine Ceiling, he would have been compelled to recognise that his own ruminations on the subject, even after restoration, are puerile and superfluous, their publication a tiresome, self-indulgent, masturbatory display' - but also that he tilts at almost everything else: the Royal Academy, the Arts Council, photography as an art form (in particular the very talented Annie Leibovitz), the Turner Prize, Tony Caro, Gilbert and George; indeed the list is unending. Sewell feels obliged to discredit everything and everybody so that we are forced, out of empathy or fellow-feeling, to defend his multitude of targets and are in real danger of overlooking his penetrating observations and palpable hits. He plays to the gallery, which is 'standing-room only' full of philistines, and they embrace him for appearing to share in their prejudices. This goes some way to explaining his two Press Awards as 'Critic of the Year'. Were Brian to pause and be a little kinder and more generous (which he is capable of being), I suspect not only would he be taken more seriously but his harsh criticisms would then appear more justifiable and deadly. Timothy Clifford is the director of Scottish National Galleries.</p>

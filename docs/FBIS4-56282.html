			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio by </F> unidentified reporters at the Presidential Palace in Guatemala  City; from the "Telepress" newscast -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [De Leon] We are working on that. The negotiations are  clear. We are highlighting not only the positive aspects of the  bill, but also the aspects of what I call a corrective tax  system. This is not simply a matter of laws, but of a series of  administrative measures, the objectives of which I could outline  as follows: the administrative reform of institutions to  facilitate tax collection, the reform and modernization of the  state to collect taxes efficiently, and the utilization of the  required authority to effectively penalize tax evaders.    By doing this we are not only modernizing the state and  finding solutions for situations -- such as locating necessary  resources -- but also laying the groundwork for a functional tax  system in this country. All sectors, Congress, and the  taxpayers can see that this government is unquestionably taking  corrective measures. In my presidential tours, I am allocating  resources to those areas in which they need to be allocated, and  I am not funneling them into the pockets of government  officials. The president has demonstrated that he is not  engaged in illegal activities or breaking the law to get rich.    The resources -- 28 percent of them -- are being invested,  and this is why I can rightly and with moral authority ask the  various sectors to pay their taxes, because the salvation of  Guatemala is everybody's duty, and because when one person  cooperates, he is cooperating not with the president alone, but  with the entire country. In this way, we can allocate resources  to health care, education, road work, and security. I trust  Congress will pass a bill that definitely will not hurt the  people, because we are simply talking about a modification --  about only one additional tax -- and it only involves 4,000  enterprises out of the hundreds of thousands that exist, as well  as 150 individuals. This tax does not affect any person or  company whose income is less than 500,000 quetzals.    We are asking those enterprises effected for their concerted  effort, support, and cooperation at this time. The tax on these  businesses will be in effect only once. Many businesses in this  group have already given their approval, because they know that  resources are necessary now to make social investments. I trust  we will be able to clean up the country's finances in order to  face economic and social problems, considering that most  institutional and political problems have been resolved.  [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Mr. President, a deputy has charged that some  funds have been transferred to the Presidency.    [De Leon] I thank you for the opportunity to flatly deny  this  deputy's assertions. We have to begin by asking who is Juan  Carlos Simons, and what has he done as a deputy? [passage  omitted]    The first thing I did when I became president was eliminate  the Presidency's secret expenditures. In addition, a  constitutional reform that is now in effect and that was passed  on my initiative, constitutionally bans secret expenditures.  From now on, no government organization will be able to get its  hands on funds that serve to promote corruption. Regarding the  deputy's charges that such expenditures exist and that funds  have been transferred, this is completely false, and I demand  that he support his charges with evidence. Otherwise, I will  turn to proper legal measures. If there is one thing of which I  am proud, it is my honesty and integrity. [passage omitted]</p>

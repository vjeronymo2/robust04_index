			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Maryland -- A caption running with the University of Maryland story in  Tuesday's editions incorrectly said that Lefty Driesell, then Terrapin  basketball coach, told his players to clean the dormitory room in which Len  Bias had died of a cocaine overdose. A grand jury investigation in 1986 was  unable to verify that accusation and neither Driesell nor any of his players or  coaching staff was charged.  </P></p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Government to urge tougher Bank role THE GOVERNMENT is likely to recommend that the Bank of England become more aggressive and adversarial in its supervision of banks, after Lord Justice Bingham's report on the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International which is due to be published on Thursday. Lord Bingham's report is critical of the Bank of England's supervisory department. But the Bank, which has a copy of the report, does not believe the resignations of Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank director responsible for supervision, or Mr Roger Barnes, the head of supervision, would be justified. Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor, is also braced for criticism, as is Abu Dhabi, the Gulf state that was a long-standing investor in BCCI and its majority shareholder at the time it closed. The UK Treasury, however, is understood to escape serious criticism. Lord Bingham was commissioned by the Treasury and the Bank of England to investigate the role of UK authorities in the events leading to the closure of BCCI in July 1991. His report was completed several months ago, but the Treasury delayed its publication until the resumption of parliament to avoid the risk that Lord Bingham, recently appointed Master of the Rolls, could be sued by disgruntled individuals mentioned in its pages. The report is being published under parliamentary privilege, in the form of an answer to a parliamentary question. There are several criticisms levelled at the Bank of England, including: It did not get closely enough involved in the attempt to restructure BCCI in 1991, relying instead on information passed to it by Price Waterhouse. Senior officials at the Bank did not learn of the huge scale of the BCCI fraud until June 1991, even though detailed information on the fraud had been passed to the Bank early that year. Bank officials expect to be told by the government that the supervisory department needs to be more aggressive and interventionist. The Bank, however, is convinced that losses of BCCI depositors would have been just as big if BCCI had been closed a year earlier. Price Waterhouse is prepared to be told that when it uncovered damaging information about BCCI, it did not stress its importance sufficiently in conversations with the Bank. Abu Dhabi is concerned, on the basis of early drafts of the report, that it will be accused of withholding information on the scale of the fraud, which it allegedly uncovered in the spring of 1990. Abu Dhabi has argued strongly to the government over the summer that such an accusation is unfair, since the information it received at the time was unclear.</p>

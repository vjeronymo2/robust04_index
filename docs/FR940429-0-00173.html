			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Applicable Refund Policies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The State in which TCC is located has a modified pro rata refund policy: students who withdraw on or before the 25 percent point of the enrollment period receive a 75 percent refund; students who withdraw after the 25 percent point but on or before the 50 percent point of the enrollment period receive a 50 percent refund; and students who withdraw after the 50 percent point but on or before the 75 percent point of the enrollment period receive a 25 percent refund. (Students withdrawing after the 75 percent point of the enrollment period receive no refund under State guidelines.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TCC's accrediting agency refund guidelines offer a 50 percent refund to students who withdraw in the first four weeks of the enrollment period, and a 25 percent refund to those who withdraw after four weeks but before the beginning of the ninth week. (Students withdrawing after that point receive no refund under the accrediting agency policy.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Student Profile.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Sam the Student enrolled in a two-year program at TCC, moved into on-campus housing, and began attending classes. Sam made a cash payment of $500 toward institutional charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Financial Aid Package and Disbursements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Sam's financial aid package for the academic year consisted of a $2200 Federal Pell Grant, a $2400 Federal Stafford Loan, a $1600 FSEOG, and $1000 in Federal Work-Study funds. Sam's first disbursement of Federal Pell Grant funds ($1100), his first disbursement of Federal Stafford Loan funds ($1116_loan and origination fees have been subtracted), and his first disbursement of FSEOG funds ($800), were credited to his institutional account. Sam received $400 of his Federal Work-Study award, paid directly to him for living expenses, before he officially withdrew at the end of the fifth week.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Step One: Figuring the Educational Costs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Only institutional costs are included in the refund calculation. TCC must use the institutional costs as charged, by the term, for a total of $4375_$1800 tuition, $2500 on-campus housing and meals (because Sam lives on-campus), and $75 for administrative costs. (The $25 application fee is not a cost of education, so it is not included.) Noninstitutional costs are treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Step Two: Figuring the Totals Paid to Institutional Costs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> TCC's records show that Sam paid $500 in cash toward his institutional costs, and that a total of $3016 in student aid was paid toward institutional charges [$1100 Federal Pell+$1116 Federal Stafford+800 FSEOG=$3016]. (The Federal Work-Study funds are not reflected in this total, because funds earned through work-study cannot be required to be refunded or returned, and are therefore not included in the calculation of a refund.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total paid to institutional costs (student payments and financial aid) is $3516 [$500+$3016=$3516]. Only funds paid to institutional charges are included in the refund calculation; aid disbursed to the student for noninstitutional expenses is treated in the repayment calculation. (See Example  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Step Three: Checking for Pro Rata Eligibility Under the Law.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether Sam is eligible for a statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation, TCC must determine if he's a first-time student and if he withdrew on or before the 60 percent point in time of the enrollment period for which he was charged. Sam is a first-time student, because he's never attended classes at TCC prior to this term. He withdrew at the end of the fifth week in the term; the term is 15 weeks long, and the 60 percent point is figured in calendar time for term institutions [15 weeks&times;.60= <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9, so any withdrawal prior to the end of the ninth week falls within the 60 percent requirement of statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ]. Sam withdrew at the end of the fifth week, so he is entitled to a statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Step Four: Calculating the Unpaid Charges.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Because a student's unpaid charges impact the refund calculation, TCC must first calculate Sam's unpaid charges (as defined in &sect;668.22(c) and (f)) using the following formula: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Total Institutional Costs ^Total Aid Paid to Institutional Costs  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> =Student's Scheduled Cash Payment (SCP) ^Student's Cash Paid to Institutional Costs  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> =Unpaid Charges <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> To calculate Sam's unpaid charges, TCC subtracts the $3016 in total aid paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) from the Total institutional costs of $4375 (from Step One, above). The resulting scheduled cash payment is $1359 [$4375^$3016=$1359]. From that total, TCC subtracts Sam's cash payment of $500 (from Step Two, above) and Sam's unpaid charges equal $859 [$1359^$500=$859]. This amount ($859) will be used in all three refund calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Step Five: Calculating a Fair and Equitable Refund.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Amendments of 1992, TCC must calculate Sam's refund under State and accrediting agency guidelines, and under statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  requirements. TCC must then use whichever calculation provides the largest refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the June 8, 1993 Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, for all refunds other than statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> refunds, the student's unpaid charges must be subtracted from the amount the institution may otherwise retain. Therefore, in calculating Sam's refund under State and accrediting agency guidelines, $859 (from Step Four, above) must be subtracted from the amount TCC could otherwise retain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State refund guidelines allow Sam a 50 percent refund (he withdrew after the 25 percent point but before the 50 percent point), which means TCC is allowed to retain 50 percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $4375. Assessed at 50 percent, this allows TCC to retain $2188 [$4375&times;.50=$2187.5]. (Figures are rounded to the nearest dollar.) However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations, TCC must subtract Sam's unpaid charges of $859 (from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, TCC is actually allowed to retain $1329 [$2188^$859=$1329]. Sam's refund under the State policy is $2187, figured by subtracting the amount TCC can retain from the total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$3516^$1329=$2187].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The accrediting agency refund guidelines allow Sam a 25 percent refund (he withdrew after four weeks but before the beginning of the ninth week), which means TCC is allowed to retain 75 percent of the institutional charges. Total institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $4375. Assessed at 75 percent, this allows TCC to retain $3281 [$4375&times;.75= <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $3281.25]. (Figures are rounded to the nearest dollar.) However, in accordance with the June 8, 1993 regulations, TCC must subtract Sam's unpaid charges of $859 (from Step Four, above) from this amount. Therefore, TCC is actually allowed to retain $2422 [$3281^$859=$2422]. Sam's refund under the accrediting agency policy is $1094, figured by subtracting the amount TCC can retain from the total paid to institutional costs (from Step Two, above) [$3516^$2422=$1094].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To figure Sam's refund under the statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation, TCC must first calculate the portion of the enrollment period that remains (in accordance with &sect;668.22(c)) by using the following formula for credit-hour programs: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Weeks Remaining in Period  <!-- PJG 0001 unknown --> Total Weeks in Period  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=77 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> =Portion of Enrollment Period That Remains <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sam withdrew at the end of the fifth week of a fifteen-week semester, so 10 weeks remain in the term. TCC calculates that for Sam, 60 percent of the enrollment period remains [10+15=.666, rounded down to the nearest tenth]. The statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  calculation allows Sam a refund proportionate to the portion of the enrollment period that remains: 60 percent. Total institutional costs (from Step One, above) are $4375. However, under the statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation, TCC is allowed to exclude from this amount an administrative charge, not to exceed the lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the institutional charges (provided that the fee is a real and documented charge). Therefore, the $75 administrative fee charged to all TCC students can be excluded, making the total institutional costs for statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  purposes equal $4300 [$4375^$75=$4300]. (Had the administrative fee exceeded $100 or 5 percent of TCC's total institutional charges, TCC could only have excluded the allowable portion of the fee.) Total institutional costs are assessed at 60 percent, making Sam's initial refund equal $2580 [$4300&times;.60=$2580]. However, in accordance with the law, TCC must subtract Sam's unpaid charges of $859 (from Step Four, above) from his initial refund amount. Therefore, Sam's actual refund under the statutory  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculation is $1721 [$2580^$859=$1721].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

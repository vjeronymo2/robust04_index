			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / US export decline hits recovery hope THE US merchandise trade deficit widened to Dollars 7.4bn in May, as falling exports raised new doubts over whether foreign sales would provide the drive needed for a US recovery. May was the third straight month of widening trade deficits and the highest deficit in 18 months. Exports declined during the month by 2.5 per cent to Dollars 35.49bn, while imports also fell, dropping 1.4 per cent to Dollars 42.87bn. A large part of the decline was attributable to volatile aircraft sales, but the bigger than expected trade gap also provided new evidence of a weak second quarter. The US Commerce Department put the best interpretation possible on the news, noting the 'solid trend' in export growth and continued strength in sales of advanced technology products. 'Our exports to developing nations are booming, accounting for 91 per cent of export growth this year,' said Mrs Barbara Franklin, the US Commerce Department, in a statement. 'US exports to Mexico are up over 30 per cent so far.' Mr Dick Hoey, chief economist of the Dreyfus Corporation, said the substantial export growth in Latin America provided some counterbalance to the weakening demand in the industrialised nations. He said the US was moving toward 'a hyper-competitive' trade position with the lower dollar, the restructuring of industry and good unit labour costs. The April to May change in the trade deficit reflected falling foreign sales of foods, feeds and beverages, capital goods, and vehicle products. Exports of industrial supplies and materials and consumer goods rose.</p>

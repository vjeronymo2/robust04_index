			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / PNG relents on Australia human rights concerns The government of Papua New Guinea yesterday indicated it would allow an Australian parliamentary delegation to assess the security situation on the island of Bougainville and investigate claims of human rights abuses. The island has been the centre of guerrilla warfare for the past five years, after a revolt by local landowners over the Panguna copper mine previously operated by CRA of Australia, a subsidiary of the RTZ mining group. The Panguna mine is one of the world's main copper mines, and CRA began mining copper at Bougainville in 1966. The landowners' complaints became meshed with secessionist demands, and clashes between the Bougainville Revolutionary Army and the Papua New Guinea defence forces have continued. The mine was mothballed in 1989. Last year, an Amnesty International report said PNG troops and the BRA had been guilty of human rights abuses, including murder, torture and rape. The report criticised Australian government policies, and urged international action. Access to the island has been virtually impossible. Yesterday, during a visit to Australia, Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, said he had no objection to an Australian delegation visiting the island. 'If anyone wants to have a look it's up to them, provided the timing's right,' he said Mr Gareth Evans, Australian foreign minister, suggested a visit could take place within a few months, although it was unclear whether a delegation would visit BRA-controlled areas. Relations between Australia and PNG have been stormy over the past year, because of the Bougainville situation and PNG's unhappiness at Australia's effort to provide more tied aid.</p>

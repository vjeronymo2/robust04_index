			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Pianist Van Cliburn, 55, finally has a platinum record for his album that  became the first classical LP to sell a million copies. RCA Records Wednesday  presented Cliburn with the award for his 1958 recording of Tchaikovsky's Piano  Concerto No. 1, which he made with conductor Kiril Kondrashin and the RCA  Symphony. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, sales reached 1  million by 1961, passed 2 million in 1967 and 2.5 million in 1970. RCA would  not disclose the number of copies that have been sold, and a company  spokeswoman said she was uncertain why a platinum record had not been bestowed  earlier. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

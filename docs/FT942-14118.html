			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: USAir hit by low-fare rivals and bad weather USAir, the troubled US airline in which British Airways holds a 24.6 per cent stake, yesterday reported net losses of Dollars 196.7m for the first quarter. This compared with a loss of Dollars 61m for the same period in the previous year before changes in accounting rules. The group said it was seeking the agreement of its labour unions to an Dollars 800m cost-cutting plan. Early last month, USAir had warned it would report a loss of about Dollars 200m in the first quarter because of competition from low-cost rivals and severe winter weather. Yesterday, the company said about Dollars 50m of this year's first-quarter loss resulted from weather-related flight delays and cancellations, implying the rest was due to its inability to compete with low-fare rivals such as Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines. British Airways has made clear to USAir that it is not prepared to invest more money in its US partner until it has an effective cost reduction plan and its financial performance improves. USAir is the most heavily loss-making of all US airlines. It is the least efficient, with unit costs of 11.3 cents per available passenger mile, more than 25 per cent higher than the average recorded by the other big US carriers last year. Mr Seth Schofield, USAir's chairman and chief executive, told analysts he wanted to get unit costs down to 10 cents a mile so the airline could better compete with its low-cost rivals. That would mean an Dollars 800m-a-year cut in its operating costs. Part of these are expected to be secured through more efficient use of the company's assets and employees - for example, by achieving faster turnround times at airports. But most will have to come through labour concessions. It said one option could be to offer employees shares in the company in return for concessions, as several other US airlines have done.</p>

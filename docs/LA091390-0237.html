			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POTENT WESTLAKE FACES BIG TEST AGAINST OXNARD  </P> <P> Westlake High will try to negate Oxnard's running attack with its potent  passing game when the teams meet at 7:30 tonight in a nonleague football game  at at Thousand Oaks High.  </P> <P> Westlake (1-0), which gained 323 yards in a 41-20 win over Buena on Friday, is  led by senior quarterback Todd Preston, who completed 10 of 21 passes for 192  yards and two touchdowns.  </P> <P> Preston, a three-year starter who has thrown for 3,334 yards in his high school  career, is aided by a talented group of skill players that includes receivers  Erik Holcomb (four receptions for 103 yards) and Seamus Gibbons (three for 56  yards). Rueben Allen complemented the passing attack with 120 rushing yards in  13 carries.  </P> <P> Oxnard (1-0) relies on a large offensive line that paves the way for tailback  Kenyon Lewis, who rushed for 116 yards in 19 carries in a 21-15 win over  Camarillo last week. Quarterback Larry Bumpus completed six of 15 for 198 yards  and capped a 97-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run with 51 seconds left.  </P> <P> "They're big and Lewis is a very good runner," Westlake Coach Jim Benkert said.  "It will be a very good test for us."  </P> <P> In another nonleague game, La Canada will visit Glendale at 7:30 p.m. The teams  opened the season last week with wins but in vastly different fashion.  </P> <P> Glendale, behind Pathon Rucker's 191 rushing yards, beat Alhambra, 36-13. La  Canada, however, needed a one-yard plunge by Chris Mozilo in the fourth quarter  and an interception from Vahram Mossaedi in the final minute to seal a 10-7 win  over Crescenta Valley.  </P></p>

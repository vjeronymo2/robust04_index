			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Jobs: How to get round the secretary barrier - With ever more managers chasing ever fewer openings, success may depend on guerrilla tactics 'HOW do you speak to an angel?' That song-title will mean nothing to any but a few fellow-wrinklies among the readership. It was high on the hit-parade (then called the Top Twenty) four decades ago, and the stripling Jobs column used to hum it wistfully while pining for the icy Joyce Miller. Alas for romance] Time soon showed that, where real life is concerned, the question asked by the song is less important than another - to wit: How do you get past a top executive's secretary? It can still be a conundrum even now, when my request to speak to the chief is backed by the FT's title. In smaller outfits particularly, the secretarial keepers of managerial gates seem programmed to react to the name of any publication with: 'We're not interested in advertising'. The more sophisticated, while less direct, are rarely much warmer. They typically respond by professing scarcely credible ignorance as to whether their bosses are in, before adding: 'What's it about, please?' And that applies not only to supreme chieftains, but if anything the more so to heads of subsidiary departments such as personnel. If secretarial gatekeepers are a knotty problem to the likes of me, they must seem an insuperable one to a sadly still growing number of other people. They are executives who've lost their jobs, often through no fault of their own, in a day when many if not most organisations are whittling down their numbers of managers. At the best of times, official recruiting processes are apt to be more defensive than welcoming. For instance, research by Britain's Institute of Manpower Studies in the buoyant late-1980s showed that the prime concern of most recruiters is not to seek out the right person for a job, but to avoid hiring the wrong one. Now, with more and more managers pursuing a dwindling demand for same, the official defences must be harder to penetrate than ever. So however much job-seekers may have to offer a company, their only decent chance of being seriously considered is to bend the ear of someone with personal power to make a hiring decision. Which gives unprecedented force to the question of how to get past top managers' secretaries and, in particular, how to circumvent the road-blocking 'What's it about?' An appealing dodge that I've heard recommended, and by an ex-gatekeeper at that, is to reply: 'If he wants you to know, I'm sure he'll tell you.' But whatever relief such a put-down may give to the caller's bruised ego, there is at least one authority who thinks the tactic will usually have the opposite of the desired effect. He is David Werner, a marketing consultant, working from New York. As head of David Werner International he advises executives not only how to package ideas and products on behalf of their companies, but also on how to present themselves to prospective employers. In his view, the recommended tactic is based on a common misconception about top-level secretaries. Their bosses may speak of them as guardian angels. But the fact is that they have typically been hardened in the fire. They wouldn't be where they are if they hadn't become used to such attempted put-downs, and learned to counter them with stinging efficiency. Hence the best strategy, he says, is not confrontation but the devious type. Even so, it is of course imperative to have done your homework on the target company and executive, and the idea you're proposing, as well as ensuring that every checkable fact you voice is true. As a case study, let's suppose that you have lost your job after a period in Germany and your idea is to extend the company's representation there. When the secretary asks: 'What's it about?', a useful beginning is to signal there's a risk of confusion by saying something like: 'It's a touch complicated, I'm afraid.' Then, even though the target executive is a complete stranger, continue: 'We've met before, but not for some time. I've been working in Germany, and I want to touch base with him because there's a business opportunity I know he'd be interested in.' According to David Werner, the chances are that once the message has been relayed, you'll be put through. Naturally, the executive will ask how he knows you. But when he does, your reply is: 'I'm sorry? I didn't say we knew each other. What I said was we've not met before, but for some time I've been working in Germany, and there's a business opportunity there. You see . . . .' Although whether the idea bears fruit must remain to be seen, you have secured your first objective of getting the decision-maker's ear. True, the price of it has been falsely suggesting that the secretary wrongly reported what you said, but only by misplacing the single word 'not' which is surely something any busy person, however efficient, can be forgiven for. Besides, the New York consultant says, 'at times like these for executives, getting re-employed calls for guerrilla warfare.' Nevertheless he adds that the canniest guerrillas do not start their secretary-circumventing with a telephone call. They first prepare the ground by sending the target chief a letter of at most 20 lines in length, and nothing more. (One of David Werner's rules for writing speculatively to employers, as distinct from recruitment consultants, is never send a curriculum vitae at first. That's best left until a chat with the appropriate boss has given more idea of what's wanted.) His pattern for the letter reads: Working in Germany recently, I discovered a niche market for a product like yours - one where only three suppliers are active, all importers. The market opportunity, as I see it, would require a modest investment to set up a small assembly plant. Is it your intention to expand in Europe? If it is, and you think a dis-cussion might be useful, please call me. My number is . . . . While it's helpful to add any career details that support your candidature, he says, they should be put in a postscript beginning: 'In case you wonder who I am . . . . The PS itself is a valuable aid because experience shows it makes the letter stand out. What you've written serves as a spearhead for the telephone call a bit later. 'The bona fide new venture,' smiles David Werner, 'the best by-pass weapon of all.' When the secretary asks what your business is, you reply: 'The German market proposal I've been in touch with him about.' THEN again, for discarded executives who'd rather change their career than descend to such tactics, there may be help in a new charitable trust. It has been set up in memory of Lord Seebohm, the former Barclays Bank director killed in a road accident in 1990, by his children Richard and Caroline Seebohm, and Victoria Glendinning. They have so far raised just over Pounds 100,000 to provide grants of up to Pounds 5,000 for people wanting to change career. The Frederic Seebohm Fellowships will go to applicants who can show a sense of mission or public-service commitment, a fully worked-out career plan, and financial circumstances that either rule out the desired move or put their family unit at risk in making it. Application forms from Judi Barwick, Frederic Seebohm Charitable Trust, 5 Tavistock Place, London WC1 9SS; tel 071-383 2124.</p>

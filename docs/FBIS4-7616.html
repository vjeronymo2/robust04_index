			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mariusz Jedrzejko and Krzysztof Jakobiec: "The </F> Difficult Art of Management; Armed Forces Meeting on Economic  Issues"]    [Excerpts] The Army cannot do without money; the  Army's functioning must take into account market mechanisms to  an ever-increasing extent; commanders at all levels, apart from  fulfilling a training and an organizational role, are also  managers. These are just some thoughts and concepts that were  articulated during a debate within the Armed Forces on economic  issues that took place in Warsaw on 31 March.    The meeting was organized by the Logistics Inspectorate of  the Armed Forces' General Staff and included participants from  the General Staff's leadership cadre, commanders of military  districts, and commanders of the various branches of the Armed  Forces, chief of the Finance Ministry [acting Finance Minister]  Henryk Chmielak, chief of the Central Planning Administration  [CUP], Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz, Deputy Defense Minister Jan  Kuriata, as well as representatives of the Supreme Chamber of  Control, the Public Prosecutors Office, the Supreme Court's  Military Chamber, and representatives of financial institutions  and military educational units.    Interdependencies between the shape of the national economy  and the possibility of meeting the tasks the Armed Forces have  been charged with were strongly emphasized during the meeting.  Despite announcements and declarations by various politicians,  there has been no breakthrough in defense expenditures. In  1994, 48.3 trillion zlotys will be appropriated for the Army,  which, taking into account after-inflation figures, constitutes  a drop of 1.8 percent from last year. The amount  appropriated for the Army is bound to have an impact on its  shape, on the rate of restructuring done within it, and on the  introduction of modern combat technologies.    Despite the popular expectations of participants at the  meeting, speeches by the chiefs of the Finance Ministry and CUP  failed to include prospects for financial assistance to serve  the fulfillment of defense needs. Lack of a model of action, at  least with the next two to three years in mind, to a large  extent makes it impossible for the Armed Forces' leadership to  plan administrative and structural changes or training  activities. One could hear statements by Armed Forces'  representatives in unofficial talk: This is not the kind of  position we expected to see.    The existing problems and interdependencies cannot impede  the  changes that are being implemented--or that are being  planned--in the area of managing the military economy. These  issues were very strongly emphasized during a speech by General  Zbigniew Zalewski, chief of the Logistics Inspectorate.  <H5>  Army and Market Mechanisms </H5>   Because of our defense needs, we should be devoting 30  to 40 percent of the Defense Ministry's [MON] budget to  structural transformations, new technologies, and technical  infrastructure. In reality, only one-tenth of the  above-mentioned budget will actually be spent on satisfying  these goals. This situation is further exacerbated by a faulty  tax system, which is responsible for so-called empty money  flowing between and among state institutions (state budget  institutions). Banks are the only party benefiting from the  phenomenon.    According to General Z. Zalewski, when it comes to  parliamentary debate on defense issues that will take place in  the near future, one should consider introducing a  different type of tax system vis-a-vis the Armed Forces. It is  also necessary to carry through amendments to the entire batch  of so-called military-related statutes. There are also  possibilities of introducing such changes that would make it  possible to implement modern mechanisms of managing and  supervising the Army's assets. On that theme, a proposal  was presented, among other things, to establish an analytical  center within the Armed Forces, which should deal with creating  economic and financial fundamentals of the MON budget.  Measures that have been undertaken so far--for instance, a  decrease of logistical units by 30 percent--made it possible to  direct additional means to the Army's most important areas of  activity. The need to search for sources of additional economic  measures was reflected in a speech by General Marian Robelek.  Among other things, a rationalization of organizational  structures and further decreases in the number of additional and  protective units should constitute a source for such economic  measures. It will also be necessary to...  <H5>  ...Give Up Unneeded Military Premises </H5>   ...the maintenance of which is a burden to the MON budget.  Unless principles of transfer of assets are changed, and unless  the resistance by the administration is overcome (the  administration procrastinates with regard to taking control over  unneeded sites), radical steps will have to be taken.    Given the limited resources that can be devoted to the  Army's technical advancement, the following will receive  priority treatment: purchases of reconnaissance and  radio-electronic combat equipment, and also of command systems  and antitank and antiaircraft systems.    The efficiency of implementing logistical concepts and  eliminating irregularities in the military economy are an  important problem. Among others, General Jan Wojtala, chief of  MON's Supervision Department, spoke about this. [passage  omitted]    The meeting did not resolve--it could not have--all of the  problems faced by commanders and the Army's logistics branch.  However, assessments and conclusions presented during the debate  will make it possible to take the realities of military service  into account in the decisionmaking process.</p>

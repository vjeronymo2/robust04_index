			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Borrowers bank on a good relationship: How the UK credit squeeze is forcing companies back to their traditional lenders AFTER almost a decade of being spoilt for choice by a procession of business-hungry bankers, blue chip companies are having to pay more for their credit facilities. 'The cost of borrowing is certainly rising,' says Mr Christopher Bull, finance director of BTR, the industrial conglomerate. 'The days when banks would clamour to lend at very fine margins are over.' The trend reflects the return of a seller's market as banks concentrate on securing adequate returns on their capital. Their changed priorities stem partly from the need to satisfy capital adequacy requirements and comply with the Bank for International Settlements' capital ratios. 'The Basle ratios are driving the pricing policy of the banking system,' says Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank. Companies have observed less of an increase in the prices of day-to-day cash management tools. These, they note, do not entail the commitment of valuable bank capital. Mr Ian Duncan, finance director of Tomkins, the conglomerate, says: 'The market is as competitive as ever for forward rate agreements (FRAs), swaps and large foreign exchange transactions.' But they say that banks are noticeably reluctant to agree to loan requests under uncommitted credit facilities. 'We have experienced a number of cases of banks not being willing to lend on uncommitted lines, particularly when the loan period would take in the end of the quarter, when their balance-sheets are being assessed,' says BTR's Mr Bull. The credit squeeze has given a boost to relationship banking, which had been exposed to intense pressure while price competition was keen. 'The reason people are emphasising relationships now is that they have to,' says Mr Andrew Robb, finance director of Pilkington, the glassmaker. 'The banks just doing transactions - the Japanese in particular - have gone home.' Blue chips say they never abandoned relationship banking because of its many advantages. Even News Corporation, whose recent debt restructuring required the co-operation of 146 bank lenders, says it has 'always stuck with' relationships. 'The transactions that the 146 banks participated in were all originated by a small group of banks that did everything for us,' the company says. Relationship bankers, companies argue, tend to be more reliable in times of distress, more trustworthy, faster on their feet in bid situations, and dream up more useful new ideas. 'Relationship banking has two benefits for us,' says Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director of the publisher, Reed International. 'First, they are more responsive when we need something done quickly. Second, because they know the business, they come up with some relevant innovative ideas.' If Reed had put its credit facilities with the banks offering the lowest commitment fees during the lending spree, it could have ended up with lines in place from the failed Bank of New England, Mr Stapleton points out. 'I like to have clear relationships with a number of banks which means that if it starts to rain, the umbrella stays up,' says Mr Bob Carlton-Porter, finance director of the building products group, ECC. In fact, many finance directors ensured that their companies obtained relationship banking on the cheap during the buyer's market by using offers from transactional-oriented banks to drive down their core bankers' prices. 'We use good rates as leverage,' says Mr David Jinks, finance director of Cadbury Schweppes, the soft drink and confectionery group. 'Clearly one has to take what is available in the market at the best rates.' Others achieved a similar goal by putting multi-option facilities (Mofs) in place, tying their lenders up in one facility at a lower cost than a bilateral overdraft agreement or a syndicated term loan. 'Our Mof didn't cost me more than 2-3 basis points,' says Mr Nigel Turnbull, finance director of Rank Organisation, the leisure group. BTR's Mof, arranged in 1987, provided the group with Pounds 500m in a standby line of credit for at least five years at an annual average cost of 3 1/2 basis points. The lenders hoped to benefit by supplying all of their customers' ancillary banking requirements. But, with up to 20 banks typically bidding for the work, the customers were usually assured a competitive quotation. Most transaction-oriented banks have now departed the fray, reducing the blue chips' bargaining power, and new Mofs are scarcer than hens' teeth. Furthermore, lending for some purposes - for example, to buy property - is hard to find at any price. 'Very few banks or investors are interested in property finance,' says Mr Donald Main, finance director of Trusthouse Forte, the hotels group. 'We have seen pricing this year go shooting up,' says Mr Turnbull of Rank. 'If we tried to put the same committed lines in place it would cost us at least 50 basis points more than it would have two years ago.' The situation may get worse, from a corporate perspective, before it gets better. NatWest's Lord Alexander said last month that 'corporate customers may well find that available funds will continue to decline in real terms, and that the price of those funds will continue to rise, even for the larger companies, to a 1 per cent margin.' Eventually, however, the finance directors of most blue chips expect the availability of cheap finance to increase as pressures on banks ease. These veterans of previous business cycles doubt that super-keen pricing will be unique to the 1980s. 'You could have asked that question post-1974 and people would have replied 'We have learnt our lesson now',' says Mr Duncan of Tomkins. 'It is a function of the cycle, sadly. There will always be banks who look for an apparently quicker profit with a lower margin.' Trusthouse Forte's Mr Main says: 'It is currently a seller's market as far as the banks are concerned. But in 18 months to two years it will probably be quite different.'</p>

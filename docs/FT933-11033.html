			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / A blow for compromise and conciliation: Israel's military attacks in south Lebanon have damaged Middle East peace hopes The Middle East abhors a diplomatic vacuum like no other part of the world. If it is not trying to resolve the worst of its problems through negotiation, then the danger is always there that it will blunder again into war. The latest, and objectively the best hope for resolving the Arab-Israel conflict peacefully sprang out of the war in the Gulf. Some 20 months after Iraq's forces were driven out of Kuwait, the long-festering crisis of Israel's relations with its Arab neighbours was brought to the negotiating table in Madrid. Some 21 months later, with no progress to show, the guns are again firing, civilians are dying and the pitiable sight of hundreds of thousands of refugees fills television screens. Once again, for the third time in 15 years, it is the Lebanese people who are paying the price for the failures, ambitions and short-term political manoeuvring of the region's leaders. This week's relentless attack on the country by Israel, which has already forced at least 250,000 people from their homes, killed 120 and wounded hundreds more, serves interests far removed from those which support conciliation and compromise. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, clearly believes that the military operation is necessary for his government and for his country. Earlier this month, seven Israeli soldiers were killed by guerrillas in south Lebanon, in the slice of territory (about 10 per cent of the country) Israel has occupied since its two earlier ill-fated invasions of 1978 and 1982. Then, as now, the declared aim is to rid the south of Lebanon of guerrilla forces capable of challenging the occupation and of firing rockets into the northern tip of Israel. This time, however, Israel is trying a new tactic. By deliberately driving out the population of the south and making their towns and villages uninhabitable, Mr Rabin is hoping to create such a mass of refugees that the governments of Lebanon and Syria will be forced into taking action against the guerrillas. Israel's prime minister has long believed, along with many of his colleagues, that force can only be answered by force. He was elected a year ago on the twin pledge of peace and security. He has not delivered peace, so the need to ensure security has become even more politically imperative. Mr Rabin may also calculate that the risks to the peace process are secondary and containable. He well knows, as do his Arab negotiating partners, that Israel is totally dominant in the region militarily. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, those Arab countries most opposed to Israel have lost their main military supplier and most constant diplomatic supporter. The risk of a Middle East conflict spilling over into the third world war has gone. Israel, meanwhile, has deepened the already close relationship with its most fervent champion, the US. Washington, in its turn, has declared a policy of seeking to deny Iran and Iraq, potentially the two most powerful economic and military powers in the region, the means to develop their influence. Seen from Jerusalem, it must appear that Israel and the US have the power to dictate events in the Middle East as never before. It is a view shared by many Arab governments. Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians went to Madrid and the nine subsequent rounds of negotiations in Washington because it was the only formula remaining which might, with US involvement, lead to the return of their land occupied by Israel in the 1967 war, as demanded in two UN resolutions. They came to the table essentially as supplicants with little to offer, except the prospect of peace treaties. For governments which until recently had beaten the drum of Arab nationalism, Palestinian self-determination, and unending resistance to Israeli ambitions, it was a chastening and potentially humiliating experience. And the less they achieved, the greater would be the embarrassment of justifying their actions in front of their own populations. By attacking Lebanon in the manner it has, Israel is seeking to strip the last remnants of their formerly hostile political clothing from them. Syria, and the Lebanese government on which it has such strong influence, are being told by the Israelis to put an end to the military activities of Hizbollah, the Iranian-supported group which proclaims that it is fighting a war of national liberation in south Lebanon. Without the curbing of Hizbollah, the civilians of the south will not be allowed to return to their shattered homes, and Lebanon's attempts at reconstruction will come to nought. But Hizbollah is more than a guerrilla movement. It also enjoys widespread support among the Shia community in Lebanon, runs an extensive social welfare programme and won eight seats in the last parliamentary elections. Lebanese ministers are well aware that the only way to reduce Hizbollah's growing influence is by raising the overall economic well-being of Lebanon, a process which Israel has now put firmly into reverse. The parallels with the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza are obvious. There, too, Israel's response to the Palestinian uprising has led to greater economic hardship and an erosion of the popular support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which gave its blessing to the peace process, and a political boost to the radical Islamic forces, which oppose it. For those Israelis who prefer the present situation to the alternative sought by the Arab negotiators, such developments are not unwelcome. It enables them to argue, especially in front of a US audience, that radical Islam has now become the most potent threat not just to Israel, but also to most of the western world. How fully the US accepts this assessment may be clearer in the next few days when Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, sets out once more for the region with his prime objective of promoting peace again overshadowed by the need to limit the damage of war.</p>

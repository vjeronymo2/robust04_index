			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits rise to Dollars 141m at Colgate COLGATE-Palmolive, the US consumer products company, saw profits increase from Dollars 113.8m to Dollars 140.8m in the first quarter of 1993, before charges related to changes in accounting rules, writes Nikki Tait. Sales were up from Dollars 1.6bn to Dollars 1.7bn, and earnings per share (again before accounting-related charges) rose from 74 cents to 85 cents. Mr Reuben Mark, Colgate's chairman, said that strong sales increases in Latin America, Asia and in the Hill's Pet Nutrition division offset 'the effects of economic softness' in the US, and the less favourable currency exchange rates in Europe.</p>

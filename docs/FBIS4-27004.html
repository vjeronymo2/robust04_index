In opening itself up to the  outside world, China has been taking the road of focusing on its  coastal areas and gradually extending the policy to its  hinterland. This is a correct decision and a correct measure  which accords with China's national conditions and the laws  governing economic development. At present, our opening up is  facing a new situation, and the international and domestic  situations are favorable to our opening up. We should sum up  our expereinces and explore new ways to advance China's opening  up to a new stage. [end of editor's note]    At the beginning of this century and the end of last  century,  then U.S. Secretary of State John Mohan [name as transliterated]  drew an inference: "The Mediterranean is a sea of the past, the  Atlantic is the ocean of the present, and the Pacific is the  ocean of the future."    Nearly a century has passed. Now, whenever people turn on  the television and read the newspapers in various areas of the  world, they can feel the vitality of countries and regions on  the Pacific rim; particularly they can feel how China, which is  in the midst of reform and opening to the outside world, is  marching from the depth of history toward the future, toward the  new century.  <H5>  The Call of the Pacific </H5>   The shifting of the center of the world's economy toward the  Pacific region began in the sixties of this century.    Rapid economy growth occurred in Japan, South Korea,  Singapore, and China's Taiwan and Hong Kong regions. But at  that time, Mainland China missed the opportunity for economic  development. China's economy was still relatively closed and  backward.    As soon as the "Great Cultural Revolution" ended, China  felt,  most sorrowfully, the urgency to open itself up and to develop  economically.    At the CPC working conference held in the spring of 1979, a  leading comrade of the Guangdong provincial party committee made  a suggestion: We can take advantage of Guangdong being close to  Hong Kong and Macao and begin opening up to the outside world.    With foresight, Comrade Deng Xiaoping supported this  suggestion and also said: We can designate a piece of land and  call it a special zone. Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia is a special  zone, you know. It is better to run special zones.    As soon as the central working conference ended, a vice  premier of the State Council led a work group to inspect  Guangdong and Fujian Provinces. They discussed with the  responsible comrades of the two provinces specific questions on  setting up special zones.    In June of the same year, the Guangdong and Fujian  provincial  party committees wrote their respective reports in which they  decided to designate areas in Guangdong's Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and  Shantou and Fujian's Xiamen for running special export zones on  a trial basis in line with the Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal.  In the spring of the following year, the Central Committee held  a meeting in Guangzhou, in which leaders of Guangdong and Fukien  participated. At the meeting, the special export zones were  officially named "special economic zones."    It was decided that the Shenzhen special zone would have an  area of 327.5 square kilometers [km]; the Zhuhai special zone,  6.18 square km; the Shantou special zone, 1.6 square km. In  Xiamen, a beautiful coastal city, 2.5 square km were designated  for its special economic zone. Today, not only have the areas  of these special zones been expanded, but the entire Hainan  Province has been designated as a special economic zone.  Morever, the special economic zones and open cities and areas  along the coast have formed an entirely new open economic  pattern. Facing the Pacific, China's coastal areas have become  areas with the greatest economic vitality and attraction on the  continent in the East.    In constrast to the Atlantic's economic position, the  Pacific remained silent for nearly a century. The "silence,  which spanned the last century and this century," was finally  broken thanks to China's reform and abrupt rise.    Going toward the Pacific -- this marks the beginning of a  new  era for China.  <H5>  Drawing the Blueprint of the Opening Up of the Republic </H5>   In early 1984, Comrade Deng Xiaoping arrived in Shenzhen,  Zhuhai, and Xiamen to begin his first inspection of the coastal  special economic zones. What he saw there was a flourishing  scene of prosperity.    Comrade Xiaoping was able to take control of the trend of  China's opening to the outside world because he viewed economic  issues from a political perspective.    China was closed to the outside world for more than 300  years, from the middle period of the Ming Dynasty to the Opium  War. This brought for it poverty and backwardness. At present,  there is spring everywhere when the East wind blows. With great  interest, Comrade Deng Xiaoping inspected the Luohu commercial  zone, which was under construction, visited a fishing village,  and toured the China Aviation Technology Import-Export  Corporation in Shenzhen... on the top floor of the National  Trade Center, which had just gone into operation after  completion, he viewed the lights from tens of thousands of home  in Shenzhen and the meandering Shenzhen River. He looked far  into the distance and saw Hong Kong through the mist. To people  by his side, he said: "I saw it, I saw it clearly!"    In the dim light of night, China suffered more than 100  years  of humiliation, experiencing ups and downs and striving to move  forward. This cannot but make people sigh with emotion.    At that time Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: In establishing  special economic zones and pursuing the open policy, we should  have a clear guiding principle -- that is, we should not retreat  but open up to the outside world. He further made an overall  important suggestion regarding China's opening up to the outside  world.    A entirely new pattern of opening up to the outside world  has  taken shape in China: There is overall development of economic  and trade relations between the hinterland and the surrounding  countries, and opening up in the frontier regions has opened  another door to the outside world; we have established five  special economic zones, including Hainan Province; we have  opened 14 coastal port cities and established 32 economic and  technological development zones and 52 national new and high  technology development zones in the open cities; after opening  up the Chang Jiang Delta, the Zhu Jiang Delta, and the Triangle  Area in Southern Fujian Province to the outside world, the  entire coastal areas have been designated as areas open to the  outside world; following this, opening up to the outside world  has moved toward the hinterland along the Chang Jiang and the  European-Asian Continental Bridge; some cities in the hinterland  have successively opened up to the outside world; China has more  than 900 cities and counties opening up to the outside world....    The world-renowned opening up and development of Pudong,  which has reached its peak in the nineties, stimulated the  development of the economic belt along the Chang Jiang.    The following data can serve as a vivid history of the  China's opening up to the outside world.    -- China's total import-export trade volume has increased  from $20.64 billion in 1978 to $195.8 billion in 1993, an  eight-fold increase, averaging 16.2 percent a year. In 1993  China's total foreign trade volume ranked 11 in the world.  China's total import- export volume has accounted for more than  one-third of its gross national product.    -- China now ranks second in the world in using foreign  capital. In the 15 years between 1979 and 1993, China approved  174,000 foreign investment projects, with actual investment of  $63.9 billion. Foreign businessmen who invested in China came  from more than 120 countries and regions. Foreign investment in  China has continued to surge upward. In the second investment  upsurge, which occurred last year, China approved 83,000 foreign  investment projects, with actual investment of $25.7 billion, up  70.6 percent and 150 percent over 1992, respectively.    -- China's opening up to the outside world has shifted  from one-way importation to two-way exchanges. A number of  Chinese enterprises with strong financial strength have moved to  set up enterprises overseas. By 1993, China's overseas  enterprises numbered 4,497, with $5.16 billion invested by the  Chinese side. They are located in more than 120 countries and  regions.    Following the opening of its doors to the outside world,  China, an ancient country, embraced with boldness of vision the  tide of the century coming from the Pacific. China has become  one of the most open countries in the world.  <H5>  Reform and Opening Up: China's Second Revolution </H5>   When economic and social prosperity, which once existed in  the history of this ancient country of China, began to dwindle  in the memory of the century, the resurgence of the world  economy has finally come along with the tide of the Pacific.  China is at the point where the regression of history, the  replacement of one era by another, and reform and opening to the  outside world converge.    When Comrade Xiaoping revisited Shenzhen in the spring of  1992, he said: It is necessary to seize the opportunity. Now  is the opportunity. Judging from international experiences, in  some countries there have been periods of rapid development or  phases of rapid development. At present, China's internal  conditions are ripe, and the international environment is  favorable. Morever, we can take advantage of the fact that in a  socialist country, forces can be mobilized to do great things.  In the long process of modernization in the days to come, it is  necessary, and also possible, to bring about several phases of  rapid development with high efficiency. We must have lofty  aspirations and great ideals.    In 1949, the world pattern changed as a result of the  Chinese  revolution. Today, Deng Xiaoping has called China's reform and  opening up to the outside world the second revolution.    With the passage of the last 15 years, a line has been  clearly charted for the victory of China's second revolution by  the developments in the various regions and industries.    Reform and opening up to the outside world have been written  into the basic line of the CPC and thus have become the  unchangeable basic national policy for building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    From 1979 to 1983, China started the building of special  zones; from 1984, the year Xiaoping inspected the special zones  for the first time, to 1988, the pattern of the opening up of  China's coastal areas was basically formed; from the spring of  1992, the time when Xiaoping inspected Shenzhen and Zhuhai for  the second time, to the present, the third upsurge of opening up  to the outside world emerged in the vast land of China. These  are precisely the "three campaigns" of opening up to the outside  world in which Comrade Deng Xiaoping seized the opportunity and  directed the tens of millions of people throughout the country  to participate.    It was precisely in one victory after another that rose in  the new cities of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Pudong; it was these  victories that led foreign corporations, such as Beijing Jeep,  Shanghai Volkswagen, Siemens, Philips, and Bell, to settle in  China; more than 4,000 Chinese enterprises have moved overseas,  and 50 of them have issued stocks abroad....    It was precisely in the course of difficult marches forward  that the Chinese have discovered their own latent ability, have  seen the brilliant light for the rejuvenation of an ancient  civilization, and opened up a path that it must go down to make  itself fit into the family of nations.    Now, the "relay baton" of reform and opening to the outside  world has been passed on to the new generation of China's  leaders.    At the 14th CPC National Congress, which was a congress of  greatest historical significance, General Secretary of the CPC  Central Committee Jiang Zemin declared:    -- Open up more areas to the outside world and form a  multi-layered, multichannel, and multidirectional opening up  pattern;    -- Accelerate the opening up of hinterland provinces and  autonomous regions to the outside world;    -- With the opening and development of Pudong in Shanghai as  the lead, futher open cities along the Chang Jiang to the  outside world;    -- Efforts should be made to quickly build Shanghai into one  of the world's economic, financial, and trading centers, so as  to stimulate rapid economic development in the Chang Jiang Delta  and in the Chang Jiang basin as a whole;    -- Accelerate the opening and development in Guangdong,  Fujian, Hainan, and in areas around the rim of the Bohai.  Efforts should be made to turn, in about 20 years, Guangdong  and other localities with suitable conditions into China's areas  which have basically attained modernization....    Facing the Pacific, the Zhu Jiang, Chang Jiang, and Huang He  are all responding mangnificently to the call of history.</p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Compensation limits unlawful - European Court UK rules restricting the amount of compensation available to victims of sex discrimination are unlawful, the European Court of Justice ruled last week in the second Marshall case. Miss Helen Marshall, a dietician, had been dismissed by her employer, the Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority, on the grounds that she had passed state pension age. In 1986 the European Court ruled that because state pension ages were different for men and women, her dismissal was discriminatory and illegal. The issue the court had to decide in the second case was the level of compensation to which she was entitled. Under the UK's Sex Discrimination Act, compensation at the time was limited to Pounds 6,250. An industrial tribunal assessed Miss Marshall's financial loss at Pounds 18,405, including Pounds 7,710 in interest. The Area Health Authority paid the capital sum, but appealed against the interest. The Court first analysed the objective of the sex discrimination provisions in the relevant EC directive. It held that the purpose of the provisions was to put into effect in member states the principle of equal treatment for men and women in employment. It then reiterated that the particular provision that prohibited sex discrimination was of direct effect, and could be relied on by an individual against a state authority acting as an employer. As to the provision in the directive that put member states under a duty to take all necessary measures to enable persons who considered themselves wronged by discrimination to pursue their claims before the courts, the Court said that the measures in question had to be such as to guarantee real and effective judicial protection and have a real deterrent effect on the employer. This meant that the particular circumstances of each breach should be taken into account and, in the event of discriminatory dismissal, a situation of equality could not be restored without either reinstating the victim or, alternatively, granting financial compensation for the loss and damage suffered. In the light of this, the Court held that fixing an upper limit on compensation breached the provision in the Council directive relating to the member states' obligation to guarantee real and effective judicial protection, because such an action necessarily limited the amount of compensation to a level which might not reflect the actual loss and damage suffered in each case. The Court also held that interest must be capable of being awarded, as compensation must be full and had to take account of factors, such as the passage of time, which might reduce its value. Finally, the Court held that the fact that member states were entitled to choose between different solutions to achieve the objective of guaranteeing real and effective judicial protection, did not prevent that provision from being directly effective. C-271/91: Marshall v Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority, ECJ FC, August 2 1993 Italian rules on foreign language assistants unlawful The European Court has ruled that an Italian law restricting contracts for foreign language assistants to renewable one-year periods was contrary to the Rome treaty's provisions on the free movement of workers. The law in question only applied to foreign language assistants and not to other teachers. The Court found that, although the law applied independently of nationality, it applied essentially to nationals from other member states, as only 25 per cent of all foreign language assistants in Italy were Italian. It was argued that the rules were necessary to ensure that numbers of assistants matched the annual needs of the universities. The Court held that the EC provisions did not stop member states from adopting indirectly applicable measures aimed at resource management as long as such measures are proportionate.

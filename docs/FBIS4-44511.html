			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Liping (1728 4539 1627), director of the </F> Medical Department of the PLA General Logistics Department  [GLD]: "Unify Conceptualization, Strengthen Economic Management,  Strive To Meet the Needs of the New Situation"]    [Text] Editor's Note: At a seminar devoted to the  issue of economic management in medical work recently convened  at the Shenyang Military District Hospital (Sanitarium), Zhang  Liping presented a complete exposition and set forth clear and  concrete demands as to how military hospitals can properly  effect economic management and provided guidance on how to  develop and administer military hospitals under the new  situation of market economy. We herewith publish his talk in  abstract so that units may study and implement it.    The strategic plan set forth by the Military Commission [MC]  for the new era raises greater demands on military hospitals as  to how they can assure delivery of medical logistics in limited  warfare under modern conditions, especially those of high  technology. The establishment of socialist market economy and  the advancement of medical reform across the country present  many new conditions and problems for military hospitals. Faced  therewith, medical logistics leaders at all levels, especially  comrades engaged in military hospital administration, must keep  sober and ensure delivery of accurate guidance throughout all  their work.  <H5>  I. Unify Conceptualization Regarding How To Respond to the </H5> New Situation    A. "Response" Must Serve To Improve Combat Effectiveness and  Not Merely To Generate Revenue    Whenever discussing response to the new situation of market  economy, some comrades consider only how to increase revenue,  equating "response" with money-making. Increasing revenue so as  to finance operations certainly forms one aspect of "response,"  but there is much more thereto. It means better response to the  new macroenvironment of market economy through service direction  and quality and effort in terms of technology, personnel,  equipment, administration, finance, and other quarters so as to  help improve combat effectiveness. Thus "assurance" converges  with "response." Indeed, it is consideration of the external  effects of market economy that leads us to stress "assurance,"  making it a basic premise. And, at bottom, we actively "respond"  to the new situation so as to provide better "assurance."    B. "Response" Must Proceed from the Fundamental Laws and  Characteristics of Military Medical Work and Not Mimic Market  Mechanism    Under the new situation, management of military medical  work,  especially compensated service provided to locals, should draw  on, but not mimic, some market mechanism methodology. This is  dictated by the unique nature, function, and mission of medical  work, especially military medical work. From the broadest  perspective, the first requirement in terms of the social  benefit medical work provides, the basic function of military  medical work, the very nature of ensuring well-being, the  characteristics of the military system, and the revolutionary  humanitarian purpose of saving the dying and treating the  wounded all differ fundamentally from the principles of market  economy, whose principal objective is maximizing profit through  exchange; is premised, in terms of participation, on a high  degree of autonomy; is guided mainly by market demand; and so on.    C. "Response" Must Ensure That Service Direction Does Not  Skew, Treatment Quality Does Not Fall, and Professional  Integrity Does Not Slip    Under market economy, people's notion and awareness of  material benefit and private interest grow, and disturbance from  all directions steadily mounts. So if we fail to adopt effective  educative and control measures, "assurance" may fail, service  quality may not meet muster, professional integrity may slip,  and other bad phenomena may arise. Over the past several years,  we have unstintingly stressed direction, quality, and integrity.  Yet even so, noteworthy problems have cropped up in some units.  For example, in the area of service, some hospitals still show  lack of dedication and devotion to treatment of army wounded and  sick; responsibility is shirked in disguised form; and some  hospitals fail to uphold funding standards in administering  drugs and even charge soldiers arbitrary fees therefor. Service  shortfall is even greater when it comes to taking the initiative  in providing preventive guidance, monitoring disease, and  technical assistance ties [BANGDAI]. Quality shortcomings are  saliently manifested as failure to uphold standards for and the  overall poor quality of basic treatment and care. Many hospitals  have failed properly to adhere to the system and standards we  have developed over the past several decades, indeed even such  basic things as three-tiered examination, pre-surgical and  pre-death discussion, the "three checks and seven responses,"  and the like. And there are numerous noteworthy problems in the  area of professional integrity. In today's society, some medical  personnel lose their sense of right and wrong whenever they see  profit to be made, succumbing to self-aggrandizement through  medicine, an evil that is reflected in military hospitals as  well. We must place great emphasis on the effects the new  situation creates in the areas of service direction, treatment  quality, and professional integrity. If we fail to master these  problems and if existing bad tendencies are allowed to fester,  the consequences will be unthinkable, and we will be unable to  face the officers and enlisted personnel of the entire armed  forces.  <H5>  II. The Effective Way To Respond to the New Situation Is To </H5> Stress "Assurance"    A. Establish Effective Regulatory Measures    To achieve "assurance," we must, while applying  administrative and legal controls, effectively employ economic  ones as well. We absolutely must firmly control that which  should be controlled. Moonlighting, special service, external  service, work in hospitals run jointly with localities or as  integrated entities, and the like must strictly abide by  relevant regulation and approval procedure. No second occupation  is permitted. And we must scrupulously effect positional  responsibility for hospital and department directors, provide  regular performance evaluation, and ensure that reward and  punishment are appropriately dispensed.  B. Promptly Systematize and Normatize Successful Experience  under the New Situation, Including Establishing an Effective  Self-Restraint System    Over the past several years, medical units throughout the  armed forces have pioneered much new experience in providing  "assurance." After summarizing, studying, and refining this  experience, we must integrate it with previous success and study  how to establish an integrated, coordinated system. With a legal  system and a normatized basis for behavior, stable service to  the armed forces can be assured, no matter how the situation and  environment fluctuate.  C. Deepen and Elaborate Service  I stress three things. First, in terms of treating military  injured and sick, emphasize priority, quality, and convenience;  fulfill one's mission to the best of one's ability; and assure  treatment quality and safety as much as possible so as to  satisfy officers and enlisted personnel. Second, expand hospital  function and enhance preventive and health-maintenance work. We  must strengthen integration of prevention and treatment in and  outside of hospitals and strive to prevent disease in and to  improve the health of military units. Third, we must, in  accordance with the requirements of the MC's strategic plan,  conscientiously prepare so that we can ensure effective response  to any emergency. These desiderata must be achieved, and  achieved properly, by all medical units throughout the armed  forces.  <H5>  III. Improve and Strengthen Economic Management, Better </H5> Effect "Assurance," and Better Respond to the Needs of the New  Situation    A. Clarify Objectives and Progressively Advance Economic  Management    To manage military hospitals properly, the most important  thing is to accurately guide medical work towards service.  Economic management not only focuses on bottom-line profit but  should also consider how better to effect the basic functions of  military hospitals, provide more accurate guidance, improve  quality and economic results, and serve hospital development.  Secondly, we must plug loopholes and reduce costs and waste.  Third, we must establish a vigorous restraint and incentive  mechanism and fully mobilize initiative. Fourth, we must "keep  clear books" so that accurate, timely, and scientific  information and advice is provided to all levels and  decision-making error is reduced.    B. Concentrate Resources on Resolution of Cost-Accounting  Problems    First, we must scientifically and rationally define cost.  Beyond actual depletion, how and by how much shall we depreciate  fixed capital? How shall the military-expense conversion portion  be computed? Of fixed capital, how shall the portions put up by  superior agencies, locals, through accumulation, jointly, or by  foreigners be appraised? How shall indirect depletion be  assessed? Regulations regarding these matters were established  in GLD Health Department Document 194 of 1989. After several  years of experience, however, we must reexamine these  regulations to determine which are suitable, which are truly  feasible, and which require supplement or revision.    Second, we must accurately establish accounting typology.  Most other countries practice three-tiered accounting. We must  strive to pave the way for and effect this and account by  disease type with the patient as basic unit. In view of actual  conditions in military hospitals, the basis and conditions for  this approach readily exist.    Third is the issue of departmental accounting. As an entity  that actually provides treatment, the department certainly  should form an accounting level. However, difficulty, intensity,  and inputs among departments vary greatly, so careful cross  comparison thereamong is warranted. And while departments may be  made accounting units, they must not undertake responsibility  contracting. We should administer them through  composite-objective responsibility and treat economic return as  but one element in evaluating their overall performance.    Treatment cost accounting must closely be integrated with  automation, and computers should become powerful managerial  tools. Modern management and cost accounting are inseparable  from automation. Units that have effected automation must  advance it because this work has considerable potential. Those  units that have not effected it should begin doing so as soon as  possible. The master plan must be handled properly, the right  personnel must be recruited, and things must get rolling  promptly. Naturally, it is important that leadership provide  emphasis and support.    C. In Applying Economic Measures, Be Attentive To Promoting  the Beneficial and Eliminating the Harmful, Use the Measures To  Accurately Guide Hospital Work, and Prevent Them from  Excessively Stressing Profit and Engendering Unscrupulous  Money-Grubbing    Economic measures are two-edged. If we are to promote the  beneficial and eliminate the harmful and prevent "money  grubbing" from arising and spreading, the key lies in accurately  mastering and employing these measures. First, we must  accurately handle the relationship between economic results and  quality. We must stress results but emphasize quality even more  and increase the weight of the latter in overall performance  review and in determining bonus distribution. Second, we must  particularize and concretize the requirements of guidance and of  principle by incorporating these requirements into the specific  duties assigned to each administrative post under the positional  responsibility system. For example, the issues of service  direction, treatment quality, and professional integrity must be  linked to positional responsibility, performance evaluation, and  reward and punishment dispensation so that orders from superiors  are transformed, via the interest mechanism, into conscious  behavior by department and individual. Third, we must mobilize  initiative as much as possible by providing appropriate  secondary distribution in accordance with both results and  fairness. Primary distribution focuses principally on results  and contribution. However, for those units that bear heavy  "assurance" mission, serve many military units, or are  unprofitable yet whose work is highly technical, hospitals, in  addition to effecting primary distribution by department, should  provide appropriate secondary distribution, taking into account  both results and fairness as well as the interests of all  quarters in terms of the overall picture, and thereby fully  mobilize initiative.    D. Take the Correct Path to Revenue Generation and Pursue  Success through Technology and Integrity    Under the new situation, hospitals face many new  circumstances, contradictions, and difficulties in their effort  to develop resources and generate revenue, and we must treat  these seriously. To generate revenue, hospitals must not resort  to indiscriminate drug dispensing, writing huge prescriptions,  or unnecessary service, thereby increasing patient financial  burden. These are impermissible and undermine the image of  military hospitals. In accordance with the spirit of the  directives issued by the MC and the GLD and in view of actual  conditions in military hospitals, the latter should place most  of their effort on providing technical service and exploiting  their scientific and technological advantages and strive for  success in developing through science, quality, and strength in  terms of technology and integrity. These two approaches form the  foundation for military hospital effort to achieve successful  development and can never be relaxed. Strengthening  technological development is dependent primarily on the  specialities in which hospitals possess advantage and on  training and recruiting middle-aged and young personnel. The key  to strengthening professional integrity lies in transforming  ideal into reality. We must make this effort fundamental to the  development of our profession, keep dossiers on the integrity of  our personnel, use great reward to recognize exemplars, sternly  punish people lacking in virtue, and resolutely check evil  practice.    E. While Stressing Revenue Generation, Also Stress Economy  and Strive for Quality While Reducing Waste    Hospital economic management involves nothing other than  needing, making, saving, and exploiting money. Given the  situation in China, the most fundamental approach is to seek  quality and reduce waste so as to provide the best treatment  outcome with the least expenditure input. We must provide better  treatment for less money. And to do this we must strengthen  economic management, stress economy, and take advantage of our  people's superb skills.    In reducing expenditure, we must pay particular attention to  scientific decision-making regarding investment and provide  repeated study and proof of need when selecting construction and  developmental projects. Examples that decision-making errors are  the greatest source of waste abound. We must be careful to plug  leaks and reduce waste everywhere. For example, drug purchase  kickbacks run about five percent everywhere. If hospitals can  strengthen supervision over each link, make secret and private  operations open and public, a medium-sized unit could save about  50,000-60,000 yuan a year, which would become tremendous when  multiplied throughout the armed forces. Even more importantly,  there is a political factor here, which, if not stressed, will  send some cadres to ruin.    F. Stress Comprehensive Application of All Types of Measures    No single type of managerial measure is omnipotent.  Excessive  reliance on any one inevitably begets trouble. This is true for  economic management, too; one cannot rely purely on that  approach. And this is especially true for military hospitals. We  must never lose the fine tradition and practice of our armed  forces, their spirit of arduous struggle, their advantage in  ideological work, and their organizational discipline of strict  obedience and of "following orders in everything one does." And  we must not ignore comprehensive application of ideological,  administrative, legal, and other measures.    G. Strengthen Training of Economic Managers and Develop a  Corps Adept at Finance    All hospitals really need to establish economic managerial  organs or at least should have experts in this field. Many  hospital directors hope to resolve the problem through  organizational expansion, but we must accomplish this work while  retrenching and reorganizing hospitals throughout the armed  forces. Each unit and hospital most devote special attention to  managerial organ and personnel. We must also improve the quality  of such personnel and train a corps that can handle finance and  management and, especially importantly, create "amphibians"  adept at both medicine and finance. We must make solid and  practical effort to improve management of all military hospitals  under the new situation.</p>

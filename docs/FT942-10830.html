			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Ex-Tory voters say PM must go Most ex-Conservative voters want Mr John Major to resign, according to a Gallup opinion poll conducted for the BBC. In a poll of 988 people who voted Tory in the 1992 general election, 58 per cent said Mr Major should resign, while just 34 per cent said he should stay on. All 988 people polled said they would not or were not inclined to vote Tory if there were a general election tomorrow. Among this group of voters, the Conservatives are less trusted on tax than Labour, the poll found. Eighty eight per cent said they would not believe a Conservative politician talking about taxes, while 82 per cent would not trust a Labour politician on the subject. Mr Michael Heseltine was the preferred choice to replace Mr Major, with 34 per cent of these former Tory voters saying they would vote Conservative if he were party leader. Only 18 per cent in each case would vote Conservative if either Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, or Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary, were in charge.</p>

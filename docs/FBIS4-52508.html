			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- An investment consultant  testified before a Diet budget committee Wednesday [11 May] that  a dubious stock transaction was carried out by former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, not his late father-in-law as  claimed by Hosokawa.    At a session of the House of Councillors Budget Committee,  securities consultant Shuzo Fujiki, 60, said he served as an  intermediary in a transaction to purchase 300 shares of Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986 for Hosokawa through  his former secretary Masatoshi Miyama and company president  Yusei Kuwahata, acquaintance of both Fujiki and Hosokawa.    Fujiki, as witness, said the Hosokawa side conveyed hopes to  participate in tenders on NTT shares because (Hosokawa) could  provide collateral for funds to purchase the shares. Fujiki  also said Hosokawa used the name of his father-in-law in the  transaction.    On March 30, Fujiki told reporters that Hosokawa himself  carried out the questionable stock deal involving hundreds of  millions of yen, contrary to Hosokawa's insistence that the  stock transaction was solely conducted by his father-in-law.    The 418 million yen loan he arranged was extended with  Hosokawa's condominium in central Tokyo as collateral, Fujiki  said. Hosokawa said he purchased the condominium with 100  million yen he borrowed form Sagawa Kyubin Co., a major  scandal-tainted trucking firm in 1982.    Disputes over the stock deal and the 100 million yen loan  caused a long delay of Diet deliberations on the state budget  for fiscal 1994, which started April 1, and was partly  responsible for Hosokawa's decision to resign as premier on  April 25.</p>

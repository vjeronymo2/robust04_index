			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / In the bear's shadow: The security concerns facing the winner of tomorrow's Finnish presidential election At Nuijamaa, a crossing point on Finland's frontier with Russia about 200km north-west of St Petersburg, the rantings of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra-nationalist, seem little more than a distant echo in the chill winter air. With the temperature at -20'C, even in a dazzling midday sun, all that disturbs a sparkling scene of snow-draped forest and frozen lakes is the rumble of heavy trucks plying back and forth between the Russian giant and its little western neighbour. 'We are proud of how few incidents we have along this border,' says Capt Janne Piiroinen of the Finnish Border Guards. But he is not complacent. 'The border is more interestingnow. Russia is boiling. You don't know what will happen next.' The youngofficer's attitude neatly sums up Finland's position, as the initial optimism generated by the end of the cold war gives way to renewed uncertainty over Russia's future posture. The question of how Finland - which is seeking membership of the European Union - manages its delicate position between west and east will be the dominant issue for the winner of tomorrow's contest for the Finnish presidency between Mr Martti Ahtisaari, a seasoned United Nations diplomat, and Mrs Elizabeth Rehn, the defence minister. Directing foreign policy is the mainrole played by the president under Finland's constitution. Undoubtedly, the rise of strident Russian nationalism symbolised by Mr Zhirinovsky is worryingfor Finland. The country broke free from Russian rule only in 1917 and fought twice between 1939 and 1944 against Soviet forces to preserve its independence, much of the fighting taking place in the Karelia region around Nuijamaa. Two years ago, alarm bells began to sound in Helsinki when Mr Zhirinovsky's partyincluded Finland on its list of countries that should be brought back under Moscow's rule. Last year, for good measure, Mr Zhirinovsky declared that a country with a woman as defence minister did not deserve to be independent. The Finnish reaction has been deliberately cautious. Neither Mr Ahtisaari nor MrsRehn, who are running neck-and-neck in the opinion polls, have dwelt on the 'Zhirinovsky question' in the presidential campaign. They stress their commitmentto Finland's security, but prefer to emphasise the Russian government's declarations of commitment to democratic reform than Mr Zhirinovsky's utterances. Finland is well aware of its vulnerable position alongside such a mighty power. It learnt the benefits during the postwar period - in terms of national security but also in terms of trade - of maintaining its neutrality while cultivating friendly ties with the communists in Moscow. It is being careful now not to prejudice its relations with a more aggressive regime that may in the future take power in Russia. Suggestions that Finland might abandon its neutrality infavour of some alliance with Nato tend to be side-stepped by politicians and officials alike. But Helsinki is nevertheless making an unmistakeable strategic shift in its application to join the EU - a move supported by both Mr Ahtisaari and Mrs Rehn. Mr Max Jacobson, a former ambassador to the UN, describes Finnish membership of the EU as an 'insurance policy' against what he calls'the tremendous uncertainties' of the future. 'What gave us an advantage in the cold war period was the fact that there was a balance of power in Europe. The Russians had to take into account western reactions to whatever they did towards Finland. The west accepted our reservations about participation in western organisations. 'We now have to consider the possibility that the west won'tbe so interested in what may happen in eastern Europe. If we choose to stay outside the EU, what obligations would the western countries feel towards us?' Opinion polls suggest that fear of what may transpire in Russia is bolstering pro-EU opinion in Finland. If negotiations on an accession agreement - being conducted in parallel with those of fellow-applicants Austria, Norway and Sweden - are completed by the March deadline, a referendum to decide the issue will be held by the end of this year. But a clear path to membership is still byno means assured. There is a significant camp in Finland that argues that the country should stay outside the EU and unambiguously neutral precisely because itmay one day again find itself squeezed between mutually hostile western and eastern powers. Negotiations with Brussels on entry terms are also complicated by deep differences over subsidies for Finnish agriculture, which Helsinki wants treated under the Common Agricultural Policy as a special Nordic category. The rurally rooted Centre party of Prime Minister Esko Aho is split on the EU issue and could not accept an accession agreement seen to disadvantage Finnish farmers. If a crisis over accession terms does blow up in the next month, the new president could immediately be faced with a splintering of Mr Aho's Centre-Conservative coalition on the EU issue. However, if such pitfalls are avoided and Finland joins the EU, the 1,200km-long border Capt Piiroinen helps patrol will become the Union's first direct frontier with Russia and Finland's border problems will also become Brussels'. In that case, the message from the Finnish side is so far reassuring. Concerns after the collapse of the Soviet Unionthat a flood of hungry refugees might pour over the low fence that marks the border have proved groundless. The number of illegal border crossings in Capt Piiroinen's 25km sector has more than than halved since 1990 to a paltry 20 last year. 'We were very worried about that - but it just hasn't happened,' he says. The number of smuggling cases has doubled, with 120 serious incidents - involving mainly illicit pharmaceuticals and precious metals - recorded along the southern 500km sector of the frontier last year. But customs officials say co-operation with the Russian authorities is good and improving. Above all, the local economy in the border area is benefiting from a growth in private cross-border trade, which barely existed before the disappearance of the Soviet regime. In Lappeenranta, the main Finnish border city, telecommunications and postal links have been set up with St Petersburg. This has enabled more than100 foreign companies working in the Russian city to maintain reliable communications with their home bases. Transit trade has blossomed since 1991 and grew bymore than 300 per cent last year. Used cars alone are being bought and taken back across the border by Russians at the rate of more than 3,000 a month. 'We have seen buses with 30 Russians arrive in the morning from St Petersburg and return empty followed by 30 newly-purchased cars, all bought with cash,' saysMr Jarmo Pirhonen, head of the local chamber of commerce. He has a sanguine view of the future. 'We have to be realistic - we can't change our geography and there is no benefit in being afraid. Of course we are a little bit worried. But I think whatever happens in Russia, trade will go on, because they really need it.'</p>

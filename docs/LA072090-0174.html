			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DAVIS REJECTS PLEA FROM JORDAN AND RE-SIGNS WITH THE NUGGETS  </P> <P> Walter Davis has signed a two-year contract with the Denver Nuggets, despite a  personal plea by Michael Jordan for Davis to help the Chicago Bulls win an NBA  championship.  </P> <P> "He called me three or four times lately.  </P> <P> He wanted me to play on his team real bad," Davis said Thursday. "And it was  very tempting to play alongside Michael Jordan and get a chance to win a  championship."  </P> <P> But Davis, 35, a 13-year veteran, chose to remain in Denver because he has a  daughter about to enter grade school and a wife who has fallen in love with the  Rocky Mountains, he said.  </P> <P> Denver initially signed the 6-6 Davis as a free agent in 1988. Davis has scored  18,140 points during his career, making him the 30th-leading scorer in NBA  history.  </P> <P> "It's important to have him," Nuggets Coach Doug Moe said. "There's going to be  a big turnover on this team this year. We have spots to fill and we'd like to  fill most of them with young guys. But we wanted to keep some veterans."  </P> <P> Moe said as many as five rookies could find spots on the Nuggets' 1990-91  roster. The Nuggets also said they have told 31-year-old center Joe Barry  Carroll there will be no effort made to re-sign him.  </P></p>

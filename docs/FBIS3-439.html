			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Arlette Khouri: "It Has Been Confirmed to </F> AL-HAYAH That a Broad Front for the Opposition Is Close To Being  Formed; a Chadian Opposition Leader Accuses France of Supporting  the Deby System for the Sake of Its Own Oil Interests"]    [Text] Paris--The president of the Movement for Democracy  and Development in Chad, Moussa Medella, confirmed in an  interview to AL-HAYAH yesterday that the Chadian opposition will  not participate in the elections anticipated to take place in  the coming spring. He said that his movement has liaisons under  way with the goal of forming a broad front, bringing together  cells of the opposition, and working towards the realization of  a democratic arrangement in the country, after President Idriss  Deby's failure to do so.    Medella accused the French Government of offering support to  President Deby because he resorted to increasing the French  companies' share in Chadian oil. But he at the same time took  into consideration that there is no comprehensive solution to  the Chadian crisis without French sponsorship of any agreement  that is achieved.    He believes that the Chadian people have not enjoyed any  type  of democracy and stability since independence. He accused Deby  of duplicity in his positions "because, when he is in France, he  makes statements that it does not take him long to renounce when  he is in Sudan, for example."    The opinion of Medella, who held the post of minister of  health and social affairs in the era of former President  Goukouni Oueddei, is that Chad is presently in a dilemma because  of the economic situation that he described as "below zero" and  because of the emigration of about 60 percent of the people to  the neighboring countries because the civil war in Chad is  continuous.    He mentioned that, in facing this reality, the movement is  striving, for the sake of democracy, for the polarization of the  greatest number possible of the Chadian cells opposed to "the  formation of a broad front striving for a settling of the  situation existing presently in the country. If it becomes clear  that the settlement is not possible beyond compromise with the  system, nothing will remain before us except the use of a  military solution."    He added that the liaisons have produced positive results up  to this point. He said that the opposition cells will hold a  meeting within a week or two, in a location he refused to  disclose, to work toward the agreement on the establishment of a  broad front, "keeping away from religious, tribal, and  ideological memberships and supporting anything that has to do  with the interests of the Chadian people."    He attacked the national conference that was held  approximately one year ago in Chad. He said that his movement  rejected participation in it in light of President Deby's  authority over the military, political, and economic  installations in the country, "which means that the conference  was no more than an occasion throughout which the participants  expressed their viewpoints without reaching any decisions."    He said that his movement, which presented a positive  initiative on the occasion of the holding of the national  conference and announced a truce in its confrontation with the  governmental powers, found itself subjected to attacks on the  part of these powers the evening of the conference. He pointed  to the fact that the goal in organizing the conference was "to  mislead international public opinion and to help Deby appear on  the exterior as a democratic man at the same time that he was  gathering all the power into his own hands and was not leaving  any area open to others to participate in the decisionmaking."    Concerning the elections expected to take place next spring,  Medella said that the Chadian opposition cells found in the  country, whose number is estimated to be around 45, are seeking  the materials required for participation in the elections. He  said that the armed opposition represented in his movement,  present in the Lake Chad region, in addition to other groups of  armed opposition found outside the regions of governmental  authority, is refusing to participate in "formal" elections such  as this.    He confirmed that the issue of the elections will be at the  heart of the discussions that the opposition cells will carry on  during the coming meeting and that they will demand national  reconciliation, defining the groundwork for reestablishing the  army, and working toward the return of the emigrants and the  exiled before any elections take place. He confirmed that the  opposition cells are all joining each other in the view that  holding elections under the present circumstances is impossible.  <H5>  The Islamists in Chad </H5>   Concerning the scope of the importance of the Islamic cells,  he said that Chad is facing several problems, such as ignorance,  poverty, and conflict, among the political elements, each of  which want to play a prominent role. He made it clear that among  these elements are those striving to use the Arabic culture  against the French and those striving for the opposite. There  are also elements calling for the establishment of an Islamic  system.    He added that whoever knows the composition of Chad realizes  the impossibility of establishing any republic having a  religious character, be it Islamic or Christian. "Our issue is a  national issue and not a religious one, and we do not accept the  establishment of an Islamic system."  <H5>  French Interests </H5>   He accused the West, specifically France, of supporting  Deby,  believing that he would apply true democracy in Chad, "but the  latter is subject to a narrow view in his practice of governing,  especially after he worked to strengthen the influence of the  individuals of his family toward government in a way that is  alienated from the public interest."    He stated clearly his belief that the continuance of French  support for the present system, in spite of its failure to  achieve practical advancement in the area of upholding human  rights, "might be attributable to Deby's undertaking to  strengthen the share of the French oil companies in Chad." He  pointed out that France's share in Chadian oil presently ranges  between 22 and 25 percent, at a time when former Chadian  President Hissein Habre had refused to give the French companies  a share that they were demanding, calculated at 11 percent.    He said that Deby took this risky step to guarantee the  support of the French for his remaining in power, but they were  getting to the point where they were realizing the scope of his  failure. He confirmed that any dialogue existing in Chad for the  sake of attaining a settlement of the existing situation must be  by the sponsorship of France, in its capacity as the side  capable of guaranteeing the attainment of what is due.    Concerning the sources of his movement's funding, he said  that it is self-financed and "that it is difficult to verify  that." He made clear that the basic source of this funding is  the residents of the Lake Chad region, which is subject to the  movement's authority and which is known for its natural  resources and animal wealth. He said that these residents are  paying taxes to the movement, on their exports of local  products, the value of which is estimated at half the value of  the governmental taxes. Likewise, a large portion of the arming  of the movement has its source in what it captures from the  government forces.</p>

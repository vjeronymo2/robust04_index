The 141-km highway took about ten years and ten million yuan  (1.15 U.S. dollars) [figure as received] to build because of the  difficult terrain and conditions. It starts from Zhamu and ends  at Medog.    A spokesman for the provincial communications department  said  that frequent collapses of snow and mountains as well as  landslides caused the road-builders "unimaginable difficulties  and sacrifices."</p>

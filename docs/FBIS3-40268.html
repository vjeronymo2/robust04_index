			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Julius Gembicky: "Who Is Muhammad and Who Is </F> the Mountain? Monkey Wrench in the Works of Slovak Foreign  Policy"]    [Text] There are areas, in any at least somewhat organized  state, where party interests or other particular interests  should not come to the fore. Foreign policy is definitely one  of these areas. Unfortunately, irrespective of foreign policy  considerations and Slovakia's interests, the exact opposite is  the case. With haughty baseness, we are using even the  diplomatic field to settle domestic accounts and fighting for  who should play the first fiddle on it. Is it a miracle that,  when one diplomatic faux pas follows the next, foreign partners  are turning away from us?    We can afford things that would be unimaginable in other  countries -- to disparately interpret at the highest level the  problem of the dismantling of [bilingual] road signs; to arrive  late, without any reason, for a visit to a neighboring country;  not to see off the head of state, out of sheer spite, when he  departs for an official visit to Germany, as would be  appropriate; or to vie for who will play the first fiddle at the  meeting of representatives of the Visegrad Four countries with  President Clinton. We can afford to first make threatening  gestures at Radio Free Europe and, thereby, indirectly also at  the U.S. Congress, in a display of world power manners, only to  quietly put the tail between the legs later on and reverse the  original decision, as if suffering a fit of asphyxia from  smoking too strong a tobacco. We are unable to send out on  time, by 15 January, our official response to the recommendation  of European Union experts on how to divide the Danube water at  Gabcikovo [between Slovakia and Hungary] or to complete, prior  to President Michal Kovac's visit to Poland, agreements that are  practically ready to be signed. We can even afford the luxury  of [Economy] Minister Ducky's absence in the delegation  accompanying the president and of putting the host country out  of countenance in this way. And all that is aired to  journalists, and at home in parliament, still during the  official visit, all "in the interest" of improving Slovakia's  positive image abroad.    An ordinary citizen who, for all the flowery diplomatic  rhetoric, does not have the chance to hear the monkey wrench in  the works of Slovak foreign policy, does not understand these  blunders and acts of defiance of the highest constitutional  officials. He cannot concede to himself the possibility of  personal or political feuds being carried from the home kitchen  to the hosts' living rooms and public lounges. After all, we  all learn to try to leave in them a good, and not a bewildered,  impression, let alone arouse some piquant scandal there.    We will have to learn to carefully distinguish where is the  source, and who is the originator, of these elephants' moves in  the diplomatic china shop. We will either have to accept the  prime minister's claim about the government's accommodating  approach toward the preparation of the president's trip to  Poland, or the diplomatic tact of the president, who, when  questioned in Warsaw by inquisitive journalists about Minister  Ducky's absence, noted that the motives were not of a political  but of a technical nature. Since even the decision to terminate  Radio Free Europe broadcasts on medium waves was presented as a  technical problem, it is obvious even to a layman that this was  not the case. In the background is the struggle, which is  becoming increasingly difficult to camouflage, for the unrivaled  dominance of Slovak politics and, hence, also the steadily  growing strains in relations between the government and the  Castle [seat of the president]. A tough struggle between the  prime minister and the president for primacy was waged even over  the composition of the delegation for [the Visegrad leaders'  summit with Bill Clinton in] Prague. A thorn in Vladimir  Meciar's side was Pavol Demes [former minister of foreign  affairs and President Kovac's current foreign policy adviser],  whom the prime minister refused to include in the 12-member  delegation and who, as Vladimir Meciar suggested, should go and  have a nice beer during the talks with President Clinton. On  the other hand, since the U.S. side and the representatives of  the Visegrad Four states came to the talks with their ministers  of defense, Imrich Andrejcak's absence would have been  embarrassing, also in view of the discussion of NATO's  Partnership for Peace offer.    The tug-of-war over whether the president or the prime  minister was the real number one or number two during these  negotiations of the year has, unfortunately, resulted in the  fact that they did not consider it necessary to brief one  another about the contents of their talks. If, in the final  analysis, Jozef Moravcik, the chief of our diplomacy, will have  to foot the bill for this, it will be clear to everyone who is  Muhammad and who is the mountain.</p>

The Chinese president said that the current visit by  President Ballen will surely help promote the bilateral  relations, which have been developing steadily and smoothly  since the two established diplomatic ties 14 years ago,  especially since President Ballen took office in 1992.    The Chinese Government attaches great importance to  developing Sino-Ecuadorian ties, and it is willing to make  concerted efforts together with the Ecuadorian Government to  further promote the relations of friendship and cooperation,  especially in trade and economic cooperation on the basis of  equality and mutual benefit.    The Chinese president told the Ecuadorian guests that  exchanges between the Chinese Mainland and Taiwan have been  developing steadily and the reunification should be realized  under the guidance of the principle of "one country, two  systems."    Jiang expressed his appreciation and thanks to the  Ecuadorian  Government for its long-term adherence to principles on the  establishment of Sino-Ecuadorian diplomatic relations and its  "one China" policy.    President Ballen said that Ecuador has, as always, supported  the cause of China's reunification.    Ballen said that he has seen with his own eyes the great  achievement that China has made in its economic construction and  China's experience is very useful to Ecuador.    The Ecuadorian president said that he is confident that  through his current visit, friendship and understanding between  Ecuador and China, as well as bilateral trade and economic  cooperation, will be further enhanced.    President Ballen expressed his thanks for China's effective  economic assistance to Ecuador over the years.    President Jiang said it is very difficult for people of  different countries to understand one another, because each  nation has its specific geographic location, different cultural  background and different levels of economic development and that  makes it necessary for leaders of various nations to exchange  views frequently with one another so as to promote understanding  and eliminate differences.    President Ballen agreed with President Jiang's stand. He  said that each nation has its specific conditions and that each  nation, in dealing with its internal affairs, should adopt ways  that fit its conditions instead of copying others. This is what  China has done and so it is with Ecuador.    During the talks, the two leaders agreed that the two sides  have common or similar views regarding many major international  and regional issues and that the two share common interests in  many areas.    The two sides also exchanged views on further strengthening  bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy, trade and  education.    President Ballen invited Jiang to visit Ecuador at his  convenience, and Jiang accepted the invitation with pleasure.    After the talks, President Jiang and Ballen attended the  signing ceremonies of a series of cooperation agreements between  China and Ecuador.    These agreements included an agreement on economic and  technological cooperation between the two governments, an  agreement on encouraging and protecting mutual investments,  exchange of notes on China's providing general merchandise to  ecuador and a cooperation agreement between two petroleum  companies of the two countries.    Prior to the talks, President Jiang presided over a ceremony  to welcome President Ballen.    This evening, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of President  Ballen and his party.    This afternoon, Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of China's  National  People's Congress Standing Committee, met with Josefina  Villalobos de Duran Ballen, wife of President Ballen.    President Ballen arrived in Shanghai on March 18 and arrived  here from Xian at noon today.</p>

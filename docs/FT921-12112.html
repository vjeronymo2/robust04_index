			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar gains as G7 disappoints THE DOLLAR strengthened on currency markets yesterday following the weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven industrial countries, writes Simon London. The communique released after the G7 meeting said that the participants had reviewed recent developments in the foreign exchange markets and reaffirmed their desire for stable rates. However, this was not related to specific rates or broader policy goals. The US unit rallied as soon as the statement was released, gaining ground in Tokyo and maintaining the firm tone through European trading. From a New York finish of Y123.55 and DM1.5920 on Friday, the dollar rose to stand at Y124.57 and DM1.6040 by the Tokyo close. All through Asian trading, dealers pushed the dollar higher, although fears of central bank intervention held the dollar below Y125 and DM1.6150. Many analysts had been watching for more specific foreign exchange goals, such as a stronger yen to contain the Japanese trade surplus. The tone of the statement was underlined by comments from Mr Yasushi Meino, Bank of Japan governor. He said that the G7 meeting had not discussed specific exchange rates. In afternoon trading in London, the dollar pushed through resistance levels seen in Tokyo to peak at DM1.6180 and Y125.40. The US currency closed in London at DM1.6165, from DM1.5875 on Friday; and Y125.40 from Y123.30. The dollar was also strong against sterling, ending at Dollars 1.7765, from Dollars 1.8055 on Friday. In New York the US unit ended at DM1.6105, Y125.25 and Dollars 1.7820. Many economists are expecting the US unit to push ahead this week, testing resistance at DM1.6350, its peak during the last rally earlier this month, and Y127, the level at which the US and Japanese authorities intervened on January 17. Elsewhere, the D-Mark weakened as dealers focused on potential industrial disputes in Germany. The German currency fell to Y77.60, having traded over Y78.00. The weakness of the D-Mark against the Spanish peseta, which appreciated to Pta63.00 from the Pta63.20 level seen last week, raised sterling's floor within the European exchange rate mechanism. The pound's floor, determined by its maximum permitted divergence from the strongest currency in the system, was yesterday around DM2.8665. However, sterling was buoyant following the publication of opinion polls at the weekend giving the UK Conservative government a narrow lead. Current account figures for December also supported the UK currency. The data showed the current account deficit narrowed to Pounds 338m in December, from Pounds 630m in November. The deficit for the whole of last year was Pounds 5.78bn, against an official forecast of Pounds 6.5bn. Sterling traded above DM2.87 for most of the day, finishing at DM2.8725 in London, from DM2.8650 on Friday.</p>

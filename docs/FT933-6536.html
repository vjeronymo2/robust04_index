			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Jericho plan could break Mideast deadlock A PALESTINIAN proposal for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho could help break the deadlock in Middle East peace talks, a senior PLO official said yesterday. Mr Nabil Shaath, PLO peace talks co-ordinator, said the idea - dubbed the 'Gaza-Jericho First' - could bypass arguments about who should control Israeli-occupied Arab East Jerusalem which have brought the negotiations to a standstill. The proposal is emerging as one of the most controversial gambits made by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, and is likely to drive the next round of Arab-Israeli negotiations which resume in Washington next week. It envisages an immediate Palestinian assumption of full authority and independence in Gaza-Jericho, leaving the rest of the West Bank under interim self-rule. The idea has excited many Israelis and Palestinians who believe it could help make progress in the stalled peace process after 22 months of fruitless negotiations. But the proposal has also spurred a revolt within the Palestinian leadership over what, if any, concessions must be made to Israel to reach a peace agreement. Palestinians who support the plan say it would produce some permanent independent entity immediately, guarantee the PLO a governing role and attract desperately-needed foreign financial aid. Israel has indicated its willingness to discuss withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the violent and economically-decimated home to 800,000 impoverished Palestinians. But Jerusalem has so far remained silent on Mr Arafat's demand for the inclusion of an enclave around Jericho in the plan. Israel, which would like to be rid of Gaza, has also made reservations about a full transfer of power and the establishment of what would be effectively a Palestinian mini-state. It is clear that in return for accepting the idea, even in a modified form, Israel would expect big concessions from Palestinian negotiators on their demand for territorial sovereignty during an interim period of self-rule over Arab East Jerusalem and the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.</p>

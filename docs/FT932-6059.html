			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Iceland urged to cut quota for cod The Icelandic government has been urged to make a drastic cut in the country's cod quota in 1993-94, although this could deepen a severe recession, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The state-run marine research institute says next season's cod catch should be limited to 150,000 tons because of declining stocks. In the current season, which ends on June 30, about 230,000 tons of cod are expected to be caught, compared with a quota of 205,000 tons. If implemented, the cut could reduce Iceland's gross domestic product by 3 per cent next year, because cod accounts for 30 per cent of the country's exports.</p>

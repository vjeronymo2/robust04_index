			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 12:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners claim that Toyota failed to report U.S. product demonstration expenses, which were categorized by the Department as direct selling expenses in the first review. Petitioners argue that Toyota should therefore be required to provide its U.S. demonstration expenses for the final results. Petitioners assert that absent a proper submission from Toyota, the Department should assume as BIA that the per unit product demonstration expenses in the United States are equal to the per unit demonstration expenses reported by Toyota for its HM sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Citing 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2) and Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Administrative Review (AFBs I), 56 FR 31692, 31725 (July 11, 1991), Toyota maintains that it correctly categorized product demonstration expenses incurred in the United States as ISE. Toyota claims that demonstration expenses incurred in the United States were incurred in demonstrating forklifts to Toyota's national account customers. In contrast, Toyota states that demonstration expenses incurred in the HM, which were reported as direct selling expenses, were incurred in demonstrating forklifts to dealers so that they could demonstrate new models to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> their <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with petitioners that Toyota failed to report U.S. product demonstration expenses. By letter of March 30, 1992, we requested that Toyota separately report total demonstration expenses and allocate the same per forklift truck. In its response dated April 6, 1992, Toyota claimed that it reallocated such expenses using the ratio of forklifts under investigation to all units as reported in Exhibit C.4.i.1, page 2 of its December 5, 1990 response. However, after reviewing the calculation, we determined that Toyota did not actually use this ratio. Thus, we corrected Toyota's allocation for the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with petitioners that demonstration expenses incurred in the United States should be categorized as direct selling expenses because in both the HM and the United States, Toyota incurs demonstration expenses in order to make sales to end-users. Toyota's citation to AFBs I is irrelevant because AFBs I does not offer a clear statement of policy with regard to demonstration expenses. Absent evidence that demonstrations serve different purposes in different markets, we determine that Toyota's U.S. demonstration expenses should be treated as direct selling expenses. See Forklifts I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 13:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners contend that Toyota did not include certain U.S. customs fees (merchandise processing fee and harbor maintenance fee) in its reported movement charges. Petitioners state that the merchandise processing fee was 0.17 percent of entered value and the harbor maintenance fee was 0.04 percent of entered value during the period of review. For the final results, petitioners request that the Department increase Toyota's reported movement charges by these amounts for all of Toyota's U.S. sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota argues that it appropriately reported such fees under brokerage and handling expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Toyota. These expenses are included in respondent's reported brokerage and handling expenses. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 14:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners claim that the Department should resort to BIA in determining the amount of certain U.S. inland freight costs incurred on sales made after May 1, 1990 that Toyota failed to report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota agrees with petitioners that it failed to report certain inland freight costs incurred on sales made during May of 1990 and that the Department should account for such costs in its final analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All parties concur that Toyota failed to report certain U.S. inland freight costs for May 1990. For the final results we therefore used Toyota's highest reported inland freight as BIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 15:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners claim that Toyota understated its U.S. value-added labor and overhead costs. Petitioners' reason for this assertion is based on proprietary information. Petitioners request that the Department use the data in Attachment 4 of petitioners' case brief to correct these costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Toyota agrees that the labor cost portion of the labor and overhead variable has been miscalculated due to a computer programming error, but that the overhead portion is correct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree that the labor portion of the ``labor and overhead'' variable was improperly calculated, and have made the necessary corrections, as described by Toyota, for the final results. We agree with Toyota that overhead was both properly calculated and properly included in the calculation of the labor and overhead variable. For a complete discussion of this issue, please refer to the analysis memorandum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 16:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners state that Toyota reported negative amounts for net selling price proxy 3 (which Toyota states represents switching operations performed in TIE processing centers and includes other U.S. expenses and profit) on many of its ESP sales. Petitioners note that these negative amounts always occur when Toyota reports a negative value for the variable manufacturing cost of options switched by TIE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Short selling City regulators are working themselves into a tizzy over alleged market manipulation through short selling in the run-up to secondary share issues. The Securities and Investments Board has already sounded off on the subject. Now the Stock Exchange has published a consultative document outlining ways in which regulations covering short selling could be tightened. The aim would be to prevent investors artificially depressing a stock's price and then covering their positions by buying shares in an offering. The regulators are putting the cart before the horse. Before suggesting more regulations, they first need to establish whether any abuse is taking place. Certainly, there are cases of share prices falling in the run-up to issues such as the second tranche of BT and Wellcome. But this may merely be a natural adjustment to the fact that the market is having to absorb more stock. Regulators should also remember that issuers are adept at finding ways of supporting share prices during an offer period. Not only does a vast array of advisers mean discordant voices are often hard to find; issuers are able to refuse stock to investors who sell shares in the offer period. Some of the rules suggested could have the effect of so tilting the playing field that share prices were artificially inflated. A wise regulator would tread warily before taking sides. The best reason for intervening would be to ensure greater transparency in share dealing. Beyond that, regulation is likely to become so heavy-handed that it stifles financial innovation.</p>

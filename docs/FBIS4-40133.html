			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin,  before departure for Blagoveshchensk by air, told journalists on  Tuesday that an understanding to "link the convocation of an  international conference and the application of possible  stage-by-stage sanctions against North Korea" had been reached  during his long conversation with President Clinton on Monday  night.    Apart from discussing the North Korean nuclear issue, the  two  presidents also examined some aspects of Boris Yeltsin's likely  official visit to America in autumn. "Judging by the prospective  time-frame, the trip will turn out well. Besides, it is planned  that I will deliver a programmatic address at the U.N. General  Assembly", Yeltsin remarked.    In this connection, Yeltsin said that Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher are to meet in Brussels on June 15-16 to specify  details of the forthcoming visit.    As far as the tour of Blagoveshchensk and the Republic of  Tuva is concerned, Yeltsin voiced hope that foreign investments  would be drawn to those areas, primarily from China, Japan,  North and South Korea. "This may help those regions in earnest,"  he emphasised.</p>

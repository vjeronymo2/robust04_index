			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Department of Housing and Urban Development will reopen a probe into an  alleged scheme to rig the awarding of federally subsidized housing in Island  Park, N.Y., HUD Secretary Jack Kemp announced. At the center of the controversy  is HUD Region II administrator Geraldine McGann, whose son, Daniel McGann, was  among those chosen to purchase a $44,500 house in the program. A cousin of  Republican Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, a longtime resident of Island Park, also  benefited from the program by buying a home for $40,000, according to a HUD  audit. The new investigation was triggered by a report in the New York Times  that officials in Island Park had distributed federally subsidized homes to  politically connected people and excluded blacks between 1980 and 1984.  </P></p>

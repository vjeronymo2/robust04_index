			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Papua New Guinea coffee industry facing crisis Papua New Guinea's coffee industry is facing a crisis of confidence, with overseas buyers threatening to withdraw because of quality problems, according to Mr Ricky Mitio, chief executive of the Coffee Industry Corporation, reports Reuter from Port Moresby. Mitio told reporters that German, British, US, Australian and New Zealand buyers were increasingly reluctant to place orders. Germany's Jacobs Suchard, which normally buys about a quarter of the country's export volume, withdrew last year because of a drop in the quality of premium 'Y' grade coffee, said Mr David Smith, the corporation's economist. 'Quality has been gradually deteriorating over three to four years,' Mr Smith said. 'It really reached a low last year. It basically stemmed from a lot of new, inexperienced exporters.' Mr Smith said a prolonged slump in coffee prices had resulted in many small growers neglecting crops, while government officials said some growers now preferred the more profitable, but illegal, marijuana, which grows wild in Papua New Guinea.</p>

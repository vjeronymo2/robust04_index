Statistics show that the number of returnees received by  the municipality increased by 19 percent in 1993 when compared  with 1992. Students studying abroad at their expense registered  a drop of 40 percent in 1993 over the year before.    Young people in Shanghai have been level-headed in handling  the matter of going abroad in recent years, according to a  service centre for returnees from studying abroad. The number  of people going overseas for further study or for professional  study was not in decline but those who went abroad to work and  to learn a foreign language registered a sharp drop in numbers.  People who went overseas to use their talents and students who  finished their professional studies abroad have returned home  with their eyes on Shanghai and its development and the Pudong  New Zone.    Following the implementation last year of a preferential  policy on student returnees from overseas, Shanghai has received  a growing number of them. A total of 95 people returning from  studying abroad have to date been given preferential treatment  by the service centre there to open enterprises. During the  short period of six months, nearly 40 returnees were given a  license to begin operating a business and already a number of  high technology companies have made a contribution to the  building up of the municipality.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Sun Alliance issue raises Pounds 150m SUN ALLIANCE, the UK composite insurance company, yesterday made its debut in the international bond market, raising Pounds 150m funding with an issue lead managed by Warburg Securities, writes Simon London. The five-year bonds carry a 10 5/8 per cent coupon and were priced to yield 100 basis points more than comparable UK government securities - seen as generous by participants. UK investment managers certainly saw the deal as fair value and bought the deal with enthusiasm. The bonds traded up from a fixed re-offer price of 99.70 to stand at par bid by the close. At this level the yield spread was 95 basis points over gilts. The issue was made through Sun Alliance's holding company, which is quoted on the London Stock Exchange. The proceeds can be either injected as equity into the insurance subsidiaries or passed on as inter-company debt. In common with many other UK insurers, Sun Alliance has faced heavy losses from mortgage indemnity insurance. Analysts are expecting a pre-tax loss of close to Pounds 450m when full-year results for 1991 are announced in early April. Sun Alliance's solvency ratio, the ratio of capital to premium income used by analysts and regulators as a measure of financial strength, is likely to have fallen to around 67 per cent from 81 per cent in 1990. This is comfortably above the level required by UK law and better than the other four quoted composite insurers. However, Mr Peter Fiddimore, group treasurer, said the group wanted to maintain the option of passing the proceeds down to operating subsidiaries in the form of equity. In the near-term, the proceeds of the issue will reduce reliance on the company's Pounds 400m commercial paper programmes. The bonds issued yesterday were rated A1/A by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies.</p>

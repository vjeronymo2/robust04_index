"Owners of fishing boats found violating the order will be  severely punished in accordance with the law," the COA's  fisheries department warned.    The stern warning, according to the council, is part of the  international effort to protect bluefin tuna, which is under  threat of extinction. The bluefin tuna spawn in the  Mediterranean Sea, the most [words indistinct] spawning ground  in Europe, from June through July.</p>

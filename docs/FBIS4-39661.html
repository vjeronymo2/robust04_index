			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman O. Moroz at </F> the Supreme Council Session on 31 May 1994]    [Text] Esteemed deputies. We have completed an extremely  difficult and unspectacular portion of deputy functions -- the  forming of the Supreme Council's working bodies. They have for  the most part been formed and their heads elected.    Despite all the hardships that we endured in the recent days  we have managed to take a step toward a totally different  democratic structuring of the Supreme Council that accounts for  the actual multiparty nature of society's political sphere. We  have laid the foundation for the Supreme Council's steadiness,  which gives hope that deputies will have no time for political  feuds. On the one hand, the makeup of the commissions does not  allow for deviating toward conflicts. On the other hand, the  burden of responsibility for the performance of official duties  and the observance of commitments for the electorate will demand  accord and compromises at all the stages of the lawmaking  process.    Of course there is hardly a deputy in the session hall who  would like the entire presidium. This is good, for it is a  confirmation of the high potential of the session hall, a  reserve of this potential. This does not close the road toward  the improvement of the council's working bodies.    In recent days, after we made a mistake at the beginning, we  realized the importance of the procedure. Had we spent three  days discussing the regulations, this would have saved us two  weeks.    I believe that now hardly anyone has doubts regarding the  necessity to discuss regulations so that once a quality draft is  prepared by the commissions, we pass it approximately within a  month, and never resume the tactics of political battles in  which there can be no winner.    On what should we concentrate our efforts in the near  future?  I repeat, do not consider this lingering. A wise start is a  guarantee of a successful finish.    First, we have to complete the manning of commissions soon,  as stipulated by the temporary regulations that we passed and  the statute of groups and factions. We must select specialists  among commission members for the division of functions within  the commissions and the forming of their bodies. No one should  be afraid of a situation where a commission comprises only one  specialist, for you have the right to engage specialists who are  not deputies. The main issue is to make good use of their  knowledge, patriotic feelings, and healthy ambitions. I think  that the Supreme Council leadership will provide the best  material and technical conditions.    Second, all the commissions should meticulously plan their  work and envision in their plans urgent, long-range, and  perspective goals. This should be done approximately in a week  -- drafts approved in the commissions, and, by means of the  secretariat, passed over to one of the legal commissions for  generalizing and forming a kind of genealogy of the legislative  process, approval by the presidium, the coordinating council,  and the session.    I believe it appropriate to entrust one of the deputy  chairmen with organizing this work and exercising control over  it.    Third, urgent tasks should be regarded as supplements to the  already determined issues and placed on each deputy's desk by  next Tuesday's session.    A large group of urgent issues is comprised of laws that  regulate economic relations. It would take much time to simply  enumerate these. We should unblock production and create normal  conditions for the functioning of enterprises through taxes,  credits, investments, and currency regulations. We must protect  the people from further growth of prices, the threat of mass  unemployment, the decline in wages, unavailability of goods and  transport, impossibility of providing for their own and their  children's summer vacations.    Complex problems arise with regard to preparation for  harvesting and quite soon for the winter as well.    However if we turn into a "fire brigade" again, then,  despite  all attempts to professionally resolve emerging problems, our  efficiency will be minimal, because we will face unresolved  strategic problems every time. I will take the liberty of  reminding you that in accordance with Clause 6 of Article 97 of  the Ukrainian Constitution, it lies within our jurisdiction, the  jurisdiction of the Ukrainian Supreme Council to determine the  principles of state regulation and social development in Ukraine.    This is currently our primary and most important task. Only  under the condition of this issue's positive resolution can we  hope to stimulate the deputies' productive work, clear the  existing legislative field, and create a solid footing for  stabilizing Ukraine's economy and launching actual reform. Only  a complex of well-planned, purposeful, interrelated measures  will facilitate a civilized resolution of the most acute  problems in our lives -- resume the work of our enterprises,  simultaneously stimulating their structural and technological  reshaping; put tax and credit policies in order and free  entrepreneurs, mediators, and banks from the criminal  environment; improve our currency regulations and encourage an  increase in the state's export potential; put in order imports;  support the creation of a reliable monetary-financial system,  without which there can be no market reform of which to speak.    Then we will be able to meet all other demands of our  electors -- index all their savings (we will have to pass an  appropriate law prior to this); provide for people's large-scale  participation in privatization; fix low prices for textbooks  designated for schools and higher educational institutions, as  well as for children's nutrition at kindergartens, summer camps,  sanatoria, and schools; and finally, reimburse expenditures on  burying the dead. These and a number of other burning social  measures must be taken this year. We should expeditiously  prepare a legal footing for this.    We are going to take these steps not for the sake of  populism, not to put a new patch on an old one. We are going to  target our reform toward a social orientation, make it  inevitable, all-encompassing and able to serve the interests of  the people of Ukraine.    This goal was set for the people drafting "The Basic  Principles of the State Regulation of Ukraine's Economic and  Social Development." Several groups of scientists, economists,  and managers have intensively worked on this document over the  last couple of months. The work is to be completed this week  and it would be good if the document could be passed to the  Supreme Council next week. Other options should also be  discussed. I know how the groups of deputies, represented in  this hall, worked; I am more or less familiar with their work,  and believe that it is very interesting and useful. We should  also hear a report on the results of their work. These results  may help coordinate various aspects of understanding certain  issues. They may also be regarded as alternative plans. We  should submit to indepth analysis the long- range plans  regarding the activities of the Cabinet of Ministers. Those  plans exist and they are quite interesting. I had a talk with  the acting prime minister yesterday; he is ready to submit those  proposals (drafted earlier) for discussion by the Supreme  Council.    It will be logical to form the new government and elect the  new prime minister following adoption of this document. However  this is not connected with presidential elections and thus,  there is neither the need nor the time for a delay. After we  have realized and adopted strategic directions that correspond  to the Ukrainian people's system of values (given that the  people have empowered us to protect their interests), we will  choose a prime minister to implement this course, and approve  his candidacy here at the session.    Through the prism of this strategy we will assess the  government's program and our numerous laws -- both the existing  ones and those that will be drafted. Such conscious constructive  work by the Supreme Council will indubitably produce positive  results and will be properly assessed by the people of Ukraine.    We, both participants and observers, should quietly respond  to all kinds of feuds within the Supreme Council. We should not  stray from the painstaking creative work; we will later sort  things out among ourselves. The Supreme Council must not be  discredited; incidentally, such discredit amounts to paying bad  service to President Kravchuk. Those who fail to understand  this are actually blocking vital reforms, encouraging the  continuation of the looting and selling of our state, the  impoverishment of a majority of people and the strengthening of  the existing parasitic groups.    I am convinced that a majority of deputies will support the  proposals regarding the organization of such work in  commissions, constituencies, and at plenary sessions.    From a perspective of strategic tasks we should consider a  number of national programs toward which foreign investors have  displayed interest. Supreme Council commissions should acquaint  themselves with these programs and determine their role in  speeding up the implementation of the latter.    Among the entire range of these issues I would single out  two  groups that warrant special attention.    One of them is the coordination of the acting laws to  facilitate their normal functioning. For instance, a series of  laws on enterprises and entrepreneurship have been distorted by  sublaws, norms, and departmental instructions. The same  concerns laws on land relationship, lease, privatization,  freedom of thought, and especially laws on local administration  and the forming of vertical structures in the administrative  branch. The budget issue also belongs here and cannot be  postponed any further. We are completing the second quarter of  1994 without an approved budget.    Fourth, we will not be able to avoid resolving urgent  current  tasks, which will partially ruin the legislative system. I mean  issues like the Crimea, preparations for the elections, and the  formation of the Cabinet of Ministers. Thus those are the  issues that will have to be discussed simultaneously.    Fifth, we should step up control activities of the Supreme  Council's working bodies, demanding that the provisions of laws  and resolutions be unconditionally observed.    I know that this stance is different from that of some  deputies. This has been said on television and discussed here in  the session hall. However no group of 10 deputies, even  comprising the best lawyers, will be able to provide control  over the efficiency of certain laws. This can be done solely by  all the deputies working in the commissions, and performing a  control function to the extent envisioned for the given  commission. For special cases we can set up deputies' groups on  a different basis. Everybody will then understand that one  should not only draft laws but also control their observance.    I repeat once again -- this is every commission's business,  however, general coordination and analysis of this work should  be supervised, I presume, by [Deputy Chairman] Oleksandr  Tkachenko. At the initial stage we should analyze how the  privatization program, passed by the Supreme Council, was being  implemented after its adoption and has been implemented in 1994.  This is the basic issue of reform and that is why the general  outcome of privatization, in particular the leasing of property,  would be interesting to both the Supreme Council, as the owner  of national wealth, and to every citizen. We should also  receive precise information regarding the use of money acquired  through privatization, the privatization of partially  constructed facilities (as compared to the general volume of  privatization), and determine the state's profits.    I believe that discussion of this issue in a month or so  would facilitate the specification of the program and the  mechanism for such change in ownership relations.    The Commission for Deputy Ethics, along with the  Administrative Office and the secretariat should help establish  the normal work of bodies and individual deputies in Kiev and in  the constituencies. Completion of the selection of advisers, the  scientific-methodological and material provision of the  lawmaking process -- everything should be organized for the  deputies to realize that their desire to be absorbed in work  meets with both understanding and a responsible attitude on the  part of all the services and officials, no matter where the  latter are employed. This, undoubtedly, primarily concerns the  appropriate services of the Supreme Council, and these will be  requested to treat deputies' work in an appropriate manner.    You should not consider this dilettantism. We must initiate  the collective work of all the Supreme Council structures,  wisely task all the deputies, so that everybody, including the  state, sees the results of our work.    Excuse your opponents' harsh words and claims. Good luck!</p>

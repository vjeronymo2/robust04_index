			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong's trade  with Germany totalled 80 billion H.K. dollars [Hong Kong  dollars] (10.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1993, an increase of 12  percent over the previous year, according to the Trade  Development Council (TDC) here today.    Germany increased its exports to the territory by 14 percent  last year over 1992 to reach 25 billion H.K. dollars (3.2  billion U.S. dollars), of which more than half were subsequently  re-exported to the Chinese mainland and other regional markets.    Clothing makes up over two thirds of Hong Kong's domestic  exports to Germany. Among other major exports were watches,  office machinery, photographic equipment and jewelry.    The TDC released the figures following a recent two-day Hong  Kong-Chinese mainland business trip by a 24-member delegation  from the Nuremberg Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Germany.    "The Far East and China are the markets of the future. We  are encouraging our members to seek joint ventures in China  either directly, or through Hong Kong," said the chamber's  President Gusti Drechsler was quoted as saying at the end of the  trip.    "Labor costs are high in Germany. Our company is considering  manufacturing its products in China for sale in the Pacific Rim  markets. Hong Kong could be conduit for this activity," a  delegation member William Sell said.</p>

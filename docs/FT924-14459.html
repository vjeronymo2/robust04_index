			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Politics sets pace for Brazilian equities - Bill Hinchberger charts the effects of 'Collorgate' on the Bovespa and foreign investors Politics continues to set the pace for Brazilian equities, a week after President Fernando Collor de Mello was removed from office to face impeachment proceedings in the Senate. The euphoria surrounding the Chamber of Deputies vote to initiate the impeachment process has left a post-Collor 'hangover', says Mr Alvaro Augusto Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa). Furthermore, the optimism stemming from the ousting of Mr Collor, with hopes of a new administration backed by a broad coalition in Congress and top-name ministers, has waned. The Bovespa index tumbled when Mr Itamar Franco, the vice president who has assumed the presidency, named Mr Gustavo Krause as finance minister, falling by 11 per cent during the first four trading days of October. On Wednesday, it closed down 3.3 per cent, at 38,291. Turnover was slow, at just Dollars 53m. Resistance in the Sao Paulo business community to Mr Krause and his henchman, Planning Minister Paulo Haddad, appears to be subsiding. Mr Delfim Netto, an influential federal legislator from Sao Paulo, chided 'paulistas' for their regional prejudices against Mr Krause, who comes from the north-eastern state of Pernambuco, and Mr Haddad, from Mr Franco's native Minas Gerais region. The stock market is now waiting for Mr Franco to elaborate his strategy to attack stagflation, and for details of his views on economic reforms such as privatisation and trade liberalisation. The market has been influenced by politics since May, when Mr Collor's brother publicly accused him of corruption. A subsequent parliamentary inquiry and the impeachment debate helped to break a bullish streak dating back to mid-1991, when foreign institutions were allowed to operate directly in the market. The upsurge made Brazil seem one of the best bets among the world's emerging markets. When the political crisis erupted, the market initially reacted as if the corruption charges would not stick. But around July, as press reports and the parliamentary inquiry began to uncover evidence of direct presidential involvement, the mood changed. Soon the market was rising on signs of a speedy presidential demise, and falling when he seemed to gain strength. This trend was most acute in late September, prior to the authorisation of impeachment proceedings and Mr Collor's suspension. Anticipating approval, the Bovespa index closed up 7.7 per cent on the day of the evening roll call. With the pre-impeachment surge, the Bovespa index rose by 9.8 per cent, after adjusting for inflation, in September. The political element should recede, say many observers, bringing the economy back to centre stage. 'I think that we are leaving behind the political climate and getting back to reality,' says Mr Vidigal. But Mr Roberto Teixeira da Costa, director-president of Brasilpar Financial Services, believes that the market may continue to reflect the mood of the government. However, he adds, 'I don't see any big surprises in the Itamar administration.' During 'Collorgate', foreign investment maintained a net inflow until August, albeit at a much slower pace. A net Dollars 1.5bn entered Brazilian bourses from January to the end of September. But two-thirds of this, Dollars 991m, was registered by April, before the political crisis. This compared with Dollars 571m for the whole of 1991. In August, foreigners siphoned off Dollars 80m more than they sent in. But in September, they invested a net Dollars 37m, fanning hopes that the foreign investment ebb may be about to reverse. Figures for early October are not yet available, but the local subsidiary of Chase Manhattan says that clients of its omnibus account invested a net Dollars 13m during the first three days of this week, compared with Dollars 19.2m in the whole of August, and Dollars 24.5m in September. Foreigners continue to express interest in Brazil by registering with the Securities Commission (CVM), as required by law. Through the end of August, the CVM had 501 institutions on its books; preliminary figures show that a further 22 won approval in September. Trading remains concentrated in a handful of blue chip stocks, especially Telebras, the state-controlled telecommunications company which accounts for 40 per cent of the Bovespa index. On Wednesday, Telebras accounted for 75 per cent of volume. Mr Franco's statements about 'perfecting' the privatisation programme and references to unnamed 'strategic' companies have raised doubts about his intentions towards Telebras. But analysts believe the company's stock is attractive and say that few investors have expressed concern about the company's privatisation fortunes under Mr Franco.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLIGHT A DELIGHT  </P> <P> Remember when it was pleasant to fly -- even tourist class? Well, there's still  one airline in North and South America that makes you feel special. It's Lan  Chile. It has a sensible seat arrangement. On the long flight from Miami to  Santiago, Chile, it was two-three-two. There was a full and well-trained crew  who started by handing out free newspapers. We were served free cocktails, then  a good hot meal with a choice of wine. After the meal, free liqueurs were  offered. Even on 1 1/2-hour local flights a hot meal was served. During the  flights the restrooms were frequently checked and we found them always neat and  clean. There were free movies. Small souvenir gifts were distributed as a  memento. So if you want a wonderful flight, we suggest you try Lan Chile. We  enjoyed it.  </P> <P> ISABEL C. McFARLAND  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

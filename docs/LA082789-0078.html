			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. AMATEUR GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> NEWCOMERS GREEN, PATTON PLAY TODAY IN 36-HOLE TITLE MATCH  </P> <P> Danny Green and Chris Patton, both newcomers on the national amateur scene,  each won twice Saturday, and will meet in the final of the 89th annual U.S.  Amateur Golf Championship.  </P> <P> Green, 32, of Jackson, Tenn., eliminated two-time champion Jay Sigel, 1-up, on  the 19th hole in a morning quarterfinal. He returned to Merion Golf Club's  6,523-yard, par-70 course in the afternoon, beating Jerry Courville, 30, of  Norwalk, Conn., 2-up, to qualify for today's 36-hole final.  </P> <P> Patton, 21, a Clemson senior from Fountain Inn., S.C., whose best this year was  a fifth in the South Carolina State Amateur, defeated Michael Brannan, 33, a  golf equipment salesman from Trumbull, Conn., 3 and 2, in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> Earlier, Patton eliminated Kevin Wentworth, an Oklahoma State senior from  Manteca, Calif., 2 and 1.  </P> <P> Green, who attended the University of Tennessee at Martin, blew a 2-up lead  with two holes to play against Sigel. But Sigel struggled on 19, and wound up  conceding a birdie putt and the match.  </P> <P> Green, trailing Sigel by a hole at the turn in the morning round, evened the  match with a birdie at the 10th. He edged ahead at 12 with a birdie, and  boosted his lead to 2-up with another at 15.  </P> <P> They halved the 16th, leaving Sigel two down with two holes to play.  </P> <P> Sigel, in his 23rd Amateur including titles in 1982 and '83, hung in with an  18-foot birdie putt at 17.  </P> <P> Sigel, 45, won 18 and deadlocked the match as Green three-putted.  </P> <P> The two moved to a first extra hole with some 3,000 fans, mostly rooting for  Sigel from nearby Berwyn, Pa., lining the fairway.  </P> <P> Sigel's tee shot landed in a divot. He hit into a trap, blasted out 15 feet  past the pin and missed the putt coming back. He conceded a six-foot birdie  putt to Green, who was on in two.  </P></p>

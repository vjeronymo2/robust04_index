			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FANFARE FOR A CONDUCTOR  </P> <P> The Pacific Symphony has selected a new music director, which is good news.  Carl St. Clair, an assistant conductor of the Boston Symphony, brings an  impressive resume to Orange County.  </P> <P> More important, his appointment should signal a period of stability for the  orchestra.  </P> <P> That's significant because of the change and uncertainty it has been through in  the last couple of years. There was the resignation of founder Keith Clark as  an administrator, after a period of tension with the board. Then there was the  search for a new conductor, which has taken a while. The orchestra can benefit  from new beginnings, and from having a young, bright conductor at the helm.  </P> <P> St. Clair has said he will continue as music director of either the Ann Arbor  Symphony in Michigan or the Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. He plans  to spend about three months in Orange County next year, eight weeks for  concerts and other time devoted to administrative matters.  </P> <P> Three months may not seem like much time for the tasks at hand: planning and  conducting six pairs of classical concerts at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center, two concerts at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre and overseeing school  and community programs. However, it's a fact of life these days that good  conductors split their time between various commitments and that to sign on  somebody good, a community has to be willing to share conductors.  </P> <P> The acquisition of a talented music director is an exciting prospect for an  orchestra that has received increased visibility with its move to the  Performing Arts Center. We welcome St. Clair to Orange County and look forward  to hearing the orchestra under his direction.  </P></p>

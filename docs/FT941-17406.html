			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Lithuania applies to join ranks of Nato Lithuania yesterday became the first former Soviet republic to apply to join Nato, accentuating the alliance's sensitive dilemma over whether and when to accept new members. President Algirdas Brazauskas said in a televised address that he had written to the Nato secretary-general, Mr Manfred Worner, formally presenting Lithuania's membership application. Mr Brazauskas's statement comes at an embarrassing time for Nato, just ahead of the organisation's summit in Brussels next week. Allied leaders are looking for a way to provide former Warsaw Pact countries which have already applied for membership - such as Poland and the Czech Republic - with a clear prospect of one day joining Nato without antagonising Russia, or providing fuel to extreme nationalist opponents of President Boris Yeltsin. Estonia and Latvia are also regarded as potential long-term candidates for Nato membership. Although Russian troops were withdrawn from Lithuania last September, they remain in the two other Baltic states.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / International Company News: ABN pays more, plans rights ABN Amro, the Netherlands' largest bank, yesterday reported strong first-half profits and announced plans for a rights issue of convertible preference shares to raise almost Fl 1.3bn (Dollars 665m). The bank said issue would go ahead next month with the preference shares priced close to the level of its ordinary shares which closed yesterday at Fl 67.20. Holders of ordinary shares will be given pre-emptive rights to the new shares. The bank's net profits rose to Fl 1.01bn for the first half of 1993, compared with Fl 872m a year ago, and the interim dividend is going up to Fl 1.45 a share from Fl 1.40 last year. The bank said it expected to see increases in both gross and net profit for the full year. ABN Amro's first-half results partly reflected buoyant conditions on European stock markets and hectic conditions on foreign exchange markets. Income from foreign exchange trading jumped by 133 per cent to Fl 294m, while securities trading income rose by 26 per cent to Fl 314m. Total income stood at Fl 6.78bn, a 9.8 per cent rise on the first half of 1992. Expenditure rose by 7.8 per cent to Fl 4.5bn. ABN Amro, created out of a merger in 1990, said it had suffered a slight setback in planned savings on staff costs but added that the process of integrating the two banks was proceeding according to schedule. The bank expects to realise savings of Fl 500m a year from 1995 onwards because of the link-up. The bank's European results showed the strongest rise, with gross results nearly doubling to Fl 360m from Fl 188m a year earlier. The Netherlands, still the bank's single most important market, produced a 10.7 per cent increase in gross profit to Fl 1.37bn. North American results fell by 10.4 per cent to Fl 370m, but the bank said this region would have posted a substantial improvement if it had not been for a provision for debt securities.</p>

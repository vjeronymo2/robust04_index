			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged William Sinclair moves ahead 9% to Pounds 4.2m A 'sound performance' across the group, with increases in sales, profits and margins, was yesterday reported by William Sinclair Holdings. Pre-tax profits of the Lincoln-based group, which supplies products to the garden, leisure and pet markets, showed a 9.3 per cent advance from Pounds 3.82m to Pounds 4.17m in the year to June 30. Turnover was up 7.4 per cent from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 41.3m. The figures included a contribution from the peat business acquired for Pounds 2.76m from Zeneca in late January. This business had been successfully integrated into the horticultural division, said Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman, and would make the company self-sufficient in peat. Because of the seasonal nature of the group's activities, and their susceptibility to adverse weather conditions, it was impossible to indicate any significant trends at this stage, he said. The spring season - the most important sales period for the group - got off to a very poor start. 'Most people have probably by now forgotten that April this year had been one of the wettest on record for some 60 years,' Mr Sinclair said, and this had resulted in additional costs. However, sales volumes subsequently recovered and, helped by the increased acreage made available by the Zeneca purchase, the peat harvest turned out to be satisfactory. The bulk of the group's income is still derived from the horticultural division which, bolstered by a Pounds 164,000 contribution from the Zeneca business, made an operating profit of Pounds 2.82m (Pounds 2.46m) from turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 28.6m). The pet, aquatic and household division achieved operating profits of Pounds 1.34m (Pounds 1.21m) on sales of Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 9.89m). Companies within this division operated in a fragmented market, Mr Sinclair said, and the group had embarked on a programme to merge them. Sinclair ended the year with a strong balance sheet, with no borrowings and net cash of Pounds 4.75m. Earnings came out at 13p (12.2p) per share and a proposed final dividend of 5.45p makes a total for the year of 7.15p (7p).</p>

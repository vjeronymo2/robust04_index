			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESERVING YOSEMITE  </P> <P> How ironic! We live in a time of the business philosophy "bottom-line  mentality."  </P> <P> Give only if there is a large profit. MCA has too long applied this principle  to our national wonder, Yosemite. Hey, that's a public park. Get the rascals  out. Create a nonprofit organization and apply the profits to saving and  preserving the park.  </P> <P> Always amazing how the private sector exploits the public one. Another example  of using and abusing without a care. I am also referring to the public bailout  of the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan mess. Where are those enlightened folks who  realize there is more to this life than money, profits and greediness?  </P> <P> BYRON KANODE  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

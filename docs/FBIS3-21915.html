			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] A delegation of Colombian drug eradication  professionals is expected here shortly to initiate a work  programme under the Guyana/Colombia anti-drug campaign.    This was disclosed yesterday by Colombian Foreign Minister  Noemi Sanin de Rubio after she signed the Guyana/Colombia  anti-drug joint agreement at the Foreign Ministry here.    The agreement, proposed during her November 1993 visit to  Guyana, provides for cooperation, assistance and exchange of  information between the law enforcement agencies and judicial  systems of the two countries.    It also provides for the establishment of a Mixed Commission  which will be responsible for the elaboration of programmes and  plans to deal with the drug menace. Mixed Commission meetings  are to be held alternately in the two countries annually.    January 15 was the deadline fixed by the two countries for  the signing of the joint agreement.    Noting that drug use and trafficking are two of humanity's  greatest problems, the visiting Foreign Minister said it is on  this basis that the two states have agreed to combat the scourge.    She added that Colombia expects President Cheddi Jagan and  Foreign Minister Mr Clement Rohee to visit soon and hopes a "lot  can be achieved" from that encounter in the area of drug  eradication.    And Foreign Minister Rohee said the signing of the agreement  signals another milestone in the relations between the two  countries.    "It heralds a new thrust in the fight against drugs and  commitment to this international scourge," he said.    He has also pledged this country's support to collaborating  "in all forms" to end the illicit trade and use of drugs.    Guyana has entered into similar agreements with Venezuela,  Cuba and Brazil.    Minister Sanin de Rubio, who flew in yesterday morning to  sign the agreement, also called on President Jagan and held  talks with officials at the CARICOM Secretariat before leaving  for Suriname in the afternoon.</p>

You are now welcome to raise your questions.    [China Central Television Station correspondent] I am from  China Central Television Station. Chairman Raidi has just  briefed us on Tibet's economic development. My question is:  Other than relying on the assistance of the central government  and fraternal provinces and municipalities, how will Tibet duly  speed up its development to narrow the gap with coastal areas at  the earliest possible date? Thank you.    [Gyaincain Norbu] Regarding the question of how to speed up  Tibet's economic development in order to narrow the gap with  fraternal provinces and municipalities, I think the entire party  and country should consider the overall interests -- seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, accelerating  development, and maintaining stability. Tibet should also serve  these overall interests in carrying out its future tasks.  Guided by the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and by the party's basic line, we should  continue to thoroughly implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, and focus on the goal of fostering a  socialist market economy so as to expedite reform and  development and to maintain stability. To accelerate reform, we  recently introduced measures to separate profits and taxes  delivered by state-owned enterprises in farming and pastoral  areas, as well as measures to reform the social insurance,  investment, and public housing systems. These measures have  injected great vitality into development.    On the question of development, I think we should mainly  carry out the following three tasks: 1) We should maintain the  status of agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation of  the national economy and strive for more bumper harvests in  agriculture and animal husbandry this year. 2) We should  nurture new factors for economic growth. We should concentrate  on developing processing industries, foreign trade, tertiary  industries, and village and town enterprises. 3) We should  continue to develop the energy, transportation, and  communications sectors; education; science and technology; and  key infrastructure projects. We have set our future economic  growth rate at 8 percent. To attain this goal, we should deepen  reform and accelerate the pace of development. To this end, we  should consolidate and build upon political stability and unity  and create a good social environment for reform, opening up, and  economic development.    Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the founding of  the Tibet Autonomous Region. More than 2.3 million people of  all nationalities across the region should redouble their  efforts to realize the goal of accelerating Tibet's development  and usher in the occasion with practical actions.    [Sprinkle, in English fading into Mandarin translation]  James Sprinkle of THE TIMES of London. It is widely known  that... [sentence incomplete as heard] This person is the Dalai  Lama of Tibet. However, in the introduction Chairman Raidi gave  just now, he did not mention this Tibetan, the Dalai Lama. I  would like to ask what is the status of the Dalai Lama now? How  is he regarded by the Tibetan? How are the talks going?    [Raidi] Certainly, every Tibetan knows about the Dalai Lama.  He has been living in exile since 1959 when he took part in a  rebellion and fled, and he has since been engaged in activities  aimed at separatism and sabotage of national unity. The central  government's policy toward the Dalai Lama has been very clear  all along: He must abandon his stance on the independence of  Tibet and he is welcome to return home to contribute to the  country's construction.    [China Radio International correspondent] I am a  correspondent of China Radio International. I would like to ask  Chairman Raidi about inter-ethnic relations -- relations between  Tibetan and Han peoples, in particular -- in Tibet.    [Raidi] Inter-ethnic relations in Tibet refer mainly to the  relations between Tibetan and Han people. Tibetan and Han  people have lived in peace and harmony and enjoyed equality  since the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951.    Over the past four decades or more since the peaceful  liberation of Tibet, the Tibetan and Han people have forged  profound friendship in their joint efforts of building Tibet.  They have developed a new form of unbreakable socialist  inter-ethnic relations. Thus they share a common fate, and can  never be separated from each other.    In spite of the effects of the Cultural Revolution and the  all- out efforts in recent years by separatists to sow  dissension among the various nationalities and to sabotage  national unity -- the troubles they stirred have had some  effects on national unity in Tibet -- taken together, unity,  fraternity, mutual trust, and mutual assistance remain the main  features of Han-Tibetan relations today. In the long history of  revolution and construction in Tibet, events have repeatedly  show that Han-Tibetan unity serves as a precondition and  guarantee for the smooth progress and advancement of all  undertakings in Tibet. Any acts aimed at sabotaging national  unity are doomed to failure. In my view, this new type of  inter-ethnic relations will be developed and consolidated as the  policy of reform and opening up deepens in Tibet, the economy  continues to grow, and living standards improve.    Certainly, some people say the relations between Tibetan and  Han people are terrible, that Han people dare not come to Tibet,  or that Han people are being killed on sight. Nothing of the  sort! Let me cite an example. Transportation in Tibet depends  entirely -- 80 to 90 percent at least -- on motor  transportation. The Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet highways  are thousands of kilometers long. Sometimes cars on these  highways break down, leaving some Han drivers helpless. When  spotted by Tibetan people, the Han drivers have been invited to  Tibetan homes and have been served [word indistinct] tea and  zanba [roasted barley, a staple food of the Tibetans]. Do you  know what these Han comrades say? My goodness, the Tibetan  comrades are really nice. As for occasional quarreling and  bickering, I believe you can find such problems in any society.  Quarreling and bickering do exist. Taken as a whole, however,  the relations are good.    [(Huang Jikuan)] Taiwan CNA correspondent (Huang Jikuan).  I have a question for [Regional Party] Secretary Chen  [Kuiyuan]. Developing the economy is an important way of  solving the problems of minority nationalities in Tibet. In the  course of establishing a market economy, what obstacles does  Tibet need to remove, and what advantages can it bring into  play? Following the First Sessions of the Eighth NPC and the  Eighth CPPCC National Committee last year, you led a delegation  to visit various coastal provinces. Do you plan to do so this  year? Thank you!    [Chen Kuiyuan] Tibet is a remote region of China. Due to  historical reasons and its unique geographical location, the  region faces grave obstacles in developing the economy. First  and foremost, the region is located 4,000 meters above sea  level. A lack of oxygen high in the mountains makes it very  difficult for people to carry out productive activities and  economic exchanges. Meanwhile, as a result of the backward  nature of its economy in the past and a weak transport and  energy infrastructure, the region's industrial foundations and  capabilities are lagging far behind other fraternal provinces  and regions. Moreover, Tibet also lacks technology and  scientific and technological personnel. Hence, during the  socialist modernization drive, Tibet faces more obstacles than  other provinces and regions. A very important condition for  developing the economy is to open up markets. However, because  of Tibet's remote location, the region has special difficulties  in exploring both domestic and international markets.  Therefore, the region has to exert greater efforts than other  provinces and regions in establishing a socialist market  economy. Tibet's advantages in developing the economy should be  viewed within the context of macroeconomic environment, without  which Tibet has more difficulties and fewer advantages. Under  the macroeconomic environment, the state and fraternal provinces  and regions have given Tibet tremendous support. To help Tibet  develop itself, the state has adopted many preferential policies  for the region. Under the state and fraternal provinces' help  and through efforts by the people of Tibet, the quality of life  of the people has improved markedly. In this way, Tibet has  effectively combined the external environment with the internal  conditions to develop the regional economy. We have the  determination and confidence that Tibet's economy will develop  together with other provinces and regions. During last year's  NPC and CPPCC sessions, I befriended (Huang Jikuan), who kept an  eye on my whereabouts. This year, I will visit fraternal  provinces again to learn from their advanced experiences and to  further promote economic cooperation between Tibet and fraternal  provinces.    [Unidentified correspondent] I was told that freedom of  religious belief is not fully respected. What is the real  situation? Would you give specific details in your answer?    [Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain, in Tibetan fading into Mandarin  translation] Freedom of religious belief is fully respected in  Tibet. There are currently some 1,400 Buddhist temples,  monasteries, and lamaseries to satisfy the needs for normal  religious life by the masses, with the number of monks and nuns  over 30,000. Day-to-day religious activities are conducted in  an orderly manner at temples. In Tibet, the majority of the  people are Buddhists. Of course, there are nonbelievers too.  This shows that both religious believers and nonbelievers enjoy  ample freedom of religious belief.    [Wang Zheren] That is the end of today's news conference.  Thank you all!</p>

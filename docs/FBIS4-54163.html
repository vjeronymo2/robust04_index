			<p>CSO     [Text] A price collapse on steel is in progress. The  instigator is Tokyo Steel. The price is 55,000 yen per ton for  Tokyo Steel, whose entry in steel plate, which had been a  product monopolized by blast furnace manufacturers, began in  April. Not only is it cheaper than the price of blast furnace  manufacturers said to be 90,000 to 100,000 yen, but even South  Korean products, and President Masashige Iketani does not  hesitate to say, "Controlled pricing by blast furnace  manufacturers has maintained high prices."    The silent pressure of the blast furnace manufacturers to  shut out imports and maintain price order is normal in the  industry. Steel processors who are called shearing and coil  centers fear the opposition of blast furnace makers and have not  spoken openly about dealing in import steel. The major trading  companies also have not dealt openly in imports.    The market control power of those blast furnace makers now  has begun to waver. "If the foreign and domestic price  differential is not eliminated, the export industry will no  longer be able to keep going." That is because voices of revolt  from major consumers such as autos, shipbuilding, and home  appliances have seethed up. Moves to use cheap South Korean  steel, such as by Mitsubishi Motors, also are becoming a  reality. The blast furnace makers have been driven to lower  steel prices for autos and shipbuilding.    The "domestic-foreign price differential" is not just for  consumer goods. According to the report of a major trading  company with the title, "Comparison of Taiwanese, South Korean,  and Japanese Steel Costs," "calculated at $1 to 125 yen to 783  won to 25.75 yuan, the cost per ton is $587 for regular Japanese  steel, about 60 percent higher than $370 for Pohang Iron and  Steel Co. (POSCO), and 353 dollars for China Steel (CSC)." Cost  reduction to the level of international prices, specifically  "dropping to the price of POSCO" where the wages of steel  workers are said to be one-fourth that of Japan, now has become  the watchword of the blast furnace makers.    "In the case of petrochemical products, the Asian market has  become borderless" (Susumu Hashimoto, manager of Resin Division,  Mitsui Petrochemical Industries). There is a high tariff for  U.S. and European products, but the import offensive from South  Korea and Taiwan taking advantage of the preferential duty  framework is intense. Ten percent of the demand has been  replaced by import goods for polyethylene film for supermarket  plastic bags or trash bags.    "The price of Japanese polyethylene is 70 to 80 percent  higher than the United States or South Korea" (Daiwa Research  Institute). The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] forecasts that import goods will account for 20-30  percent of petrochemical products in the near future.    "The collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989 began the worldwide  deflation," points out Yoichi Ito, head of the Exchange  Operations Office of Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking. "The former  socialist countries, which have low costs, have been  incorporated into the market economy system, and their products  have begun to flood world markets all at once. Prices inevitably  will tend toward standardization" (Ito).    In addition to NIE's (newly industrializing economies) and  developing nations with the ability to supply, the former  socialist countries also have become supply nations. On the  other hand, no place in the world has enough demand to absorb  that.    The prices of international products, which are a reflection  of the world economy, are gradually improving after the great  bottoming at the beginning of 1993, but viewing real prices  which are adjusted by the inflation rate of advanced nations,  "Only crude oil and gold are at the same level as during the  1960's, and agricultural products, nonferrous steel, etc., are  from one-third to one-fourth" (Marubeni Research Department).  Even if prices do not go down, a mechanism where "they will not  increase" easily has been created worldwide.    In Japan, high yen acceleration has restricted the lowering  of prices. "In the Japanese economy, when a yen rate higher than  $1 equals 130 yen takes root, the domestic-foreign price  differential will come to have decisive significance" (Nomura  Research Institute). The procurement of materials from overseas  is rapidly spreading.    Sanyo Electric put together high yen emergency measures by  order of the president in the summer of 1993 and worked out a  policy of "procurement from abroad with the most advantageous  price." Change to import goods in steel for compressors, plastic  products, and printed circuit boards and other electronic parts  is beginning. The goal of the overseas purchase ratio, which had  been 8 percent in fiscal 1993, "will be over 10 percent this  fiscal year."    While Suminoe Textile, the largest maker of interior  materials for autos is demanding that synthetic fabric  manufacturers lower prices to international price levels, they  are studying whether they should import from South Korea or  Taiwan BCF nylon for car seats that will be used in new cars  this fall. It is a defensive measure because "the move from auto  manufacturers on materials suppliers to lower prices has  accelerated all at once since the beginning of this year"  (Director Kanichiro Kishigami). The wave of overseas materials  procurement is going back upstream.    A return to half of the drop from peak to bottom is called a  "half-price return." The forecast that, "even if the economy  fully recovers, there will be a half-price return of steel  prices at the most" (President Toshio Kokure, Kawasaki Steel)  may be too optimistic in view of the reality that international  prices will determine the upper limit.</p>

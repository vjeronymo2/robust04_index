			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Earnings halved at Reynolds Metals THE SLUGGISH world economy and weak aluminium prices cut Reynolds Metals' third-quarter earnings in half. Income fell to Dollars 20.8m, or 35 cents a share, from Dollars 41.5m, or 70 cents, in the same period last year. For the first nine months of the year, earnings were Dollars 67.2m, or Dollars 1.13 per share, down sharply from Dollars 130.4m, or Dollars 2.20, in 1991. Third-quarter sales rose to Dollars 1.48bn, from Dollars 1.44bn. Nine-month sales were Dollars 4.31bn, down from Dollars 4.34bn. 'Reynolds' results reflect the continuation of severely depressed aluminium prices due to the weaker than expected economic recovery and the worldwide oversupply situation,' said Mr Richard Holder, chairman and chief executive. Aluminium shipments totalled 388,300 tonnes in the quarter, and 1.115m tonnes for the first nine months, up from 386,400 and 1.088m tonnes respectively in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: "COMPUTER MUGS" AND NUCLEAR-TINTED HOMES;  </P> <P> WHEN KIDS ENVISION THE FUTURE, IT'S STILL THROUGH A TECHNOLOGICAL LENS  </P> <P> We are living in the future  </P> <P>  I'll tell you how I know  </P> <P>  I read it in the paper  </P> <P>  -- 15 years ago  </P> <P>  We're all driving rocket ships  </P> <P>  And talking with our minds  </P> <P>  Wearing turquoise jewelry  </P> <P>  And standing in soup lines  </P> <P>  -- "Living in the Future"  </P> <P> by John Prine, 1981  </P> <P> When I was in grade school in the late '50s and early '60s, scientists seemed  like gods and the idea of a future based on nuclear power was virtually a  religion.  </P> <P> My friends and I wanted to be rocket scientists or astronauts when we grew up  and we eagerly anticipated the day that miniaturized atomic engines would allow  us to cut the umbilical cord connecting automobiles to the gasoline pump.  </P> <P> In our eyes, at least, there was little of the mixed blessings awaiting us in  the future that singer-songwriter John Prine so cleverly pointed up.  </P> <P> Every now and then I wonder what kind of image of the future kids must have  today in the wake of devilish disasters with Three Mile Island, the space  shuttle Challenger, the Stringfellow acid pits and terrifyingly too many  others.  </P> <P> An exhibit at the Fullerton Museum Center addresses that very question through  youthful imaginings that are occasionally disturbing, but mostly charmingly  wacky.  </P> <P> The exhibit, which closes today (a week earlier than planned to make way for a  show from the Smithsonian that opens next month), is entitled "Document Orange  County, Part 3" and is paired with "Looking Forward," a show featuring  futuristic adult visions supplied by members of New York's American Institute  of Graphic Arts.  </P> <P> There are a couple of interesting entries among the graphic artists' show, but  for the most part, these posters and magazine or newspaper illustrations often  only loosely conjure images of the future.  </P> <P> It was the kids' section that most intrigued me, perhaps because I still carry  one dark memory out of all those duck-and-cover civil-defense drills that  supposedly were preparing us to survive nuclear war: the fear that I'd never  live long enough to die of old age.  </P> <P> As Albert Einstein observed, in a quote used on one of the AIGA posters: "The  unleashed power of the atom has changed everything except our modes of  thinking, and thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe."  </P> <P> What do you suppose today's kids, who may retain visions of Chernobyl, of  rockets' red glare and the space shuttle bursting in air, imagine life will be  like when (and if) they reach adulthood?  </P> <P> For a surprisingly large number, technology still appears to represent a kind  of savior, as it has to people throughout the 20th Century. Robots and other  clever machines will deliver kids of the future, if not from evil, at least  from the horrors of homework and washing the dishes.  </P> <P> Few imagine devices to eliminate poverty, hunger or disease. Most are far more  pragmatic.  </P> <P> My vote for Invention Most Likely to Succeed goes to fourth-grader Phoenix  Sanchez for his "Computer Mug."  </P> <P> "The computer mug will be used for drinking coffee and doing work at the same  time." Think of the time-wasting trips to the coffee machine that will save.  "It will come with a handle for transporting it easily to work or to school. It  will come in all the rainbow colors. It will cost about twice as much as a  plain coffee mug." C'mon -- it'd be a bargain at thrice the price. "It will be  used for art projects, homework and games."  </P> <P> Wait till the Ronco folks get hold of that one.  </P> <P> Two entries predict resurgences of fashions from the past. In 2189, writes  fifth-grader Melissa Merrell, "children and adults will wear long dresses and  suits like were worn in the year 1889, because fashion repeats itself."  Fortunately for our descendants, none of these kids is figuring on a big  comeback for bell bottoms.  </P> <P> Fullerton fifth-grader Greg Baines envisions the nuclear-tinted house of the  future: "The dark squares in my drawing represent the rooms where our faces  will glow in the dark in order to save on electricity."  </P> <P> And, of course, we will make contact with extraterrestrials in the world of  tomorrow.  </P> <P> Accompanying a picture of a creature that looks like a man with a head  resembling a two-slice toaster, fifth-grader Jim Freeman says: "U.S. astronauts  will discover this alien on Mars. They will find out that he is human in some  ways." In other words, he's not a lawyer. "He also has alien features, for  instance, his eyes and mouth and three fingers are very alien. He has a badge  indicating he is Captain of Mars." Sort of the Joe Friday of the Red Planet.  </P> <P> There are, however, a few signs that not everything will be rosy in the year  2525.  </P> <P> As explanation for her city in the sky, Kerri Devonald expects that "the world  will explode before the year 2489, so everything will be up in the air."  </P> <P> Angelina Gonzalez, another fifth-grader, put together an illustration that she  describes thusly: "My picture is of a spaceship going up in the air. A man is  looking out of the spaceship, and he looks a bit scared."  </P> <P> Under a computer-generated picture called "The Kid Robot," one fifth-grader  painted a psychologically revealing analogy of the model child-student as  automaton: "My robot is very intelligent. She can do any problem on your  homework. She is programmed to clean rooms, wash dishes and any other chore you  could ask her to do. . . . She looks like a human being, but she's not."  </P> <P> When asked to describe what Orange County will look like in the future, most  kids drew pictures including vehicles that will be able, in one student's  words, to "fly through the air with the greatest of ease." Obviously they've  spent some time on the Santa Ana freeway.  </P> <P> And some of us can find reassurance in knowing that at some point, as pictured  in one drawing, Orange County apparently will be defended by a giant walking a  tightrope shaking his fist (or is he throwing punches?) at low-flying planes.  </P> <P> Several of the houses that will occupy the county in years hence have windows  emblazoned with dollar signs. Are they all banks, reflecting the county's  affluence? Or are they an indication that kids are aware of the astronomic cost  of housing that will price most of them into futuristic suburbs somewhere  outside Fontana?  </P> <P> There is, however, one image of Orange County's future that stands apart from  the rest: a picture of green hills and flowers and a rainbow and a blue sky and  a shining sun.  </P> <P> I don't know what kind of student drew this one, but I'll predict that this kid  may have the brightest future of all. At the Orange County Chamber of Commerce.  </P></p>

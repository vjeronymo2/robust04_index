In May, having decided to procure either the COSIS 200k1  system of Germany's AE or the SSCSMK system of Britain's  Baesema, the council asked the DLA for a document with which to  evaluate the British firm's ability to deliver the system within  the set period.    Baesema forwarded the document and a bank affidavit  guaranteeing its financial solvency to the DLA within a week.    But the DLA concealed the British firm's documents and  advised the council that it was not an adequate contractor  because of its poor financial status and low credibility,  misleading the council into selecting AE.    The council's dominant opinion was that the British product  was optimum for Korean destroyers and better than the German  product, but the DLA's misinformation led the council to select  the German system, the white paper says.    The board recommended that the Defense Ministry take action  against DLA deputy foreign procurement officer Yun Sam-song for  producing the misinformation, and the ministry disciplined him.</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Emu may not be dead, after all: A currency union embracing most of Europe cannot be ruled out by the end of the decade 'I hope my fellow heads of government will resist the temptation to recite the mantra of full economic and monetary union as if nothing had changed. If they do recite it, it will have all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same potency.' Thus did John Major, in an instantaneously notorious article for The Economist last September, dispose of the soul of the Maastricht treaty he had fought so hard to enact. Yet there is an excellent chance that this particular piece of wisdom, albeit increasingly conventional, is quite wrong. Some continental politicians agree that the Maastricht timetable is no longer realistic. Not surprisingly, this is particularly true in Germany, where the notion of sacrificing the beloved D-Mark in favour of what has been condemned by one Bavarian politician as 'esperanto money' is decidedly unpopular. In June, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, said that a single European currency might not be realised until 2001. In similar vein, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, have both emphasised that maintaining currency stability is more important than sticking rigidly to the Maastricht timetable. British Tory politicians find the idea of Emu too painful to contemplate since it might spell the end for their party. As for Mr Kohl, he has made a commitment upon which he can hardly renege if his country is to retain its credibility abroad. Yet the consequences of living up to it could seriously damage his popularity at home. When confronted by alternatives so unpleasant, a natural response is to pretend the choice will not arise, or at least not soon. It is certainly a natural response for vote-seeking politicians. Yet there are strong reasons for believing Emu will happen. The first is that influential people in Germany and France remain convinced that closer integration between their two countries is in their interest. For Mr Kohl, who looks increasingly likely to retain power at the forthcoming German general election, this is an article of faith. As for the French policy-making elite, whose hold on power is unlikely to be shaken by next year's presidential election, it wants Emu not just for broad political reasons, but specifically to obtain influence over German monetary policy. If the French were to request Emu when the treaty says they are entitled to do so, could Germany refuse? Second, many European policy-makers believe that a single market must have, if not a single currency, at least currency stability. This desire makes Emu still more important than before last August, when at least there was the hard ERM. The present provisional arrangement, with its 15 per cent divergence bands, has proved more stable than might have been expected. Indeed, one of the reasons for believing a move to Emu would not be too disruptive is that the French franc is back within the old 2.25 per cent divergence band from its central rate against the D-Mark. The same is true for the Belgian franc and Irish punt. It is almost true for the Danish krone, while the Dutch guilder never even moved into wide bands. Yet such stability cannot be guaranteed, it is argued, except through a currency union. Finally, the loosening of the ERM has demonstrated that a currency union is different in kind from an adjustable-peg exchange rate system. An Emu would be binding throughout an unknowable future. It is frivolous to pretend that failure to meet arbitrary convergence criteria by 1998 would make Emu unsafe, while success by, say, 2001 would make it safe. So why should EU member states not attempt to use the dates they have already set? The obvious answer to that question is that the criteria laid down in the treaty, albeit arbitrary, are likely to prove an insuperable obstacle to Emu by 1999. But this is to forget the subtlety of the treaty. The relevant criteria fall into three groups: for inflation and interest rates; for exchange rates; and for fiscal policy. Consumer price inflation must be within 1 1/2 percentage points of the level in the best three members. Long-term interest rates must be within 2 percentage points of bond yields in the three countries with the lowest inflation rate. The Commission's latest forecast for 1994 inflation makes the three best performers France, Denmark and the Netherlands (see chart). Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the UK all meet the criterion. In early July, these countries also met the interest rate test. The treaty was written on the assumption that Emu would emerge out of the ERM with narrow bands. The precise requirement, however, was that 'a member state has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS without severe tensions for at least the two years before the examination'. The current wider bands can now be used to define what is normal. Those with an excellent chance of meeting this criterion are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Others may, too. Fiscal policy appears, at first glance, to be the paramount obstacle. On closer examination, however, this obstacle too disappears. The treaty offers two fiscal 'reference values', namely, '3 per cent for the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product at market prices' and '60 per cent for the ratio of government debt to gross domestic product at market prices'. On Commission forecasts, Luxembourg and Ireland should meet the deficit criterion this year, although Germany and the Netherlands will come close. The public debt criterion should be met by Germany, France, Luxembourg and the UK, although Spain is very close and Portugal not too far away. If unchanged, the fiscal position would appear to preclude Emu by early 1997, when a majority of members would have to satisfy all criteria. Furthermore, if Emu is to start in January 1999, it appears that there will be few participants. A monetary union between Germany and Luxembourg would seem the definition of futility. This analysis is misleading, however, because the 'excessive deficit' procedure of the Maastricht treaty, of which the reference values are components, is judgmental. In addition, the leading role in applying it falls on the Commission, hardly a disinterested party. The latter is enjoined to identify 'gross errors'. It is a gross error, for example, if the 'planned or actual' general government deficit is in excess of 3 per cent of GDP, 'unless either the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to the reference value; or alternatively the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the ratio remains close to the reference value'. It is also a gross error if the ratio of general government gross debt to gross domestic product exceeds 60 per cent, 'unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace'. Exceptional circumstances - the recent recession - may well be used to explain why Belgium, France, the UK and Denmark cannot meet the deficit measure. Furthermore, economic recovery should make it feasible for all of these countries to cut their deficits further. Most already have plans to do so. Ratios of debt to GDP cannot be adjusted as swiftly as can deficits. Furthermore, three member states are forecast to have debt ratios of above 100 per cent this year: Italy, Greece and Belgium. In addition, Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland have ratios well above 80 per cent. The question, however, is whether debt ratios will be judged to be 'sufficiently diminishing'. If a country maintains a large primary budget surplus - that is, excluding interest payments - that ratio will indeed tend to diminish. Of the high debt countries, Belgium, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands all had significant primary surpluses last year. Though generally smaller this year, they could rise again. In 1996, therefore, the Commission may be able to argue that the eight countries which meet the inflation and interest rate criteria also meet the fiscal standards. It has, in fact, already argued that Ireland does not fail the fiscal tests, despite its high debt, because of its low deficit. The Commission should also be able to get away with this sleight of hand, since the Council 'shall, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission (my emphasis) . . . decide . . . whether an excessive deficit exists'. The Commission has the initiative. Thus the supposedly awesome fiscal criteria vanish, leaving but a grimace behind. The Maastricht treaty offers two specific dates for the move to the third stage. The first is not later than December 31 1996, by when the Council, acting by qualified majority, shall determine 'whether a majority of the member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, decide whether it is appropriate for the Community to enter the third stage, and if so set the date for the beginning of the third stage'. Seven members - Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Ireland - may be judged to meet the criteria in 1996. The UK is likely to pass all except the ERM criterion. But Denmark and the UK have their hard-won opt outs from the third stage of Emu and are excluded by the treaty from any potential majority. By then, however, the EU will have been enlarged, in theory by four members. Norway already meets all the criteria and Austria almost all. Although not a member of the ERM, Austria possesses the most stable of all exchange rates against the D-Mark. Finland might well meet the criteria too. But Sweden looks likely to be excluded by its daunting fiscal crisis. Nevertheless, the number of countries meeting the conditions and not having opt-outs could well be nine out of 16 by late 1996, a majority. If the member states decide in 1996 that the conditions are met for the EU to enter the third stage, they must then set the date. They could set 2097, for example, not 1997. Yet such finagling seems unlikely, since it would ruin the EU's credibility. If they do not make a decision in 1996, the treaty requires Emu to start on January 1 1999. Germany is the only plausible obstacle to Emu, since one without it would rob the project of its purpose. That many Germans are uncomfortable with the idea is obvious, but the country has made a commitment. To draw back would do grave damage. What is more, the German constitutional court is not likely to prove a decisive obstacle. It has insisted, quite rightly, that the rules laid down in the treaty must be followed. But those rules are themselves judgmental. Provided the procedures are followed, there is no obvious legal basis for complaint. Some may object that this analysis is insufficiently political. But it is precisely through legal obligations that European integration proceeds. There was, after all, also scepticism about the ability of the EU to meet the 1992 date for completing the basic legislation relating to the single market. Never underestimate the EU's fear of failure and the tyranny of the deadline. Politics might arise in other ways. Germany could, for example, use the threat of being difficult to obtain concessions on political integration at the inter-governmental conference due in 1996. But the Germans are not in a good position to insist on a quid pro quo for Emu. Mr Kohl presumably knew what he was doing when he sold the pass, even if he does not care to tell his electorate now. One way to make the move to the third stage more palatable would be to have irrevocably fixed exchange rates, but make no early moves to a single currency. Technically, all that would be needed is an open-ended commitment to support member currencies vis a vis one another, combined with a common monetary policy. The latter is what the European Central Bank would provide. Meanwhile, the angst of the man on the U-Bahn would be assuaged by continued circulation of his beloved D-Marks. Mr Major may be unwilling to contemplate the possibility, but the dissolution of the ERM does, if anything, make Emu more probable, because more urgent. By the end of the decade an Emu embracing Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway is quite conceivable. Even the participation of Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden cannot be precluded. Would Denmark and the UK then say no? The prime minister was wrong. This rain dance is potent - and could be followed by a downpour.</p>

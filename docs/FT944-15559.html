			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Call to end VAT 'money-go-round' - In a nutshell The Federation of Small Businesses yesterday called for a system of VAT-free trading between companies dealing on credit terms. The Federation says HM Customs and Excise collected Pounds 63bn in 1993, of which Pounds 25bn was subsequently repaid to companies in a 'futile money-go-round'. Freeing such inter-company trading from VAT would relieve small companies of much of the paper work required to avoid the stringent VAT penalty regime, the Federation said in a submission to the Chancellor of the Exchequer ahead of the November Budget. Abolition of inter-company VAT would be the 'biggest clearance of red tape within a system recognised by all small business surveys to be the biggest cause of concern for this sector', the Federation said. The idea is likely to be opposed by Customs and Excise, which has argued that VAT-free trading would increase the risk of abuse. The Federation claims Customs and Excise collects considerably more than it is due and pays it back later, creating a cash flow benefit to the Exchequer at the expense of UK commerce.</p>

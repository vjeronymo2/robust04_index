			<p>BFN     [Text] Brcko, 11 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic, told journalists in Brcko  today that he cannot foresee an end to the war in the near  future, although the Serb people want it. His statement came  after the 40th session of the Srpska republic people's assembly,  which adopted conclusions on topical issues of foreign and  domestic policy. Members of the public were not present at the  assembly's discussions.    "The latest attack by Muslim forces on Brcko rules out any  possibility of their having any part of Brcko," Karadzic  stressed. "Brcko has been and will remain a Serb town."    The Srpska republic president called on the people in Serb  Posavina to be vigilant and strong and to remain in this  territory "to defend it well and be convinced of their own  victory." "There can be no discussion about the territory,  which is vital for the Serb people," the Srpska republic  president said.    In his statement for journalists, Karadzic reaffirmed the  stands contained in the negotiating platform of the Srpska  republic adopted in March this year, which is still in effect  and according to which "no negotiations on the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina can be possible if there is no peace."</p>

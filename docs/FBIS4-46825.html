			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Matveyevich Fadeyev, RF minister of </F> railways, by correspondent Arkadiy Zhemchugov; date and place  not given: "Gennadiy Fadeyev: `We Are in Favor of Mutually  Beneficial Cooperation with Businessmen'"]    [Text]    [Zhemchugov] Gennadiy Matveyevich! Railway transport is  known  to be one of the few areas in which most, if not all, operations  are regulated by the state. Nevertheless, First Deputy Chairman  Oleg Soskovets of the RF Council of Ministers kept asking the  railroad administrators who attended a domestic electronics  exhibit in the Leningrad Station on 12 April about their  relationship to commercial banks and business structures. Can  you tell our readers anything about this?    [Fadeyev] The Ministry of Railways is in favor of mutually  beneficial cooperation with commercial banks and business  structures. What is more, it is assisting in the establishment  of commercial structures, particularly those that might do  something to achieve the current objectives of railway transport.    The Railroad Bank, a commercial institution, was established  and is operating within the branch, and it already managed to  achieve some impressive financial results last year. The capital  stock of the bank is now being increased to 1.5 billion rubles,  and the figure will rise to 5 billion in the future. According  to plans, the Railroad Bank should aid in the establishment of a  single banking system for the Russian railroads to speed up the  transfer and circulation of financial resources. Virtually all  of the railroads have operating commercial banks, and bank  branches are being opened in railroad subdivisions and  enterprises. The banking system is operating as an autonomous  commercial structure, not only to attract investments and extend  credit to rail transport enterprises, but also to earn money on  its own. This is particularly important in view of the reduction  of freight transport revenue.    The Ministry of Railways and the railroads have established  commercial structures such as Sovfinamtrans, Apparel, and the  Railway Joint-Stock Insurance Company, which will have a broad  field of operations in connection with the institution of  compulsory insurance for freight and passenger transport. An  industrial finance company was recently founded to solve the  problem of nonpayments. There are plans to establish a structure  to handle supplementary pension security. According to railroad  administrators, the commercial structures can develop most  productively if they solve the specific problems of the branch  and secure and improve transport services.    [Zhemchugov] Do you want to enlist the services of Russian  businessmen in the resolution of current problems in rail  transport? If so, what kind of plans have you made?    [Fadeyev] We certainly do want to do this. In particular, we  want a domestic production base for the construction of rolling  stock. You could say that this process has already begun. The  production of electric trains, for example, has been organized  at a plant in Torzhok, and without the use of government funds.    Participation by Russian businessmen in the improvement of  transport services could be another important field of  cooperation. Railroad administrators are willing to take the  priority of certain freight shipments into account when they  serve business structures.    Besides this, there are already some firms specializing in  the safe arrival of freight, in freight expediting services, and  in the monitoring of delivery schedules. Interaction with  commercial structures is also possible in this field.    [Zhemchugov] How realistic are the plans for the  construction  and operation of private railroads in Russia?    [Fadeyev] The construction of private railroads in Russia  would be extremely problematic: It would entail large capital  investments and a long recoupment period. Private capital still  cannot afford to take on projects of this kind without  government support. The Gelleflint Joint-Stock Company, which  plans to build the Lendmozero-Kochkoma line, and the High-Speed  Highways Joint-Stock Company, which has already begun  construction work, are experiencing a need for considerable  government support. No one could object to the installation of  private railway lines for the development of new mineral  deposits, for instance, but any new railroad will have to  operate at a loss for the first five years or so, and carrying  losses for this length of time will probably be too inconvenient  and unaffordable for business structures.    [Zhemchugov] Tell us what we all want to know: Will there be  any fare increases before the end of this year?    [Fadeyev] Rail transport is one of the few branches in which  the cost of its products and services is regulated by the state.  Meanwhile, the prices of most of the products used by the  railroads are not controlled. Regrettably, adjusting fares to  keep up with rising costs cannot be avoided unless the state  subsidizes the expenses of the branch, and this depends on  budget prospects.    In view of the much more intense rail traffic in summer, the  government wants to reduce the fares on suburban trains by 70  percent from 30 April to 10 May 1994 and by 50 percent on  holidays and weekends from 14 May to 25 September 1994 and  compensate the Ministry of Railways for the resulting losses.</p>

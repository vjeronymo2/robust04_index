			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Miyazawa to act on share slump MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, will today chair an emergency meeting on measures to support the country's flagging stock market. The announcement came after Wednesday's 2.9 per cent plunge on the Tokyo market, where the Nikkei average fell to its lowest level since April 1986. Share prices rallied yesterday on reports of the emergency meeting, and the Nikkei surged 497.99 to 16,039.94. Mr Miyazawa spoke during his campaign tour in Kobe, in western Japan, before Sunday's election for half the seats of the upper house of parliament. He expressed concern over the effects of the Japanese stock market on other world markets. 'We have to think of the Japanese economy's position in the world,' he said, adding that all possible measures needed to be considered to support the faltering stock market. Market participants were relieved by the announcement. 'It seems like the authorities, who have been turning their cold shoulder to the stock market, have started to indicate that they care,' said a fund manager at Dai-Ichi Life. The Tokyo business community was also heartened by the move. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the employers' federation, welcomed the government's response to stock market weakness. However, Mr Miyazawa did not elaborate on possible measures to support share prices, and some scepticism remains. 'The turnaround in the government's attitude is good news, but whether the support measures are practical is another matter,' said Mr Nick Cant at Baring Securities in Tokyo. Others expressed concern over the negative impact, if the emergency measures turn out to be little more than a rehash of previously discussed reforms. The government's emergency economic package announced in March failed to restore investor confidence. Pessimism over the Japanese economy is at the root of the stock market weakness. Most investors had hoped for a rebound of the economy this autumn to lift corporate earnings. However, recent adverse economic data have cast doubts over an early economic recovery.</p>

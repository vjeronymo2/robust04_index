			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : A DARKER CAPT. HOOK  </P> <P> Captain Hook, that shiny meat hook of a hand slashing through the air, has  always been a child's bedtime villain, good for a little nightmare for the tots  but really a figure of innocent squealish delight for children raised on Darth  Vader.  </P> <P> Now comes actor Stephen Hanan, co-starring with Cathy Rigby in "Peter Pan" at  the Pantages, who turns theater's most popular, dastardly pirate into a  menacing psychotic.  </P> <P> "The concept going into this show," said Broadway veteran Hanan, "was to play  Hook more darkly, to catch the lighter side of evil and capture his cavernous  abysses of grief and heartbreak. He wants revenge for his childhood. Hook was  Barrie's critique of the British class system, which is all in Barrie's novel  (1911). Hook is the nightmare version of the children's Daddy" (Mr. Darling,  whom Hanan also plays in a double role).  </P> <P> The show is a hard ticket here, closing at the Pantages July 1 and continuing  on tour through the country until it winds up on Broadway in December.  </P> <P> Hanan, 43, a classically trained actor from Washington who was Tony-nominated  for his work in "Cats," broke into theater singing Italian arias for money  outside the San Francisco Ferry Terminal between 1971 and 1977. "It was the era  of Woodstock, and I had just come back from a year on a Fulbright Fellowship in  London, where my training ) had made me very idealistic about theater. My agent  would only send me out for commercials, so I became a full-tilt hippie."  </P> <P> He's written a play about that period, about Haight-Asbury, entitled "Rainbow's  Return," which was produced last year in Hampton, N.Y. In fact, Hanan has  written five plays.  </P> <P> "I act to support my writing habit," he said with a grin. RAY LOYND  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOW, IT'S WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE TOLLWAY;  </P> <P> LAND-USE: LAGUNA BEACH OPPOSES PLANS TO BUILD THE ROAD, BUT THE TRANSPORTATION  CORRIDOR AGENCIES AND THE IRVINE CO. SAY THEY INTEND TO PROCEED.  </P> <P> Although the fractious battle between the city of Laguna Beach and the Irvine  Co. over Laguna Canyon has apparently been settled, the related question of the  San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor tollway -- scheduled to run through  the canyon -- remains in dispute.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the Irvine Co. agreed to sell 2,150 acres of the area known  as Laguna Laurel to the city for $78 million, scrapping plans for a 3,200-unit  housing development and several commercial centers. Much of the first  installment will come through a $20-million bond issue if voters approve it on  the Nov. 6 ballot. All parties to the Laguna Laurel negotiations agreed to keep  those discussions separate from ones about the future of the corridor.  </P> <P> "The city is in opposition to the toll road and presumably will continue to  oppose it," Mayor Lida Lenney said. "We foresee Laguna Laurel as a regional  park," and that would be harmed by the presence of the tollway.  </P> <P> But both the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies and the Irvine Co.  maintain that the sale of Laguna Laurel to Laguna Beach and its preservation as  a wilderness area will not affect plans for the tollway.  </P> <P> Although tollway officials have not seen the details of the Laguna Laurel  settlement, spokeswoman Donna Stubbs said, "we don't think it's going to have  any effect on us. . . . We'll be moving forward, doing business as usual."  </P> <P> "We are on the record in the past as having been supportive of all three  transportation corridors, and that has not changed," an Irvine Co. spokeswoman  said.  </P> <P> Provision for the corridor right of way was written into the Laguna Laurel  sales agreement, and the Irvine Co. remains committed to an earlier agreement  to pay $30.2 million in transportation improvements associated with the  tollway, a spokeswoman said. The settlement also includes a provision that any  reduction in that amount as a result of the company's decision not to proceed  with the housing development is to be deducted from Laguna Beach's final  payment to the company.  </P> <P> But the future of the tollway is still in dispute.  </P> <P> A revised environmental impact report for the project that was released earlier  this month includes a new plan for a bridge that would span the canyon,  reducing damage to the environment. The revised report was to be a topic of  discussion today at the regular meeting of the Orange County Transportation  Corridor Agencies.  </P> <P> So far, grading for the road has been confined to the Aliso Viejo area, and no  work has been done in Laguna Canyon. The corridor is already two years behind  schedule, largely because the original plan was written for a freeway rather  than a tollway. Further construction is contingent on approval of the  environmental impact report.  </P> <P> Stubbs said she does not think that the scrapping of the Laguna Laurel  development will necessitate the filing of a new environmental impact report.  "We used existing (traffic flow) figures that were required at the time" the  study was initially written, she said. The new agreement "won't jeopardize this  EIR as far as I can see. The plan was contingent on congestion that we have  now."  </P> <P> But opponents of the project are gearing up efforts to block it.  </P> <P> The city of Laguna Beach has hired a consultant to aid its effort to show that  the tollway would contribute to smog and be otherwise environmentally  disruptive.  </P> <P> Lenney is so opposed to the project that she wrote a letter to the tollway  authority protesting that the signs along the route that describe it as a  "freeway" are "false advertising."  </P></p>

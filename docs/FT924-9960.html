			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Luscar agrees mines purchase LUSCAR, a privately-owned Alberta coal producer, has agreed to buy two mines in south-east British Columbia formerly owned by Westar Mining, which was Canada's biggest coal exporter until it was put into bankruptcy earlier this year. Terms for the purchase of the Balmer and Greenhills mines were not disclosed. The sale is expected to close by mid-November. The Westar deal, which is another milestone in the shake-out of the financially stretched Canadian coal industry, will make Luscar one of the country's biggest coal producers. The company, based in Edmonton, operates seven mines in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The Balmer mine, which produced 5.4m tonnes in 1991, has been idle since a labour dispute halted operations last May. Members of the United Mine Workers of America union at Balmer have accepted proposals for a new contract. Cominco, the Canadian base metals and fertiliser producer, returned to the black in the third quarter due to higher zinc and copper prices and improved costs at its smelter at Trail, British Columbia. Third-quarter earnings were CDollars 10.1m (USDollars 8.1m), or 12 cents a share, before extraordinary items, compared with a loss of CDollars 23.2, or 30 cents, a year earlier.</p>

The draft is to be submitted for  consideration by the CIS Coordinative and Consultative  Committee, which will hold its meeting in Moscow on 1 March. As  Yevgeniy Gorelik, press secretary of the CIS Executive  Committee, told an RID correspondent, the main controversies  which arose during the drafting of the agreement concerned an  article defining the status of Ukrainian representatives in the  coordinative bodies of the economic union.    The Uzbek delegation insisted that Ukrainian experts and  permanent representatives be entitled to only put forward their  suggestions. The Ukrainian delegation, which arrived in Minsk  to participate in the project, proposed that it should be  defined in one of the articles that decisions adopted by the CIS  coordinative bodies be considered as recommendations with regard  to Ukraine. The majority of participants in the meeting did  not, however, accept this proposal. The last word in this  dispute rests with the prime ministers and presidents who will  chair sessions of the Council of CIS Leaders and Government  Heads at the end of March, said Yevgeniy Gorelik.</p>

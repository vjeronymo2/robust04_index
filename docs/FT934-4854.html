			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Canada set for gradual recovery: OECD survey warns that prospects depend on US growth Canada can look forward to a gradual economic recovery next year, with rising productivity and subdued inflationary pressure, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's annual survey of the Canadian economy. But the survey warns that prospects depend heavily on the pace of recovery in the US, which is by far Canada's biggest export market, and on success in coming to grips with towering federal and provincial budget deficits. The OECD forecasts 3.9 per cent real growth in gross domestic product in 1994, up from 2.7 per cent this year and 0.7 per cent in 1992. The recovery has so far been based mainly on strong export growth. This is forecast to continue in the year ahead, but should be accompanied by substantially higher household spending and business investment and a strong housing market rebound. Inflation, measured by the GDP price deflator, is projected at a modest 1.8 per cent in 1994, compared with 0.8 per cent this year. However, the unemployment rate will drop only marginally to 10.9 per cent from 11.2 per cent. The OECD cautions that 'heavy government borrowing has left the economy vulnerable to changes in financial market sentiment, leading to increased short-term interest rate volatility and higher long-term credit costs'. It adds that continuing fiscal discipline in the public sector 'appears crucial to the maintenance of easier monetary conditions and the achievement of lower long-term rates'. A feature of Canada's recent performance has been a surge in productivity, with businesses adjusting remarkably quickly to such structural changes as the 1989 free trade agreement with the US, privatisation and tax reform. 'The better domestic cost performance along with exchange-rate depreciation has significantly improved international competitiveness,' the OECD concludes. But the report says that the prospects for long-term growth would be enhanced by further reforms, including the dismantling of inter-provincial trade barriers, lower farm subsidies, and improved education and healthcare systems. Canada's generous social-security net is also singled out as a source of concern. The new Liberal government has indicated in recent weeks that it plans to overhaul the entire social security system.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Fiat's job cuts raise spectre of labour unrest Fiat, the Turin-based automotive group, faces serious labour unrest following a management decision to implement a 5 per cent cut in its workforce and lay off a further 10 per cent for up to two years. The stand-off between the management of Italy's largest private employer and the unions is expected to set the tone for industrial relations this year. Italy has been slower than its big international competitors in cutting jobs in the automotive, chemicals, defence and steel industries - which are most affected by recession and international overcapacity. By the end of this week indefinite lay-off notices, lasting two years, will have gone out to 6,500 of the group's 95,000 workers, with more to follow. This is in addition to the 16,000 employees who will be temporarily laid-off this week in Fiat's Italian plants because of poor car sales. At the weekend Fiat unions called an eight-hour strike for tomorrow at all big Italian plants. On Wednesday workers at Arese, the big Alfa Romeo plant outside Milan, which is under threat, are due to strike. In November Fiat announced plans for job cuts and lay-offs to help it sustain competitiveness and absorb the impact of recession. During subsequent meetings - initially with the unions, and then with the Ministry of Labour - it has held to a tough line. The unions tried to persuade it to accept 'solidarity contracts' - flexible working hours and a shorter working week as used by Volkswagen. Fiat insisted this was incompatible with the L40,000bn (Pounds 15.7bn) being invested until the end of the century on upgrading production and introducing new models. The break came late on Friday evening when Fiat said time had run out and the plan had to be implemented immediately. Although reluctant to risk a confrontation, the group's financial position and car production overcapacity have forced the issue. Fiat's 1993 losses are likely to be L2,000bn and are largely attributed to poor car sales. With its Melfi plant fully operational this year, the group's Italian car capacity will be close to 2.4m units, against 1993 production of little more than 1.1m units. The management's decision also appears to have been influenced by the imminent dissolution of parliament and difficulties of the government acting as a broker. The main job cuts are at Fiat's Sevel plant near Naples, in the Turin area and at Arese. Of these, some 3,800 affect administrative staff. Apart from trying to introduce 'solidarity contracts', the unions are concerned that Fiat still lacks a clear strategy and that the two-year lay-offs will become permanent. They also fear that in 1996 the Arese plant, employing 9,000, will be closed.</p>

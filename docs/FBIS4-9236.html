			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana April 20 (ATA) -- On April 20 Albanian  ambassador in Athens, Hysen Cabej, was called to the Greek  Foreign Ministry by the vice director of Balkan political  department, Mr.Ralis, who presented the Greek request that the  Albanian diplomatic staff be reduced by one more person. The  present staff of the Albanian Embassy in Athens is composed of  five diplomats.    Strangely enough, this fact runs counter to the statements  uttered by the Greek government members themselves on finding a  way to dialogue and cooperation. As a result, the message from  Athens is difficult to be understood, says a statement of the  spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Albania  regarding this event.</p>

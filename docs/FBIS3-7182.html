			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 25 KYODO -- Japanese automakers have  proposed resumption of their talks with American carmakers to  help break an impasse in bilateral framework trade talks.    In its "action plan for international cooperation," the  Japan  Automobile Manufacturers Association on Thursday [24 March] also  proposed inviting smaller parts makers in the U.S. to regular  business negotiations between Japanese carmakers and major U.S.  parts makers.    The action program was published to coincide with the  government's planned market-opening measures to be announced  shortly. It is apparently designed to help break the ice in the  framework trade negotiations, which broke down in February.    The private-sector talks were held twice in 1992 but no  bilateral discussions have taken place since.    Following the program, Japan's five biggest carmakers  including Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. will  separately announce individual schemes for purchases of U.S  parts.</p>

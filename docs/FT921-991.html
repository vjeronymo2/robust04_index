			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: No black clouds mar Chilean skies - How the revaluation of the peso has revitalised the bolsa THE Santiago Stock Exchange moves from strength to strength, spurred by falling inflation, a strong peso and a booming economy that is expected to grow by 15 per cent in dollar terms this year. Mr Mario Lobo, a manager at Celsius, the stockbroker, says: 'There is not one negative economic indicator on the horizon. Few countries in the world could match Chile's economic performance over the past year.' The bolsa, or stock exchange, has been the main beneficiary of the central bank's decision to revalue the Chilean peso in January and to introduce looser exchange controls. The peso has appreciated by about 8 per cent against the dollar since early January. As a result, inflation is coming down and so are money market interest rates. This has led individual and institutional investors to move their cash into the stock market and, as a result, trading has been exceptionally heavy. Some Dollars 20m changes hands each day - double the average daily trading volume last year. The IPSA index of the 40 most traded shares has risen by 21.5 per cent since the beginning of the year. The gains in dollar terms have been even higher because of the peso's appreciation. By last Friday's close, share prices had climbed by 28.6 per cent in dollar terms. Traders do not expect the bolsa to repeat last year's phenomenal growth, when the IPSA index advanced by 124 per cent in real terms. The consensus forecast is that share prices will rise by a further 50 per cent this year. While Chilean equity is becoming more expensive, shares are still expected to outperform all other investment instruments this year. Some listed companies riding the economic boom are expected to show a 30 per cent real increase in profits during 1992. The gains, however, will not be uniform. Exporters are complaining loudly that the central bank has abandoned them. Unless world commodity prices recover this year, the strong peso will dent the profits of large exporting conglomerates such as Copec (cellulose and fishmeal), CMPC (paper and pulp), CAP (forestry and steel) and Iansa (sugar and agro-industrial exports). The banking sector is also expected to perform poorly as it is suffering from excess liquidity and the loss of corporate business. An increasing number of companies are swapping their bank debt for bond issues carrying lower coupons. Bank profits were down 78 per cent in January compared with the same month last year, but much of this was due to the fall in the peso value of their dollar assets following the revaluation of the peso. The hot favourites this year are construction companies, utilities, vineyards and generally any company which can be expected to cash in on Chile's consumer spending spree. Companies with dollar debts have received an unexpected windfall with the revaluation. Likewise CTC, the telephone utility which imports much of its telecommunications equipment. Its shares have risen by 43 per cent so far this year, making it one of the best performers in the market. So much economic success, however, tends to breed complacency. Foreign investors have begun to lobby the central bank to lift the remaining restrictions on capital repatriation. At present, foreign investment funds are tied in Chile for three to five years. Investors point out that Argentina and Mexico now have no restrictions on capital repatriation, making these markets more attractive to regional funds. Chile's economic stability, however, makes Santiago's bolsa the safest bet within the emerging markets in Latin America. A total of 13 foreign investment funds are now active in Chile. They have brought in some Dollars 400m over the past 2 1/2 years. The total value of their Chilean assets is now worth Dollars 1.12bn.</p>

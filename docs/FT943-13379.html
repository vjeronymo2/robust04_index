			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Cost targets planned to curb NHS bureaucracy The government is to launch a fresh initiative to counter growing bureaucracy in the National Health Service by setting out broad targets for management spending by trust hospitals and community health groups. Amid growing concern about the increase in the number of NHS managers, ministers will reveal that the average administrative costs incurred by NHS trusts over the past year are between 3.5 per cent and 6 per cent of their total budgets. The Department of Health intends to use this figure as a guide to how much each trust chief executive should spend on management. Earlier this year Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, admitted that some trusts spent as much as 8.6 per cent of their total pay bill on administration, and said it needed to be reduced. The recommendations will come in a hitherto confidential report produced by the Department of Health, the Audit Commission and the Trust Federation, which should be published later this year. But it is unlikely to satisfy critics in the Labour party and health unions who argue that the purchaser/provider reforms in the NHS have led to more an bureaucrats. Concern over the increase in bureaucracy followed the publication of figures last year showing that the number of NHS managers rose by nearly 25 per cent in 1992. Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, recently embarrassed the government by referring to the 'restlessness among medical staff about the number of men in grey suits'. The government does not intend to enforce strict guidelines for spending on management. It believes that publication of figures on the average administrative expenditure by trusts will exert strong public pressure on those which exceed the figure. It will be a criminal offence for a drug company to offer expensive gifts and for doctors to accept them under regulations presented to parliament yesterday. The regulations implement the European directive on the advertising of medicines. Inexpensive items relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy remain allowed.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Libya reduces budget forecast Libya has sharply cut its budget forecast for 1994 because of difficulties caused by UN sanctions, Reuter reports. 'The cut amounts to several billions (dollars),' Prime Minister Abouzid Omar Dourdah said yesterday after the commission of the General People's Congress adopted the draft budget. Figures for the new budget were not made available. 'As a result of the unjust UN sanctions we have been forced to cut our expenses in several domains such as education and health,' said Mr Dourdah. The budget was set in such a way that Libya would rely less on oil, its main source of revenue, he said.</p>

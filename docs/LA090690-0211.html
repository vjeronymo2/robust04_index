			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> DEFENSE PATCHED, SO ROBINSON EYES OFFENSE  </P> <P> The Rams have been spending most of their time recently trying to patch  together a defensive unit, but with the return of three defensive holdouts over  the weekend and the addition of cornerback Mickey Sutton Tuesday, Coach John  Robinson has had a chance to focus his concern on the offense.  </P> <P> Conditioning will likely be a factor for former holdouts Kevin Greene, Doug  Reed and Michael Stewart, but rushing the passer, plugging up holes on the run  and knowing your spot in a zone defense don't require the precise timing that  is involved in the Rams' intricate passing game.  </P> <P> So now, Robinson has new things to worry about going into Sunday's season  opener against the Packers in Green Bay.  </P> <P> Both starting receivers -- Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson -- are coming off  hamstring injuries that have severely limited their practice time. Ellard has  caught one pass in exhibition play and Anderson didn't get a reception in an  exhibition game.  </P> <P> "I'm worried about getting started offensively," Robinson said. "The talent is  coming back, but we've been off the practice field for some time now, and I  think the timing could be a problem. We're just going to have to be precise and  efficient offensively to get off to a good start in the season.  </P> <P> "We can't screw the game up and win with the skill level that I think this team  has, because that skill level has been eroded by injury circumstances and the  loss of time. I'm worried about those residual negative things that will heal  themselves in time. I feel good about the football team, but it would be great  if we had one more week before we opened. I feel that kind of pressure."  </P> <P> Quarterback Jim Everett will be the one feeling the pressure shortly after the  opening kickoff Sunday. But Everett, who's so positive he sometimes makes Mr.  Rogers seem like a pessimist, is doing his best to downplay the problem.  </P> <P> "I think it will be a minimal thing," he said. "It's not like these guys are  walking in off the street or something. We've had some experience working  together.  </P> <P> "I suppose it could have some effect, but it shouldn't take more than the first  quarter or so. . . . only kidding. This week of practice should be enough."  </P> <P> The Rams picked up linebacker Greg Clark off waivers from Green Bay Wednesday.  Clark, who went to Green Bay as a Plan B player from Miami, will play primarily  on special teams.  </P> <P> But Robinson, who has seen his share of films of the Packers' exhibition games  this week, said Clark, a third-year player from Arizona State, is "a pretty  good inside linebacker, too."  </P> <P> The Rams' plans to take some pressure off Greene by moving Bill Hawkins to  weakside tackle, where he would also be a designated pass rusher, have been put  on hold. Hawkins has been slow to recover from arthroscopic knee surgery he  underwent in December and is "still playing on a leg and a half," according to  Robinson.  </P> <P> "One of the most disappointing things about training camp to me is that both  Bill Hawkins and (defensive tackle) Mike Piel have been so slow coming back  from injuries of last year," Robinson said. "It might be a little bit  psychological at this point."  </P> <P> Piel is still favoring his left elbow, which was dislocated twice last season.  </P> <P> Derrick Faison, the rookie free agent receiver with the nickname "Big Bird,"  continues to be one of Robinson's favorite topics of discussion.  </P> <P> "He's definitely been the most entertaining player in training camp," Robinson  said. "He's ready to play, but he's not sure what all those numbers mean. I  mean he's a bright person, he's just still learning the game and learning the  nuances. He gets excited and doesn't run the patterns precisely the way we want  him to.  </P> <P> "He certainly has the ability to jump and catch the ball, though. We threw a  pass to him (against Washington) and (cornerback Darrell) Green was covering  him and Green was about knee high to Big Bird when he went up for that one.  </P> <P> "He can really get up in the air. Over a period of time, he's going to be an  impressive player in this league, I think."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> All-Pro wide receiver Henry Ellard agreed to a three-year contract extension  Wednesday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. . . . Cornerback Mickey  Sutton, picked up on waivers from the Buffalo Bills, will start at left corner  against Green Bay. The Rams considered moving safety Anthony Newman to corner,  but decided it was best to have as few players as possible playing out of  position.  </P></p>

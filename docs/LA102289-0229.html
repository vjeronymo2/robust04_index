			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ELATED O.C. FIRE CREW PULLS LIFE FROM CARNAGE  </P> <P> One small movement of life lifted Orange County Fire Department Battalion Chief  Chuck Nicola Saturday from a deep gloom that overcame him after three days of  dealing only with the dead.  </P> <P> "It was like the highest high I could experience," Nicola said after he and  Orange County firefighter Dan Mackay led a dramatic rescue of a 57-year-old  dock supervisor buried for 90 hours in the rubble of the Nimitz Freeway in  Oakland.  </P> <P> Buck Helm of Weaverville was pulled from the wreckage of his car by the two  firefighters, who are part of a Heavy Rescue Flash Fire unit stationed in the  department's Seal Beach fire station, said Fire Capt. Hank Raymond.  </P> <P> Working feverishly in a dusty crawl space that threatened to collapse at any  time, Nicola and Mackay tore with a Jaws of Life tool at the mangled door of  Helm's car until they could finally free him. Then they and five others pulled  Helm to safety. Helm had been trapped since a 6.9-magnitude earthquake  collapsed the double-decker freeway at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> The rescue "was really a boost to us all," Nicola said.  </P> <P> News of the involvement of the two firefighters spread quickly Saturday at  their station on Beverly Manor Road and Seal Beach Boulevard, where fellow  firefighters eagerly watched local television reports throughout the day.  </P> <P> "They were watching for them all day," Raymond said. "It was good news to hear  that our local guys played a big part in this. It's exciting for our guys to  see our own people in a faraway place like that."  </P> <P> Raymond said that the rescue began after someone scouting among the wreckage  noticed a hand moving. California Department of Transportation workers and  private contractors rushed to shore up the section of overpass that had  collapsed on Helm's car.  </P> <P> "It was real tricky work," Raymond said. "A lot was going on. The structure had  been shifting. But when they knew a guy was alive in there, they all shifted in  gear."  </P> <P> Nicola, who arrived in Oakland on Thursday morning with four other members of  the Seal Beach heavy rescue workers, crawled into the three-foot-high space  that was left after the top of the double-decker freeway collapsed onto the  lower level during Tuesday's temblor.  </P> <P> "There wasn't much headroom," Raymond said the men told him.  </P> <P> As Nicola reached Helm's flattened car, Nicola said he felt a rush of  adrenaline when he saw the victim's head and feet moving slightly.  </P> <P> "It was an emotional roller-coaster when you go from retrieving dead people and  body parts to actually seeing a live human being in pretty good spirits,"  Nicola said.  </P> <P> Nicola then ordered firefighter Mackay to bring in a Jaws of Life tool to pry  the car door open, Raymond said. Working in the tight, enclosed space, rescuers  took seven hours to extricate Helm from the flattened car, Raymond said. Helm  talked to workers throughout the operation, he added, and was finally passed to  safety by a human chain of workers.  </P> <P> The special operations team has been involved in major rescues since its  inception in 1983. Nicola and other members of the team rescued victims after  the devastating Mexico City earthquake, Raymond said. "He's sort of getting  used to this," he said.  </P> <P> It was Mackay's first dramatic rescue as part of the team, however, Raymond  said.  </P> <P> Mackay has proposed renaming the heavy power tool that saved Helms' life the  "Spirit of Buck" and putting a nameplate in Helm's honor on the housing.  </P></p>

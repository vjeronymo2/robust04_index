			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Dublin extradition law likely to tighten The Irish government is expected to approve amendments to extradition legislation, closing legal loopholes that have blocked the extradition of IRA suspects to the UK from the Irish Republic. Government officials said yesterday the cabinet would approve the amendments this week, and that the new bill would be published before the Dail, the parliament, resumes next week. Extradition has been a source of friction between the British and Irish governments in recent years, in spite of moves to tighten the laws in the republic in 1987. For example, the possession of non-automatic firearms, as opposed to their use, is currently a non-extraditable offence in the republic. This was used as a successful defence in the Supreme Court two years ago by two IRA convicts who won an appeal against their extradition to Northern Ireland after their prison terms in the republic. In 1991 there was a political furore in Ireland after Mr Desmond Ellis, an IRA suspect, was extradited to the UK on charges of having conspired in the UK to cause explosions. When no evidence was presented in court that he had ever been in the UK, the charges were changed, breaching established extradition procedures.</p>

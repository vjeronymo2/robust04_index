			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Fisons Fisons describes 1992 as a year of change. A shock collision with reality might be more accurate. The company may be trying to ditch its reputation for nasty surprises and inculcate a less complacent management attitude, but it cannot seem to shake off lingering uncertainties. It is not yet clear that the production difficulties which slowed sales and upset the US Food and Drug Administration have finally been solved. Fisons Opticrom treatment has still not been re-admitted to the US. Its cash cow, Intal, may face competition once its US patent expires in August. The prospects for its new drug Tilade are still muddy. Despite the fall in sterling, the company may have difficulty restoring margins on its scientific equipment business in a weak European market. Small wonder, then, that no one has summoned up the nerve to bid for the company. Nor are they likely to, since Fisons has neither a gold mine of new compounds nor a steam roller sales force. Even the recovery potential seems pretty well discounted with a prospective 1993 rating which puts Fisons alongside Glaxo. To be fair, a 5.1 per cent yield does offer underpinning. The company is, however, likely to remain a niche player in pharmaceuticals. The delay caused by past management arrogance and shoddy production values seems to have closed the door on greater things indefinitely.</p>

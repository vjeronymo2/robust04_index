			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PHIL COLLINS SHRUGS OFF STARDOM  </P> <P> British singer Phil Collins knows he doesn't fit a pop superstar profile.  </P> <P> "I don't like to think of myself as a star," Collins said recently.  </P> <P> "It makes me nervous. When you start thinking in star terms, you start thinking  you're better than everybody else."  </P> <P> Collins, whose latest solo album ". . .But Seriously" hit the top of the charts  three weeks after its release, said his success has little to do with his  appearance.  </P> <P> "Do I look like someone who's going to set feminine hearts aflutter?" the  balding 38-year-old asked.  </P> <P> But the author of eight No. 1 tunes during the past decade and a member of the  rock group Genesis bristles when critics call him a lightweight on social  issues.  </P> <P> Many media critics said his recent No. 1 hit, "Another Day in Paradise," is  unconvincing.  </P> <P> "How dare these critics say I don't know what I'm talking about. I know what I  see for myself, what I read about and see on TV. I don't have to be homeless to  be touched by what's happening to these people," he said.  </P></p>

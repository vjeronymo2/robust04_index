			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: A SEASONED BRONSON STILL PLAYS TO THE HERO IN EVERYMAN  </P> <P> At 68, Charles Bronson is the least flamboyant and the most private of American  box-office leaders. He works almost constantly, although not always in movies  that please him but that do well in foreign markets where, like Clint Eastwood,  he found early stardom.  </P> <P> In his latest film, "Kinjite" (Japanese for "forbidden subjects") he is once  again a damn-the-legalities cop, a crime-hater ready to do what it takes to  mash the criminals. But the film seems, he says, "a little more interesting  than most I've been offered." It is, in that it centers on a clash of cultures  born of the Japanese takeovers of American businesses.  </P> <P> "It's from the point of view of a policeman who never read a business page in  his life," Bronson said at lunch in Malibu a few days ago, "but he can see  what's happening and he's not sure he likes it or understands it."  </P> <P> The film, directed by J. Lee Thompson, is a fairly standard mix of heavy action  and sleazy villains, but it does have quieter, subtler moments when the culture  shock is seen from both sides of the gulf and some violence, at least, is  forestalled.  </P> <P> "I keep looking desperately for scripts that haven't been done dozens of times  before," Bronson says. "I think guys keep writing from what they see on TV,  copying what's already there."  </P> <P> Bronson has had a sort of career within a career with the series of "Death  Wish" films directed by his friend Michael Winner. "He's brazen when he's  working in a street," Bronson says, smiling. "He takes it over and he doesn't  care about complaints. But it's tough shooting with him. He demands three takes  of every shot, and if it's hard running or some other action, it gets to you.  J. Lee only demands two."  </P> <P> "Death Wish" riled many critics with its portrait of a man taking the law into  his own hands and acting as judge and jury, but the films were extremely well  made and, like Eastwood's "Dirty Harry" films, they obviously touched a nerve  in society.  </P> <P> "The audience likes to see the heavies get their comeuppance," says Bronson.  What is also true is that the films appealed to those who feel the heavies  aren't getting sufficient comeuppance from the law. Now, at last, he says, the  series is finished.  </P> <P> It was good casting because Bronson has always been a tough hero rather than a  romantic hero, possibly the only box-office champ who can successfully and  regularly wear a wrap-around mustache.  </P> <P> He can be warmly sympathetic, as he is in the family scenes of "Kinjite." He  can also be ambiguous, creating doubt whether he is the good guy or the bad  guy, as he was in one of his best roles, in the French film "Rider in the Rain"  in 1969. There is always a sense of latent anger and danger underlying his  performances, and it gave him the nickname "Il Brutto" in his European days.  </P> <P> Bronson dislikes discussing his early life, although his is a remarkable  success story. He was the seventh son and ninth child of 15 of a  Lithuanian-Russian coal miner in Pennsylvania, and Bronson did some years of  his own in the mines before he was drafted and became a tail gunner in the  South Pacific.  </P> <P> After the war he went to Philadelphia to study fine arts, got involved with a  theater group and came West to study at the Pasadena Playhouse. He did a  succession of small movie parts and then began to attract significant attention  in "The Magnificent Seven," "The Dirty Dozen" and "The Great Escape." By the  mid-'70s he was a star.  </P> <P> Several of his hits were Westerns, including Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time  in the West," in which he co-starred with Henry Fonda. "I saw it again not long  ago and it holds up," Bronson says. "Slow but good." He sighs. "The Westerns  were popular until they got comic-booked out of existence."  </P> <P> He has two movies yet to do with Cannon Films and, he says, "Plenty of scripts  come in but they're all the same. I can tell within 40 pages -- fewer than  that, sometimes -- whether it's anything worth doing. Few scripts have good  endings anymore. I don't know why that is."  </P> <P> Bronson is more the home-centered man than ever. His wife, Jill Ireland, has  courageously gone public with her continuing struggles with cancer and has a  second book of encouragement for others, "Life Lines," due out this spring.  </P> <P> One son is studying film at Loyola-Marymount, another is an underwater  photographer, a third a musician on tour. One daughter is in pre-med at UCLA, a  second is still at home, which is now in Malibu. The Bronsons also have a 1791  farmhouse in Vermont, where they try to spend the fall and Christmas.  </P> <P> Both places are a very long way from the company mining town of Ehrenfeld, Pa.  </P></p>

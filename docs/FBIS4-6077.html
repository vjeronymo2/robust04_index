			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan's deregulation is likely to become the major  trade topic between Japan and European Union (EU), as well as  between Japan and the United States. With an aim to reduce  trade deficits against Japan, EU has urged the Japanese  Government to positively promote deregulation in various  sectors, particularly in telecommunications, the distribution  system, and three other sectors. It is believed that this issue  will be taken up for discussion at a ministerial-level meeting  of Japan and EU scheduled for this weekend. The Japanese  Government may be asked to take EU's wishes into consideration  when working out the additional package for easing regulations  in late June.    The ministerial-level meeting between Japan and EU will be  held in Tokyo on 22 and 23 April. However, depending on Japan's  political situation, there is a possibility of postponement.    EU urged Japan through diplomatic channels to give priority  to implementing measures for import expansion, promotion of  investment in Japan, and liberalization of the market, as well  as promotion of deregulation in the telecommunications market,  and in the distribution system.    EU plans to indicate details of its request in the bilateral  ministerial-level meeting. A government source said that with  regard to the "telecommunications," EU asks for easing the  regulation on the ratio of foreign companies' investment in  Japanese telecommunications companies (the ratio should be less  than one- third under the present regulation). EU further  requests that business licenses should be issued more freely.    Concerning the "distribution system," EU demands that Large  Retail Stores Law should be reviewed comprehensively so as to  reduce regulations drastically, and that the Fair Trade  Commission should investigate "distribution control" by the  National Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives Associations  (Zenno).    Regarding the "import expansion measures," EU urges adoption  of EU's safety standards for electric appliances in the Japanese  market so that companies of EU nations will not have to apply  for approval based on the Japanese standards before selling  their products in Japan.    The surplus of Japanese exports to EU nations over imports  was about $26 billion in 1993. Although it dropped for the  first time in three years, EU is still dissatisfied, saying the  "surplus is still at a high level." Some EU officials said  "Japan's trade policies are exclusively U.S.-oriented."    EU also shows a critical attitude toward U.S. trade policy.  Some government officials said that if Japan succeeds in  strengthening cooperative ties with EU nations, it will be  advantageous to Japan for checking U.S. hardline attitude toward  it.</p>

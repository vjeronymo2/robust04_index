			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: MGM-Pathe in Orion distribution proposal MGM-Pathe Communications has made a non-binding proposal to Orion Pictures to distribute Orion's unreleased motion pictures and its library products, AP-DJ reports from California. MGM said that it would make an advance under a distribution agreement and provide a line of credit for print and advertising expenses. In addition, MGM said that its proposal contained an option for it to purchase the film assets of Orion. Terms of the MGM proposal were not disclosed. Orion, which last December filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, has 10 films ready for release but has lacked the funds to release them. An agreement with Orion would give MGM-Pathe films to send through its existing distribution pipeline. MGM-Pathe needs additional films to release because its prolonged legal and financial problems have halted production. MGM said that the proposal, if accepted, would effectively benefit MGM's distribution infrastructure and would make the most of the value of the Orion library and also the unreleased motion pictures. MGM-Pathe is principally owned by Credit Lyonnais following the bank's recent foreclosure on MGM's stock.</p>

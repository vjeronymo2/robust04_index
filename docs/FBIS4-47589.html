Korolevich, O.P. Sobeshchuk, A.A. </F> Adarchenko, Clinical Pharmacology Course and Intrahospital  Infection Laboratory at the Minsk Medical Institute; UDC  576.8.088.3:615.28]    [Abstract] The urgency of combatting purulent infection  using various antibacterial preparations and antiseptics which  have a number of advantages over antibiotics and the arbitrary  and empirical manner in which antiseptics are often prescribed  necessitated a comparative study of the antimicrobial activity  of chlorhexidin, decamethoxin, and septonex relative to hospital  strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas  aeruginosa and pathogenic forms of the enterobacteria  species. Sensitivity to antiseptics was measured by diluting the  preparations in a dense nutrient medium and establishing the  minimum inhibiting concentration (MIK) for each strain. An  analysis shows that in therapeutic concentrations, chlorhexidin,  decamethoxin, and septonex inhibit the growth of all hospital  strains of S. aureus and 48-78% of hospital strains  of enterobacteria. Yet all hospital strains of P.  aeruginosa are tolerant to decamethoxin and septonex while  28.0% is tolerant to chlorhexidin. The conclusion is  drawn that  the use of the above antiseptics against hospital infections  should be based on studies of the microorganisms' sensitivity to  these preparations.

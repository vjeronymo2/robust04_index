			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukraine's foreign affairs ministry has received an  oral message from Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The  message notes serious concern over the course of developments in  Crimea. Ukraine's government knows that China maintains a  consistent and clear stance with regard to our state's  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. This  principled stance is outlined in the communique on the  establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries, and  in the Chinese-Ukrainian joint communique signed in 1992.  During a discussion of Sevastopol's independence at a session  of the UN Security Council last year, the Chinese side voted to  support Ukraine's position on the basis of these principles.  "China will always adhere to these principles in its relations  with Ukraine," the message notes.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARSON SUSPECT SEIZED IN $5-MILLION BLAZE;  </P> <P> CRIME: FLAMES DESTROY A CONTROVERSIAL CONDO PROJECT IN PASADENA. A LAID-OFF  CONSTRUCTION WORKER IS ARRESTED AS HE WATCHES INVESTIGATORS FROM ACROSS THE  STREET.  </P> <P> A laid-off construction worker was arrested Thursday in a $5-million arson fire  that destroyed a controversial Pasadena condominium project under construction  and heavily damaged an adjacent townhouse complex, forcing 30 people from their  homes, authorities said.  </P> <P> Timothy Loxson, 26, of South Pasadena was arrested Thursday morning across the  street from the fire scene at Orange Grove and Del Mar boulevards, where he had  been watching arson investigators as they combed the rubble, Pasadena Fire  Chief David Leonard said.  </P> <P> Loxson was booked for investigation of arson and remained in Pasadena City Jail  in lieu of $10,000 bail. The arrest was based on conflicting statements Loxson  made to fire investigators earlier in the day and the fact that he apparently  matched eyewitness descriptions of a man seen running from the condominium  project moments before it erupted in flames at 11:15 p.m. Wednesday, Leonard  said.  </P> <P> The chief said that "the evidence we've collected shows definite signs of  incendiary origin," including "signs of a flammable liquid" detected at the  southeast corner of the half-completed project. He said the complex was the  site of a minor arson blaze last Friday.  </P> <P> Wednesday night's fire spread quickly to an adjacent 20-unit townhouse complex,  destroying five units valued at $650,000 each, authorities said. Two other  units sustained heavy water damage. Thirty residents were displaced, but no one  was injured.  </P> <P> The condominium project -- a three-story, eight-unit complex of $500,000 to  $1-million residences in an exclusive west Pasadena neighborhood dominated by  Victorian homes and stately mansions -- has been controversial from its  inception, according to a former owner of a portion of the project site.  </P> <P> "Residents opposed to it circulated petitions to prevent it from going up,"  said Kathleen Thorne-Thomsen, who sold a corner lot to developers. "They didn't  want to see any other condos going up. They felt it would be a precedent for  changing zoning in the area."  </P> <P> Five months ago, voters passed the city's Growth Management Initiative, which  set an annual ceiling of 250 new residential units citywide. The condominium  project was exempted from the initiative because the property had already been  subdivided, said Colin Lund, a Pasadena city planner.  </P> <P> The project, the product of a business partnership, was being built by the  Construction Group of Los Angeles. Robert Klein, a spokesman for the firm,  would only say, "I have no idea who might have done this."  </P> <P> Many residents reported hearing an explosion moments before flames engulfed the  project and lighted up the night sky.  </P> <P> "I heard an explosion I thought at first was an earthquake," said Robert Martin  Sr., who lives two doors away from the construction site. "I saw a highly  suspicious man running eastward to a car."  </P> <P> Martin said the man entered the car and "took off without his lights on" as a  security guard from nearby Ambassador College vainly gave chase on foot. The  security guard could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Other witnesses reported seeing as many as three men running from the fire.  </P> <P> Among the residents displaced by the fire was Katherine Morris, whose  two-bedroom townhouse was gutted.  </P> <P> "It's gone. There's nothing left," said Morris, surveying the ruins of her  home, which she said contained several original Picasso paintings and pencil  drawings worth "hundreds of thousands of dollars."  </P> <P> In an interview before his arrest, Loxson said he was one of seven construction  workers relieved of their jobs at the construction site last Friday -- the same  day a small arson fire caused $5,000 damage to some stairwells and a wall.  </P> <P> "I heard they tried to start three fires in three stairwells," said Loxson, who  described himself as a carpenter who had worked on the project for six months.  </P> <P> The complex was scheduled for completion sometime in March, he said.  </P> <P> Loxson said he was not very upset about being laid off because his duties were  nearly completed.  </P> <P> "I took it as it is," Loxson said. "Framers are a dime a dozen."  </P> <P> The other workers, however, took it a little harder, Loxson contended.  </P> <P> "They were bummed out. It's Christmas time and they were upset," he said.  </P> <P> One of Loxson's co-workers, Scotty Adelhelm, 24, said authorities were wrong to  suspect that Loxson was involved in the fire.  </P> <P> "He has alibis," Adelhelm said. "He was with us until 6 p.m. drinking beer in  the mountains. He was with his wife and kid after that."  </P> <P> "I don't understand anything that's going on right now," Loxson's wife, Terri,  said, fighting back tears. "He didn't do it. He was home both nights. That's  all I have to say."  </P> <P> As it stands, Loxson is the only suspect, although the investigation is  continuing, authorities said.  </P></p>

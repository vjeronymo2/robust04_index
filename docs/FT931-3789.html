			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Point of dispute REMOTE and ancient, it rises out of the sea, in the shadow of the 1,500 ft peak of Roineval on the south east corner of Harris - a rocky headland like thousands in the Scottish Hebrides. But Lingarabay point is not the same as all the others. Its special qualities mean it might be blown apart, pulverised and sold by the shipload as high grade aggregate in south east England, Germany and the Netherlands. In its place, when all the dust and noise has gone, will be a sea loch more than a mile square, but not a loch like all the others . . . This grand scheme has caused an outcry from environmentalists. Yet it could bring prosperity to the island and alleviate pressures on the environment in the south of England where lobby groups have almost paralysed big mineral working applications. Scotland, with its tradition of industrial extraction, less people and more space, may be a distant location from which to haul material, but royalties instead of Pounds 3.50 a tonne are nearer 10p. Lingarabay is the only large and accessible British deposit of the rock anorthosite, which is especially hard and heavy. Can its removal, and substitution with a sea loch be balanced with prevailing philosophies of land use? The government's commitment to sustainable development of natural resources is in difficulty when the resource is being developed by being deported. But language has been tortured to meet political ends before. The matter of scenery, the Highlands core appeal, presents another teaser. Who is to say the sea loch left behind will not be pretty too? The only superquarry presently operating in the Highlands, at Glensanda on Loch Linnhe, has hollowed out a mountain from behind and inside, leaving main profiles intact. Calnum MacDonald, MP for the Western Isles, thinks most local people would support the quarry plan if the terms were sufficiently generous. But all the expected national conservation bodies oppose the Lingarabay superquarry. the owner of the underlying mineral rights, civil engineer Ian Wilson, presents the superquarry plan as an opportunity not a blight, and a possible saviour of the Outer Isles. He sees the quarry dust from pulverising rocks, not as a silicosis-carrying pollutant, but as a valuable mineral which, mixed with lime, could restore fertility to the island's tired and acid topsoils. Wilson says the quarry would bring jobs in a depopulated area, stop young people emigrating, and fund a local enterprise zone. It would also provide him with a royalty on each tonne, which, with a production forecast of 10m tonnes a year, should not slip out of the equation. d4 What makes this dispute so evocative is the pristine beauty of the site, the dearth of local employment, and the sheer scale of the plans. Financial sweeteners are being proffered to the community council and the mining company has already offered a local concession - no working on the Sabbath. The Western Isles Council, its finances shattered by its investments in BCCI, is considering the application. Coastal superquarries have already been embraced by the regional council's structure plan. The Secretary of State for Scotland has asked that the decision, to be referred to him. With four other coastal superquarries in the Highlands being planned, Lingarabay will be seen as a test-case. Most commercial developments in the Highlands are opposed by retired people or getaway types with no interest in local employment. Take the case of farmed salmon cages disfiguring sea lochs, one white settler (English immigrant) declared the uninterrupted sea-view was 'a right', Which shows, perhaps, how the view colours the viewer.</p>

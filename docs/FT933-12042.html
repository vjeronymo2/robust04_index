			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Newport loses car import contract NEWPORT Docks in south Wales is to lose the contract it has held for nearly 20 years as the import centre for Mitsubishi vehicles. Colt Car Company, the Mitsubishi vehicle importer, is setting up a new centre at Bristol's Royal Portbury Dock at Avonmouth which is capable of handling 11,000 cars and vans a year. Colt said the move was forced by shippers' increased use of ships too big for Newport.</p>

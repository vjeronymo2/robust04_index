			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Dissident's appointment to board ends row at Seafield The row between dissident shareholders and Seafield, the Dublin-based transport and distribution company, came to an end yesterday with the appointment of one of the dissidents to the board. Mr Jonathan Glanz, a solicitor, has become a non-executive director to represent the interests of Fidex International Trust, the offshore trust that holds 18 per cent of Seafield. At an extraordinary meeting last June the dissidents failed to oust Mr Brian Chilver, chief executive, and Mr Richard Hayes, a director. Yesterday Mr Chilver said the two sides had gone through a 'good cooling off period'. 'The appointment of Mr Glanz is a positive move and all shareholders will see it as that,' he said. The row and the subsequent withdrawal from merger talks of Imari, a private Irish transport company seeking a listing, cost the group Pounds 88,000. Nevertheless Seafield reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 220,000 on turnover of Pounds 7.98m for the six months to end-June, compared with losses of Pounds 1.06m on turnover of Pounds 16.9m. The improvement reflected a reduction in interest payable from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 359,000 since disposal of the group's property interests. The group now operates a fleet of 150 lorries and trailers and owns about 1m sq ft of warehousing. Since a distribution contract for Waitrose ended last year the group has increased efficiency and lowered costs, lifting operating profits to Pounds 667,000 (Pounds 505,000). Earnings per share were 0.33p (1.6p losses).</p>

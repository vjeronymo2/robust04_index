			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Pay review bodies report expected RECOMMENDATIONS of the independent pay review bodies are expected to be announced by the prime minister today. The recommendations will not include pay because of the government's ceiling of 1.5 per cent pay increases this year for public sector workers. The doctors and dentists' pay review body decided not to prepare a report, given its reduced remit. A special conference of Nalgo, the local government union, yesterday voted to reject the government's pay ceiling and to ballot its members on a one-day strike on March 18.</p>

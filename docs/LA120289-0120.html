			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER TERESA GETS PACEMAKER, IS 'FINE'  </P> <P> Mother Teresa underwent surgery Friday to receive a pacemaker, and hundreds of  nuns of her Missionaries of Charity prayed for her recovery.  </P> <P> The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who suffered a heart attack in September,  was reported to be resting comfortably after the operation.  </P> <P> "The permanent pacemaker is working fine," said Dr. Rajen Watts, her personal  physician. "Mother Teresa had a mild bout of fever in the afternoon, but now it  is under control. She is under constant observation, but we can say that she is  fine now."  </P> <P> Mother Teresa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work among the  poor, was hospitalized Sept. 5, and suffered a heart attack three days later.  </P></p>

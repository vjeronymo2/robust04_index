			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the </F> Palestinian National Authority, by 'Umar Zaydani; place and date  not given; from the "With The Midday Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Zaydani] It has been reported recently that there  is tension between the judicial apparatus, led by you, and the  Palestinian police, or police officers?    [Abu-Middayn] I really do not know what the source of this  information could be. In fact, cooperation between us is at its  utmost. We hold meetings with the brothers in the security  forces every night, particularly with brother Nasr Yusuf and the  rest of the security officials. In fact, there is full and  comprehensive cooperation because we are approaching a stage in  which law should prevail and the Palestinians must be well  protected.    [Zaydani] There are reports that Tunis and 'Arafat are not  satisfied with Ziyad al-Atrash and Yusuf Nasr and that they will  be replaced?    [Abu-Middayn] I do not know how consultations are understood  as differences. This happens throughout the world. Some people  might have interpretations that are different from others'  interpretations. There is full compliance with the instructions  President 'Arafat gave to the army, which is estimated at  approximately 3,500-4,000 individuals. There are no major  differences. Those who came here are soldiers who carry out the  full orders of the leadership. I am not aware of major  differences, but people would term consultations as differences.  This is new logic and a new understanding of matters.  Thousands of kilometers separate us from the leadership,  therefore there should be consultations, especially since Israel  is monitoring telephones and faxes. Therefore, the leadership  summons all its commanders, or most of the decisionmakers, every  30 days. This is quite natural.    [Zaydani] Does the departure of Ziyad al-Atrash and Yusuf  Nasr for Tunis fall within these consultation?    [Abu-Middayn] I believe so. Even if there are different  interpretations on the ground, President 'Arafat wants to be in  the picture 24 hours a day. So, things cannot always be  discussed over the telephone or in written instructions.  Therefore, it is no more than consultation.    [Zaydani] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, your answers show that  there are differences.    [Abu-Middayn] There are different interpretations, not  differences. The interpretation of the liaison committee was  different from that of the brothers in Tunis regarding the issue  of prisoners and releasing them in Jericho, as well as other  things. Such things should be solved directly between the  president and his soldiers. I believe there is nothing more  than this. All issues are minor things, and I hope they will  always remain so.    [Zaydani] We heard that Yasir 'Arafat is mad at Ziyad  al-Atrash concerning the transfer of prisoners to Jericho?    [Abu-Middayn] It is not anger. 'Arafat had another opinion.  We do not want Jericho to turn into another Marj-al-Zuhur. This  is the main thing. Israel wants to implicate us in this issue  by force. These are not mistakes committed by Ziyad al-Atrash  or others. There are things in the agreements that are still  unclear. We are assessing these issues and trying to explain  them together with the Israeli side each day and each hour. We  will reach solution to these issues, God willing.    [Zaydani] What is the task of 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya who  arrived in Gaza a few days ago?    [Abu-Middayn] 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya participated in the  Cairo talks and he, more than others, is well versed in the  security agreement in particular. Brother al-Yahya arrived to  translate this agreement on the ground with the right formula.  Not everything written on paper was clear. Therefore, brother  'Abd-al-Razzaq al- Yahya understands the spirit of the agreement  more than anybody else. This the task for which he came to  Gaza. It is an important and delicate task.    [Zaydani] The last question, Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, deals  with those who collaborated with the [Israeli] authorities. In  your capacity as the official in charge of the judicial  apparatus in the self-rule areas, are there any instructions to  the Palestinian police regarding those people?    [Abu-Middayn] Regarding this issue, those who continue to  collaborate will find no mercy on our part. There are very  clear orders to arrest and interrogate any person suspected of  collaborating. We will not be lenient in this regard and it  will not be an issue for bargaining with the Israelis, as Mr.  Rabin said: If they pursue the collaborators we will delay the  prisoners. You cannot compare an honest fighter with a  collaborator. Those who were collaborators is a different  issue, but those who continued their collaboration will be  arrested and stand trial. There is no lenience in this regard.  Israel recently activated some cells that it recruited in the  past. This is the nature of Israel. It has espionage  activities in America and Pollard was sentenced to 25 years  imprisonment in America. We will not allow this. We have  military and economic institutions, as well as other  institutions. We will not be lenient toward their security in  any way. Therefore, we say to the Israelis: Keep your hands  off those collaborators. They are your victims. We cannot be  lenient toward this issue and toward those who continue their  collaboration. If they caused heavy damages or the death of a  Palestinian they will receive severe punishment, including a  death sentence. This should be understood by the Israeli side.  We will not be blackmailed on this issue and we will not  succumb to Rabin's instructions. Rabin acts with the brain of a  general, a bone breaker. He should stop this and know that this  is a peace process. He should enjoy good performance and good  intention.    [Zaydani] Will you pardon those who collaborated with the  authorities in the past and stopped it now?    [Abu-Middayn] We are thinking seriously of those who stopped  collaboration and even those who were killed. We will  rehabilitate the children and sons of those who were killed.  There is a plan to absorb the families of those killed into the  society again. We consider them victims. Therefore, it is easy  to resolve the issue of those who stopped their collaboration.  However, we cannot be lenient toward those who continue their  collaboration. We ask the ones who collaborated with the  authorities in the past to report to the security centers and we  will give them guarantees, provided that they stop any  collaboration with the Israeli intelligence organ.    [Zaydani] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the Palestinian  Authority, thank you very much.    [Abu-Middayn] Thank you.</p>

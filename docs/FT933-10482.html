			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Drink sales 'not being undermined' CUSTOMS and Excise officials said yesterday that government figures covering alcoholic drinks and tobacco indicated that cross-Channel shopping was not undermining traditional retailing. Statistics on the release of alcoholic drinks and tobacco by Customs from bonded warehouses showed no significant change in the first three months of the European single market. Customs admitted that the figures were less reliable than usual because of lack of information about imports from the European Community since the formation of the single market. 'We are continuing to monitor the situation,' officials said. Drinks retailers have protested that increased allowances for personal imports of cheaper, duty-paid cigarettes, spirits and beer from continental Europe since January were threatening their business.</p>

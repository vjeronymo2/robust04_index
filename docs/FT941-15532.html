			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Swedish confusion over EU Sir, Hugh Carnegy ('Struggle to square the Arctic circle', January 6), in his review of Swedish attitudes to membership of the European Union, understates the party political dimension of the debate in Sweden. The decline in support for the 'Yes' campaign has taken place primarily among Social Democrat supporters confused by the party leadership's decision to await the outcome of the negotiations before formally campaigning for membership. I, too, have stood in the snow and dark of Arctic farms in Norrbotten and I have no doubt that the European Union will accept the case for continued regional and social subsidies. With the successful conclusion of negotiations on March 1, I have every hope that the Social Democrat party will overcome its tactical coyness and will campaign in public for the membership to which its leaders are privately committed. Tom Spencer, rapporteur on Swedish membership committee on external trade, 97-113 rue Belliard, 1040 - Brussels, Belgium</p>

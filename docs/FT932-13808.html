			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / The Balkan Conflict: Belgrade is hit by economic crossfire - Citizens are bearing the brunt of war and UN sanctions OJANA Popovic, a clerk in a Yugoslav transport company, is struggling to make ends meet on a monthly budget of about Dollars 50 (Pounds 33). After nearly two years of war and 10 months of sanctions, an atmosphere of impending doom grips Belgrade. Worried about the war in Bosnia and the possibility of violence spreading to Serbia, Mrs Popovic complains little about her plummeting standard of living. The Popovic family used to lead a comfortable life. A few years ago, Mrs Popovic and her husband, a retired doctor, thought their two children's future was secure. Mirjana was completing her medical internship and Milan had just graduated from medical school. 'In 1990, I could buy a pair of Italian shoes each month. Now I am still waiting to receive my December wages. At 20,000 dinars, it will be worth less than two dollars on the black market,' says Mirjana. Mrs Popovic says inflation makes it impossible to plan. 'It eats up our earnings. When I get paid, the only thing to do is buy as much food as possible,' she says. Mrs Popovic, like most of her co-workers, uses office hours to scour Belgrade stores for basic items and scarce imported goods. Staple goods are in short supply as producers and grocery stores withhold stocks in a bid to buck government price controls.' 'Before the December elections, each worker was given about 30 kilos of sugar, oil, and flour,' she says, shaking her head at what she sees as electioneering by Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. A network of relatives and friends helps feed her family. Some people rely on relatives abroad, or on farm produce from country cousins. Mirjana and her brother live at home. She says there is little hope she could ever earning enough to rent a flat. 'That is just one of the reasons why so many doctors and engineers are trying to go abroad.' High unemployment and low wages have driven many professionals to queue outside foreign embassies seeking work anywhere outside Serbia. Mirjana was hired as a psychiatrist in an election scheme of the ruling Socialist party  -still technically unemployed, she receives a salary of 40 per cent of the minimum wage, equal to Dollars 30. The Popovics rarely drive any of their three cars. Petrol, rationed at 15 litres per month, is unavailable anyway, except on the black market, where prices continue to rise. City transport lines have been cut because of the oil blockade, causing long waits and crowded buses. 'Everyone has short tempers. I was riding to work, happy to have a seat, when a huge argument erupted among the passengers, jammed in the bus. One man said 'this is what you deserve for voting for Milosevic',' says Mrs Popovic. A sense of uncertainty and hopelessness has taken hold of their lives, says Mrs Popovic, who spoke on condition her real name was not used. The 49-year-old remembers Belgrade after the second world war. 'Bread was rationed at half a kilo per person. But then no one had anything and, together, we all waited for better days. Now we have no prospects.'</p>

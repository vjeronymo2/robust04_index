			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Unions fear worst for Daf vans UNIONS FEAR that Leyland Daf's van production plant in Birmingham will close, although they believe its axle plant in Glasgow and its truck assembly plant in Leyland, Lancashire will be saved. The fears were voiced as the Dutch administrators of Daf, the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, warned that more than half of the jobs at the Dutch and Belgian operations would be eliminated. Mr Louis Deterink and Mr Friso Meeter, the court-appointed administrators, said the jobs would be cut as part of a rescue plan aimed at forming a new limited company - 'New Daf' - comprising the 'core operations' of Daf's Dutch and Belgian medium and heavy duty truck activities. The Dutch administrators said consultations had taken place with Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the joint UK administrative receivers of Daf 'to see if - and if so how - activities in the UK can be absorbed by New Daf.' It is understood that the Leyland plant would be the main candidate for inclusion in New Daf, although probably with a considerable cut in the 2,200 strong workforce. The overall fate of the UK operations with more than 5,500 jobs therefore remains uncertain. The receiver is expected to announce a decision this Friday, and the unions are preparing an intense lobbying campaign over the next few days. Today Leyland Daf shop stewards are to meet Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, and union officials tomorrow are due to have discussions with the receiver. On Thursday union leaders travel to Eindhoven for talks with the main Daf board in the Netherlands. The Birmingham van plant with its 2,000 jobs appears most at risk - Daf was facing an investment of about Pounds 100m to modernise it for a new van range that had been under development with Renault of France. But jobs are also at risk outside the UK. Daf has more than 5,000 employees at Eindhoven in the Netherlands and about 1,500 employees at Westerlo, Belgium, where it assembles cabs and axles. The administrators said they expected the total number of these jobs to be 'at least halved'. The administrators said Daf Finance, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Daf group, would be 'run down and closed'. They did not specify if this included Leyland Daf Finance, its UK subsidiary, which is not in receivership in the UK but which last week closed its five UK regional offices. British union leaders are particularly concerned about the prospect that members losing jobs in Daf's UK operations might receive no redundancy pay. The TGWU general union estimates that - if the company met its redundancy obligations - it would cost Pounds 27m for a complete closure of all the plants. As Leyland Daf is in the hands of the receiver, no company redundancy money will be forthcoming. Workers will be able to receive only state redundancy help after 14 weeks. Daf, which has more than 12,650 jobs mainly in the UK, the Netherlands and in Belgium, was forced to file for protection from its creditors last week after running up losses of more than Fl 800m in the past three years.</p>

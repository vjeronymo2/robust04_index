			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Somalia's children die in the rubble: Appalling suffering is being caused by the collapse of a nation IN the hot and dusty streets of one of Somalia's war-shattered towns, skeletal children close to death feed on grass, roots, and the boiled skin and bones of camels. Some of the most appalling suffering in Somalia's war-fuelled famine, where 4.5m people are in need of food aid, is unfolding in isolated places such as Bardere - a rubble strewn town on the Juga river. It is towns such as this that must receive supplies by air if a massive disaster is to be averted. Ten days ago the United Nations Security Council sanctioned an airlift. So far it has not taken place, although a UN technical team was yesterday preparing to fly to the capital, Mogadishu, to assess its feasibility. Like many towns across Somalia, Bardere, 400km west of Mogadishu, has been completely looted and destroyed by marauding soldiers who ripped roofs, doors and windows off the houses and left the people to starve. Hundreds of people, mostly children under five years old, are dying in Bardere, far from the gaze of the world's media or the reach of aid agencies. With no deliveries of emergency drugs or supplementary and intensive feeding materials, the famine tragedy in Bardere is mostly a hidden one. There are no feeding centres yet and therefore no mass concentration of the hungry and the dying. Instead, children are dying in the bombed-out and pillaged houses of the town and are buried quietly in shallow graves. Aid workers estimate that 80 per cent of Bardere's children under five years old are severely malnourished and that anywhere between 15 to 30 people, mostly children, are dying in the town every day. If their figures are correct that would give Badere one of the highest rates of death by starvation per population in the country. Human skeletons not yet buried mix with the bones and carcases of donkeys and cows in the dusty streets of the town. Outside Bardere itself another 25,000-35,000 people are in an even worse condition, close to death after dissolute bands of gunmen looted their livestock and left them without food or sufficient energy to stagger into the town. 'The ones we see walking here are much better off,' said Ms Brigitte Doppler of the medical charity Doctors Without Borders. 'In these situations many more people just don't have the strength to walk and are dying in their homes.' In Bardere market there is some camel meat, cigarettes and salt. But there is no maize or millet or anything to stave off the worst signs of malnutrition. Fresh leafy millet stalks are sold in bundles to the hungry who can still afford to buy food. Most cannot. Hundreds of emaciated people carrying sacks and looking desperately for food poured into the disused hospital yesterday as aid workers brought the first drugs in to the town in a twin-engined aircraft. Once again the starving Somalis were disappointed and angry that Europeans had come to the town without bringing food. For the last 20 months, Somalia's' civil war has disrupted agriculture and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homesteads. Many have eventually reached Mogadishu after a long trek, resulting in many deaths along the way. In recent days, international aid agencies have stepped up their calls for a huge sea and airlift of aid to Somalia, saying the shattered African nation is a hell on earth that claims hundreds of victims every day. But an airlift alone would not be enough. The Save the Children Fund (SCF), one of only a handful of aid organisations working in Somalia, said the humanitarian crisis there made the Ethiopian famine of the 1980s look like 'small beer', describing it as far worse than the mayhem in former Yugoslavia. The SCF has highlighted security problems in Somalia as a reason for the wariness of the international community to become involved, but the organisation said unless the supplies were increased food would continue to be a commodity worth fighting for. 'People say there can't be food without security, but there will be no security until there is food,' said Mr Don Redding, who witnessed the problems at first hand during a trip to Somalia last April. Amnesty International yesterday described Somalia as a human rights disaster. It called on Somalis to stop fighting and the rest of the world to help relieve the suffering. The International Committee of the Red Cross has warned that 1.5m people could die in Somalia over the next few months. Help may, finally, be close at hand with Bardere's first airlift of food by C-130 Hercules transport planes expected on Saturday. Unicef, the UN children's agency, is planning to fly in 16 tons of food, drugs and shelter material. In the short run that is bound to exacerbate the situation, as thousands of people head for the town once they hear food is there. But in the continuing insecurity of Somalia a big airlift is the only hope of averting the world's worst looming human catastrophe.</p>

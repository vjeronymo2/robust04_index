			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas </F> by Carlos Fernandez, host of the "24 Hours" program, in the  television network's studio in Caracas--live]    [Text] [Fernandez] We are going to be talking with Foreign  Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. We will also talk later  with Pedro Paris Montesinos, Democratic Action president, and  Aldemaro Romero. Let's begin with Foreign Minister Miguel Angel  Burelli Rivas.    There are several topics of current international interest,  which, of course, have repercussions in our country. I would  like to talk first about an important meeting scheduled for 6  May. President Rafael Caldera will be meeting with Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria, who will be the next OAS secretary  general, during that meeting. We do not know if there is a  previously established agenda or if they are going to be talking  about general topics. I believe that due to the close relations  between Colombia and Venezuela, a contact between two presidents  is always important. Welcome, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel  Burelli Rivas. Let's talk about those details.    [Burelli] We invited President Cesar Gaviria to a 6 May  meeting with our president in Caracas. It will be a working  meeting exclusively. It will only take place on 6 May. President  Gaviria will be coming with his entire cabinet.    [Fernandez] That is very good.    [Burelli] Fourteen ministers will be coming; their 14  Venezuelan counterparts will also be present.    [Fernandez] Have there been recent previous meetings between  Colombia and Venezuela in which such a large delegation  participated?    [Burelli] Not of this size. The first experience with these  types of meetings was when I was ambassador to Colombia with  President-elect Carlos Lleras and Venezuelan President Raul  Leoni. I brought President-elect Lleras over with some of the  individuals that were to become his ministers. We held a very  important and pleasant meeting with them at La Casona  [presidential residence], but we have never held such a massive  meeting before.    [Fernandez] This type of meeting is important, because, as  we  all know, the problems between Colombia and Venezuela are not  strictly diplomatic in nature. These problems are not limited  only to the discussions of the delimitation of maritime areas.  It is a succession of problems and difficulties that both  countries must face.    [Burelli] That is true. We are going to hold bilateral and  multilateral talks. We are going to talk about all divine and  human topics, you may say. I want to speak quite frankly. The  topic of vehicle theft, for example, is apparently a commonplace  one; the problem of delimitation is a prominent one. Both are  the alpha and the omega of a long list of well-known topics.  What we need to do is put the topics in order. Both foreign  ministers, both defense ministers, and both ministers in charge  of border affairs will meet in San Cristobal on 29 April to talk  about the agenda both presidents will discuss.    [Fernandez] What fundamental aspects could result from a  meeting of this type when Gaviria's government is about to turn  over power?    [Burelli] The same results that could be achieved with a new  Colombian Government. Colombia has a coherent and continuous  international policy.    [Fernandez] That has not been our case.    [Burelli] Our international policy is starting to be  coherent  and continuous. I would say Venezuela's international policy is  not the best, but it has not been the worst either. We have lost  the things we have lost due to Venezuelan policy.    [Fernandez] If we look at the past, we realize many of the  things we have lost have been our responsibility.    [Burelli] True.    [Fernandez] What fundamental aspects do you think will be  discussed in this open dialogue between Presidents Rafael  Caldera and Cesar Gaviria and the members of both cabinets?    [Burelli] I would say the fundamental topics are: the  delimitation of river basins. It is something that is extremely  important for us, because, as you know, Venezuela is a country  of river mouths. Venezuela's river sources are located in  Colombia. The source of the Orinoco River is in Colombia.    [Fernandez] That is so important that many analysts of the  bilateral situation between Colombia and Venezuela are saying  today the delimitation of maritime areas is less important than  the delimitation of river basins.    [Burelli] Correct. That is many people's opinion. The main  river of Maracaibo Lake is the Catatumbo River, the source of  which is in Colombia. You can see the seriousness and importance  of this topic. We must also talk about the integration that is  taking place between the two countries, integration which is not  the greatest but is certainly the most intense from Alaska to  Patagonia.    Shortly, we are going to be trading products worth an  estimated 2 billion [currency unspecified]. It has allowed  Venezuelan and Colombian industries to successfully market their  products to other countries. Colombia is a country that has a  very important industrial base. It has the most important  thing--an infinite number of mini-industries or family  industries. That constitutes a country's actual wealth. We have  to follow that model with our handicrafts industry and with  family-type industry in the production of goods that can be  exported, something Venezuela has already been doing for the  past few years. That will give us a true wealth.    [Fernandez] Now that you are broaching the economic topic, a  month and a half ago spokesmen of various Colombian industries,  banks, and small- and medium-size industries talked about trade  relations between our two countries. They have many fears, and  Colombian newspapers, EL TIEMPO, EL ESPECTADOR, and others, have  great doubts and questions about our country's economic future.  They, of course, link it to the trade relations that exist  between our two nations.    [Burelli] Some journalists are very pessimistic about what  is  going to happen here. I have already met with some Colombian  journalists who want to see a catastrophe in relations with  Venezuela. It does not happen only with the Colombians. There is  a succession of international spokesmen who are betting  something terrible will happen here; that will not occur.  Venezuela is in no worse shape than any other country of the  world. In this marvelous, gigantic world of disorder in which we  live Venezuela is not the worst of all countries. Look at  Europe, Asia, and Africa, and you will find huge dramas.    [Fernandez] That should not be a consolation for us.    [Burelli] It should not be a consolation, but it should  serve  as an example. In other countries with less self-criticism than  we have here, they are rebuilding their countries. It is each  country's obligation to put its pieces back together after the  collapse of the political empires dispersed them.    [Fernandez] Could these fears mentioned in the Colombian  media, which pick up statements by business association and  private sector spokesmen, be discussed in one way or the other  within this open agenda for the 6 May meeting?    [Burelli] Spokesmen from all sectors will be coming here. We  are going to invite all sectors of Venezuela to meet them, even  though many of them already know each other. The relationship  between Colombia and Venzuela is impressive. It is like a  discovery. Venezuelans suddenly found out that Colombia is a  very important country with which to do business and that they  have to refine their capabilities of negotiation, because  Colombians already have that capability. Colombians have  discovered this is a country that has a great capability for  consumption, where many of its products can be sold. If we, as a  government, would like to interrupt this integration, we could  not do it. Our integration has reached a desirable point. It has  reached the private individual; it has reached a point where  governments and politicians are practically no longer needed.    [Fernandez] Concerning those pessimists who insist on  disrupting the possibility of an expansion of trade relations  between the two countries, could they be successful?    [Burelli] Absolutely not. This trade relationship is no  longer in the hands of any comptroller. Bankers, industrialists,  businessmen, and technological experts are the ones who are  dealing among themselves. When integration began the enemies of  the politicians, the businessmen, thought we the politicians  would ruin their domestic market. The businessmen are now doing  all the work and have forgotten about the politicians; that is  important for integration.    [Fernandez] That is a positive angle despite the ups and  downs; there are conflictive situations, however. We have  already talked about the river basins. On various occasions the  Venezuelan Government and the Foreign Ministry have set clear  guidelines on certain things. We do not know if Colombia has  been reciprocal regarding these things. If we look at the other  border problems we are going to find topics that I imagine will  be discussed in depth.    [Burelli] Any problem between neighbors are the problems of  two neighbors. I used to say we do not have any problem with  Finland. As relations with Colombia intensify, our problems will  intensify, but that is why the governments and the foreign  ministries are there, to solve these kinds of problems. All  ties, all associations, and all communities produce problems of  friction and misunderstanding.    The Andean Integration Court will soon begin operations; it  will settle cases. Businessmen need a court to which to go when  there is a disagreement between them. The European Court, for  example, has an impressive amount of work, because every time a  businessman or an industrialist fails to honor a contract they  resort to this court. We have the Andean Court in Quito, but it  does little work, because we do not have the culture to resort  to this court. The integration that we see as impressive with  Colombia is beginning to occur between Colombia and Ecuador. The  volume of trade will go from 300 million to 800 million  [currency unspecified] between Colombia, which has 32 million  people, and Ecuador, a much smaller country. Tomorrow it will be  between Ecuador and Peru and then between Peru and Colombia.  Little by little these things will be achieved. As integration  intensifies there will be more cases to settle at the Andean  Court.    [Fernandez] That is very important. Now, by contrast, those  pessimistic voices, those that are maintaining extreme and  radical positions in Colombia as well as those here in Venezuela  are always trying to create differences between both countries.  An example of this is a recent article by former Colombian  Foreign Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds who cited a report by an  EL TIEMPO correspondent here who had interviewed you,  [Environment and Natural Renewable Resources] Minister Perez  Lecuna, and [Special] Minister Pompeyo Marquez. Lemos Simmonds  maintains radical and extreme positions toward Venezuela, and in  the end he recommended what he seems to like: war, the  possibility of a confrontation.    How does the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry view this kind of  position, because Mr. Lemos Simmonds bears some weight in  Colombia?    [Burelli] He served as foreign minister.    [Fernandez] Correct.    [Burelli] He is a good writer, but we view his statements  naturally. These are the characteristics and freedoms of  democracy. We view these things....    [Fernandez, interrupting] Such statements are perhaps  responsible for instigating Colombian military officers, much  the same way some extremists brew ideas among Venezuelan  officers.    [Burelli] We have had many Lemos Simmondses here, and we  believe this is normal. We consider this kind of attitude an  encouragement to our activity. They are not the ones, though,  who impose their views. These gentlemen, given they no longer go  to war, are calling for war. It is very easy to call for war  when one does not have to go to war.    [Fernandez] Another important detail of these articles is  the  fact the nomination for OAS secretary general is addressed  again. They suggest Venezuela will now assume a radical position  or attitude, and President Caldera's government maintains a  different position and it will be more belligerent; in sum, the  trumpets of disaster are sounding once more.    [Burelli] You have seen our reaction. I will meet tomorrow  with the Colombian foreign minister, with whom I traveled for  six hours to Sao Paulo recently. About 12 generals of Colombia's  general staff are coming to meet with an equal number of  Venezuelan officers, including the defense minister, to define  the agenda tomorrow. You have seen the preparations for the  reception we will give President Gaviria here and how we have  launched an offensive of friendship. This is what corresponds to  countries with so many and important common interests.    [Fernandez] That is very important. A short while ago you  said there were certain foreign interests abroad trying to sell  a more complex and difficult image than the one we actually  have. There was, at some point, talk of international campaigns  against our country. I would like to hear your comments on this  important topic, an ever present one, because comments and  observations continue among Venezuelan public opinion. This has  had some repercussions and has caused a reaction among people's  opinion. What does the Foreign Ministry make of all these  campaigns? Who is behind the campaigns?    [Burelli] Basically, there are economic interests behind  these campaigns. Competition among certain Venezuelan products  that are entering the markets of industrialized nations has  generated a marked reaction from environmental agencies,  violated human rights, when it is simply a matter of commercial  competition.    In the United States, for instance, Citgo gas stations, many  in number, have prompted the opposing reaction of others. They  have claimed our gasoline needs to be reformulated, because it  causes pollution, but it is not inferior to U.S. gasoline. This  scheme is invented. Industrialized countries are trying to  replace former protectionism, which must come down as a result  of the universal implementation of GATT. They are simply  inventing something new to close the doors on importation of  other products.    [Fernandez] By the way, did Venezuela withdraw its suit  before GATT on the gasoline issue?    [Burelli] It is still pending a resolution. [Words  indistinct] do not think it will be necessary, because the  United States has maintained an attitude of understanding in the  last few days, but we could use this right. There are a series  of arguments, such as the case of tuna and the case of  Orimulsion [boiler fuel made from heavy oil] which caused [words  indistinct] in Europe, where we finally made it. Our products  had been denied access to the European Union, because we were  not a drug-producing country and because we had a high per  capita income.    In the Sao Paulo meeting last week, I had the pleasure of  receiving from the EU the promise Venezuela will be included in  the Andean tariff preference. This will open the European market  for us. Indeed, we also obtained a 2-percent share of the EU's  banana market. We are not yet a banana-producing country, and  the collapse of Banco Latino had a negative impact on big banana  crops in the southern Lake Maracaibo area with which we hoped to  meet our quota, but we must now work to correct the situation.  This will allow us to begin exporting and to take advantage of  our market share, which we could lose if we fail to meet it.    [Fernandez] Now Dr. Burelli, some say there are Venezuelans  abroad who have become spokespersons for these international  campaigns. Some letters written by former ministers in the  Carlos Andres Perez administration were published this weekend  denying that possibility. Based on what the Venezuelan Foreign  Ministry knows, is that assertion true?    [Burelli] Not really. There is the idea that some.....  [pauses] I think they are as patriotic as you and I.    [Fernandez] But we hear everyday--perhaps you hear it more  than I do--that many Venezuelans abroad like to speak ill of  their country. That is very disappointing. In the specific cases  of people who have held important positions, the Foreign  Ministry is obligated to investigate this situation, but so far  nothing has been done.    [Burelli] No, we know what is being said abroad about  Venezuela. We receive reports from all our missions, and we have  not heard of any former ministers speaking ill of our country.  That is mere speculation. We don't think it is significant if a  Venezuelan residing abroad, a Venezuelan without access to  organizations or media sources, criticizes the country.    We have a bad image abroad largely because of what we  project  from here, from what is seen from here.    I have seen live Venezuelan television newscasts abroad in  which 17 out of 17 news stories broadcast portrayed a bad image  of Venezuela. These reports were on local issues that are of no  interest abroad. Those who prepare the newscasts aired abroad  must keep in mind that their audiences are not living in Caracas  slums or in the countryside but in the world, where we are  sending a discouraging message.    What good does it do for the Foreign Ministry and the  Venezuelan Government to try to improve Venezuela's image abroad  to bring investors by saying that this country now has legal  security with clear rules if the television stations, with  larger audiences....    [Fernandez, interrupting] The image of a corrupt country is  projected abroad. Indeed, there are reasons to sell the idea  that this country has had corrupt governments in the past.    [Burelli] Well, that is something different. The daily  insecurity is what is projected abroad. It is overstated as if  there was nothing good in the country, and there are many  positive things in the country.    [Fernandez] Certainly. Many television reporters only send  the worst news abroad and convey the idea that we are crumbling.    [Burelli] Let's be frank. Our own television stations do not  emphasize the message of our country's positive, noble aspects.    [Fernandez] Well, we cannot deny the truth.    [Burelli] But this kind of news reporting cannot continue  indefinitely.    [Fernandez] Of course. We now have some viewer questions for  Dr. Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas. One viewer from Los Naranjos  asks: What is your opinion--this is another matter, but it is  important to address anyway--of the personnel working at the  Foreign Ministry, who, according to your statements to the  media, seem to be underqualified?    [Burelli] The problem is that there are too many employees,  among whom there are some good employees. I am trying to  identify those who are inefficient so I can get rid of them.    [Fernandez] We have another call. Our numbers are 793-1845  and 793-1634. When will the Foreign Ministry help raise the  self-esteem of Venezuelans?    [Burelli] The Foreign Ministry is working to raise the  self-esteem of Venezuelans, not just now but always. Our  diplomats have done their share in an unassuming way, and their  task has been made more complex by the preconceived notion that  the Foreign Ministry is useless. I have said before that the  important causes Venezuela has lost were not lost because of the  Foreign Ministry.    [Fernandez] From Valle Abajo--this is a question that would  have to be answered by other authorities, not the Foreign  Ministry--a viewer asks: The Peruvian Consulate has not  delivered passports for the last four months. Could you take  some action? Can you speak to the Peruvian consul in this  country?    [Burelli] That is not my responsibility.    [Fernandez] From Valencia, a viewer asks: When will a  selective policy of immigration be implemented in Venezuela?    [Burelli] It is currently under way. Commissioner (Jans  Norman) is in Asia right now setting quotas for the number of  emigrants we can receive. He is working so all state governors  can offer facilities to install selected groups of emigrants and  their families in the interior.    [Fernandez] [Words indistinct] what we Venezuelans need are  foreign ministers who do not allow the constant theft of our  land.    [Burelli] No foreign minister allows it; no Foreign Ministry  has allowed it. The Foreign Ministry won the Orinoco River for  Venezuela in 1833 with 300,000 km east, or rather west of the  Orinoco River with half of Guajira. Congress refused to ratify  the treaty just to prevent Santos Michelena, who was the noble  negotiator, from becoming president based that success. That was  when we first began to lose Venezuelan territory. We have to  know history.    [Fernandez] The political ineptness of the last century is  responsible for the controversy in which we are immersed with  Colombia. The last question has to do with the Curacao Branch of  Banco Latino. Legislators Walter Marquez and William Davila  Barrios were here yesterday and urged the Foreign Ministry to  intervene because this is a state to state problem.    [Burelli] I am very fond of Walter Marquez, and his actions  have our full support. He knows it. His is a very noble,  selfless task with a great spirit. We must look at the matter,  however, with a cooler head. We have followed all the steps. The  Netherlands has its laws; banks are autonomous in Curacao. We  must always keep in mind that the Netherlands is the second  largest investor in Venezuela after the United States. It is the  only country that never lost faith in our capabilities. We are  following the procedures as they should be followed. We told the  Curacao Central Bank president that he can hold a news  conference at Foreign Ministry to explain how Banco Latino works  in Curacao, the operations it has conducted, and the measures to  be taken.    [Fernandez] Tomorrow's guest on this program will be the  president of the Central Bank of the Netherlands Antilles.    [Burelli] That is great. I think that is great.    [Fernandez] He is coming from Curacao. Depositors have  complained of the humiliation they suffered in Curacao.  Lawmakers said they were not treated well. We will discuss all  those things. At some point there was mistrust, or some said  there was an armed operation around the assembly.    [Burelli] I watched that program yesterday morning, and I  asked the consul in Curacao to file a report. As a matter of  fact, I found this to be rather odd and worrisome.    [Fernandez] Will the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry intervene  in  this case?    [Burelli] It will intervene by asking our authorities to  inform us of all the investigations that legislators like  Marquez and Davila Barrios are conducting. From a legal  standpoint, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry intervenes when a  body, a court, or the entity with jurisdiction officially asks  us to act. We cannot step in except for providing logistical  support or the assistance of our consul and ambassador to  conduct an investigation and expedite all the necessary  proceedings. Legally, we cannot act and order an extradition or  file a request before a foreign court unless we are asked to do  so by the Venezuelan legal system.    [Fernandez] We thank Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli  Rivas for being with us on "24 Hours" and you for your telephone  calls.</p>

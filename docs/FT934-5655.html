			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Saving in safety The UK chancellor's pledge before the CBI conference to conduct a thorough review of tax on savings might give the pensions industry a stay of execution. The obvious targets for tomorrow's Budget, such as tax-free lump sums on retirement and higher rate relief on pension contributions, can hardly be considered in isolation. For example, restricting relief to the basic rate of income tax only makes sense if taxation of pensions in payment is reformed along similar lines. The drift of policy has been clear since Lord Lawson introduced the cap on pensions contributions in 1989. With the cap indexed to prices rather than earnings - and now frozen altogether - the attraction of pensions vis-a-vis other forms of savings, such as personal equity plans, will gradually diminish. Mr John Maples, former economic secretary to the Treasury, recently proposed the logical extension: pension contributions should be paid out of taxed income but benefits paid tax free, as under a PEP. While that might initially raise Pounds 7bn a year for the exchequer, the chancellor would again be guilty of pre-empting a wider review. The same could be said of another cut in pension funds' tax credit on dividends. The cut to 20 per cent in March was rationalised as bringing the credit in line with the new lowest rate of income tax. Unless Mr Clarke introduces another lower rate, that argument will not wash again. Given the muted response to the last cut, though, the dividend credit may look a soft target. Abolishing it altogether might bring in Pounds 2bn, even allowing for tax relief for companies forced to increase their contributions to top up pension funds as a result.</p>

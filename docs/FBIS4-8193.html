			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of  the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.), Biljana Plavsic, on Monday  said the attacks by NATO planes near the eastern Bosnian Moslem  enclave of Gorazde had killed Serb civilians and that the  "bombing of Serb children used sophisticated laser technology".    At a protest rally organized outside the U.S. Embassy  building in Belgrade by the independent anti-racial association  "White Rose", Plavsic said that at the time when Serbs were  offering lasting peace, the United Nations, instead of sending  observers to Gorazde, sent experts for the guiding of missiles.    The R.S. vice-president said a toll of the NATO air strikes  is yet unknown, but the R.S. leadership is on the ground.    She said it was quite certain that civilians had been killed  because she said bombs had been dropped deep in the R.S.  territory -- on the populated areas.    She said Bosnian Serbs had broken off all contacts with U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    "Nothing is as it had been before the bombing any longer,  and  the Serbian people has a new aggressor before it," she said.    Plavsic announced that further steps to be taken by the Serb  side would be decided on Tuesday, at a meeting of the R.S.  supreme command.    The vice-president of the "White Rose" association, writer  Radomir Smiljanic said the air strikes on Serbs had eventually  unmasked the United Nations, NATO and the Western powers.    By the NATO move yesterday, peace has been undermined, and  the world community has sided with one of the parties to the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Moslems, he said.    The protest was held in front of the U.S. Embassy in  Belgrade, in connection with U.S. NATO planes' air strikes on  Serb positions near the eastern enclave of Gorazde, which were  carried out on Sunday at the request of UNPROFOR.    Although Gorazde should have been demilitarized last spring,  as one of the six Moslem safe areas, it was used as a  starting-point of attacks of 10,000 Moslem troops on Serb  positions around the town.    According to UNPROFOR reports, the fighting around Gorazde  has been provoked by the Moslems. According to Serb military  sources, the Moslem authorities in Sarajevo want to capture more  territory before the resumption of the peace talks mediated by  the international community.</p>

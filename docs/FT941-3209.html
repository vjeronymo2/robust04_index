			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Confusion clouds labour statistics The headline fall in February's seasonally adjusted unemployment total may be good news  - but the detailed statistics published yesterday by the Department of Employment display some confused signals of the strength of the labour market. One pattern which had been noticed during 1993 was that new jobs being created were mostly part-time, and mostly for women. But some of the department's figures appear to show that that trend has reversed. The figures for employees in employment (collected from employers) show that full-time employment rose by 19,000 between September and December, while part-time employment fell by 5,000. However, the Labour Force Survey  - a survey of 60,000 households  - seems to show the opposite. The survey says that, between the summer and the autumn of 1993, part-time employment rose by 90,000, while full-time employment fell by 17,000. Although the statistics cover slightly different periods, the contradiction is apparent. The department's figures also show that, in the last three months of 1993, the main cause of a 15,000 increase in people in employment came from a rise in the self-employed. The number of self-employed rose by 54,000, cancelling out a 52,000 fall in the number of people in employment. An extra 23,000 people were on work-related government training programmes, while 9,000 fewer were employed in the armed forces. The growth in self-employment has been fairly erratic, showing a 75,000 jump between March and June 1993, but being virtually flat in the third quarter of last year. Some caveats also apply to the 38,800 fall  - to 2.75m  - in seasonally adjusted unemployment in February. The employment department has changed the seasonal adjustment for February. Under the old seasonal adjustment, the figures would have shown a fall of just 18,800. The unadjusted total fell by 47,855 to 2.84m. Furthermore, January's unexpected rise in unemployment has been revised upwards, from 15,500 to 19,800. Manufacturing employment continues to fall, recording a 13,000 drop in January. And vacancies at job centres increased by only 400 in February, compared with an average monthly increase of 2,100 over the past six months. Nevertheless, there were several good signs. The number of people joining the unemployment register, at a seasonally adjusted 324,700, was the lowest monthly figure since October 1990. The number of working days lost due to industrial disputes in January was 2,000. Overtime working in the manufacturing sector rose by 0.33m hours to 9.29m hours per week in January, while short-time working fell slightly to 0.25m hours per week. Unemployment fell in all regions in February, for both men and women. East Anglia has the lowest percentage of workforce unemployed, at 7.8 per cent. With the south-west and the north, it has seen the biggest percentage drop since January. The north has the highest percentage of unemployment apart from Northern Ireland, which has 13.2 per cent. The Labour Force Survey shows that 205,000 people were made redundant in the three months before its survey, a fall of 32,000 compared with the summer 1993 survey. The survey continues to show an unemployment figure 57,000 higher than that compiled from benefit claimants. According to the survey 24.9m people were in employment in the autumn of last year.  -----------------------------------------------------            UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN IN ALL REGIONS  ----------------------------------------------------- February, seasonally adjusted  ----------------------------------------------------- 1  Northern Ireland              13.2 per cent 2  North                         11.8 per cent 3  West Midlands                 10.2 per cent 4  North-west                    10.2 per cent 5  Wales                         10.0 per cent 6  Yorks &amp; Humber                 9.9 per cent 7  South-east                     9.6 per cent 8  Scotland                       9.3 per cent 9  South-west                     9.1 per cent 10 East Midlands                  9.1 per cent 11 East Anglia                    7.8 per cent    UK                             9.8 per cent  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of Employment  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

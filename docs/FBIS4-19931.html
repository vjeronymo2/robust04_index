			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the view of FRG Economics Minister  Guenter Rexrodt, the GATT trade agreement, which was concluded  in Marrakesh, is of outstanding importance for Germany as an  export nation. This is a "milestone in trade policy," Rexrodt  said in a government statement delivered in the Bundestag on  Friday [22 April].    Thus, the average customs rate for trade with industrial  goods will decline from 6.3 to 3.9 percent. Particularly  successful is the agreement about the liberalization of  services. Here Germany, as the largest exporter of services,  benefits most since services alone amount to one-quarter of  Germany's overall exports. In this field are working one-third  of the 7 million people employed in exports.    Rexrodt affirmed his intention to bring the GATT follow-up  institute, the World Trade Organization, WTO, to Bonn. However,  Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland are also interested in being the  headquarters of the new international organization. According  to the economics minister, tasks still remaining for  liberalization are the opening up of financial services and  ocean traffic, and a multilateral steel agreement.    On behalf of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Uwe  Jens  stated that the agreement comes more than one year too late.  What is urgently needed is, above all, an active labor market  policy in Germany in order to push ahead with reducing  unemployment and promoting employment.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Unions claim BT is targeting for redundancy UNIONS representing workers at British Telecommunications yesterday claimed the company was introducing a grading system which could be used to target individuals for redundancy. The points system draws upon individual's annual performance assessment, their attendance records and whether or not disciplinary action has been taken against them. Age was to have been a factor but this was dropped by BT after complaints from the National Communications Union and the Society of Telecom Executives. BT, which employs 170,000, down from a peak of 250,000 in 1984, has been shedding jobs for the past five years. It now wants to make an audit of its staff in different operations as part of an exercise to define the shape and skill-mix of its future organisation. Staff in units that need to be slimmed down will be selected, on the basis of the points system, either to remain in their jobs or to transfer to a 're-deployment unit'. It will be staff at the bottom of the scale who will be transferred to the redeployment unit and trained for other vacancies. At present there are 527 managers in this unit with 348 vacancies logged with it. The NCU, the largest union within BT, said it was concerned that the redeployment unit could be seen as a 'dumping ground' with individuals within it vulnerable to being targeted for redundancy. It objected to people being de-selected from their jobs on the basis of what it called 'an arbitrary points system'. BT said that people in the redeployment unit might be offered jobs they did not want to take but they had a choice,as there was a voluntary redundancy package. BT, which at present is locked in talks with the NCU on the points system, said it was committed to the goal of achieving planned reductions in jobs by voluntary means. The company, which wants to shed 15,000 jobs this year and a similar number next year, said it could not make a categorical denial that there would never be any compulsory redundancies. But it said: 'We are doing everything we can to stick with volunteers for redundancy.' Traditionally, British companies have chosen workers for enforced redundancy on the principle that the shortest-serving employees go first. Employers have grown increasingly unhappy with this system, mainly because it gives managers little control over who goes. Considerable numbers in the recession, including National Westminster Bank and Aston Martin, the luxury carmaker, have turned to alternative methods - in particular selection criteria which may draw upon performance, skills, versatility and attendance. Companies are well placed if they have performance appraisal systems in place. Indeed, companies are frequently advised that an indirect benefit of appraisal systems is that they can provide evidence of fairness in redundancy selection.</p>

The Action and Progress [Generation Action  Progres] party was inaugurated at the International House in  Porto-Novo this morning. In his welcome address, the party  chairman, lawyer Yves Edgar Monou, took stock of the country's  33 years of independence which were marked by failure and  success as well as unrest and peace, and this raises questions  and requires sober reflection. According to Monou, Beninese  should stop destroying their own genius and strive for the  consolidation of the current democratic process which they  invented in Africa. The whole Beninese people must change their  mentality and behavior. Let us listen to Lawyer Monou:    [Begin recording] We must change our mentality and make a  new  national and patriotic interest one of our major concerns. From  now on, our daily concern should be how to come together as an  individual and advance, always advance, relentlessly and  (?straight) on the path of progress. We should also strive to  make our youth the true spearhead of our country. In short, we  should draw lessons from past mistakes and resolutely turn to  the future and prove the relevance of the thought of Oscar  Wilde, an English author of the last century, who said that  youth is the only valuable asset.

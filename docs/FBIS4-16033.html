			<p>BFN     [Text] The central executive committee of the Russian  Communist Party distributed a statement among the deputies of  the State Duma Tuesday protesting against NATO's actions in  Bosnia.    "While diplomats of all interested sides are trying to find  a  way out of the Balkan crisis, NATO is openly interfering in the  civil war favoring one of the sides and demonstrating to the  whole world that the nature of this alliance has not changed,"  the statement stipulated.    According to the committee, the bombings of Serb positions  by  NATO planes must serve as a warning for those countries which  welcome Clinton's Partnership for Peace program.    The Russian Communist Party appealed to the State Duma and  the Federation Council to condemn the U.S. and NATO policies  which bring death and destruction to Bosnia and does not  contribute to the establishment of peace in this region.    The statement also contains an appeal to European  parliamentarians meeting in Strasbourg this week to call on  their governments to put an end to NATO's policy of aggression  and seek the establishment of peace in Bosnia by political means.    Russian Communists also demanded that economic and political  sanctions against Yugoslavia be immediately lifted.    In the meantime, the opposition Russian All-People Union  (RAPU) headed by Sergey Baburin sent a statement to Interfax.  The document states that Russia must take a firm stand in the  resolution of the Yugoslav conflict following NATO's bombing  Serb positions near Gorazde.    According to RAPU, Moscow should call a special session of  the U.N. security Council in the wake of the bombings, which it  describes as constituing a breach of stability in Europe.    The union said it was categorically against any unilateral  actions in Yugoslavia and for reasonable consideration of the  interests of Orthodox and Moslem Serbs, with unconditional  respect of the independence, sovereignty and territorial  integrity of Yugoslavia and without attempts to thrust a  decision from outside upon its people.    The Society for Russo-Serb Friendship told Interfax that  activists of the society and a number of national patriotic  movements and representatives of the Serb community picketed the  U.S. embassy in Moscow Tuesday protesting against the bombings.    The society's secretary, Mikhail Kazmin, pointed out that  the  demonstrators harshly condemned the U.S. policy in the Balkans  which had lead to the escalation of the Yugoslav conflict into a  large-scale war and had aggravated tensions both in Europe and  the whole world.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Books: The Sitwell with an inferiority complex - Anthony Curtis on a candid new biography of Sir Sacheverell SACHEVERELL SITWELL: SPLENDOURS AND MISERIES by Sarah Bradford Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 486 pages EDITH SITWELL: COLLECTED POEMS Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 25, 444 pages ALTHOUGH the Sitwell trio were extremely close in childhood, and remained on terms of endearment even when they quarrelled as adults, Sir Sacheverell - he inherited the baronetcy after Osbert's death in 1969 - always suffered from a sense of being up-staged as a writer by his older brother and sister. Therefore, it is somewhat ironic that this biography of Sacheverell, based on family papers not hitherto available, should appear on the same day as a re-issue of the Collected Poems of his sister Edith. The last edition of Sacheverell's Collected Poems was in 1936. Does anyone read any of his poems (he wrote a great many) now? When Philip Larkin came to compile The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century Verse in 1973, he included four poems of Edith's, and one of Osbert's, but none by Sacheverell. Sachie was still at Eton when all three Sitwells sprang to notoriety as poets. This was in Wheels, an anthology edited by Edith in 1916 and designed as a counter-attack on Marsh's Georgian Poetry; Sachie's contribution was a 20-line poem in free verse. During a spell in the army, and an abortive Oxford career at Balliol after the war, he continued to publish poetry in subsequent editions of Wheels and brought out a slim volume of verse of his own, The People's Palace, which was praised by TS Eliot. Sachie and Osbert were then sharing a London flat in Chelsea and were part of a post-war arty set that included Harold Acton, Brian Howard, Siegfried Sassoon, Gerald Berners, Cecil Beaton, Stephen Tennant, Anthony Powell, Raymond Mortimer, Peter Quennell, Arthur Waley and, from a different background, William Walton, whom the Sitwells adopted. It was Edith's poem-sequence 'Facade' that brought this phase to its climax. Sachie suggested it be set to music by Walton and the first private performance, with the poems spoken through megaphones, was given in the brothers' flat on January 24 1922. A vociferous anti-Sitwell backlash from various quarters - notably those of Noel Coward, Geoffrey Grigson and FR Leavis - greeted their antics. It was said the Sitwells' activities belonged to the history not of poetry but of publicity and it was perfectly true that, by their striking appearance and love of battle, they kept modern poetry in the public eye well into world war two. There was, however, a rift within the symbiotic pattern of the trio's stormy relations, both among themselves and with their parents, Lady Ida and the formidable Sir George, that gives this biography its rather sad fascination. Bradford presents us with all the relevant facts about what resembled a large, ugly fissure in an otherwise exquisitely homogeneous marble statue. Her book amplifies greatly the account given by Victoria Glendinning in her life of Edith and that of John Pearson in Facades, an extended gloss on Osbert's magisterial volumes of autobiography, Left Hand, Right Hand. Pearson dealt with the trauma Sachie suffered at Eton during his mother's trial and imprisonment for financial crime. In Sachie's long life, during which he would publish volumes of belles-lettres, connoisseurship and travel writing, there were many more traumas to come. Being the younger son, he was two sets of heartbeats away from not merely the title but, more pertinently, the family's Trust money. Sir George ('Ginger') squandered large sums and was cheated by his financial advisers of lots more. Although extravagant personally, he was always extremely tight-fisted when requested to disburse any funds to his offspring. This fiscal constraint occurred again - as far as Sachie was concerned - when Osbert took over. Bradford, an historian by training - with previous biographies of Cesare Borgia and Disraeli under her belt - keeps us well informed of all the intricate Sitwellian financial wheeling and dealing. Sachie's emotional investments were just as complicated and far-reaching. The great one was Georgia Doble, a Canadian beauty from Montreal whom he married in Paris in 1925. 'Ginger' did open the purse strings for once and bought Weston Hall, Northamptonshire, for the couple; they lived there for the rest of their lives, interrupted by frequent forays abroad. But Georgia was never accepted truly by the family, especially not by Osbert, and the fissure began to widen. In spite of Georgia's many love affairs after marriage, all enumerated dutifully by Bradford, and Sachie's similarly intense extra-curricular passions, the marriage lasted until her death in 1980; the couple remained devoted to each other, more or less. None of the the trio ever really got over childhood. Memories of golden summer days at Renishaw inspired all three Sitwells to put nostalgic pen to paper, as in Edith's celebrated poem, 'Colonel Fantock.' She wrote: 'Dagobert, Peregrine and I were children then . . .' Peregrine's - Sachie's - most cherished childhood memory of the colonel in that poem (or rather as he was in real life, Major AB Brockwell, their tutor) was set down in his autobiographical fantasy All Summer in a Day. Just as memorable to him were the pierrots that used to perform regularly on the sands at Scarborough, then in its heyday as a spa. When grown-up, Sachie became a great authority on Pierrot and the characters of the Italian comedy from which that character derives. Sachie adopted two of them as his and Georgia's private emblems. He wrote beautiful passages on those Harlequin and Columbine figures in porcelain fashioned by such craftsmen as Kandler and Bustelli. These drawing-room objects were described in minute detail with the same infectious lightly-worn erudition he deployed to re-create the towering splendours of Spanish and German baroque in his best-known books. To his dozens of devoted friends, Sachie would seem to have exuded both the pathos and the charm of Harlequin. For Sitwell fans, and for historians of the morals of the great and the good, this book is essential reading. Others may experience longueurs.</p>

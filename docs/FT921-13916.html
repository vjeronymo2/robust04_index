			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Markets: Where to place your trust? - Serious Money Big fleas have little fleas Upon their backs to bite 'em And smaller fleas have littler fleas And so ad infinitem SO IT is with the investment trust industry. Trusts have a parasitical nature - they are, after all, companies that exist solely to invest in other companies. The next level of evolution - trusts that invest solely in other investment trusts - have been around for a while. The industrial branch of the family tree - split capital trusts - rigorously divides such functions as income and capital growth between different classes of shares. Adam Smith would have approved. Someone had to invent the split capital trust that invested in other split capital trusts and, of course, they did. The trust which invests only in trusts which invest in other trusts cannot be far away. The private investor has to wonder whether these ever more complex examples of financial ingenuity are wonderful investments, or carefully crafted illusions. However clever the structures, the success of all of these trusts depends on the underlying health of corporate earnings and dividends. Normally this specifically means UK corporate earnings and dividends since it is only in the UK that dividend streams are high enough to make these structures work. If the profits and dividends of UK companies do not grow through the 1990s, then the investment performance of many of these trusts will be sharply hit. It is not therefore logical for a private investor to shy away from the stock market as 'too risky', only to be lured into a split capital trust on the grounds that it is a 'sure thing'. And the private investor also needs to be careful which class of shares he buys. Take Exmoor Dual Investment Trust, a split capital investment trust that invests in other splits. The three classes of share in Exmoor - ordinary, income and zero preference  -were issued for a combined total of 240p in 1988. Their current combined price is 352p, a return for anyone who bought all three of 46.7 per cent, well ahead of the FT-A All-Share Index over the same period. However, the gains have not been equally distributed. Those who bought the zeroes at 100p have seen the price of their shares rocket to 184p, and those who bought the income shares have also done well, enjoying a rise from 100p to 132p. But the ordinary shares have fallen in price from 40p to 36p over the three years. In general, there has been a popularity shift in favour of zeroes - which have a prior claim on the assets of a trust and are perceived as almost 'risk-free' - and income shares - which are highly attractive when held in a Personal Equity Plan - and away from capital shares - which depend for their return on a trust achieving strong asset growth. Exeter Preferred Capital, a new trust launched this week, will invest in the 'popular' classes of split shares. By investing in a mix of zeroes, yielding around 11.6 per cent and income shares, yielding 15 per cent, the aim is to get a return on Exeter ordinary shares of 13.6 per cent per annum. The vast bulk of this return will be provided in the form of capital growth. There is also a tax twist. Exeter has raised a large part of its capital in the form of a zero coupon debenture. It will make annual provision for the 'interest' element on this debenture (the annual increase in the value of the zero) and claim this as a tax deduction against the investment income it receives. It sounds attractive but could Exeter get it wrong? If there was a general collapse in the stock market, then there would be a risk that the zeroes in which the trust is invested would not be redeemed at par. The income shares which the trust buys will themselves be invested in high-yielding stocks. Such stocks performed well in the 1980s but there is a risk that in the 1990s, they may not be able to produce much in the form of dividend growth. The nature of income shares is also that their price declines towards the end of their life. If dividend growth is slower, and income share prices decline more sharply, than Exeter expects, then the returns to investors might not be as high as 13.6 per cent. That said, the risks ought to be less than would be incurred by investing in a single company or in a geographically specialist trust. Investors should remember, however, that the returns are not guaranteed. The other split capital trust to be launched this week is more traditional. Lloyds Smaller Companies Investment Trust has two classes of shares - dividend and capital - and as its name implies, it is hoping to benefit from a revival in small company shares. After many years of outperformance, small companies slumped in the late 1980s, and the hope is that they will benefit more than their larger brethren when the UK economy recovers. As with last year's M&amp;G Income Trust, investors can only apply for packaged units. For most investors, therefore, the split capital structure is only important to the extent that it helps to prevent the trust from slipping to a discount. With a yield of around 5 per cent, the Lloyds trust will be more suitable for inclusion in most people's PEPs than the Exeter trust, which has a minimal dividend yield. But again, do not dive in just because of the tax savings. A 5 per cent yield on Pounds 6,000 is Pounds 300 a year, which means a maximum tax saving of Pounds 120 for higher rate payers. Investors could lose a lot more in capital than that if share prices decline sharply.</p>

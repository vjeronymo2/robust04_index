			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Good second-half growth boosts Taiwanese bank Hua Nan Commercial Bank, one of Taiwan's three main government-owned banks dominating the local market, posted preliminary pre-tax earnings of NTDollars 6.4bn (USDollars 239m) for the fiscal year ended June 30. This was an increase of 21 per cent from a year earlier. However, analysts cautioned that most of the growth had been in the second half of 1993, while the first half of this year had been stagnant due to slower loan growth and increasing pressure on interest rate spreads. The bank also reported revenues of NTDollars 55.8bn, up 4.9 per cent from 1993. Taiwan's 16 commercial banks set up since 1992 are aggressively expanding, which will make it increasingly difficult for the three state-run commercial banks to build their loan portfolios, analysts said.</p>

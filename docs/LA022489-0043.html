			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> DRIVEN TO OSCAR'S MELTING POT OF CUISINES  </P> <P> What a view from this parking lot: a sprawling sea of light, the Hollywood  Freeway spilling into the Valley. Walk indoors and the entrance to Oscar's  Restaurant is gleaming too, a triumphal alcove of brass and glass.  </P> <P> Great, all great. The question is, would you or I drive all the way up here?  </P> <P> Ordinarily we probably wouldn't. Oscar's is the restaurant in the Registry  Hotel in Universal City and must be all things to all palates, while we who  live in L.A. can target a specific cuisine when we go out to eat.  </P> <P> However, if it happened that we couldn't decide between Californian,  Southwestern, East Asian or Continental, or if we wanted to dine near the  Universal Amphitheatre, Oscar's would be a good bet. It does have some very  good things, like a wonderful appetizer of shrimp fettuccine in a hot and sour  cream sauce or a tortilla soup that is like a tiny bit of enchilada in a whole  lot of gritty, mild brown enchilada sauce.  </P> <P> When it's being a California place, its appetizers have the usual problem of  bitter baby vegetables, particularly the eggplant. On the other hand, the  California entrees are about the best. The roast duck is flavorful and its  passion fruit sauce makes surprising sense. An excellent roast veal chop with  cherry tomatoes and sweet sliced onions becomes a wacky salad in a dashing  sauce that is more or less a whole-seed mustard vinaigrette.  </P> <P> A number of entrees are Southwestern, whether they sound so from the menu  description or not. You expect something Southwestern of grilled swordfish in  orange tequila sauce, with its tortilla chips and three caviars, but the  steamed salmon in rice paper is unexpectedly topped with creamy black bean  sauce and cilantro. And the New York steak, sliced into little rounds Nouvelle  Cuisine style, comes with a tortilla shell full of salsa and both white and  black beans. When some of the black beans escape into the Cabernet sauce, the  effect is of a particularly sophisticated carne asada.  </P> <P> In short, there's a broad range here, from an appetizer of grilled chicken  pieces rolled up in wilted romaine with no sauce, like a half-hearted  compromise between Southeast Asian and Nouvelle, to an unimaginative but  excellent entree of cold shellfish with an herb sauce and a mild, tomato  cocktail sauce.  </P> <P> Desserts are things like a plate of fresh fruit arranged in pretty patterns on  the plate in champagne sabayon sauce or a rather stiff box of delicious bitter  chocolate filled with raspberry mousse. The best is the seemingly least  promising, a crisp pastry shell with a couple of balls of white chocolate ice  cream on a plate coated with what at first seems to be an afterthought of  raspberry jelly, but the wonderful jelly is really the whole point.  </P> <P> There are a lot of nice touches here. When you order fish, they give you a  proper fish knife and fork. A lot of chocolate-dipped strawberries show up  along with the check. And when you order an espresso, they bring you a  full-sized coffee cup of it. If I wanted a fancy sit-down meal in the  neighborhood of the Universal Studio Tour's white shark, this is where I'd go.  </P> <P>  Oscar's, Registry Hotel, 555 Universal Terrace Parkway, Universal City. (818)  506-2500. Open for dinner Monday through Saturday. Full bar. Validated valet  parking. All major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $62 to  $101.  </P> <P> </P></p>

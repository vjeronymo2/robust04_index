			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Fall in legal aid solicitors recorded OPPOSITION to plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal aid work in magistrates' courts increased yesterday when the Law Society published figures showing a sharp fall in the numbers participating in duty-solicitor schemes. In evidence to the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice the society says that on average the number of solicitors taking part in schemes to provide emergency cover at police stations and courts has declined by between a quarter and a half since they were set up in 1986. The number of solicitors taking part in the Cardiff scheme has fallen from 65 in 1986 to 41 today. In Exeter the number has fallen from 45 to 25 and in Norwich from 19 to 1. The society says several schemes are now under severe strain. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, who proposed the standard-fee plan, has said he expects those leaving the scheme to be replaced by young, newly-qualified lawyers. The society says the age profile of duty solicitors does not support this contention. In Birmingham, where statistically the society would expect 16 per cent of those on the duty rotas to be aged between 25 and 29, only 4.5 per cent are in this age band. In addition to the numbers leaving duty schemes, the society says solicitors on 11 of the 120 schemes in England and Wales are taking industrial action by withdrawing from rotas. The society says the schemes were introduced after the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act because the government felt it was right that suspects should have the benefit of legal advice from a solicitor in the police station. It was therefore up to the government to keep the schemes viable. It warns the Lord Chancellor that once solicitors leave duty rotas it will be very difficult to get them back without putting a lot more money into the system. A little more money now might avoid the problem. Lord Mackay has given legal aid lawyers a 3 per cent increase in fees this year. The society says with rising rapidly overheads this amounts to a pay cut of 5 per cent in real terms.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Gillette wins clearance from trade secretary for Pounds 285m Parker Pen bid THE Pounds 285m bid for Parker Pen by Gillette, the US shaving and toiletries manufacturer, was cleared yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry found that the deal would not operate against the public interest. According to the MMC, Parker supplies about half the value of UK sales of refillable pens, while the Waterman and Paper Mate brands, which Gillette already owns, account for a further 7 per cent. The MMC found that any attempt to exploit its position in the retail market would be constrained by numerous competitors and the bargaining power of larger retailers. The MMC was concerned that consumers could be misled by retailers' use of staff deployed by suppliers but not identified as such. Mr Hes-eltine said the Office of Fair Trading would investigate. The proposed Parker acquisition, agreed in September, is still being studied in the US.</p>

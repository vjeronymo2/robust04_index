			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Recession stalks new Gonzalez team: There are doubts the cabinet has the stomach for the fight THE NEW Spanish government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez took office yesterday and was greeted with a degree of scepticism by the financial community. Doubts were cast on its stability and on its willingness to apply measures to curb Spain's worsening recession. Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party (PSOE) failed to win an overall majority in last month's general election, and despite extensive talks with leaders of the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties, the prime minister has failed to persuade either group to join his government as a junior partner. The absence of the nationalist parties, which would have assured Mr Gonzalez of firm parliamentary support, lends a provisional look to the new government. Both groups may change their minds, however, and try to join the cabinet after the 1994 budget is approved following the the summer recess. Mr Gonzalez's new team is built around Mr Narcis Serra, the deputy prime minister in the previous government who is now given the additional responsibility of co-ordinating economic policy. Mr Pedro Solbes, a technocrat and a non-Socialist, has been promoted from the agriculture ministry to run the economy and finance ministry. Neither Mr Serra, a plodding consensus politician, nor Mr Solbes, who has a record as an interventionist in defence of state industry, is viewed as a tough personality willing to take on the challenges of a recession. A senior Madrid corporate lawyer likened the new economic team yesterday to 'an aspirin to cure a cancer'. The difficulties facing the domestic economy have been underlined this week by estimates which put the general budget deficit at 7 per cent of gross domestic product. That is double the figure outlined in Spain's Emu convergence plan and compares with 4.4 per cent last year. Year-on-year GDP rose by 0.5 in the first quarter and growth forecasts for 1993 range between zero and minus 1 per cent. Inflation is nevertheless rising - it was up by 0.4 per cent in June to give an underlying 12 month rate of 5.9 per cent - despite the recession and a steep rise in unemployment. The number of registered jobless rose last month by 35,351, the first June increase for 10 years, and the total number of job seekers now stands at more than 2.5m, representing 16.6 per cent of the working population. Echoing a widely shared view in the financial community, Madrid stockbroker FG forecast that the new government would avoid head-on collisions with the unions, would do little to reduce the budget deficit and would deregulate only under direct pressure from Brussels. The one positive signal to the markets in the new government is the exclusion from the cabinet of the left wing of the PSOE which is championed by the deputy party leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra. This is a second humiliation suffered by the so-called guerristas. Mr Gonzalez has already foisted Mr Carlos Solchaga, the former economy minister and a bitter foe of the leftwing Socialists, on to the PSOE, as the party's leader and chief spokesman in parliament. Mr Gonzalez has retained as foreign minister Mr Javier Solana, who is no friend of Mr Guerra, and he brought into the cabinet minor-ranking social democrats, identified with the moderate wing of the party, as well as a total of six independents, three of them women. It is likely now that the prime minister will continue to wage his war on the left wing by calling a party congress later this year or early in 1994. The guerrista faction, which holds most of the senior positions within the party, has been at the centre of scandals over illicit campaign funds that have severely embarrassed Mr Gonzalez. Should the latter deal a definitive blow to Mr Guerra's camp, and also meet home rule demands made by the nationalists when he draws up next year's budget, the way will be smoothed for the entry of the Basques and Catalans into the cabinet. A broad-based coalition government would have its stability assured over the next four years. Given the more market-orientated policies of both the Basques and the Catalans, such a government would help to boost confidence about the economic policies that Mr Gonzalez may pursue in his fourth term in office.</p>

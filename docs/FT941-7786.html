			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Japanese TV faces shake-up: Readiness to scrap high definition system angers electronics industry Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry shocked the consumer electronics industry yesterday by making clear it was prepared to dump the country's high definition television system, developed over 30 years, in favour of more sophisticated digital technology. The shift makes the establishment of a worldwide digital standard for HDTV increasingly likely. The US is poised to finalise its own digital HDTV standards and is about to begin field tests of the new technology. NHK, the Japanese public broadcasting network, is already broadcasting eight hours of programmes a day in the analogue HDTV format. The Japanese electronics industry has poured huge amounts into developing equipment based on the analogue system. More than 20,000 wide-screen sets have been sold to wholesalers and the public. Mr Akimasa Egawa, director-general of the ministry's broadcasting administration bureau, said yesterday that Japan should consider many possibilities in the context of a global trend towards digital systems. The ministry would make a final decision in July. Japanese broadcast and consumer electronics industry representatives described the move as 'very regrettable' and demanded a retraction. Representatives of the European and US industries welcomed the move. The US, Japan and the European Union plan to adopt the high definition TV system by the late 1990s. The statement from the ministry stunned NHK which developed Japan's high definition TV system, known as Hi-Vision. It said Mr Egawa's remarks 'hinder the progress of Hi-Vision promotion, spoil the efforts hitherto made by the concerned parties, run counter to audience expectation and are thus very regrettable'. The Electronics Industry Association of Japan, representing equipment makers, pointed out that digital TV was still far away from realisation and therefore Mr Egawa's remarks would cause undue confusion in the market. NHK began developing its own HDTV 30 years ago and tried to make it a world standard by encouraging the US and Europe to adopt its system. However, fears that adopting NHK's system would give Japanese consumer electronics makers a significant head start led the EU, under pressure from European consumer electronics makers, to develop its own analogue HDTV system. The US decided to adopt a digital system developed by a US consortium, and has pressed hard recently to establish digital as the world standard for HDTV. Last year the EU decided to ditch its development attempts, and could now move towards adopting a digital system. Tokyo admits backing wrong horse, Page 5 Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

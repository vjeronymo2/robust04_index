			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Publication may be loss leader WHILE the Tories and Labour may be trying to appeal to business, neither has shown much business acumen in the production of its manifesto, Andrew Jack writes. Labour's document, of which 150,000 copies have been printed, is the cheapest to obtain. It costs Pounds 1. But it did not know the printing costs, or how many it needed to sell to break even. The Conservatives sell The Best Future for Britain  - of which there are also 150,000 copies  - for Pounds 1.95, and were equally unsure yesterday about production costs. Changing Britain for Good, the Liberal Democrats' offering at Pounds 1.50, has reached 100,000 copies so far. 'It sells at a price equivalent to a glossy up-market magazine,' said one official, who estimates that it will break even on sales of 70,000. But who will buy them? One of the largest customers is the Civil Service. The Department of Trade and Industry said that it had bought 464 copies of each document for its staff.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> CLATWORTHY OVERCOMES AT ATLAS  </P> <P> Benn Clatworthy, the Los Angeles-based tenor saxophonist from London who has  been earning good airplay with his recent album, led his quartet Saturday at  the Atlas Bar &amp; Grill on Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> Although Clatworthy and pianist Cecilia Coleman are capable composers, the  presence of substitute bass player Ralph Alessi confined them to standard  tunes.  </P> <P> This did not prevent the leader from exhibiting a soaring, Rollins-inspired  style and sound on "Falling in Love With Love" and a lyrical ballad mood on  "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye."  </P> <P> With her crisp accompaniment and fleetly ebullient solo work, Coleman is an  admirable partner. Alessi proved himself a more than able soloist while Kendall  Kay, the drummer from South Africa, showed discretion, working mainly with  brushes.  </P> <P> If the limitations of repertoire were a handicap, this was a piece of cake  compared to the working conditions. The artists were confined to 20-minute  sets; Clatworthy was forbidden to speak, even to introduce the tunes or his  musicians. Between sets the customers, most of whom were clearly there to talk  or eat rather than listen (there was almost no applause, even at the end of the  tunes), seemed content to be offered 40 minutes of schlock music piped over the  P.A. system.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Clatworthy's quartet overcame, at least for those few who paid  attention. It cannot be too long before he graduates to regular work at places  where his impassioned, energetic sound can be more fully appreciated. LEONARD  FEATHER  </P></p>

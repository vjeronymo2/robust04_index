			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HELD IN SERIES OF PURSE THEFTS  </P> <P> A 39-year-old Van Nuys man was being held Tuesday in connection with a series  of purse snatchings in the northeast San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles police  said.  </P> <P> Anthony Douglas Haylock was arrested Monday night in Sylmar after police  watched him get into a stolen car that matched the description of a car used in  at least two purse snatchings, police said.  </P> <P> "He's suspected of several purse snatchings and other crimes," Detective Mike  Wynn said.  </P> <P> Lt. Bernard D. Conine said police have been investigating a series of purse  snatches and thefts from cars in recent weeks in which the victims were  followed by a second vehicle. The driver of the second vehicle jumped from the  car and grabbed a purse or belongings then sped away, police said. On Monday  night officers found a stolen car parked near Hubbard Street and Dronfield  Avenue. After learning that it was similar to a car used in the thefts, the  officers began watching the vehicle. About 9 p.m. Haylock allegedly got into  the vehicle and sped away when officers tried to stop him. The chase ended  several blocks away when Haylock stopped at Desmond Street and Glenoaks  Boulevard.  </P> <P> Haylock was arrested on suspicion of robbery and was being held in lieu of  $15,000 bail at the Foothill Division Jail.  </P> <P> Conine said investigators were attempting to determine how many thefts were  part of the series and if there is evidence that might link Haylock to other  incidents.  </P></p>

Gasanov told IRNA at the airport that the objective of his  visit was to exchange views with Iranian officials on holy  places in Karabakh demolished by Armenian forces.    Gasanov noted that the Armenian forces have strenghtened  their positions in Karabakh and rejected Azeri proposals to  evacuate the occupied areas.    "We are confident that the Armenians are not willing to  solve  the dispute through peaceful means," said the Azeri minister.    Regretting the demolition of holy places, including several  mosques in the occupied territories, Gasanov urged Iran to join  his country in following up the matter in the next summit meet  of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).    Velayati said the commonalities between Iran and Azerbaijan  required exchange of higher level visits at closer intervals.    The belligerent sides as well as the neighboring countries  should take measures to end the regretful war between Azerbaijan  and Armenia, Velayati said.    Following up the letters of understanding signed between the  two sides during President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's trip  to Baku, regional cooperation especially at Caspian Sea as well  as economic coopevation are among topics discussed between  Gasanov and Iranian officials.</p>

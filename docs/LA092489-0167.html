			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER COLORADO QUARTERBACK DIES OF CANCER AT 21  </P> <P> Former University of Colorado quarterback Sal Aunese died of cancer Saturday  night, a week after being admitted to University Hospital. He was 21.  </P> <P> Aunese died shortly before 9 p.m., MDT, hospital spokesman Brad Bawmann said.  </P> <P> Wayne Gersoff, the attending physician, told a news conference called less than  two hours after Aunese's death: "He was a tremendous warrior and put up one of  the greatest fights anyone could imagine. Unfortunately, the fight had to come  to an end."  </P> <P> Aunese's mother and several brothers and sisters were at his bedside shortly  before death. Colorado football Coach Bill McCartney had visited Aunese earlier  in the evening but was not there at the end.  </P> <P> Asked if Aunese, who was from Oceanside, was awake and aware of what was  happening, Gersoff said:  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, yes."  </P> <P> Gersoff said Aunese's condition worsened dramatically Friday night.  </P> <P> "It was really a day-to-day thing," Gersoff said. "At any time he could have  taken a turn for the worse."  </P> <P> Gersoff said Aunese had progressive respiratory difficulty during the day and a  buildup of lung fluids.  </P> <P> "Part of his body was giving out," Gersoff said. "It was a struggle to breathe.  After a time it became too much of a struggle."  </P> <P> Aunese, first diagnosed as having inoperable stomach and lung cancer in March,  was brought to the hospital last Sunday after he began having trouble  breathing. He had been an outpatient.  </P> <P> Last season, Aunese led the Buffaloes to an 8-3 season and set a school record  by throwing 92 passes without an interception. He passed for 1,004 yards and  two touchdowns, and rushed for 397 yards and eight touchdowns.  </P> <P> Memorial services are scheduled on the university's Boulder campus at 1 p.m.  Monday.  </P> <P> Colorado President Gordon Gee and Chancellor Jim Corbridge praised Aunese's  courage and extended sympathy to his family.  </P> <P> "Sal Aunese was an inspiration to his teammates and indeed to all of us during  his courageous fight against the toughest of his opponents," Gee said.  </P> <P> "Sal Aunese was a special young man who fought a brave battle. We are all very  proud that he was one of our students," Corbridge said.  </P> <P> Colorado players had been wearing bands on each arm -- one armband bears  Aunese's name, the other "No. 8," Aunese's jersey number.  </P></p>

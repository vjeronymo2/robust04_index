			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese mining issues gain on Soros tale ANOTHER strong day for the futures market prompted technical buying, and the Nikkei average gained ground on support by public funds and dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei was finally up 192.55 at 19,685.07, after opening at the day's low of 19,501.46 and hitting a high of 19,729.65 in the afternoon. Volume remained almost flat, at 250m shares against 244m. Advances led declines by 868 to 179, with 107 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose for the third consecutive day, climbing 21.69 to 1,584.08. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 4.42 at 1,205.70. The bond market closed higher thanks to the stronger yen, prompting renewed hopes of monetary easing by the Bank of Japan. The dollar closed Y1.97 down at Y108.60, while the yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark bond fell 3.5 basis points to 4.425 per cent. Traders said public fund support limited the downside for the Nikkei, but that the unexpected weakness in the economic recovery had limited the prospects of a rise above the 20,000 level. Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities expects the index to move between 19,300 and 20,000 in the near term. 'Market participants still cannot evaluate the implications of the political upheaval,' he added. Mining issues were popular on rumours that Mr George Soros was once again buying the gold market. Sumitomo Metal Mining was the most active issue of the day, forging ahead Y57 to Y1,030, while Mitsui Mining and Smelting rose Y18 to Y515. The higher yen supported electric power utilities, which gained 2.74 per cent on the day. Tokyo Electric Power put on Y50 at Y3,550. High-technology exporters were lower. Short-covering helped steel issues. Nippon Steel moved up Y6 to Y366 and Sumitomo Metal Y8 to Y330. Uniden, a mobile phone maker, appreciated Y140 to Y3,090 on reports that it had received approval for its mobile phones from the Chinese government. Hosiden, a consumer electronics parts maker, rose Y70 to Y2,040 as investors were encouraged by the US decision to lift the anti-dumping duty on Japanese high performance liquid crystal displays. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 249.56 firmer at 21,773.03 in volume of 26.6m shares. Roundup THE REGION mostly turned easier. Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for public holidays. AUSTRALIA was marginally higher as stronger bullion prices drove golds, taking the sector index up 45.1 to 1,775.0. The All Ordinaries index edged 0.9 ahead to 1,699.7 in heavy turnover of ADollars 412.1m. Placer Pacific appreciated 21 cents to ADollars 2.76. News Corpor-ation moved forward 9 cents to ADollars 7.54 on expectations of strong profits figures for the current financial year. SINGAPORE suffered a wave of selling in nervous afternoon dealings after Wednesday's rebound, and the Straits Times Industrial index fell 20.21, or 1.1 per cent, to 1,770.90. The nervous tone was attributed to reports of heightened tension on the Iran-Iraq border. BANGKOK was also depressed by reports of heightened tension in the Gulf and the SET index weakened 16.25, or 1.8 per cent, to 894.08. Bangkok Bank of Commerce shed Bt2.25 to Bt22.50 and NTS Steel lost Bt2 to Bt53 after the exchange authorities said that trades in the two issues must be settled in cash, instead of the normal policy of half cash and half credit, following recent 'irregular movements'. SEOUL saw continued profit-taking in blue chip manufacturers and financial issues but the market was carried higher by some healthy demand for small and medium-capitalisation shares. The composite index added 0.42 at 762.95. BOMBAY began firmly but the advance was reversed after midsession on rumours that allies of Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's government were planning to withdraw support. The BSE index closed 6.51 down at 2,228.55. KUALA LUMPUR extended its downward correction and the composite index dropped 16.30, or 2.3 per cent, to 701.66, the mood still soured by news that the authorities were investigating alleged trading irregularities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi has warned his supporters that they were heading for  hard times. He was addressing an IFP rally at Ngwelezana just  outside Empangeni in Natal, a day after the IFP's Central  Committee decision that the party is not to take part in the  elections.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Linda van Tilburg] The  Youth  Brigade, his young lions as Dr. Buthelezi calls them, came to  listen to their leaders' message, but his words did not hold  much hope for a peaceful new South Africa.    [Buthelezi in English] I would like to say that sadly -- it  is also a sign of apprehension -- I am forced to warn you that  there are difficult times ahead of us.    [Van Tilburg] Even some of his older supporters, some with  sticks and [word indistinct] in their hands, all gathered with  the young people at the Ngwelezana sport field. Many had been  transported from the nearby Esikhawini township. For those  people who have been living with violence for a long time, he  said they must fight back when IFP members were being attacked.    To the government and the ANC [African National Congress]  Dr.  Buthelezi once again set out the demands for his party's  participation in the election. They asked for recognition of  the king's powers, a double ballot paper, an own tax base for  regions, autonomy of Natal-kwaZulu, and also a federal system.  [end recording]</p>

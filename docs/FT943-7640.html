			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Refocused operation gives Wace a boost - Other Companies The continuing rationalisation and restructuring of Wace, the pre-press and specialist printing group, is expected to show through in tomorrow's results announcement, with first-half profits forecast to jump from Pounds 7m to Pounds 10m. Its refocused UK operations are likely to have made a healthy contribution, although demand remains patchy overseas. Analysts are looking for a big cut in debt, which on bullish estimates may have come down from Pounds 59.2m at the year-end to less than Pounds 30m.</p>

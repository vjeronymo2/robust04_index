			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Virgin set to pull out of Dan-Air rescue NEGOTIATIONS between Mr Richard Branson and Dan-Air are expected to reach a head in the next 48 hours amid signs that another group has emerged as a potential rescuer for the troubled UK independent carrier owned by Davies &amp; Newman. Mr Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways, is understood to have become increasingly reluctant to enter into a Dan-Air rescue operation because the airline's financial situation appears to be far worse than Mr Branson had earlier anticipated. Virgin now seems on the verge of pulling out of a rescue of Dan-Air. Earlier City estimates that the group's pre-tax losses this year would total Pounds 7m-Pounds 10m have now been described as too low. Mr Branson also appears to consider that any rescue of Dan-Air in association with Virgin would require a complete restructuring of the Dan-Air business cutting it back to its profitable core. There has meanwhile been increasing speculation over the weekend that another company has expressed interest in Dan-Air. One suggestion was that British Airways, which ended talks with Dan-Air last month, had decided to take another look at the Gatwick-based carrier. BA said yesterday it never commented on this sort of speculation, but City analysts said it was unlikely the UK flag-carrier would be interested in reviving talks. However, the same analysts suggested that one company possibly interested in forging an alliance with Dan-Air was the German group LTU, which bought the Thomas Cook travel chain last summer. LTU, which is understood to be looking for investment opportunities in Britain, has also been rumoured as a possible white knight in the event of a hostile bid on Owners Abroad, the UK holiday group, from its UK rival Airtours. Dan-Air has also held unsuccessful partnership talks with British Midland, the independent UK carrier in which Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) holds a 40 per cent stake, and Air France.</p>

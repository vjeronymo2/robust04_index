			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Dividend prospects boost shares - A look at the forthcoming electricity results season DIVIDEND increases of over 10 per cent in real terms are expected to loom large in the electricity industry results season which gets under way today. This has provided some fizz to the shares in the last few days. Scottish Power will be the first of the 17 companies to unveil its performance for the year ended March 31. The remainder will be strung out over the next seven weeks, making the power industry something of a results marathon for investors and stock analysts. The focus on dividends is a touchy issue for the regional electricity companies (RECs) and the generators because of the fuss that earlier generous pay-outs have caused. There is also the reaction of Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator to be considered. He has embarked on a wide-ranging review of electricity pricing practices. Previous results seasons have shown that the later a company reports the larger its dividend increase tends to be, as if boldness grows with time. The RECs deny that this is the case. But it is a fact that the three regional companies tipped to make the biggest increases, Yorkshire, Seeboard and Southern, do not report until late June and early July. Among the generating companies, National Power will also be a high payer. PowerGen has already paid its second dividend, showing an overall increase of 14 per cent. The electricity companies will justify their high dividends by pointing to their financial strength and the high level of dividend cover. Analysts at Barclays de Zoete Wedd are estimating average cover for the RECs of 2.8 times, with Manweb as high as 3.5. The background to the results is fairly straightforward. Despite the incipient recovery, overall electricity sales are unlikely to show much change. But this does not mean that the RECs will return a uniform performance. Actual profit growth will be mixed, with increases in single as well as double figures expected. The variations will reflect RECs' success, or lack of it, in the highly competitive non-franchise market, and other variables like bad debts and cost control. They will also report the fortunes of sideline activities such as appliance retailing, which have caused trouble in the past. The big event that occurred in the second half of the industry's financial year was the settlement of the coal crisis. The uncertainty over the volumes and price of electricity to be generated from the new long-term coal contracts between the generators and British Coal has been removed. This creates a framework for a significant part of the industry's long-term business. However, there is still the question of how much additional coal the generators will take from British Coal under the government's recently agreed programme to subsidise more pits. It seems unlikely, though, that either National Power or PowerGen will be willing to make firm commitments quite yet, though the comments of all the electricity companies will be keenly picked over by British Coal. Prof Littlechild is currently engaged on a review of the pricing formula in the electricity supply industry, and he is expected to announce the results in July. But analysts say he is unlikely to tighten the formula because he seems to want to encourage more entrants into this market. More crucial will be the review of the distribution business which he will then embark upon. This accounts for the bulk of the RECs' revenues, and any tightening of the regulatory regime would be reflected in REC profits and, therefore, in the dividends which provide the strongest underpinning to the sector.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATES OF PROFITS AND DIVIDENDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company               Results   Pre-tax*   Change   Dividend   Change                           due      Pds m        %    total p        %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Scottish Power         May 20        290      8.8       11.2     10.1 National Power         May 27        575       15       10.4     14.3 PowerGen               June 7        400       14       10.5     13.5 Hydro-Electric        June 10        143      4.4       11.3     11.2 East Midlands         June 14        155      3.6       19.2     12.3 Manweb                June 15        113     22.2       20.4     11.8 South Wales           June 17         88     20.7         22     13.4 Norweb                June 23        158     25.8       19.8     11.9 South Western         June 24        100     21.5       19.7     13.2 Yorkshire             June 25        152      9.3       20.4     14.9 Northern              June 28        111     12.6         21     13.2 Seeboard              June 29        112     14.7       19.7     14.2 Eastern               June 30        184     28.8       18.9     13.2 Southern               July 1        185      9.1         19     14.1 LEB                    July 2        143      3.6       18.9     12.5 Midlands               July 6        168     16.2       19.4     12.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Year to March 31, 1993 Source: Estimates from SG Warburg Securities.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

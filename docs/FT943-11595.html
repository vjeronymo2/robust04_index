			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Technology: Brains on their minds - Drugs researchers are seeking a stroke treatment that could transform current therapy Ask almost any doctor what drug treatments there are for strokes and they will probably say 'none'. The reason lies in the nature of the condition. A stroke occurs when the brain is damaged due to poor blood circulation. It can happen quickly, even without warning. The brain is damaged within minutes or hours, and all a doctor can do is try to help the patient recover. Stroke victims lose brain functions such as memory, speech or limb co-ordination. As well as their distress and that of their families, the cost to society is vast. About 500,000 people a year suffer from strokes in the US. Only about a third of victims recover sufficient independence to return to previous levels of activity. The rest require years of rehabilitation and nursing. Some are permanently hospitalised. The prospect of earning an enviable reputation and a great deal of money has attracted many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to the area. Success would transform stroke therapy. Today's preventative therapies would be supplemented for the first time with patient treatment. But the condition is complicated. About 85 per cent of strokes are caused by blockages in blood vessels and are called ischaemic strokes. Without oxygen carried by blood, cells die. The remaining 15 per cent of strokes are caused by leakages of blood into the brain - cerebral haemorrhages. The brain is squashed by the extra volume of blood and cells die. Doctors try to identify people who are at a high risk of either kind of stroke and give appropriate preventative drugs. People with a history of artery disease, for example, may be given mild blood-thinning agents such as aspirin to ward off clots. People with high blood pressure have an increased chance of a haemorrhage and can be treated with drugs for high blood pressure. After an ischaemic stroke, victims may be given stronger clot-busting drugs such as streptokinase to try to clear the blockage quickly. In cerebral haemorrhages, blood thinners and clot busters are precisely what must not be administered as they would increase the blood flow to the brain. After the stroke, only risky brain surgery can help. Modern research on drugs that might effectively treat stroke victims begins by analysing the biochemistry of the condition: what chemical events take place between blood flow disruption and cell death? Unfortunately, biochemists cannot yet provide a complete answer. What is understood so far is that when blood is cut off from brain cells, chemicals called excitatory amino acids are released. These bind to receptors on brain cells and open channels into the cell. Through the open channels flow large amounts of calcium and sodium which can kill the cell simply by bursting it. The calcium and sodium are also involved in reactions inside the cell which release poisons such as nitric oxide, highly reactive substances called free radicals and even protein-eating enzymes that can digest the cell from the inside. As if that were not enough, the inflow of calcium is a trigger for the release of more excitatory amino acids and the whole lethal sequence spreads out from the original core of damage. 'There is almost an active progression of damage going on for minutes, even hours, after the stroke,' says John Reid of Glasgow University's department of medicine and therapeutics. Within a few hours, the dead core is surrounded by a larger area of dying cells, he says. So a candidate drug treatment is one that blocks either the release or the action of the excitatory amino acids. The principle is to freeze the process that leads to the death of the cells until normal blood circulation is restored through the action of clot-busting drugs. But the lack of complete biochemical understanding means the practice is more difficult. There is more than one excitatory amino acid, several ways of obstructing each and yet further ways of dealing with their effects. On top of that, interfering with the functioning of brain cells can cause unpleasant side effects such as hallucination. The first drug likely to reach the market is expected to be launched in the next few months. Called Freedox, it was developed by Upjohn of the US. It tackles some of the last stages in the sequence of cell death - for example, by inhibiting the free radicals. Initially it will be licensed for use in haemorrhages only. Further clinical trials are under way in patients with ischaemia and with victims of head and spine injuries that can trigger a similar sequence leading to cell death. At the other end of the biochemical sequence, Wellcome, the UK company, is researching a drug called 619C89 which is designed to prevent the release of the most important of the excitatory amino acids, glutamate. The drug is about to enter further clinical trials and is unlikely to be on the market before the end of the decade. Ciba, the Swiss drugs company, is a little further advanced with its Selfotel drug, which blocks the action of glutamate rather than its production. Selfotel is entering the last and biggest series of trials that must be undertaken for any drug is approved. If all goes well, a product could be on the market in three or four years, says Beatrix Maurice-Schubiger, head of Ciba's central nervous system product management. Unfortunately, Selfotel has side-effects including hallucination, paranoia and confusion. In May, Ciba signed a collaborative deal with California biotechnology company Cocensys to research a second stroke drug. Acea 1021 works by a quite different mechanism, blocking another of the receptors for excitatory amino acids. Maurice-Schubiger says that Acea 1021 is 'about two years behind Selfotel' in the development process. Improving on Selfotel is also a target for Massachusetts biotechnology company Cambridge Neuro-Science. It has a drug called Cerestat which blocks a different receptor for excitatory amino acids. Elkan Gamzu, the company's president, claims that Cerestat is as good as Selfotel but avoids the side-effects. But Cerestat has only just completed initial trials, so even if all goes well a product is unlikely to reach the market until the next decade. Other companies researching the area include the UK's Wellcome and Fisons, Switzerland's Sandoz, France's Synthelabo and US biotechnology companies Alkermes, Guilford, Gensia, Pharmos and Cephalon. In spite of the large amount of research activity, some scientists fear that no one solution will work well. There are at least 22 separate steps in the biochemistry of cell death and it is not known which, if any, could stall the whole process. Drug developers have recently witnessed an unpleasant precedent in the treatment of septic shock. Both stroke and septic shock involve complicated cascades of biochemical events. In septic shock, each of the drugs developed seemed to be effective in blocking part of the cascade, but each so far has failed to prevent the disease progressing. Behind the optimistic words, the industry is aware of this potential problem. Merck of the US, the world's biggest drug company, abandoned work on its candidate stroke drug MK 801. Executives at Upjohn concede that they do not know exactly how Freedox works. Gamzu admits that Cerestat acts on only one of several receptors involved in stroke. Ralph White, central nervous system project manager at Wellcome, sums up the view of many when he says: 'We won't know if a drug really works until we've finished the last clinical trial.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       STROKE TREATMENTS IN RESEARCH  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                Country       Drug                   Launch date  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Upjohn                      US       Freedox                      1994- Ciba               Switzerland       Selfotel                     1997- Alkermes                    US       Calpain inhibitor                ?

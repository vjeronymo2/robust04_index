(Microwave Radios)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board (the Board) by the Port of Houston Authority, grantee of FTZ 84, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the microwave radio manufacturing plant of Microwave Networks, Inc. (MNI), located in Houston, Texas. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on April 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MNI plant is located at 10795 Rockley Road, in Harris County, Houston, Texas. The facility (3.5 acres, 240 employees) is used to manufacture microwave radios for use in cellular and other wireless communication networks (duty rates: 2.4% to 6%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foreign-origin materials used in the manufacturing process (some 70% of total) include: Electronic transformers, multiplexors, antennnas, transmitters/receivers, capacitors, resistors, printed circuits, diodes, transistors, integrated circuits, insulated wire, coaxial cable, flexible RF waveguide and waveguide parts (duty rates: duty-free to 10%). The application indicates that privileged foreign status (19 CFR 146.41) would be elected on all foreign merchandise admitted to the subzone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone procedures would exempt MNI from Customs duty payments on the foreign materials used in export production (90% of output). On domestic sales, MNI would be able to defer Customs duty payments until the finished products leave the plant. Foreign materials and finished products held for export would be eligible for an exemption from certain state and local ad valorem taxes. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve MNI's international competitiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July 15, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period August 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Department of Commerce District Office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1 Allen Center, 500 Dallas, Suite 1160  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Houston, TX 77002. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of the Executive Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Foreign-Trade Zones Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3716, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14th Street &amp; Constitution Avenue NW.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington, DC 20230. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 9, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John J.

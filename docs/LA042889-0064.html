			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGUITO'S GOLD THROWS ONE-HITTER BUT LOSES TO VISTA  </P> <P> It is rare for a pitcher to throw a one-hitter and lose. It is also rare for a  pitcher to strike out three batters in an inning and give up two runs. And is  almost absurd for a high school baseball game to last just an hour and 40  minutes.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for San Dieguito, all three were part of Thursday's 2-0 loss at  home to Vista.  </P> <P> Vista improved to 6-1 in the Palomar League to stay a game behind first-place  Mt. Carmel. San Dieguito dropped to 2-5 in league.  </P> <P> San Dieguito pitcher Jeff Gold (3-5) was the unlucky loser, striking out seven  and walking just two. The only hit he surrendered, a leadoff double in the  third by Vista designated hitter Billy Rounsiter, did not even figure in the  scoring.  </P> <P> "Jeff just pitched a great game," San Dieguito Coach Darold Nogle said. "You  know when you pitch a one-hitter and lose, you're going bad."  </P> <P> Vista's John Land, who was beaten by Mt. Carmel, 8-0, in his last start, threw  a four-hitter and raised his record to 4-1. He struck out five and walked one.  </P> <P> "I kept under control today," Land said. "I kept it low and made them hit it on  the ground."  </P> <P> Just four San Dieguito players hit the ball in the air.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Gold was at his best -- and had his most trouble -- in the first,  when he allowed both runs.  </P> <P> Vista's Scott Collins struck out to lead off but reached on a wild pitch in the  dirt. Collins advanced to third when Brian Fleming's grounder was thrown into  right field by third baseman Chad Newman. Fleming took second.  </P> <P> Vista's Rodney DeLeon drove in the first run with a fly out to right, Fleming  taking third. Fleming then scored on a passed ball by San Dieguito's Nate  Fleck. Land and Ryan Tamburrino struck out to end the inning.  </P> <P> San Dieguito's most severe threat came in the second, three singles. But in  between the first and the second was a double-play ball. In all, San Dieguito  (10-10-1) left five runners on base.  </P> <P> San Dieguito's Justin Machado had two of the Mustangs four hits.  </P> <P> Vista Coach Butch Smith, whose team improved to 14-4-1, didn't seem to mind all  the oddities.  </P> <P> "I'll take them any way I can get them," he said.

A statement by the Central Bank explained that  the action followed a serious deterioration of the financial  conditions of the two banks and a total erosion of their capital  base. The statement said depositors' funds in the banks had  dissipated resulting in their inability to meet their  obligations to depositors and creditors. The liquidation of the  two banks should be handled by the Nigerian Deposit Insurance  Corporation.</p>

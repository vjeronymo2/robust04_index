			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yang Hyong-sop, alternate member of the Political </F> Bureau of the Workers Party of Korea (WPK) Central Committee and  chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), at a joint  meeting of the DPRK Government, political parties, and public  organizations at Pyongyang's People's Hall of Culture on 11  April -- recorded]    [Text] Comrades: At a time when the national unity of a  nation of 70 million is required more urgently than ever before,  today we are holding a joint meeting of the republic's  government, political parties, and public organizations to  discuss practical measures to implement the 10-point program of  great unity of the whole nation for national reunification  personally worked out by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song on  the occasion of the first anniversary of its publication.    Recognizing that this joint meeting has been convened at a  very opportune time, now I am going to present a report "On  Promoting the Indpendent and Peaceful Reunification of the  Country by Thoroughly Implementing the 10-Point Program of the  Great Unity of the Whole Nation for National Reunification,"  presented to the meeting as an agenda item.    As everyone knows, last April, at a grim time when a  dangerous situation--in which a war could have broken out at any  time on the Korean peninsula and in which the nation's supreme  interest might have been infringed upon--was created due to the  anti-republic maneuvers by outside forces and their followers, a  handful of antinational forces, the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song published the 10-point program of the great unity of the  whole nation for national reunification, which he personally  worked out based on his outstanding plan to open the nation's  way of living by turning adversity into prosperity with the  whole nation's united strength. [applause]    The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation,  personally worked out by the great leader and adopted as the  common action program of the nation for the peaceful  reunification at the historic fifth session of the Ninth Supreme  People's Assembly [SPA], brilliantly elucidates a wide road that  can eliminate barriers lying on the road of national  reunification with the nation's independent strength and achieve  peace in the country and its independent and peaceful  reunification.    The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation  clearly elucidates first of all the program's basic ideology for  all of those who are concerned about the nation's destiny to  firmly unite as one nation, transcending the differences in  their residential districts and advocacy of ideology, and to  make characteristic contributions for the country's  reunification and for grandeur and prosperity of a reunified  fatherland. The 10-point program also clearly elucidates the  general goal of great national unity on founding an independent,  peaceful, neutral, and pannational reunified state through great  national unity; the ideological foundation of great national  unity based on the love toward the nation and the spirit of  national independence; and the principle of unity on achieving  the nation's coexistence, coprosperity, and common interests and  on serving everything for the cause of national reunification.    The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation  also extensively presents practical ways for great national  unity, including the matters on suspending all hostile  activities and on achieving mutual trust and unity between the  North and the South; the matter on advancing toward the road of  national reunification together, irrespective of one's advocacy  of an ideology; the matter on protecting all assets belonging to  individuals and groups and effectively utilizing them for  national unity; the matter on achieving mutual understanding and  trust of fellow countrymen and their unity through contacts,  visits, and dialogue; and the matter on highly assessing those  who have contributed to great national unity and to the cause of  national reunification.    The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation  for national reunification is a great encyclopedia for national  unity and the banner of national unity which integrates the  valuable tradition of great national unity established in the  days when the respected and beloved leader founded the  Fatherland Restoration Society [FRS]--an original anti-Japanese  national united front organization--during the anti-Japanese  revolutionary struggle and led the anti-Japanese struggle for  national liberation to victory by propagating the 10-point  program of the FRS. The 10-point program also integrates the  noble struggle experience attained in the struggle for building  a new society and national reunification after the liberation.  [applause]    The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation,  which contains the respected and beloved leader's idea of great  national unity and his noble will for reunification and  patriotism, is the most reasonable and realistic great political  program for national unity and a great charter for national  reunification to which anyone who truly loves the country and  the nation and desires national reunification can consent  because of its thoroughly independent, patriotic, nation-loving,  fair, and just position incorporating all situations. [applause]    The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation  is the noble crystalization of the great, broad politics and  benevolence politics of our leader, who has devoted his entire  life since he set off on the road of the revolution shouldering  the destiny of the country and the nation for the country's  independence and the national growth and prosperity all by  himself and who embraces each fellow countryman with a  boundlessly broad mind, accepting even those who committed  crimes before the nation broadmindedly and generously, and  leading the 70 million people toward reunification with tender  care. [applause]    Truly, that the respected and beloved leader promulgated the  10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for  national reunification and bestowed the great program for  national reunification on the entire fellow countrymen is  another immortal achievement he has made in the glorious history  of the struggle to pioneer the destiny of the country and the  nation with great unity of the nation. It is a political event  which has opened a new chapter of great national unity that must  be recorded in national history as a remarkable event. [applause]    The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation  commanded our nation's full support and consensus as soon as it  was promulgated as it elucidated the ways to overcome the  prevailing crisis and bring a breakthrough in the way of the  nation. It vigorously encouraged and gave a strong impetus to  the forward movement of the entire fellow countrymen toward  national unity and national reunification.    As soon as the great leader's great historic reunification  program was promulgated, the movement to implement the program  was vigorously conducted as a pannational movement in the North,  the South, and overseas, and the yearning of the entire nation  for reunification became more intense than ever. The dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--who devotes his all to bring our  nation a reunified country upholding the noble will of the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song--elucidated specific directions and  ways to vigorously wage the struggle to implement the 10-point  program of the great unity of the whole nation on the basis of  the entire nation. He exercised his wise leadership so that all  the fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas may  unite on a pannational basis and launch themselves into the  national movement to expedite and achieve reunification in the  nineties. [applause]    Under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, we, in the northern half of the republic, have made  every sincere effort to achieve reunification in the 1990's on  united national strength under the uplifted banner of the  10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation.    In April 1993, we sent the text of the 10-point program of  the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification  to the authorities, political parties, public organizations, and  individual personages in South Korea, including the chief  executive [choegodanggukcha], and overseas compatriots, via  international mail or various other means. And, in May 1993, we  proposed an exchange of top-level special envoys of the North  and South out of a single desire to open a road of national  survival with the united efforts of the North and South and have  repeatedly taken momentous measures to implement this proposal.    We also took positive measures last year to hold a  pannational rally, which had taken place every year since 1990,  in Seoul as a festival for the unity of the entire nation, both  in name and in reality. We also opened the door to independent  civilian dialogue [chajusonginnun mingan taehwa] and have made  patient efforts to hold such dialogue.    South Korean people from all walks of life highly extolled  the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation,  describing it as the only banner of great national unity and a  bright lighthouse that lights up the road of reunification, and  are positively participating in the patriotic movement to  implement this program.    The 5 million overseas compatriots residing in the five  continents of the world have also launched the movement to  collect 1 million signatures to implement the 10-point program  of the great unity of the whole nation. They also proposed that  this year be a year of great national unity and are vigorously  waging a struggle for reunification and patriotism.    Revolutionary people of the world greatly supported and  welcomed the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole  nation because of its justness and compelling force. Over 200  party and state leaders of the world have sent us messages or  letters of solidarity to express their firm support for the  10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation.  Furthermore, solidarity organizations in over 100 countries of  the world, including the Asian Regional Committee for Korea's  Reunification and the African Regional Committee for Friendship  and Solidarity With the Korean People, are boldly launching the  movement worldwide to support the 10-point program of the great  unity of the whole nation.    This worldwide solidarity movement launched greatly  encourages our people and vigorously inspires all fellow  countrymen into a struggle for reunification and patriotism.    For the past year since the release of the 10-point program  of the great unity of the whole nation for national  reunification, the historic work of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, compatriots in the North and South and overseas have  been launching a reunification and patriotic movement for  national reconciliation and unity, and the movement to extend  solidarity with our people's struggle for independent, peaceful  reunification has been launched worldwide. This vigorously  demonstrates at home and abroad the justness and vitality of the  10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation. This  also shows that a new phase is being opened for national unity  and fatherland reunification under the wise leadership of the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    On this occasion, when we are discussing practical measures  to achieve reunification in the 1990's based the great unity of  the whole nation, I, with the unanimous loyalty of all fellow  countrymen, respectfully extend the great honor and warmest  thanks to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a peerless  patriot, national hero, and lodestar of the fatherland's  reunification, who released the 10-point program of the great  unity of the whole nation, thus, brightly elucidating the road  toward the fatherland's independent, peaceful reunification, and  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, our nation's destiny and  symbol of the fatherland's reunification, who is leading us to  break through the prevailing difficulties and achieve  reunification in the 1990's on united national strength.  [applause]    Comrades, achieving the great national unity by  implementing the 10-point program of the great unity of the  entire nation for national reunification is a very important  matter related to the life and death of the nation today.    In his 10-point program of the great unity of the whole  nation for national reunification, the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song has taught: The unanimous demands and will of the whole  nation is to achieve national reunification by terminating the  history of division and confrontation which has lasted for  nearly half a century. The whole nation should achieve a great  unity to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of  the fatherland.    The great unity of the whole nation is a basic condition for  the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland.  The reunification we desire is for the whole nation to  harmonize and unite as one.    The 70 million fellow countrymen in the North, South, and  abroad should first unite as one nation in any place and in  whatever work, to consummate the historic cause for the national  reunification, transcending differences in thought [sasang],  ideologies [inyom], and systems.    The country's stern tensions created by outside forces and  their few flunkeyistic and nation-selling follower forces within  the nation require that we take more decisive steps  [kyolchongjok chochilul chwihalgosul yoguhago issupnida] than  ever before to achieve the great unity of the nation.    As is already known, the South Korean authorities, who  finally broke up the exchange of special envoys appointed by the  North-South highest authorities--which had been newly initiated  by our side and carried out amid the great expectations and  interest of the people at home and abroad--are unprecedentedly  kicking up a reckless commotion of confrontation as a shock  brigade of the imperialist reactionaries' anti-socialist and  anti-republic plots and leading our country to the worst  situation of extreme danger [wihomchonmanhan choeagui satae].    Along with the United States, they have already formulated  the so-caled New Operational Plan No. 5027 to invade our  republic and have largely introduced lethal equipment--including  fighter bombers, assault planes, and Patriot missiles--to South  Korea from the United States. They have not only decided to  again resume the provocative Team Spirit joint military  exercise--which they had previously decided not to conduct--but  also have inspired the atmosphere of war [chonjaeng punwigi] at  home and abroad by loudly babbling that they should crush  [apsal] someone by force.    Based on the unreasonable statement issued by the UN  Security  Council president, the South Korean authorities intend to  escalate the commotion of pressure [apryok sodong] against us.  Also, they are going to set a fire on a point of nuclear war by  giving impetus to the nuclear development.    This clearly shows that the South Korean authorities have  canceled the North-South agreement, promising nonaggression;  nullified an agreement on converting the Korean peninsula into a  nuclear-free zone; and pursued only confrontation and war. It  is clear to everyone that when a fuse of nuclear war is ignited  on the Korean peninsula, this will bring ruin to our country, as  well as destroy our nation.    It is now the time for all 70 million fellow countrymen in  the North, South, and abroad to unite as one in order to solve  all problems arising in our nation from the principle of  national independence.    All fellow countrymen in the North, South, and abroad should  unite as one for the sake of national interest; prevent the  disaster of an approaching nuclear war [tagaonun  haekchonjaengui]; remove the wall of division; and open doors  for independent and peaceful reunification.    To make all fellow countrymen in the North, South, and  abroad  firmly unite as one under the 10-point program of the great  unity of the whole nation for national reunification, an arena  for national dialogue reflecting the intention and demands of  the 70 million fellow countrymen should be prepared.    All Korean compatriots should be aware of their lofty sense  of responsibility and duty of being not only the masters who are  responsible for the nation's destiny, but also the persons  directly pioneering the nation's destiny, should confirm through  frank dialogue that they are fellow countrymen who cannot live  divided, and should seek concrete ways to achieve national unity  as one nation, transcending ideologies and systems.    Proceeding from this desire we courteously propose to the  South Korean authorities, political parties, and public  organizations, individual figures, and compatriots overseas that  a national conference be convened in either Pyongyang or Seoul  to seek ways for great unity of the entire nation with the  upcoming 15 August, one year prior to the 50th anniversary of  national liberation, as an occasion. [applause]    The national conference may be in the form of a roundtable  conference in which the authorities, representatives of  political parties and public organizations, and individual  personages in the North and the South and representatives from  the compatriots overseas participate are on an equal footing.  The conference may open-heartedly discuss the matters the whole  nation is interested in, including practical measures to achieve  great unity of the whole nation and the nation's common tasks  which are raised as indispensable requirements in expediting  reunification in the nineties.    Reflecting the desire of the compatriots in the North, the  South, and overseas, I propose to send a letter containing the  proposal for convening a national conference to the authorities,  political parties, public organizations, individual personages  in South Korea and to the compatriots overseas in the name of  this joint meeting.    The letter containing our proposal for convening the  national  conference will, without doubt, evoke active support and  sympathy among the compatriots in the North, the South, and  overseas.    Also, I acknowledge that it is necessary to form a national  conference preparatory committee composed of five delegates each  from the North and South and overseas in order to successfully  convene the national conference.    We think that it would be good to hold the first meeting of  the national conference preparatory committee in Pyongyang or  Seoul in around mid-May.    On this occasion, we demand that the South Korean  authorities  discontinue nuclear war exercises and abandon the international  cooperation system for the sake of the great unity of the whole  nation based on a stand of national independence and, thus,  promote a favorable atmosphere for convening the national  conference.    Our just patriotic cause of achieving the fatherland's  reunification, the historic cause and the nation's earnest  desire, with the great unity of the whole nation is  ever-victorious.    Let us all more vigorously fight to achieve peace in the  country and achieve reunification in the nineties based on the  great unity of the whole nation in hearty response to the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song and under the wise leadership of the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.

The article, authored by Sun Pinghua, former deputy  secretary  general of the China-Japan Friendship Association, points out  that some Japanese non-governmental organizations have been  enthusiastic about China's efforts at afforestation, sand  control and improving rural living conditions.    China now has more than 66.7 million ha of barren hills and  swamps waiting to be greened, and every year large areas of land  are engulfed by sand or threatened by flood, drought, hail or  mud-rock flows.    Without well-planned, long-term and consistent efforts to  improve the environment, China's climate will be affected, as  will the climate of China's neighbor, Japan, Sun states.    Since its establishment in 1984, the Green China Fund has  been making efforts to enhance domestic afforestation and  international cooperation.    Sun says he hopes that Japanese afforestation organizations  can have more contacts with the fund so that Japanese friends  will be able to support China's greening activities.    The cooperation also requires government involvement,  according to Sun. The increased acid rain over Japan have  catched [as received] a growing public attention. Some Japanese  questioned if it was the result of the untreated coal burning of  the Chinese factories.    "To reach the conclusion, proof based on scientific  researches is needed," Sun noted, adding that this also calls  for the cooperation of both sides.    During the past few years academic seminars have been held  between Japanese and Chinese scholars. However, few of them  were related to greening and environmental problems.</p>

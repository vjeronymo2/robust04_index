			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong recovery in higher turnover THE BURDENS laid on the London stock market earlier this week were lifted significantly yesterday and share prices bounced back confidently in good trading volume. The favourable response from Wall Street and the US dollar to President Clinton's State of the Union Message set the stage for a good performance by UK equities. The market was further encouraged by good interim results from Glaxo, relief that two potential rights issue hurdles were cleared, and an acceptable set of data on the UK economy. At best, the market was 38.1 up on the Footsie scale, but gains were trimmed in the second half of the session when Wall Street lost part of its early gain to show an advance of 17 points on the Dow Average as London closed. The final reading on the FT-SE 100 Index showed a 23.7 rise at 2,837.7. Blue chip stocks opened strongly as the US dollar steadied and London noted with relief Wall Street's firmness overnight following President Clinton's speech. Trading results from Glaxo were significantly better than some market fears and the stock market caught the hint from the boardroom that no rights issue or major acquisition was in the pipeline. Another of the rights issue threats overhanging equities was soothed when Kingfisher, the UK retail store, confirmed its Pounds 1.1bn merger with Darty, the leading French electrical retailer, but called for only Pounds 313m from shareholders, much less than had been feared when the deal was first mooted three weeks ago. The disclosure that unemployment in the UK had indeed risen above 3m, to 10.6 per cent of the workforce in January, had been well foreseen in the City of London and had little effect on share prices. More encouraging was the increase of Pounds 2.1bn in UK bank lending last month, although strategists agreed that this should not be regarded as conclusive evidence of increased economic activity. Heavy turnover in Glaxo made up about 3.6 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 637.2m shares. Stocks in the pharmaceutical group had been depressed ahead of the profits statement. However, some analysts refused to shed their doubts on Glaxo's longer term outlook, and the shares ended well under the day's best levels. The focus on the blue chip stocks yesterday was reflected in a slight fall in trading among non-Footsie shares, which made up just under 60 per cent of the day's Seaq total. However, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index climbed by 22.9 to 3,040.3. On Wednesday, Seaq volume of 618.6m shares was worth Pounds 1.2bn in retail worth. Good results in the merchant banking sector brought gains among the financial stocks. The market's conviction that domestic interest rates will be cut again at Budget time, now only a few weeks away, helped shares in building, construction and property companies. The stock market has now effectively recovered the ground lost at the beginning of the week when Wall Street fell sharply as it reacted to the first hints of President Clinton's taxation plans. The Footsie 2,800 area appears to have established itself as a support level and traders now hope to see the market move up towards the 2,900 mark again as it awaits the Budget speech from the UK chancellor of the exchequer.</p>

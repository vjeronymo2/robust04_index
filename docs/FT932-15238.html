			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Money Markets: Futures tightly traded SEVERAL small pieces of positive economic news failed to break through the post-holiday lethargy yesterday and both the money and financial futures markets generated scant enthusiasm, writes Peter John. An announcement that the French upper-limit emergency lending rate was to be cut by two percentage points to 10 per cent prompted some buying of Pibor futures. However, dealers soon appreciated that the rate was so far out of line with the overnight lending rate that the cut made little difference. In spite of an optimistic statement from Mr Edmond Alphandery, the new economics minister, predicting further interest rate falls, the contract for June delivery settled unchanged at 91.81 on low turnover. The news from France gave heart to some of the perennial optimists banking on the Bundesbank to produce a rate cut with more substance than what has been described as the 'salami-slicing' of recent months. The Euromark contract for June was bought up three basis points to a high of 92.91 but the sceptics prevailed and it settled slightly down on the day. Finally, in the UK, a stronger pound combined with economic data to signal that underlying inflationary pressures might remain distant for some time. However neither pointer was strong enough to take short sterling anywhere but the doldrums and the June contract settled three basis points lower at 92.84 on desultory turnover of less than 10,000 contracts. Dealing in the money markets was also gentle with an end to the large shortages forecast last week. The Bank of England forecast an early shortage of Pounds 250m, later revised to around Pounds 350m, of which Pounds 215m was taken up. German call money firmed to 8.25/30 per cent, up sharply from Thursday's 8.10/20 per cent as tax payments drained liquidity from the banking system. Traders said they expected the Bundesbank to relieve the upward pressure by allocating DM78bn to DM84bn marks in this week's repo tender, thus adding DM4bn to DM10bn in funds to the market. They see the minimum allocated rate easing to 8.10 per cent from 8.13 per cent. Reserves on deposit with the Bundesbank rose to DM60.1bn from DM56.3bn on Monday, bringing the average to DM56.8bn for the first six days of April.</p>

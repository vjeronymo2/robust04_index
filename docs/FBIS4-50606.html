			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang has  decided to join hands with South Korean companies in buying  banks in Indonesia in line with the government's "southern  strategy," Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the KMT [Kuomintang]  Business Management Committee, said Saturday [14 May].    "We will seek to buy existing banks run by Chinese in  Indonesia and establish leasing companies to provide financial  support for the Taiwan businesses there," Liu said.    Taiwan-invested businesses in Indonesia mostly rely on  foreign banks and the Jakarta office of the China Trust  Commercial Bank for loans.    Liu, during his visit to Jakarta in April, approached  several  leading conglomerates with the plan and reached a preliminary  agreement with a South Korean bank in May.    Liu also said that in addition to Indonesia, the KMT is also  planning to buy a bank in Hong Kong before the colony's transfer  to Mainland China in 1997.    He said that the plan to run banks and other financial  businesses is only part of the party's "all-out" overseas  investment policy. Manufacturing and trading industries, he  added, will follow.</p>

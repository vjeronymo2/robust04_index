			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER;  </P> <P> PRESS HIT FOR SEEKING ATTORNEY DONATIONS  </P> <P> Bill Press, one of the apparent front-runners in the race for the Democratic  nomination for insurance commissioner, came under attack Tuesday for soliciting  thousands of dollars of campaign contributions from attorneys who advertise  heavily for clients with accident claims against insurance companies.  </P> <P> Ray Bourhis, another Democrat in the race and an attorney himself, raised  questions about a fund-raising reception Press will hold next Tuesday at the  San Francisco home of Arnold Laub, one of the biggest advertisers of litigation  services. The invitation lists 65 trial lawyers, some of them important  advertisers in lucrative auto accident litigation, as supporting Press.  </P> <P> Bourhis also said he has been told that the Los Angeles telephone solicitation  firm of Gordon &amp; Schwenkmeyer, which he said has traditionally been a big  fund raiser for the California Trial Lawyers Assn., has in recent days assisted  trial lawyers active in the auto accident litigation business in raising  $100,000 for Press.  </P> <P> Bourhis said that such big advertising attorneys as Laub, Larry H. Parker of  Long Beach and Michael Scranton of Pleasant Hill are "famous for profiting from  this business" and have "vested interests in the state Insurance Department."  It is not right for Press, he said, to take contributions from them or use them  to raise money for him if he hopes to be an independent commissioner.  </P> <P> Press' campaign manager, Michael J. Ganley, said, "It's sheer hypocrisy for  Bourhis to accuse Press of taking money from people he's begging from himself."  He suggested that Bourhis "is just upset he's raised so little support from his  peers."  </P> <P> "I hope we're raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from all of our donors,"  Ganley added. "We're up against a millionaire politician (Democratic state Sen.  John Garamendi) who's received a half-a-million-dollar bank loan, and we're  receiving donations from our friends."  </P> <P> Attorney Scranton said he was surprised by Bourhis' statements because he had  also given Bourhis a contribution.  </P> <P> "Yes, I am a lawyer, and yes, I advertise, and yes, I contribute to Bill  Press," Scranton said. "I think these accusations are insane and sour grapes  for Ray Bourhis."  </P> <P> Bourhis, however, insisted that he is not seeking to raise money from the big  advertising attorneys and said he will return Scranton's $1,000 contribution.  </P> <P> "I try to distinguish between people who are part of the problem and people who  are part of the solution," Bourhis said. "Those attorneys pursuing product  liability cases, consumer complaints against unfair insurer practices,  representing women and minorities, these are attorneys trying to do a good job  representing people.  </P> <P> "But to the advertisers, it's a business, and some of these firms are nothing  more than accident claims mills, closely associated with teams of doctors and  chiropractors."  </P> <P> Laub, host of next week's fund-raising reception for Press, joined Scranton in  accusing Bourhis of "sour grapes."  </P> <P> "If he says personal injury attorneys should not get involved in the  commissioner's race, then why is he running?" he asked of Bourhis. "He should  withdraw himself. We obviously have a right to be involved in behalf of a  candidate we like."  </P> <P> Parker, credited in a recent Press contribution report with raising money for  him, was not available for comment. Mike Gordon, president of the Gordon &amp;  Schwenkmeyer firm, declined to comment on the firm's role.  </P></p>

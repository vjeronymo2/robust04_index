			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Abbey National sees gloomy year ahead FURIOUS trading in Abbey National shares followed a gloomy forecast by the banking group's chairman, Sir Christopher Tugendhat. The volume of transactions for the day, at 12m, was the highest since the company was launched in July 1989. Having risen before the annual meeting, shares ended down 11 1/2 p for the day at 299 1/2 p. Sir Christopher said: '1992 is proving to be a difficult year for Abbey National. During the first quarter there has been a significant increase in the level of inquiries from prospective house purchasers, but the political uncertainties have put a brake on turning those inquiries into confirmed business. Arrears and repossessions are at a higher level than expected and this in turn will mean a higher level of provisioning.' Abbey's chief executive, Mr Peter Birch, had made a more positive assessment last month. 'I think we are over the worst in the housing market,' he said. Analysts disagreed on whether the market made a realistic reaction. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, described the move as a 'thinly veiled profits warning', but added that the statement had not affected his own profits forecast for the year, which remains at Pounds 635m, compared with Pounds 618m last year. However, some analysts are considering downgrading their forecasts from the Pounds 650m level to around Pounds 620m. Mr Chris Ellerton, analyst at SG Warburg, suspected the reaction was overdone. He said the housing market had been widely forecast as a chief victim of a hung parliament, and that the stock might have been 'a little carried away' during post-election euphoria. Stormy scenes punctuated the meeting, which was attended by around 1,400 shareholders. One shareholder attempted to move a motion not to increase the final dividend, and to divert the money saved to mortgage rescue schemes. Several shareholders complained about poor service or underperforming accounts from the Abbey, and there was also an attack on its life assurance questionnaires, which ask if applicants have been tested for the Aids disease, but do not ask about smoking.

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index tests the 2,900 hurdle THE UK stock market's success in foreseeing yesterday's cut in German interest rates was marred by disappointment that the Bundesbank's discount rate was reduced by only one quarter of a point. The London market just managed to break through the Footsie 2,900 hurdle following the news from Germany but the 26.3 point gain was then wiped out by heavy profit-taking pressures, reflected in at least three large trading programmes at the market close. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index down 7.9 on the day at 2,865.9, while Seaq trading volume was one of the highest daily totals since what the market has re-christened 'Golden Wednesday' - when Britain quit the ERM network. Equities were very firm early in the session but were hesitant in challenging the Footsie 2,900 barrier even after the Bundesbank's announcement that it would, after all, hold a press conference, virtually confirmed hints in London on Wednesday of powerful international political pressure for a cut in German rates. The speed of the turnaround in share prices later emphasised the somewhat speculative nature of the previous buying pressure. The downturn was led from the stock index futures sector, where the March contract on the FT-SE Index fell to a discount against the underlying blue chip sector. However, it seemed that the big UK investment houses were still bullish of the stock market and that yesterday's downturn could be safely ascribed to profit-taking; last night, the Footsie was still around 30 points up on its close on Tuesday night, ahead of the latest bout of interest rate speculation. A strong opening to the new Wall Street session, with the Dow Industrial Average 18 up in early trade, helped sentiment in London at the close. One programme trade by a UK investment bank was believed to be a massive switch away from the blue chips which have stood out this week and into the underperforming second line issues. Another, from a large US investment banking house, involved heavy purchases of utility stocks. The programme deals came very late in the day and delayed, as well as boosting, the final Seaq volume figures for the session. Seaq volume bounded to 949m shares, with the non-Footsie share total again lagging slightly at around 58 per cent of the total. The shakeout in share prices fell mainly on the bank shares, which have been rising strongly this week. But some other interest-related stocks, notably in the property sector but also among construction, contracting and building materials stocks, continued to move ahead. The leading oil stocks also extended recent gains as US investors continued to buy them ahead of next week's meeting of the Opec ministers, when the market expects producers to confirm production cuts. Sterling's firmness at the end of the day served to underpin expectations of another reduction in UK base rates, although the more cautious analysts do not expect a move before Budget day, early in March. With attention on currencies now returned to normal, at least for the present, the stock market resumed its search for the next rights issue candidates.</p>

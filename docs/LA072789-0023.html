			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: AN INTERNATIONAL PURSUIT TO LEARN COLLECTION'S VALUE  </P> <P> Question: During her lifetime, my mother amassed a small collection of coins.  Many of them are from foreign countries, including France, Germany, Cuba,  Ghana, Canada, some of the Scandinavian countries as well as the United  Kingdom. What is the best way to determine their value?  </P> <P> There are also American coins, pennies and nickels. The oldest coin is an 1876  French franc, followed by an American nickel dated 1893, and then a 1907 Indian  head penny from the United States. There is also a sales tax token from Kansas  and a 1915 Cuban viente centavo.  </P> <P> I have no idea of their value or the value of the rest of the coins. Will you  advise me on how to proceed? -- S.M.  </P> <P> Answer: It's a good idea to have a general idea of what your coins are worth  before you try to sell them. You can make a major project out of this or treat  it rather casually, depending upon your dedication. Practically, however, you  can do a little research and satisfy your curiosity and get an approximation,  but only a hands-on inspection by a professional numismatist will give you an  accurate evaluation.  </P> <P> To begin, there are several price guides available. For foreign coins, there's  the "Standard Catalogue of World Coins" by Krause and Mishler and/or the Simon  &amp; Schuster "World Coin Catalogue" by Gunter Schon. For American coins,  there's "A Guide Book of United States Coins" by R. S. Yeoman plus numerous  pocket-type guides.  </P> <P> Because condition is a key element in pricing coins, you will have to determine  whether the coins are circulated or uncirculated. The less wear, the greater  the value. After you've priced your coins, you're liable to discover that  they're worth considerably less than you'd anticipated. The 1893 nickel, for  example, is one of more than 13 million minted that year. It catalogues for  $3.50 in good condition (a very low grade), but you'd be hard-pressed to get $1  from a dealer.  </P> <P> Which is the next step: finding a dealer who will purchase your coins. Don't  sell until you are satisfied you have received a fair offer. Check with more  than one dealer; opinions and prices can vary widely.  </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> A new theme design featuring kangaroos will appear on the 1989 proof Australian  Nugget legal tender gold coins. The design (pictured) will replace the  three-year proof issue depicting 12 Australian gold nugget discoveries. Only  8,000 full sets will be minted with five coins in each set: a 1 ounce, half  ounce, quarter ounce, 1/10th ounce and 1/20th ounce. This is the first time a  1/20th-ounce piece will be issued. For information, write to GoldCorp  Australia, P.O. Box 711, Cooperstown, N.Y. 13326.  </P> <P> The Collection of Nelson Page Aspen is featured in the five-session sale Aug.  9-12 in conjunction with the American Numismatic Assn. Convention at the Vista  International Hotel in Pittsburgh, Pa. More than 4,600 lots are featured,  including a rare proof 1839 Gobrecht dollar. Catalogues are $15 from Auctions  by Bowers &amp; Merena, Box 1224, Wolfeboro, N.H. 03894; telephone (603)  569-5095.  </P> <P> More than 3,000 coins are featured in a mail bid sale closing Aug. 23 featuring  selections from the Amon G. Carter Jr. collection and from a Long Island  collection of foreign coins. Catalogues for the Ancient and Modern Coins of the  World and the United States sale are available from Coin Galleries, a division  of Stack's, 123 W. 57th St., New York, N.Y. 10019; telephone (212) 582-5955.  </P> <P> Coin Update  </P> <P> The recent column that mentioned the 1989 no-mint mark quarter drew a negative  response from Dennis Baker, editor of the Coin Dealer Newsletter, the respected  numismatic pricing journal. Baker says contrary to other numismatic  publications, which claim the error coin is worth about $3, some dealers are  actually offering about $60 for the 25-cent piece. True values of course  ultimately are settled in the marketplace. Still, the Coin Dealer Newsletter is  the guide used by most dealers to determine day-to-day pricing. It is published  weekly, $89 for a one-year subscription, from Coin Dealer Newsletter, P.O. Box  11099, Torrance, Calif. 90510.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alpert cannot answer mail personally but will respond to numismatic questions  of general interest in this column. Do not telephone.

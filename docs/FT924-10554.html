			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / GM loses Dollars 753m in third quarter GENERAL MOTORS, whose chairman resigned this week amid boardroom disapproval of the group's financial performance, yesterday reported a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 753m (Pounds 461.9m) and warned that the rest of the year could remain difficult. However, the company insisted it was 'even more determined' to continue to shake up its loss-making North American operations, involving lower costs, improved efficiency and a better product line. Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman who set the restructuring in motion last December, resigned on Monday after strong pressure from non-executive directors who argued that he had not pushed sufficiently for change in the world's largest manufacturing company. He will remain in the post until at least Monday, when the GM board is expected to name Mr John Smale, leader of the non-executive directors, as chairman and Mr John Smith, president, as the chief executive. Yesterday's losses, equivalent to Dollars 1.37 a share, were better than the loss of Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 1.88 a share, a year ago. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 29.4bn, up from Dollars 28.9bn. The figures met Wall Street expectations and GM shares closed unchanged at Dollars 31 3/8 . Analysts said a large fourth-quarter loss was also likely, while speculation persisted that Monday's board meeting might consider a dividend cut. The company said GM's international motor operations remained profitable and saw better earnings than in the third quarter of last year. US results were affected by continued market weakness and production cuts, due partly to a rash of strikes. GM's share of the US vehicle market dipped from 34.5 per cent in the third quarter last year to 33.3 per cent, but this partly reflected the group's decision to focus less on highly subsidised sales to fleet car buyers. The company said the fourth quarter could remain difficult if the US economy did not show signs of more rapid improvement, but aggressive cost-cutting activities were being intensified. The results were bolstered by Dollars 624m of net income from GM's three non-motor automotive businesses - Electronic Data Systems, GM Hughes Electronics and General Motors Acceptance, Corporation, its finance arm. For the nine months the group reported a net loss of Dollars 970.7m, or Dollars 2.11 a share, on sales and revenues of Dollars 86.7bn, after taking a Dollars 749m restructuring charge at Hughes. That compared with net losses of Dollars 1.98bn, or Dollars 3.72 a share, a year ago, on sales of Dollars 78.7bn. Serious surgery, Page 28</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (6): Hybrid deal seen as a less risky option - Problems associated with pure buy-ins have deterred backers MANAGEMENT buy-ins, which involve an outside management team moving in to take control of a company, have proved more difficult than many people first thought. Their place is increasingly being taken by 'bimbos' - buy-ins/management buy-outs - which involve a combination of outsiders and the existing management. With a risk profile closer to that of a start-up than a buy-out, buy-ins in their purest form are now only attempted when the financiers are convinced the deal will work. 'We are not keen on pure buy-ins because the risk is high,' says Mr Hugh Mumford, managing director of Electra Kingsway. Special factors, as well as a belief in the new managers, often play a role. Mr Mumford says his decision to back a buy-in at Gower Furniture was influenced by the fact that he knew the business well, having had an investment in the company for the previous seven years. This shift towards hybrid deals undoubtedly contributed to an increase in the share held by buy-ins in the total buy-out market in the first six months of this year. Buy-ins accounted for nearly 24 per cent of the number of buy-out/buy-in deals compared with just 18.5 per cent in the first half of 1991, according to Nottingham University's Centre for Management Buy-Our Research. Most of the buy-ins carried out in the first half of 1992 were of family-owned businesses with the second most common vendors being public companies divesting themselves of divisions or subsidiaries. Buy-ins of large listed groups, a feature of the late 1980s, have fallen out of favour. In September, Continuous Stationery, which includes the Prontaprint copying chain, was taken private in a Pounds 6.8m deal by its existing management. Although the deal was predominantly a buy-out, the incumbent managers brought in an outsider with experience of general management and finance as part-time executive chairman. 3i, the largest buy-in (and buy-out) backer in terms of deal numbers, took a hard look at its buy-in portfolio two years ago to analyse the features which made for success. 'We had the choice of saying that buy-ins were too difficult and pulling out or of marketing them more aggressively and giving the managers more back-up,' says Mr Patrick Dunne, who heads 3i's buy-in programme. 3i decided to stay in the buy-in business but has had to commit considerable resources to making sure that the deals work. It subjects would-be buy-in managers to a tough selection process and devotes training sessions to getting to know them. The result has been an increase in the number of buy-ins/bimbos carried out by 3i from 31, in the year ended March, 1991 to 55, in the year ended March 1992. But whereas in the late 1980s only 10 per cent of deals were accounted for by bimbos, by 1992 this had risen to 50 per cent. The attraction of the buy-in is that it broadens the range of managers available to carry out a deal, particularly if the existing management lacks the ability or the range of skills required to run an independent business. The problem has been in matching outside managers with a business with which they are not familiar. 'Skeletons in the cupboard' emerged as one of the most frequent problems encountered by incoming managers according to Nottingham University. When 3i reviewed its buy-in programme it identified a number of factors which made for success in a buy-in/bimbo. They were: The more senior the incoming management team, the greater the chance of success. Managing director experience was preferable. Given a choice of backing someone with experience of the sector or someone with managing director experience, the latter was a safer bet. Backing someone with experience of having previously turned round another business. Combining incoming managers with some of the existing management - staging a bimbo - and ensuring both acquired equity in the business. Giving incoming managers experience of working in the business beforehand. Buy-ins are also best avoided when the business concerned is itself a candidate for 'turnaround' treatment, says Mr Ian Forrest, managing director of Montagu Private Equity (formerly Midland Montagu Ventures). Combining a buy-in with a corporate rescue increases the risk of failure, he says. Buy-ins may be difficult to stage but this is unlikely to act as a deterrent to managers seeking independence. If anything, the supply of senior executives keen to run their own business seems set to increase. Managers in their mid-40s are aware that their next promotion may be their last. Recession and the removal by large corporations of middle tiers of management have brought forward the retirement age for many executives. Managers aware of how vulnerable their jobs are, often see the attraction of running their own business, Mr Dunne says. At present most buy-ins are initiated by the managers themselves. They put together a team comprising people they know from their own industry and identify the target company or division they would like to acquire. But buy-ins, as opposed to buy-outs, create greater opportunities for the financier to play a role in shaping the deal. 'We have had more involvement lately in crafting teams and in plugging gaps,' says Mr Gordon Bonnyman, managing director of Charterhouse Development Capital. This trend has been strengthened by an increasing desire on the part of vendors to approach financial groups directly to see if they are willing to make a bid. The advantage of this approach for the vendor is that it shortens the sometimes drawn-out process of establishing whether funding will be available. This does not mean, however, that the financiers are taking over complete responsibility for the deal as is the case in the US. 'I don't see the US model developing here,' says Mr Bonnyman. 'We would not buy a company over the head of the management.'  ------------------------------------------- MANAGEMENT BUY-INS OVER POUNDS 10m  ------------------------------------------- Under 25m  ------------------------------------------- 1985 Cullens                   (10) 1986 Acal                      (10) 1987 Life Sciences Int         (11) New Scotland Ins          (15) 1988 Burn Stewart              (13) Autoclenz                 (13) Clairmont                 (14) European Brands           (21) 1989 Range Valley              (11) Abacus                    (11) Maison Caurette           (11) Haigh Castle              (12) Severn                    (13) Country Casuals           (14) Valor Stoves              (14) British Air Ferries       (15) Hill Leigh                (15) Exide Batteries           (16) Britannia Data Mgt        (18) Service Tec               (20) Themes Int                (22) Rubatex                   (22) Hamleys                   (24) 1990 Wilcox                    (10) Fairmead                  (10) Anglian Fast Foods        (10) Juliana Sound             (11) E.

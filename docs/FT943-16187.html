			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Romania uplifted by win over Argentina The Romanians are looking for more World Cup scalps. And they say they have prepared themselves carefully enough to go further in the competition, following their 3-2 win against Argentina that eliminated the two-time world champions. The victory put Romania into the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time and triggered intense excitement in Romania and in the US. The match was greeted as the high point of the World Cup finals so far. 'This was our greatest performance ever,' said Ilie Dumitrescu, who scored two goals against Argentina. 'We eliminated one of the best teams in the world.' In Bucharest, tens of thousands of people appeared on the streets in celebrations reminiscent of those in the winter of 1989, after the downfall of Romania's Communist regime. Head coach Anghel Iordanescu said that the win against Argentina was Romania's 'greatest joy since the revolution.' Four years ago Romania lost to Ireland in the World Cup second round on penalty kicks. Against Sweden in the next round, the Romanians will be even stronger with the return of striker Florin Raducioiu, who had to sit out the game against Argentina because of suspension. Romania were seen as underdogs before the tournament started. But they have won three of their games (Colombia, the US and Argentina). Only Switzerland (now eliminated) have beaten them - 4-1 in the first round. Brazil, who did not over-impress against the US on Monday, winning only 1-0, will have their work cut out if they bump into the Romanians next week.</p>

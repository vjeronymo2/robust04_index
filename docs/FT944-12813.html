			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Where Packard Bell has the PC edge - Why the Californian company has been so successful in the multimedia revolution While the battle between International Business Machines and Compaq for leadership of the personal computer business has been hogging the limelight, a hitherto little - known player is threatening to upstage the giants of the multimedia industry. Packard Bell Electronics, a privately-held Californian PC manufacturer which sells exclusively to home users through retail outlets, crept past IBM in the first six months of this year to take third place, after Compaq and Apple Computer, in the US PC market, and is now fourth  - after Compaq, Apple and IBM - in the worldwide market. Its projected 1994 sales are Dollars 2.5bn and should be close to Dollars 3bn next year, says Beny Alagem, its chief executive. The significance of that rate of progress should not be under-estimated. Compaq, Apple and IBM are the 'premier league' PC makers, pioneers of the industry and owners of the most prestigious brand names in the business. But who goes out purposely to buy a Packard Bell? Packard Bell Electronics was founded in 1926 as a radio manufacturer and has no connection to Hewlett Packard, the US electronics giant, or to the Bell telecommunications companies. Nevertheless, it seems to have got two elements of the multimedia revolution right. First, multimedia services are likely to be delivered to the home through PCs rather than TV sets. A report this week on multimedia in European homes from the research company Inteco notes: 'One of the most striking conclusions to be thrown up is that the PC rather than the TV set will be the likely focus for multimedia services in the home. . . a whole range of multimedia-related equipment and activities are concentrated in the same type of households, and PC buying is concentrated in these same busy households.' This year, as many computers will be sold for use in the home in the US as for use in business. Packard Bell has a 41 per cent share of mass retail sales in the US, ahead of IBM (13 per cent) and Apple (9 per cent). The implication is that in the US, at any rate, multimedia services are more likely than not to be delivered to the home on Packard Bell machines. The company's own corporate goals include 'making the PC the centrepiece of the home', 'implementing the most efficient manufacturing model in the industry so every one can afford a PC' and 'having at least one Packard Bell PC in every home'. Second, ease of use and maintenance is a critical factor in the home market. Even IBM has been forced to this conclusion. 'The PC industry has done a brilliant job of innovation and technology,' said G Richard Thoman, head of IBM's PC operations, last month, when introducing a new, simplified PC range. 'But in the process we have lost touch with the majority of customers who are all dazed and confused by the complexity in the technology, the array of choices, and the level of support.' Packard Bell claims to have been the first manufacturer to sell systems complete with a hard disc and pre-loaded software, and the first manufacturer to build in a CD-Rom drive, creating a multimedia packaged system. It also claims to be the first PC manufacturer to introduce on-site maintenance to the home. It calls its latest family of systems 'home appliances'. Packaged in a single cabinet is a multimedia PC which doubles as a compact disc player, a stereo system, a TV and video player, a telephone-answering system and facsimile machine, complete with modem for attachment to the telephone network. All this for between Pounds 1,499 and Pounds 1,999. The Packard Bell machines are designed to look good in the home. But more important is Navigator software developed by Packard Bell to make using its computers easier. Navigator is based on pictures and operates by interacting with Windows, Microsoft's graphical interface. Beny Alagem makes it clear, however, that although users need never go into Windows, Navigator is not a replacement for the Microsoft product. There are various ways to use Navigator. One method starts with a view of a hallway with rooms leading off it. As the cursor is passed over the doorways, the rooms are illuminated as if a light has been turned on. The rooms represent the learning centre full of tutorials and demonstrations; the workspace, a management system for applications and documents; a software area for all the programs available; and a suite of games called Kidspace. Next year the company will offer special software that makes it simple for home users to log on to the Internet, the world's largest computer network. Before its leap into the top tier of PC makers, Packard Bell attracted attention through a deal last year with Groupe Bull, the French government-owned computer manufacturer struggling to return to profitability after several years of losses. The French company took a 20 per cent stake in Packard Bell to seal an accord through which the US company would have access to Bull's PC technology, while Bull would have the benefit of Packard Bell's experience in selling in volume through low-cost retail channels (Groupe Bull's PC arm, Zenith Data Systems, was a pioneer in portable computing). According to Alagem, the relationship is working well. The company is opening a new manufacturing facility at Angers in France, where Bull makes printed circuit boards and other PC components. Nobody can say with certainty that Packard Bell's future is assured. Many companies in the PC business have experienced false dawns. And the home market is quirky and unpredictable. But what Packard Bell has achieved so far suggests that as multimedia expands into the home, a Packard Bell machine is likely to be at the end of the information superhighway.</p>

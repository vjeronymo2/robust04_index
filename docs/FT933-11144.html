			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: ITT registers 152% jump in net income SHARES in ITT rose yesterday after the diversified US conglomerate reported a 152 per cent jump in second-quarter net income to Dollars 267m following improved performances from all but one of its eight main business lines. Group sales rose slightly to Dollars 5.5bn. The news lifted ITT's shares on the New York Stock Exchange to Dollars 89 1/4 , a new 52-week high, before closing Dollars 1 3/8 up at Dollars 88 3/4 . Investors appeared untroubled by a warning from Mr Rand Araskog, ITT's chairman, that some of the group's markets would 'soften' in the second half of this year. ITT's latest results were affected by special items, including a Dollars 13m restructuring charge, a Dollars 50m provision to cover the losses on early retired debt, a Dollars 63m gain on the sale of its unsecured consumer loan business, and Dollars 25m of capital gains in the group's insurance portfolios. Among ITT's businesses, its financial and business services group put in an especially strong performance. Operating results at the insurance unit, ITT Hartford, improved dramatically, with earnings jumping from Dollars 41m a year ago to Dollars 187m this year. This followed a drop in catastrophe losses, favourable underwriting results, higher capital gains and the absence of losses relating to its Cameron and Colby business. Better results from its commercial lending business lifted ITT Financial's earnings 15 per cent to Dollars 75m. The only unit in the financial and business services group to report a decline in income was ITT Communications and Information Services, where foreign exchange losses led to a small drop in earnings to Dollars 66m. In the manufactured products division, earnings at ITT Automotive jumped Dollars 20m to Dollars 54m as material and overhead costs fell. ITT Defense and Electronics also reported sharply higher income at Dollars 18m, as did ITT Fluid Technology. Both units benefited from improved cost control. ITT Rayonier, the forest products operation, reported doubled income to Dollars 50m.</p>

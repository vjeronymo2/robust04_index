			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(rc)": "The Skoda Plant Is Liquidating Its </F> Research Reactor"]    [Text] The Plzen Skoda factory is liquidating its SR  research reactor in Vochov near Plzen, including spent fuel and  unused fuel. The reactor is of its own construction and  manufacture and was used from 1970 until 1989. This information  was provided to RUDE PRAVO by Engineer Frantisek Svitak, deputy  director of the Skoda Nuclear Engineering Plant in Plzen. The  Skoda plant does not need the reactor anymore. It was used to  test various measuring methods and devices, to train reactor  operators, to train students from the West Bohemian University,  and to conduct radiation testing for the republican Civil  Defense organization.    Despite the fact that the reactor is not contaminated (it  was  reconstructed in 1986 and was not put into operation after that  date), all legal standards must be met during the liquidation of  the workplace in Vochov. Regulations regarding the handling of  fuel are equally strict. The State Office for Nuclear Safety in  Prague and the International Agency for Atomic Energy in Vienna  supervise fuel-handling. Moreover, any fuel-handling must not  contravene the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear  Materials.    At present, they have approximately 10 kilograms of uranium  235 in sandwich-type metallic fuel at the Skoda plant. The  Slovak Technical University has shown interest in the reactor  and fuel. Because of the lack of funds on the part of the  customer, however, the negotiations failed. Prospective buyers  in Germany have also shown interest but did not meet the  requirements. The Nuclear Research Institute in Rez near Prague  is currently interested in the reactor. According to Eng.  Svitak, the Skoda plant is conducting the most promising  negotiations with two French firms that would like to buy the  research reactor and the fuel.</p>

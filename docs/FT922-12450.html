			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / The Lex Column: London back on track The London equity market's response to the Tory election victory has proved more robust and durable than some at first expected, this column included. Perhaps the most encouraging sign came on Thursday, when the market ground to a halt in heavy two-way volume. This suggested that the near-250 point rise of the previous five trading days was a genuine adjustment to changed circumstances, rather than a bubble waiting to be pricked. One rationale of what has been happening is illustrated in the chart. Last September, the market reached its all-time high on the basis of premature hopes of economic recovery and the belief the Tories would sweep to victory in a November election. Then came disappointment on both counts, and a 12 per cent plunge by Christmas. This was followed by a revival, briefly punctured by the panic of the election itself. The revival is now back on track, with the FT-SE a mere 41 points below its September high. It could be argued that the record now deserves to be beaten, on the grounds that the market is once more free from the perception of political risk and must necessarily be closer to the reality of economic recovery. The main reservation remains the fact that evidence of recovery is likely to be meagre and uncertain for some time. Even Thursday's unexpectedly good employment figures came with unexpectedly bad news on wage inflation, thus suggesting the need for continued monetary restraint. The market gains of the past week look fairly secure. From now on, though, the going could prove less exciting.</p>

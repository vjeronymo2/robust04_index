			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Blackstone may acquire Univa in CDollars 1bn venture BLACKSTONE, the New York-based investment group, may acquire Univa, Canada's second largest food distributor, in a deal worth just over CDollars 1bn (USDollars 793m). Univa, with annual sales of CDollars 6.5bn, is a wholesale and retail food distributor with subsidiaries across Canada and in California, and is second to the Toronto-based Loblaw. In the nine months to October 31 Univa's net profits were CDollars 29.4m, or 34 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 5.1bn. The figures reflected vicious competition, particularly in eastern Canada. Mr Bertin Nadeau, who for the past 11 years has controlled 26 per cent of Univa through a holding company, Unigesco, plans a joint venture with Blackstone to offer CDollars 11 a share cash for all Univa's 94m common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. This would be about 45 per cent above the average Univa market price over the past three weeks. Thus the value of the bid is CDollars 1.03bn. Univa's next biggest shareholder is the Sobey family of Halifax, Novia Scotia, with 25 per cent. The family usually votes with Mr Nadeau. The Caisse de Depot, the Quebec Pension Plan's investment arm, holds about 12 per cent including conversion rights. If the deal goes through the joint venture is structured so that Univa will be owned 80 per cent by Blackstone and undisclosed private international investors and 20 per cent by Unigesco. Mr Stephen Schwarzman, president of Blackstone, said his investment group would sell its Univa shares over a three to seven-year period via public offerings and Unigesco would buy back control of Univa. After seven years the joint venture would be dissolved. He said that Univa management would continue unchanged and Univa would get full financial backing for a three-year CDollars 230m modernisation programme in the highly competitive eastern Canada market. Unigesco, which owns a hardware retailing group and food service units, would sell its 26 per cent of Univa into the joint venture for CDollars 246m, which would be used to reduce its own heavy debt. Blackstone will provide CDollars 375m for the bid, with the balance borrowed partly from Canadian and US banks. Univa will set up a committee of independent directors to evaluate the bid and report to shareholders.</p>

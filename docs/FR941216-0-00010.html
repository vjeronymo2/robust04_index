			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other products of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent rapid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decompression of the airplane. This AD requires a revision to the Limitations Section of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit flight above an altitude of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41,000 feet. This AD also provides for replacement of certain outflow/safety valves in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pressurization system as optional terminating action for the AFM revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is considered to be interim action. The FAA is considering further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking action to supersede this AD to require replacement of certain outflow/safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valves within 18 months. However, the proposed compliance time for the replacement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiently long so that notice and time for public comment would not be impracticable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Invited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the address specified under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . All communications received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed in the Rules Docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;NM&hyph;210&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

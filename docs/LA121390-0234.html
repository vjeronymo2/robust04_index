Final  </P> <P> 13 DIE IN SICILY QUAKE; TAIWAN TEMBLOR KILLS 2  </P> <P> An earthquake struck Sicily's eastern coast before dawn today, killing at least  13 people, collapsing buildings and sending panicked residents into the  streets, officials said.  </P> <P> The quake registered a magnitude 4.7, the Ministry of Civil Protection  reported. The U.S. National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,  measured it at magnitude 5.1.  </P> <P> On the other side of the world, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake shook a wide area of  northeastern Taiwan today, causing landslides and killing two construction  workers who were knocked off buildings where they were working, police said.  </P> <P> Thousands of people were driven from their homes by the quake in Sicily, and  many spent the rest of the night in their cars for fear of further shocks.  </P> <P> Eleven bodies were pulled from the rubble in the town of Carlentini, a town of  10,000 between Catania and Syracuse that was hit hardest by the quake, the  ministry said.

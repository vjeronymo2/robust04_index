			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFUGEES GIVEN 20 DAYS TO SEEK ASYLUM OUTSIDE S. TEXAS  </P> <P> Central American refugees were given a 20-day stay Tuesday to apply for  political asylum without fear of being trapped in the Rio Grande Valley, and  the federal judge presiding over the case strongly chastised immigration  authorities for allowing illegal aliens to live in abject squalor while their  fates are being determined.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to view the kind of disgrace and kind of problem created by this  policy," said U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela. "It is not my intent to sit  back and be a spectator in my community and my country. I am disturbed."  </P> <P> But at the same time, Judge Vela said he was inclined to agree with immigration  authorities on the major issue of Tuesday's hearing -- that the Immigration and  Naturalization Service does not have to go through a complicated process before  imposing new regulations on how the asylum process works. If Vela does remove a  temporary restraining order now in effect, the INS could begin holding  political asylum applicants in South Texas within three weeks.  </P> <P> The judge's indication that he would probably side with immigration  authorities, despite the admonishment, caused government lawyers to declare a  victory of sorts. But they also said that immigration officials in the new Bush  Administration would look closely at practices that led to the refugees' suit  against the government.  </P> <P> At issue in this dusty border town, one of the major points of entry for  Central American refugees, was how they would be treated while applying for  political asylum. Last December, the Immigration and Naturalization Service  issued a new set of rules, based on the claim that almost all political asylum  applications from Central American countries are frivolous.  </P> <P> Chief among those new rules was that illegal aliens must wait at their point of  entry for the asylum applications to be processed. That, in turn, led to a  buildup of illegal aliens in the Brownsville area. At one point, hundreds of  aliens were living in open fields and an abandoned motel, many of them with no  warm clothing and little to eat.  </P> <P> On Jan. 9, Judge Vela issued a temporary restraining order that allowed the  refugees to leave South Texas and apply for asylum in other parts of the  country. Since issuing that order, more than 6,000 refugees have filed for  asylum and left South Texas. According to INS figures, about half of them have  gone to Miami, while an estimated 10% traveled to the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> During the hearing, immigration officials tried to paint a picture of refugees  as people who would disappear once allowed to leave the Rio Grande Valley,  while a lawyer for the refugees said the government was largely responsible for  the number of Central American aliens, particularly Nicaraguans, who were  crossing into the United States.  </P> <P> Allen Hausman, a Justice Department lawyer, said that huge numbers of aliens  would be lost in the system, and one of his examples cited California  statistics that of the 1,417 asylum applications in Los Angeles and San  Francisco, only 74 had appeared to pursue their cases.  </P> <P> "They can potentially disappear among the 240 million Americans," said Hausman.  "They need not pursue asylum."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Says Policy Hardens  </P> <P> Robert Rubin, a lawyer for the refugees, contended, meanwhile, that the  hardening of the immigration policy was essentially a change of heart by the  American government. He contrasted the new INS policy with that in 1987, when  84% of the Nicaraguans who applied were granted political asylum. He said the  same figure for 1988 was more than 50%. And now, he said, the policy is to keep  them out altogether.  </P> <P> Rubin also contended there should have been much more public debate on the new  INS policy before it was put in effect, asserting that refugees, local health  officials and a local shelter had known nothing of the new guidelines.  </P> <P> Rubin said the new rules "interfere with the ability to file for asylum and the  ability to survive.  </P> <P> "Instead, these people were forced to sleep out in the rain and cold while they  attempted to file an application for asylum," he told the judge. "This policy  is designed to starve people out of the asylum process."  </P> <P> At the end of the arguments by both sides, Judge Vela told immigration  officials that he would not stand for any more of the conditions in Brownsville  that brought national attention to the refugees held here under the new rules.  He said that if conditions did not improve, he would immediately grant another  request for injunctive relief.  </P> <P> "I insist that you take off your adversarial hat," Vela told immigration  lawyers. He also said he did not agree with the new immigration policy, but  would probably have to lift the restraining order because the INS seemed to  have followed the letter of the law.  </P> <P> William Joyce, an INS lawyer, said after the hearing that he believes there  will be another surge of new refugees once word is out that only 20 days are  left.  </P> <P> "I think you might see a lot of Central Americans coming through here in the  next three weeks," he said.  </P></p>

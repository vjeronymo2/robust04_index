			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: NFC It will be a crying shame if NFC abandons the practice of publishing a best estimate of profits for the coming year. At least its official forecast is freely available to all investors. Institutions with access to brokers' forecasts - massaged up or down by companies at private briefings - would barely notice the change. NFC's army of employee-shareholders might find themselves disadvantaged. Still, the company cannot be blamed for worrying about potential litigation, especially in the US, should it ever fail to hit its target. The broader question is whether a more conventional style of communication with shareholders might lay the ground for a more conventional pattern of share ownership. With shareholders' funds of Pounds 350m supporting turnover approaching Pounds 2bn, NFC is not well endowed with equity. That partly explains the rapid rise in gearing during the first half. An acquisition in logistics, for example, would demand substantial goodwill write-offs and further weaken the balance sheet. Since employees own 15 per cent of the shares, a rights issue would be touchy. Smaller placements of equity might be used to fund acquisitions, or cement alliances such as that with Schneider in the US. That might explain NFC's concern with the potential pitfalls in the US courts. While its parcels business is losing money and with reorganisation provisions promised for the second half, though, NFC has its work cut out closer to home. Even if Lynx can be quickly turned around, it is questionable whether NFC should slug it out in the overcrowded parcels market. Another good performance from Exel Logistics should be a pointer to the way ahead.</p>

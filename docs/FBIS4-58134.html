			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Peace Cannot Come In Pieces"] </F>   [Text] The constant, principled position reiterated by  Damascus yesterday, prior to the talks between U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher and President Hafiz al-Asad, has given  the peace process a comprehensive pan-Arab dimension, set it on  the right track, and revealed Israel's false allegations and  gimmicks to circumvent the foundations and concepts of the just  and comprehensive peace aspired to by the Arab parties.    The Syrian rejection of partial and separate settlements and  secret negotiations and deals emphasizes the fact that peace is  an indivisible whole and cannot be achieved in bits and pieces  by dividing withdrawal and scheduling stages. The  land-for-peace principle cannot, under any other name, stipulate  giving back part of the territory in exchange for peace; full  peace entails full withdrawal, giving each party its rights, and  uprooting the causes of tension and conflict.    The Israeli concept, which takes after the shylock model of  barter, wants to give back the occupied Arab territories in  pieces. In return, it wants to exact the full price of peace all  at once. Such exposed maneuvers and names such as "Majdal-Shams  First," like Gaza-Jericho First, will not deceive the other Arab  fronts, which do not accept half solutions and only seek  comprehensive and just peace in return for withdrawal from the  occupied territories -- all of the occupied territories --  without any division, bargaining, or flexibility.    The Oslo accord was concluded under special circumstances  and  considerations that have to do with the reality and  considerations of the Palestine question and the Palestinian  people under occupation. It was also the outcome of political  circumstances and the suffering of a people under an unjust  military rule. This accord, however, does not constitute a  formula that can be promoted on the other Arab fronts.    Just as Israel withdrew fully from Sinai under the peace  agreement with Egypt, the solution of the Syrian, Jordanian, and  Lebanese tracks cannot depart from this framework in all its  political details and facts.    The three Arab parties are determined to reject half  solutions and peace in pieces in adherence with the  land-for-peace principle. They believe that peace does not stand  a chance of survival if it is not a comprehensive peace in  return for a comprehensive withdrawal from all the Arab  territories, without exception.    Such a comprehensive Arab strategy, stressed by His Majesty  King Husayn and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Amman a few  days ago, constitutes a basis for the Arab negotiator in his  quest for a just and comprehensive peace.    Therefore, the U.S. role in advancing the peace process  should not be limited to conveying and propagating Israeli  ideas; it should correct the course of these ideas and reject  any attempt to circumvent the land-for-peace principle and the  Madrid framework, which is based on UN Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338. The U.S. initiative that launched the  peace process almost three years ago was originally based on  these principles.</p>

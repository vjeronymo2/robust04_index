			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Japan sidles towards a nuclear future: The Tokyo government is amassing huge stocks of plutonium. Michael Cross asks: should the world be worried? ONE DAY this autumn, an extraordinary convoy will leave the French port of Cherbourg. It will comprise the freighter Pacific Crane, owned by a British-Japanese joint venture, and the patrol boat Shikishima, armed with 35mm cannon and 20mm machine-guns and operated by Japan's Maritime Safety Agency. The Pacific Crane's cargo will be enough plutonium to build 120 crude nuclear bombs. The voyage - the first of many over the next 20 years from Cherbourg and the north-west English port of Barrow-in-Furness - is part of a process by which Japan seems set to accumulate the world's largest stockpile of the deadly element. At a time when unpredictable new regimes are taking over the former Soviet arsenal, the prospect of stable and pacifist Japan becoming a nuclear power might not sound alarming. But any steps it takes along the road towards the capability of building nuclear weapons could have profound international consequences. Thomas Cochran, head of nuclear affairs at the US Natural Resources Defense Council, says Japan's activities 'will greatly restrict efforts in the US and Soviet states to eliminate stockpiles of weapons material.' Meanwhile, the presence of a Japanese stockpile of plutonium could give the Koreas and Taiwan an excuse to continue their efforts to develop bombs. The movement of plutonium is a temptation to terrorists or rogue governments in search of nuclear weapons. Shipments also raise the possibility of spilling or otherwise losing plutonium at sea. Such materials can go astray, as was shown by the disappearance of 10 kilogrammes of enriched uranium from inventories at the Dounreay reactor in Scotland. With the right knowledge - perhaps from an unemployed Russian - eight kilogrammes of civil-grade plutonium is enough to make a bomb. Of course, the Japanese government has no intention of mishandling plutonium, much less of building nuclear weapons. It has always complied strictly with international rules to combat nuclear proliferation. The government's Atomic Energy Commission, which sets nuclear policy, states that it is a 'national principle' for Japan not to possess more plutonium than needed in civil power stations. Critics say, however, Japan is setting in motion the machinery to obtain plutonium much faster than it can be consumed. By the most alarming estimates, more than 100 tonnes will pile up, half of it shipped from British and French reprocessing plants, the rest produced locally. This is more plutonium than exists in the nuclear weapons of either the US or former Soviet states. 'Japan will become the world's number one plutonium country,' says Dr Jinzaburo Takagi, a former nuclear scientist who runs his country's most prominent anti-nuclear group, the Citizens' Nuclear Information Centre. Japan committed itself to the plutonium economy 25 years ago. Most other rich nations shared the dream. Nuclear pioneers saw the plutonium cycle as the most efficient way to tap energy from a limited supply of uranium. Technically their arguments remain sound. But political and economic priorities have changed. Falling prices of uranium, coupled with fears about the proliferation of nuclear weapons, caused the US to abandon its civil plutonium programme. The Soviet Union, after Chernobyl, followed suit and protest killed Germany's efforts. Britain and France retain a commitment to reprocessing but have had second thoughts about fast-breeder reactors. Japan, obsessed with the need to import 80 per cent of its energy - and with its celebrated ability to plan for the long term - keeps the faith. The country has in service 39 commercial reactors, almost all pressurised-water and boiling-water models adapted from US designs. Work is proceeding at a furious pace on 11 more using giant pipe-laying robots, the world's largest cranes and armies of workers. But, in Japanese eyes, all this effort has little point so long as the country needs to import its uranium and send fuel overseas for processing. To attain true independence, Japan must 'close the nuclear fuel cycle.' The centrepiece of this effort is a gigantic plant being built near the village of Rokkasho, at the northern end of Honshu. The 1,000-acre (400-hectare) site houses plants to enrich uranium and store and reprocess fuel to extract plutonium, as well as a dump for low-level nuclear waste. It will cost about Y840bn (Pounds 3.7bn). The final link is the fast-breeder reactor, which runs on a mixture of plutonium and uranium - and contains, in its spent fuel, more plutonium than went in. Japan's first electricity-generating breeder, named Monju, is having final tests on the Tsuruga peninsula, 250 miles west of Tokyo. Fast breeders are powerful but very expensive. An ordinary power station releases 1 per cent of the energy in its fuel; a fast-breeder can, theoretically, extract 80 per cent. According to the plan, fast-breeders will become the standard power station in Japan, assuring energy supplies for thousands of years. Fuel for the first generation of fast-breeders will contain plutonium extracted by reprocessing the spent fuel of conventional reactors. Since the 1970s, spent fuel from Japan's power stations has gone to Sellafield in Cumbria (near Barrow-in-Furness) and Cap de la Hague (near Cherbourg in Normandy) for reprocessing. During the 1990s, new plants to handle fuel from light-water reactors come on stream in both countries. They will process 4,500 tonnes of Japanese fuel to produce 37 tonnes of plutonium. In signing the reprocessing contracts, Japan undertook to remove both the plutonium and high-level waste. So far, only one load of plutonium has gone back to Japan, - in 1984, under the escort of the US and French navies. The original plan was to transport it by air, but that would have needed permission from the US government because the fuel originated from US uranium. Washington refused to set technical standards for airborne containers. In 1988, Congress approved shipments of plutonium only if they travelled by sea, with an armed escort - which the US refused to provide. Sending the Japanese navy around the world would, however, alarm neighbouring countries and outrage opinion at home. The government decided it would be unconstitutional, anyway, and gave the job instead to the Maritime Safety Agency, a coastguard force. It also spent Y20bn on a new ship, the 6,500-tonne Shikishima. (Ironically, after deciding to build the Shikishima, the government sent minesweepers to the Gulf). Ferrying the plutonium is the job of Pacific Nuclear Transport, a company owned by British Nuclear Fuels and Japanese investors. PNT has five ships which take spent fuel from Japan to Europe. One of these, the Pacific Crane, recently was modified to strengthen its cargo hold and Greenpeace, the environmentalist group, believes this will be the plutonium-carrier. The question remains: what to do with the plutonium cargoes? Japan already has enough in stock to start up Monju but, even if the breeder performs flawlessly, it will be a long way from a commercial plant. Tokyo hopes that private industry will pay for the next step, a 'demonstration' fast breeder. The government persuaded the country's nine private electrical utilities to spend 20 per cent of Monju's Y600bn cost but they have shown little enthusiasm for funding further work. All this means that fast-breeders will not contribute significantly to the Japanese electrical grid for at least another 40 years. Last August, Tokyo admitted this by announcing a shift in priorities. It would still bring home its plutonium, but as fuel for ordinary pressurised-water and boiling-water reactors. The Atomic Energy Commission says such a policy 'contributes to the preservation of uranium resources and reduces the environmental effects caused by energy consumption.' The government intends two light-water reactors to be loaded in the mid-1990s with fuel containing a mixture of plutonium and uranium. It wants private industry to take on the task of making the mixed-oxide (Mox) fuel rods. Takagi says this is unrealistic: plutonium adds to the difficulty of handling fuel and disposing of waste while Mox is far more expensive than ordinary enriched uranium. The utilities share this scepticism. The switch involves operational changes which might jeopardise their exemplary record of exposing workers to as little radiation as possible. Joining the plutonium cycle would also make commercial nuclear power stations subject to the scrutiny of the International Atomic Energy Authority. Power companies fear that regular visits by foreign inspectors to check fuel-handling would alarm rather than reassure the public. Several observers are adding-up the figures of Japan's accumulation and consumption of plutonium and, predictably, people opposed to nuclear energy produce the most alarming findings. But one informed analysis is by Tatsujiro Suzuki, a Japanese nuclear engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Energy Policy. Suzuki estimates that, by 2010, Japan will have between 80 and 90 tonnes of fissile plutonium: 30 tonnes from Europe, six tonnes from an experimental processing plant near Tokyo, and 50 tonnes from Rokkasho. Over that time, the highest possible consumption will be 40 tonnes. The Atomic Energy Commission says demand will be 80 tonnes but the Citizens' Nuclear Information Centre says it will be only 23. Japan's quest for the plutonium economy appears expensive and damaging to its international image. It is also a gift to opponents of nuclear power. But many Japanese find such concerns trivial compared with the uncertainty caused by dependency on imported energy. Tetsuo Kobori, deputy directory of the Monju construction project, articulates a widespread fear: 'By the year 2010 or 2015, we will have big international competition, maybe war, over energy. In order to keep peace on earth, we need to develop new energy resources.' The fast breeder, he argues, is the only technology on the horizon capable of assuring a virtually inexhaustible and concentrated supply of power. Such concerns are fading in a generation that has known nothing but prosperity. 'Young people here have no sense about energy security, they are just enjoying daily life,' Kobori says. Greenpeace Japan, which claims 400 supporters in a population of 120m, also complains about youthful apathy. While there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Kobori and his colleagues, anxieties must remain that Japan's enthusiasm for plutonium might at some later date develop into a capacity to build nuclear bombs. Officially, Japan pledges never to build nuclear weapons, never to allow them into its territory, and never to contribute to their development. Adherence to two of these principles has eroded, though. US ships armed with nuclear warheads visit Japanese ports routinely, although their captains maintain a diplomatic fiction by refusing to confirm or deny they are carrying nuclear weapons. And, until 1987, the reprocessing plant at Sellafield mixed stocks of plutonium from civil and military contracts; plutonium originating in Japanese reactors has ended up in British or US warheads. Japan has a better claim than most nations to be a responsible nuclear superpower. Thanks to the legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the idea of building a nuclear deterrent never enters Japan's political agenda. Regular public-opinion surveys on national defence do not even raise the question. If Japan were to move towards the bomb, the important first step - accumulation of a large stockpile of plutonium and advanced rockets - would have happened without any public debate on the issue.</p>

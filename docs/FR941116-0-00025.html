			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received reports of two low pressure turbine (LPT) disks that failed in the disk web area due to creep fatigue on AlliedSignal Inc. (formerly Garrett Engine Division) Model TFE731&hyph;3A&hyph;200G turbofan engines. Both disk failures were uncontained. A metallurgical examination of first and second stage LPT disks found that two heat treatment production processes created a microstructure more susceptible to creep fatigue cracking. Both production processes affected AlliedSignal Inc. TFE731&hyph;3 series engines' first and second stage LPT disks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, a field inspection of LPT disks on AlliedSignal Inc. TFE731&hyph;3 series turbofan engines revealed that excessive disk growth occurred on AlliedSignal Inc. Model TFE731&hyph;3A&hyph;200G and TFE731&hyph;3AR&hyph;200G engines, which are installed on Israel Aircraft Industries, Ltd. (IAI) 1125 Westwind Astra series aircraft. The FAA has determined that the IAI Astra flight profile subjects the first and second stage LPT disks to prolonged flight time at or near the maximum continuous inner turbine temperatures limit. Repeated prolonged exposure to high temperatures can cause a more rapid deterioration of the nickel-graphite abradable material on the LPT second stage nozzle air seal than originally anticipated during the certification process of the engine. This deterioration results in increased seal clearance, which contributes to disk growth. This disk growth, also known as creep, resulting either from certain heat treatment production processes, excessive LPT second stage nozzle air seal clearance, or the LPT disk(s) prolonged exposure to elevated operating temperatures, if not corrected, could result in LPT disk web separations, which can result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of AlliedSignal Aerospace Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. TFE731&hyph;A72&hyph;3519, Revision 3, dated May 6, 1994, that imposes an hourly life limit on first and second stage LPT disks and describes procedures for removal and replacement of these LPT disks; SB No. TFE731&hyph;72&hyph;3530, Revision 1, dated October 8, 1993, that describes procedures for installing a second stage LPT turbine nozzle that incorporates a honeycomb air seal; and ASB No. TFE731&hyph;A72&hyph;3544, dated October 8, 1993, and ASB No. TFE731&hyph;A72&hyph;3557, dated May 12, 1994, that describe procedures for removal and replacement of specific serial numbered first and second stage LPT disks. Certain requirements of this AD may be accomplished using an earlier version of a service bulletin (SB) or ASB than the one cited in the AD. The original version of AlliedSignal Aerospace SB No. TFE731&hyph;72&hyph;3530 differs only by minor changes that do not impact the technical content of the procedures, and is an acceptable method of compliance to paragraph (c)(1) of this AD. Prior to the effective date of this AD, replacement of LPT disks in accordance with previous revisions of SB No. TFE731&hyph;A72&hyph;3519 is an acceptable method of compliance to paragraph (b) or (c)(2) of this AD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other AlliedSignal Inc. TFE731&hyph;3A&hyph;200G series turbofan engines of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent LPT disk web separations, which can result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. This AD requires removing from service certain LPT disks, imposing an hourly life limit on first and second stage LPT disks, performing a dimensional inspection of second stage LPT disks at repetitive intervals, and incorporating honeycomb material in the second stage LPT nozzle air seal. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Invited <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;01.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Army was merely summoned to act jointly with the  Federal Police [PF] in a move to guarantee the freedom of  transit. At present, the situation is normal throughout the  country with the exception of three capitals. The cabinet chief  of the PF Department in Brasilia guarantees that the situation  has returned to normal.    On 11 May, Jose Roberto da Silva, the cabinet chief of  Colonel Wilson Romao who is the Federal Police director general,  reported that except for Brasilia, Sao Paulo, and Belem [Para  State], 30 percent of PF administrative personnel are working  normally in the other states. Da Silva added that the issuance  of passports is normal nationwide and borders are under control.    He explained that the Army was summoned to guarantee the  right to move freely of those civil servants who wanted to work.  Col. Romao personally requested the Army to step in after PF  strikers, who have been out for 54 days, prevented civil  servants from entering the Federal Police Department building on  10 and 11 May.    Yet, the Army personnel were summoned to Brasilia in the  early hours of 11 May by express order of President Itamar  Franco. They cordoned off the PF headquarters and were deployed  in other places of the city, including the Ministries Esplanade.  Army personnel were supported by four helicopters of the Army  Special Brigades stationed in Rio de Janeiro. Da Silva said the  Army personnel will continue to be deployed in Brasilia, Belem,  and Sao Paulo until the end of the strike.    Col. Romao was to have held a news conference early this  morning, but declined to talk to the press. The Army  Communications Center reported that only the PF and Planalto  Palace will inform the public about the latest developments in  this issue.</p>

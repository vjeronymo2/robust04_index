			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Scots Hydro seeks southern growth Scottish Hydro-Electric, the power company, is holding discussions about acquiring power stations from National Power and PowerGen. Mr Roger Young, Hydro chief executive, said his company wanted to 'push hard into England' using the strong cash flow from its operations north of the border. But it was too early to say what the outcome of the talks would be. The two English generators are required, under an agreement with the electricity regulator, to sell plant and reduce their generating capacity. Hydro-Electric also announced a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 164.2m (Pounds 146.4m) for the year to March 31 assisted by strong growth in electricity sales. Turnover advanced by 10 per cent from Pounds 717.8m to Pounds 792.4m. Mr Young said that the rise was also helped by last year's expensive redemption of government debt, and fluctuations in output from the hydro-electric installations due to wide variations in rainfall. A final dividend of 8.68p is proposed, making a total for the year of 12.64p (11.38p), an increase of 11 per cent. Mr Young said the company aimed to stick to its target of 6-8 per cent real annual dividend growth until the end of next year. Increases after that would depend on the outcome of the current regulatory reviews. Earnings per share were 31.7p (27.6p). Total volume of electricity sold rose 22 per cent, helped by a doubling of sales to Scottish Power as it took its share from the Peterhead power station, now running on Miller gas from the North Sea. Sales of electricity in England and Wales were up 9.2 per cent at Pounds 147.5m, equivalent to about a fifth of turnover. Hydro-Electric already has a share in one power station in operation south of the border - at Dover - and two more are due to come on stream at Sellafield and Keadby. COMMENT To its credit, Hydro-Electric was keen to emphasise the exceptional nature of the 15 per cent rise in post-tax earnings. Even so, the underlying rate was based on solid growth both in its home market in north Scotland, and in England and Wales where the company has set its sights for long-term growth. Confirmation that discussions are taking place with the English generators underlines Hydro's determination to expand south of the border, but no one expects any quick deals. The longer term prospects depend on Prof Littlechild's distribution review, though only 20 per cent of its profits are affected as against 80 per cent at the regional distribution companies. Hoare Govett has Hydro on a prospective yield of 4.7 per cent, which is a 10 per cent premium to the market as a whole.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Arts: Twyla Tharp Dance - Ballet Twyla Tharp's dances, like her dancers, offer a thrilling display of energy that knows exactly where it is going, where it has been - in the sense of the influences that have shaped it - and what it wants to do. This is dancing purposeful, vivid, hugely satisfying. And it can be seen for the next ten days in the smaller of the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. I reported on the Tharp troupe in their current repertory at the Paris Opera last autumn. The change of location is a shock - from the expanse of the Palais Garnier's stage (which the Tharpians grandly filled) to the close quarters of Riverside 2 is carrying contrast to craziest extremes - but the dances and the dancers (their wits very much about them) triumphed on Tuesday night on no uncertain terms. There is a lot to complain about in this present setting. Getting to Riverside through a maelstrom of traffic is a wall-of-death exercise; the seating in the theatre is bum-numbing and for the most part fit only for midgets; the dance area is reasonable, though there is no wing-space, while the dancers must warm-up in front of the audience as it arrives, which I suppose is a bonus for people who want to see performers' bodies at their private devotions, but I think it an intrusion. Yet there is also a lot to praise: Riverside's enterprise in acquiring Tharp's troupe when a tour was cancelled; the opportunity to see superb dancers and superb dances at close quarters, and the extraordinary immediacy this brings to performance and our response to it. The balance is on the right side, and the season is not to be missed. The first of two programmes opened with the recent Sextet. Three couples; some undistinguished mock-Hispanic jazz; popular dance - even jitterbug - balleticised. These are ingredients which Twyla Tharp cleverly manipulates, though despite brilliant dancing from Stacy Caddell and Shawn Stevens (fine dancers from Balanchine's stable), I do not find the piece reaches far enough into the music or the idea of dance-hall style to seem more than an appetiser for the delights to come. These are the blazingly contrasted Baker's Dozen and In the Upper Room. While you watch Baker's Dozen you know that it is the happiest, jokiest, nicest thing in the world. Four enchanting piano rags by Willie 'the Lion' Smith; white clothes; dancing that is both relaxed and tautly responsive to rhythm; twelve dancers who are friends, and can play merry tricks on each other and on dance itself; movement that runs and slides and takes a pause and then nips along over and through the music. Bliss. In the Upper Room suffers at Riverside from lack of space, and more especially from lack of the lighting that gave it such drama on the Garnier stage - choreography roaring at us from out of the dark and mist, or pin-pointed with singular vividness in a shaft of illumination. But it remains a prodigious example of Tharpian analysis, of movement contrasted - athleticism versus classicism on the most obvious terms - and activity sprung from the grinding motor rhythms of a Phillip Glass score. It is dance driven, relentless, sometimes fractured or trapped in the vain repetitions of Glass's orchestra. It is made by someone who is fascinated by how dance works, how it may be shaped and re-shaped, exposed and obscured. It is an intellectual (quite as much as a theatrical) exercise by a dazzling choreographer who holds our attention at every turn and twist of her imagination, and it is danced with that energy, clarity, self-sacrificing brilliance that we expect of Tharp's casts. Very exciting in it are two male dancers: Jamie Bishton - massive scale to his movement, micro-second alertness to rhythm - and Petter Jacobsson, his classicism given a bright edge and a kind of wilful daring. Absolutely admirable are Stacy Caddell, Shawn Stevens, and the rest of the cast. Wonderful dancing in wonderful dances. At The Riverside Studios with two programmes until March 12. 081-748-3354.</p>

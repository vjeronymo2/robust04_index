			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 2 KYODO -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) has renewed its demand that North Korea  allow it to conduct full inspections at the time of refueling at  an experimental reactor in Yongbyon, an IAEA spokesman said  Monday [2 May]. The spokesman said the Vienna-based nuclear  watchdog body made the demand in a letter sent to North Korea on  Sunday.    The IAEA wants to send an inspection team to North Korea to  oversee the refueling which involves the replacement of fuel  rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, 90 kilometers north  of Pyongyang. The Yongbyon complex has been the focus of  allegations that North Korea is pursuing a clandestine nuclear  weapons program.    North Korea on April 29 offered to allow IAEA inspectors to  be present at the unloading of spent fuel rods from the reactor,  but said it would not permit the IAEA to measure radioactivity  levels or take samples.    The IAEA later indicated that North Korea's terms were  unacceptable. North Korea had indicated it would like to  conduct the refueling as early as late April. The latest IAEA  message to North Korea indicates that the Agency has not budged  from the insistence that it wants full inspections of the  facility and that it will consider a failure to allow this as an  infringement of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said in Seoul on April  21 that North Korea will be able to acquire enough plutonium  "within weeks" to make four to five nuclear bombs with the fuel  rod change at the reactor.</p>

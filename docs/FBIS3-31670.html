			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Officials from North  America, Western Europe and Russia agreed Tuesday to work  together on measures to consolidate and extend the peace  achieved around Sarajevo to the rest of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  participants said.    Some 30 envoys and senior foreign ministry officials from  the  United States, Canada, the European Community and Russia  proposed ways to bring relief to besieged Moslem enclaves and  prevent use elsewhere of Bosnian Serb heavy weapons withdrawn  from around the capital, German foreign ministry political  director Juergen Chrobog said. [passage omitted]    [Russia's Vitaly] Churkin told reporters: "We know now what  we are doing. We are acting together."    Asked if Russia would put pressure on the Serbs, he said  that  some countries had "special channels" by which to influence the  warring parties "for the common good:" the Americans with the  Moslems, the Germans with the Croats and the Russians with the  Serbs. [passage omitted]    Chrobog said Tuesday's meeting concluded that the European  peace plan for the former Yugoslav republic was "quantitatively  more or less right" in giving a proposed 33 percent of the  republic's territory to the Moslems, but that "qualitatively"  there needed to be improvements in besieged Moslem enclaves.    For Sarajevo, the participants agreed the need for  consolidation of the peace through demilitarisation, free access  for humanitarian aid and a restoration of normal life with UN  help, according to a joint statement.    They expressed their "deep concern" regarding the situation  in other Bosnian regions, and stressed the need to "concentrate  efforts on extending the security zones". They stressed the  need to improve conditions for the besieged Moslem population of  Maglaj, and called for a rapid reopening of the airport at Tuzla.    Regarding the fighting between Bosnian Moslem and Croat  forces, they called for a ceasefire and withdrawal of artillery  to allow a return to normal life in Mostar, and an effective  ceasefire with a pulling back of the warring parties in central  Bosnia.    The meeting was aimed at building on the peace in Sarajevo  resulting from the withdrawal, under threat of NATO airstrikes,  of the besieging Serb forces' artillery. NATO responded to the  shock caused by a presumed Serb shell which killed 68 people and  wounded some 200 in a Sarajevo market early February.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis turns in Pounds 14.6m loss Chrysalis, the music and entertainment group, yesterday announced a full year pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.6m, but said it would pay its first dividend since April 1991. The result for the year to August 31 included Pounds 15.5m in trading losses and closure costs at MAM Leisure, the amusement machine arm, and other discontinued businesses. This compares with a profit of Pounds 5.6m last year. The 1992 outcome included Pounds 11.6m in gains from the sale of Chrysalis Records to Thorn EMI. The group has started a new recording division under the Echo label. Turnover was Pounds 73.6m, against Pounds 65.9m. A tax credit of Pounds 5.6m reduced losses after tax to Pounds 9m. The dividend is 3.25p. Losses per share were 34.44p (earnings 26.02p).</p>

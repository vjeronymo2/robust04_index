			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / American dream turns sour: Alan Cane on troubles at Wang, product of a genius Wang Laboratories, which yesterday sought protection from its creditors in Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, is an American business dream turned sour. Founded in 1951 by Dr An Wang, a Chinese immigrant with a prodigious talent for invention, the company at one time had annual sales in excess of Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) and employed more than 31,000 people. If it had continued to grow at the pace it set in the early 1980s, it would by now have outstripped International Business Machines, the world's dominant computer company, and have annual sales in excess of Dollars 100bn. Revenue projections for small, rapidly growing companies tend to produce such fantastic scenarios. But Wang seemed destined to become a significant minicomputer company by any measure. Dr Wang's genius was to recognise the potential for small computer systems in the office. He pioneered a way of thinking about office automation that was exactly right for the time. Wang essentially invented computer-based word processing and the quality of Wang's word processing software remains convincing even today. But times and technology change, and Wang's tragedy lay in failing to keep pace either with technology or with fast-evolving markets. Yesterday, when chairman and chief executive Mr Richard W. Miller reluctantly put the company into bankruptcy, annual revenues had slipped to less than Dollars 2bn, staff numbers had been reduced to just over 13,000 and debt stood at about Dollars 540m. For Mr Miller, it was a disappointing end to a three-year battle to return Wang to profitability. Appointed in 1989 as president and chief operating officer, he took over as chief executive on Dr Wang's death from cancer in 1990. He cut costs, improved operating efficiency and paid off Dollars 575m in debt. On its own, the company's resources and cash flow proved insufficient to complete the restructuring process. The final straw seems to have been a decision on the part of IBM not to proceed with a second tranche of funding which it agreed with Wang last year. The former bitter competitors agreed an iconoclastic deal. IBM would invest up to Dollars 100m in Wang which would in turn distribute IBM's mid-range systems alongside its VS minicomputer range. It seems, however  - and in spite of official denials  - that Wang was not able to fulfil its part of the bargain. IBM seems to have decided to cut its losses and refuse further cash injections. Wang is the most dramatic victim to date of the savage changes within the computer industry which have damaged growth of revenues and profits for all the big players. IBM and Digital Equipment, the world's largest mainframe and minicomputer manufacturers respectively, both lost money last year and have put in place traumatic restructuring measures. These include the plummeting costs of computer hardware, a move towards standard rather than proprietary systems among customers and a questioning attitude among customers about the value of further investment in computer systems. The recession in most of the world's developed markets has also put a cap on capital spending. Wang's problems, however, can be traced back to at least a decade ago when analysts first began to realise that the hitherto pace-setting company was failing to keep pace with some critical technological changes. Over the succeeding years it continued to lose touch, failing to exploit industry trends like the move to personal computers  - which essentially destroyed Wang's market for minicomputer-based word processing systems  - and the development of open, nonproprietary computer designs. It also built up debt which in 1989 was close to Dollars 1bn. Other companies have fallen into the same trap  - Digital Equipment of the US is one, Norsk Data of Norway another  - but Wang was also plagued by management changes at the top which cost the company its sense of direction at the critical time. Dr Wang relinquished control of the company first to Mr John Cunningham and then to his son Frederick, taking up the reins himself again in 1989 as the situation deteriorated. Mr Miller was appointed shortly afterwards as Dr Wang's illness worsened. What is the future for the company? A buyer seems doubtful. Mr Miller says he is committed to staying with Wang and transforming it from debt-laden manufacturer to finely focused software and services company specialising in office automation. Computing services is the only route available to computer companies which have failed as manufacturers but Wang still commands respect for the excellence of much of its technology. It has some 35,000 customers world-wide for its minicomputers, many fervently loyal to the company, and it can still claim to be a pioneer in office imaging systems  - potentially a large and profitable market. In the UK, its best market outside the US, its largest reseller Text Systems of London pledged support to its customers. Mr John Podbury, managing director, paid tribute to the company's efforts to pull back from the brink. But heroics are not enough in computer markets. For Mr Miller and his greatly reduced company, Chapter 11 is only the beginning of the long, uncertain, haul back.</p>

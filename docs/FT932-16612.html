			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Letter: Crediting Pinochet for free market in Latin America Sir, If Observer does not know what General Pinochet has done to deserve a Latin American Award ('Obverse side', March 8), he obviously has not asked the right Latin Americans, and certainly not the majority of Chileans. General Pinochet prevented that beautiful Latin American country from becoming a Soviet satellite. He is also responsible for introducing the free market concepts into Chile and, by example, into the rest of Latin America. Therefore, ironically, more than any other single man, Pinochet is responsible for the transition of Latin America from the old-style military coup and counter-coup of the 1960s and 1970s to the open, free market, democratic continent that it is today. It is worth pointing out that Pinochet is the only dictator, to my knowledge, ever voluntarily to step down from office. This was after a referendum he himself called, in which he received a higher percentage of the total vote than did John Major's conservatives at the last election (or Bill Clinton in the last American election]). I do not think that either of those two would put themselves to an up-down referendum at this point. Pinochet, with his military trappings, is perhaps easy to ridicule; but Latin America has much to thank him for. Adrian Day, 900 Bestgate Road, Suite 405, Annapolis, Maryland 21401USA</p>

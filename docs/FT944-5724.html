			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Service wins managerial independence BBC World Service has won its managerial independence from government after more than 50 years and will in future be able to decide in what languages to broadcast and for how many hours. The World Service, which now broadcasts its radio programmes in 41 languages to more than 130m regular listeners, has always guarded its editorial independence. But since 1938, when the Foreign Office began funding the service, the government has had the right to specify the languages broadcast and the relative importance given to particular language groups. In the early 1980s there were confrontations when the government wanted the BBC to give up its Italian, Spanish and Maltese services and in the late 1980s the government insisted the BBC should stop its Japanese and Malay language services. After more than a year of negotiations the government has agreed to give up its 'prescription' rights in return for greater accountability. The freedom could lead to a shake-up at the service with Mr Sam Younger, the managing director, having to set priorities with a grant that is declining in real terms. The annual grant is about Pounds 170m and over the current three-year funding period the BBC has estimated it will lose about 8 per cent in real terms. The languages change, due to be announced soon, is set out in a corporate plan already endorsed by the BBC board of governors and Foreign Office ministers. In return for the changes, the service will try to increase its audience size to 140m by 1996-97. New value-for-money targets will aim to increase staff output and programme minutes for every Pounds 1,000 spent. On Wednesday the BBC began broadcasting in two new languages - Azeri and Uzbek - languages spoken in eight former Soviet republics in central Asia. The BBC is undertaking a review of what its new priorities will be with emphasis on countries where there is an 'information need'. Executives warn privately however that high priority will not necessarily mean more money and low priority may simply mean that those countries can be better addressed by BBC Worldwide Television, the BBC's international television operations. The Arab world, Israel, China, Russia and the Ukraine and south Asia are likely to be high priority. Medium-priority areas will range from Iran and Afghanistan to most of Africa, the Balkans and south-east Asia. Low priority is expected to be given to the countries of the European Union, the Caribbean, north America, central and south America and Japan and Korea.</p>

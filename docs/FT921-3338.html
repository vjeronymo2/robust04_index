			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Dispatches: Slovenia's capital new slogan IT IS a busy morning on what used to be Tito street. Although they have not changed the road signs yet, Ljubljana's main boulevard is now called Slovenska cesta, after the Slovene people who have always used it - even when this was officially part of Yugoslavia and not the capital of the independent republic of Slovenia. But for some Slovenes, loth as they would be to admit it, times were better under Tito. In Number 35, Slovenska cesta, for example - part of a blockish grey office building of early Communist vintage - the Ljubljana tourist office is scraping along. This is not high season, but the woman behind the counter is wondering if there will be a high season worth the name this year. 'Maybe April,' she says with a raised eyebrow. 'Maybe Americans.' Americans - that is, those Americans who cancel visits to Europe at the slightest whiff of trouble anywhere from Iceland to the Urals - are probably the last tourists who will want to mingle with the locals on Slovenska cesta. As a member of artificially stable Communist Yugoslavia, Slovenia benefited from being part of one of the old eastern bloc's most popular holiday destinations. But now, if potential tourists know where Slovenia is, they also know that it borders Croatia and for most outsiders Croatia stands for civil war. Never mind that the battle for Slovenia lasted only 10 days last summer, and ended with the complete withdrawal of Yugoslav forces. Slovenia and Croatia have been linked in newspaper headlines for too long for the country to shake off the stigma of being a war-zone. War-zone this is not. On the roads north-west from Ljubljana towards the border with Austria, the picturesque lakeside town of Bled, and Slovenia's best skiing, each bridge sprouts a cluster of heavy concrete pyramid-shaped tank-traps. They are the only reminder that less than a year ago Slovenia was fighting for independence. Elsewhere, it is the trappings of independence which are more noticeable. Start the Slovene publicity machine and it is difficult to shut it off. Slovenia already has a slogan - 'A new state on the sunny side of the Alps'  -a promotional emblem (a small green leaf), and more and glossier brochures than many better-established states. Since recognition of Slovenia in January, Ljubljana airport has reopened, the smart national airline, Adria - which lost part of its modern fleet to enemy attacks on the airport - has restarted direct flights, and the first British package tour since independence has been welcomed back to the country, a sure sign of returning international confidence. But progress is likely to be slow. In Ljubjlana - unlike Salzburg, which it most resembles - or Paris, there are few off-season foreign visitors on weekend breaks. There are no takers for the shiny new Slovene souvenirs sold on the triple-bridge which crosses the Ljubljanica river into the old town. Behind the smart pastel facades, the cafes, galleries and boutiques which hug the castle hill on the other side of the river are almost deserted and the cashiers in the banks still seem surprised to have to deal with foreigners wanting to exchange their D-Marks for new Slovene tolars. And even when the information ministry's enthusiastically peddled message gets through to the outside world, there are doubts about the effect it will have. Jure Zerovec wonders whether coachloads of Americans will really want to add tiny Ljubljana to their list of ten European capital cities to see in as many days. In the dimly-lit bar of the Hotel Turist - 260 beds, perhaps a dozen guests, no tourists - the barman and a handful of businessmen, mostly Slovenes, are watching in silence a television report about the first foreign airline, Swissair, to fly into Ljubljana airport since before last July's war. For a moment, Ljubljana's very inaccessibility - only two flights a week from London and Paris instead of 20, and a blissful dearth of coach parties  -seems enticing. On the aircraft out two days later, the Slovene in the seat next to me suggests, tongue in cheek, a new slogan for her capital: Salzburg without the tourists. It could be a short-lived attraction.</p>

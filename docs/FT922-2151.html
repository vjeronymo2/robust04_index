			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / NY Daily News 'was conduit for funds' MR KEVIN MAXWELL is alleged to have used the New York Daily News as a conduit to transfer funds from Maxwell companies in London to banks and companies around the world. According to newly obtained court documents filed by the Daily News, the transactions were outside 'the ordinary course' of the newspaper's business. The newspaper, bought by Mr Robert Maxwell in March 1991, has named Mr Maxwell's son Kevin as having 'authorised and directed' the fund transfers between March 21, 1991 and November 29, 1991. The other person named as directing the transfers was Mr Robert Maxwell himself, who died on November 5 last year. The issue of the fund transfers is the subject of a legal dispute in the US between the Daily News and other parties, including Mirror Group Newspapers of the UK. MGN was floated in the UK by the Maxwell empire last May. The Daily News court submission was made in answer to a question about its financial affairs by the New York bankruptcy court. The newspaper filed for bankruptcy protection last December. The submission alleges that, from March to November 1991, the UK funds were received by the Daily News 'and transferred to various entities in virtually simultaneous transactions'. The Daily News added that the funds served 'no business purpose' of their own and that the newspaper was 'utilised merely as a conduit by Robert Maxwell or his affiliated companies or family members for such transfers'. The Daily News is itself being accused in the US court of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to defraud MGN of Pounds 50m. The Daily News, which has denied any wrongdoing, faces claims from MGN and from the UK administrators of the Maxwell private companies for a total of more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 110m) of Maxwell fund transfers. This money came to the Daily News from both private and public Maxwell companies in the UK and elsewhere. It was learnt last night that Britain's Serious Fraud Office is investigating a Pounds 50m transfer from MGN to the Daily News that occurred on October 21, 1991. Court documents filed by MGN this week in the US concerning the Pounds 50m transfer accuse the Daily News of being liable for fraud, aiding and abetting conspiracy to defraud and aiding and abetting MGN directors in a breach of their fiduciary duties. The court filing also asserts that both Mr Robert Maxwell and Mr Michael Stoney, the former deputy MGN managing director in charge of finance, were responsible for the misappropriation of MGN funds and a violation of their fiduciary duties to MGN. The filing also says that Mr Stoney drew down the Pounds 50m - which was borrowed by MGN from the London office of Bankers Trust - upon the orders of Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Stoney was moved by Mr Robert Maxwell to MGN in the spring of 1991.</p>

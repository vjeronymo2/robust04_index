			<p>BFN     [Text] As already reported, another diplomatic  misunderstanding has arisen between Latvia and Russia in  connection with the ITAR-TASS report of Russia's alleged desire  to set up military bases in adjacent states including the  Baltics. It turns out that the Russian Foreign Ministry has  nothing in the least to do with this report. We contacted by  telephone special envoy Sergey Sergeyevich Zotov, head of the  state delegation at the talks with Latvia. This is what he said.    [Begin Zotov recording] At the state talks, the Russian side  has never posed the question of keeping military bases in Latvia  and we are not planning to pose such a question. The state  delegation is working exclusively under the mandate of the  president of the Russian Federation, and in keeping with this  mandate we have finished the practical discussion of the whole  set of questions connected with the withdrawal of troops.    Among the drafted and already initialed documents there is  an  agreement which concerns the legal status of the Russian radar  station in Skrunda. But I want to stress that our radar station  in this state agreement, which has already been approved by our  country's president, is regarded as a military institution under  civilian control. There can be no question of any bases.    Questions with Latvia in this regard have been fully settled  between us and are determined by the texts of interstate  treaties and agreements which have been drafted and are  incidentally ready for signing at the highest level. [end  recording]    [Announcer] To the question as to why absurd sensations of  this kind appear in the press from time to time, the special  envoy answered that this is due to bad, illiterate work by  individual officials of the state apparatus, and it is their  incompetence that leads to such misunderstandings in interstate  relations.</p>

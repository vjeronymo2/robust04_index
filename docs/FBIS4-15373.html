			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [UNIAN report on interview with Ukrainian President Leonid </F> Kravchuk by unidentified journalists: "The USSR Will Never Be  Reestablished...."]    [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk visited the  UNIAN Agency and answered questions by journalists of the  information agency and representatives of other mass media.    [Question] Proceeding from the results of the 27 March  voting, please try to forecast the results of the second round  of the Supreme Council elections. What steps will you take if  less than 126 people's deputies are elected; what will you do if  the number will range between 126 and 300; and, the third  variant -- if more than 300 people's deputies are elected?    [Kravchuk] These are first elections in Ukraine as an  independent state. That is why one cannot expect the highest  level of democracy from them. No serious conflicts took place  during the elections. There were isolated cases of unethical  conduct. There were no conflicts involving rallies or strikes.    I would like one variant -- that a Supreme Council be  elected  and that the new Supreme Council do the following: First, adopt  constitutional laws without which it is no longer possible to  live, namely, on local power structures, the range of their  jurisdiction, and the law on the President in accordance with  Ukraine's Constitution. If these two laws are adopted, the  [presidential] elections will be held on 26 June.    [Question] Who, in your opinion, can postpone the  presidential elections: the new Supreme Council or, under  certain circumstances, this can be done by the president?    [Kravchuk] It would be best if the new Supreme Council does  this, because it would be a legitimate step.... However, in  order for it to do this, it must be elected -- it is the most  important problem.    [Question] In the opinion of experts, Belarus has embarked  upon a road that may become the beginning of the renewal of the  Union. How can this influence Ukraine's position with regard to  the CIS?    [Kravchuk] Let us start with two important theses. First,  the Soviet Union will never be reestablished. The second thesis  lies in the fact that the CIS was not created as a Union and it  is impossible to transform the CIS into the Union on the basis  of those formative documents that were adopted by us.... It  took the members of the European Union 35 years to create it,  whereas we expect to do this by a single decision. It cannot be  done by a decision. If there are no preconditions, no  mechanisms will function. In my opinion, we must use the  potential of the CIS and the potential of relations between  states. Decisions on next steps must be adopted after asking  the advice of the people and of the parliaments.    [Question] What is your attitude toward the statement by  Ukraine's people's deputy Leonid Kuchma to the effect that  people with "clean hands" must make Ukraine's new policy?    [Kravchuk] I read that statement. The former prime  minister, who is presently president of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, made his analysis proceeding  from the facts of real life. However, for me, there arises one  moral problem, more specifically, the answer to the question of  who has led to this. The person who was also in the government  and who put in effort to create the present situation is trying  to shift the blame onto the government, the president, and other  executive structures.    When Leonid Danylovych was "in power," the prices jumped  tenfold and the correlation between the fund of consumption and  the fund of accumulation was distorted. The worst cataclysms  and strikes occurred precisely at that time. If you take the  decrees adopted by the Kuchma government, those decrees have  overturned everything. Today, I am signing guarantees for  foreign firms that want, for example, to built the [oil]  terminal. After those decrees, they no longer trust our laws.  It is the most terrible thing to lose the trust of investors....    In one of his recent statements, Leonid Kuchma stated as a  goal the need to remove Kravchuk's "power party" from the  leadership. When Vyacheslav Chornovil says such things, I can  understand it (even though he also belonged to the "power party"  when he headed the Lvov Oblast Council). However, for Leonid  Kuchma, the "power party" was the "cradle." The "Pivdenmash"  Production Association is the state within a state. Such a  status made it possible to have everything that could be had:  Kuchma was a member of the Communist Party Central Committee, a  deputy, a director, and secretary of the Party Committee. Even  now, Kuchma belongs to the "power party," because he heads the  Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. Does he  have a moral right to call for the removal of the "power party?"  It is not for nothing that people ask: "And pray who are the  judges?" [quotation from Griboyedov's play]    When Kuchma decided to quit the post of prime minister, we  said that relations between us must remain normal. All of a  sudden, Leonid Kuchma seems to have forgotten what he was saying  to me. I did not see such cases anywhere in the world when a  person who has left his post raises so much ado.... I have  expressed my point of view, I kept silence [before], but I have  said it now. If need be, I will say it again.    [UNIAN] Commenting upon the statement at the electoral  station by the Supreme Council chairman Ivan Plyushch to the  effect that only those people who are not sure of their strength  are afraid to go to elections, Leonid Kravchuk said:    [Kravchuk] You will not succeed in causing me to fall out  with Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch]. He and I have shared and  continue to share the same point of view on constitutional  processes. When the Supreme Council is elected, it must adopt  constitutional laws on local power structures and on the  president....</p>

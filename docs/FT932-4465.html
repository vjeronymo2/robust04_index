			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Arts: The Velvet Underground - Pop At the old the Town and Country the bar policy was simple. It sold bad beer in plastic beakers designed to cause the minimum of injury when, not if, they were thrown at the band. The T&amp;C is now the freshly-painted Forum and things are different. The new management knows its customers' vices are changing. And so on Saturday, the Velvet Underground, reformed and touring again after 23 years, dusted off their old repertoire and performed 'Heroin' in a venue which sells tubs of Haagen Dazs ice cream and coffee in hefty china mugs. The audience covered the pop age range. For two decades suburban rock fans have grown up listening to songs of drug abuse and sado-masochism and dreamt of the seedy glamour of late-1960s Manhattan when the Velvets were Andy Warhol's house band. To have four of the original five members (Nico died of a heart attack in 1988) on stage in Kentish Town, alive and well and unmistakeably middle-aged somehow seems a breach of the band's contract with its fans. In the middle of a bit of doggerel 'We're the Velvet Underground', Lou Reed, the lead singer, demanded 'what's wrong with this picture?' The answer came when the band tried the old shockers. As Reed, arms bulging white and unblemished from his tight black rock star T-shirt, declared: 'heroin, it's my wife and it's my life', the credibility gap yawned. The Velvets have always been victims of a widespread prejudice against out-of-tune singing. For the faithful, Saturday's generous concert veered reassuringly between the competent and the chaotic. Reed's voice has improved with age and a more careful life. But the audience roared its approval after drummer Mo Tucker's scratchy rendition of the gentle Close the Door. At other times the band struggled to settle on a tempo. But the slickness would have been the greatest sin. The music was at its most engaging when it teetered on the edge of collapse; when the band was making a mess of Reed's simpler pop songs rather than when duplicating the original, eerie recordings of 'Black Angel Death Song' or the gruesome, cautionary tale, 'The Gift' (children do not open man-sized parcels with power tools). The only new song was 'Coyote', a slower number which closed the second encore, signalling to the demanding crowd that it could expect no more. The Velvets' original songs are entirely preoccupied with Manhattan nightlife, quite free of nature references. 'Coyote' is a not a Velvets' song, it is latter day Lou Reed. It was a pleasure to see and hear the enjoyment with which they performed the old favourites. But they can never again be the dangerous, amphetamine-powered creatures they were when they created these songs. It is not just rock fans who grow nostalgic for irresponsible youth . . .</p>

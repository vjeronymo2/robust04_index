			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SECOND TIME AROUND  </P> <P> Critics liked it, but American moviegoers were less excited. So why did  producer Dodi Fayed make a sequel to his 1986 thriller "F/X"?  </P> <P> Fayed points to "F/X's" worldwide box-office tally: $55 million ($27 million  from North America) -- a solid figure for a film shot for $10 million.  </P> <P> "F/X II," now in post-production for Orion Pictures, cost about $16 million.  Set for March release, it again re-teams Bryan Brown as a movie special-effects  man and Brian Dennehy as a tough cop.  </P> <P> Fayed admits that he'd have preferred to have the sequel come out much closer  to the original. But: "It has a big following. Brown and Dennehy say that for  the past few years they're always asked (in interviews) about the sequel."  </P> <P> The promo campaign, adds Fayed, will "remind audiences of the first film."  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Fayed is involved in the two Peter Pan projects, "Hook" and "Peter  Pan." He had held "Peter Pan" rights since 1985 when he heard that Tri-Star  Pictures was talking "Hook" with filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Consequently,  Fayed is now executive producer of the Spielberg film, which stars Dustin  Hoffman as Captain Hook and Robin Williams as a grown-up Peter Pan.  </P> <P> Fayed hopes to begin production on a more traditional "Peter Pan" in the fall,  also for Tri-Star, though no director or stars are yet attached.

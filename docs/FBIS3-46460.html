			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Criticizes Hong Kong Government's </F> Arguments on Airport Loans"]    [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Zhang Junsheng,  deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, has criticized  the Hong Kong Government's arguments about the airport loans,  saying that the Hong Kong Government deliberately disregarded  and evaded the relevant provisions of the Sino-British  Memorandum of Understanding on the airport project in an attempt  to make the future Special Administrative Region [SAR]  Government bear the responsibility for the consequences of the  decision unilaterally made by the British Hong Kong authorities  without consultation between the Chinese side and the British  side.    Before attending an award ceremony held by TA KUNG PAO,  Zhang  was asked by reporters to comment on the British Hong Kong  authorities' argument that the credit line of HK$5 billion [Hong  Kong dollars] was only part of the credit arrangements made by  the Hong Kong Government. Zhang said: The Sino-British  Memorandum of Understanding on the airport issue clearly  specified the credit limits and arrangements. That is, on 30  June 1997, the British side should leave HK$25 billion in  financial reserves for the SAR Government, and the British side  can arrange loans of less than HK$5 billion with the endorsement  of the Chinese side. Any loan arrangements that exceed HK$5  billion which must be borne by the SAR Government must be first  discussed by the Chinese and British Governments before a final  decision is made. All this was clearly spelled out in the  memorandum.    He pointed out that the airport memorandum of understanding  did not indicate that "loans arranged by the Airport Authority  and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation would not be included  in the 5-billion-dollar limit." Zhang said that the British  Hong Kong authorities changed the Airport Authority into a  corporation in an attempt to dodge the relevant provisions of  the Memorandum of Understanding. He criticized the British Hong  Kong authorities for trying to shirk their responsibilities to  the future SAR government while unilaterally making a decision  without consulting the Chinese side and without the endorsement  of the Chinese side.</p>

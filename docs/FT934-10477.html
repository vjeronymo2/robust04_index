			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Calling a halt to the price escalator: The water industry regulator's plans for a fair deal for customers THE LAUNCH phase for the privatised water industry is over. Now, the water companies must work for their profits. This was the message that Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water regulator, put across yesterday with the publication of his consultation document on the forthcoming price review. The paper stems from Mr Byatt's duty to lay down a formula for price increases above the rate of inflation for all the privatised water companies in England and Wales. The formula takes into account the industry's investment costs and the costs which are imposed on water suppliers by tighter water standards, particularly at European Community level. The result is known as the 'K factor' and this sets a cap on price increases. When the price formula was originally set in 1989, the K factor was deliberately set at a generous level for the water companies to ensure that they earned high returns: the industry was new, the risks were unfamiliar, and the stock market needed reassurance. But water bills have increased by 5 per cent in real terms every year, and newspaper headlines have been full of water company chairmen's inflated salaries. Mr Byatt is now preparing for the first five-yearly review next summer, and yesterday's paper laid out his approach. It was summed up by his comment: 'I want to get customers off the endless price escalator. The water industry will have to earn its profits and its dividends through greater efficiency.' The main proposal he made was to reduce the rate of return on water industry assets from the present level of 7 per cent to the lower end of the 5 per cent to 6 per cent range. This is partly because the risks of privatisation are now over, but also because interest rates have fallen sharply since 1989. The level is far below the 9.5 per cent that the water industry says is the minimum needed to attract outside capital. It is also below the 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent which the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recently recommended for another utility, British Gas. Mr Byatt says the low level is because water is a low risk business, although he stresses that the formula will be tailored to each water company depending on its circumstances. Companies will have to lower their rates of return over 10 years. This may encourage them to bring forward investment plans so they can benefit from today's higher rates. Mr Byatt also proposes to amend some financial criteria, such as interest cover (the amount of times interest costs are covered by earnings). This means that water companies will have to borrow more or achieve greater efficiency to fund improvements in service and investments rather than look to higher prices as in the past. But Mr Byatt was wary of promising water customers that price rises will stop altogether, let alone go into reverse. He spoke only of 'moderating the escalator'. This is because the price formula includes an element over which he has no control: the cost of EC-mandated quality improvements which are automatically passed straight on to the customer. These have been estimated to cost as much as Pounds 45bn over the next decade. Mr Byatt has already said he thinks the EC standards are too costly. Last month Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, agreed and promised to sound out EC partners to see if the urban waste water directive could be modified. Meanwhile Mr Byatt will have to do his sums using a variety of assumptions about EC costs. The implication of yesterday's paper is that it is now up to the government to act if it wants to stem further water price rises. Mr Byatt was careful yesterday to avoid putting any actual numbers on the price formula. He said it was too early, and too many unknowns hung in the balance. This left the stock market without much to go on, although it gave the industry heart because it implied that Ofwat has still got an open mind about the detail. Water companies will go into discussions with Mr Byatt hoping to negotiate better terms for themselves, and much of their case will rest on their claim that he is underestimating the risks they have to deal with, and the uncertainties created by the EC directives.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WATER CHARGES: THE OFWAT SQUEEZE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Rapid rises in water prices to be moderated by obliging companies to   reduce costs for existing services, and fund improvements through   greater efficiency  -Price increases will only be allowed to help meet new quality and   environmental obligations  -Rate of return on new investment to be cut from 7 per cent to   around 5 per cent or 6 per cent  -Higher returns on existing investment not to be clawed back, but   should converge with new rate over 10 years  -Companies will have scope to increase efficiency and raise dividends  -Cost of connecting a house to water and sewerage to be limited to   Pounds 200 for each service  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

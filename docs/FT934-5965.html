			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Survey of Gloucestershire (1): The idyll is clouded - The quest for new businesses is being impeded by contraction in important regional industries and uncertainty over the future of local authorities. The county has responded with the launch of an economic strategy forum Gloucestershire has always been seen as one of the more fortunate English counties, with a rural prosperity suggested by its Cotswold villages, grand country houses, the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester, and the Cheltenham Gold Cup. It is assumed to be a shire where the living is good. Today, the image is flawed. The county is indeed a pleasant place to live and work, and leading companies have chosen to be based there: state-owned Nuclear Electric, Gulf Oil (GB), Eagle Star insurance group and Mitsubishi's Colt Cars are among them. They have been attracted by the skilled and stable workforce, good access to the M4 and M5 motorways, and by being within reach of London but able to enjoy lower property and labour costs. The population has risen steadily, boosted by relocations, especially in financial services. In just two years to September 1989, 21,000 net additional jobs were created. Agriculture now accounts for only 2 per cent of the labour force. Contrary to the popular image, the backbone of the economy - once provided by sheep and woollen mills - is manufacturing, and especially engineering and electronics. But here is the catch: no fewer than 14 per cent of the companies are estimated to be involved in the defence and aerospace industries, with Dowty, Smiths Industries and the government's GCHQ at Cheltenham among the biggest employers. The contraction of these industries is happening at a time when the recession has stopped growth in financial services and in tourism. In just three years, unemployment has nearly trebled, rising from only 3 per cent in 1990 to 8.8 per cent in September. This represents 22,000 people, 1,500 fewer than last February and still below the national average, but the differential has sharply narrowed. Industrial restructuring increases the vulnerability of regional plants. The head office of Dowty moved out of the county after last year's takeover by TI. Earlier this year, there were big job losses in Gloucestershire, when Meko International, a mining equipment company, subject of a buy-out from Dowty, merged with Dobson Park Industries and work was consolidated in Lancashire. 'The regional economy is under very great pressure,' says John Sewell, leader of the Liberal Democrats, the largest group on the county council. 'In economic development terms, Gloucestershire is caught between the grants available in south Wales and the effects of the M4 motorway corridor, which stretches as far as Swindon.' It is also midway between the heavyweight cities of Bristol and Birmingham. 'What we have to do,' says Mr Sewell, 'is to form the seedbed for new businesses to grow - there is simply no other way round it. We have a very skilled workforce; we have lots of people with ideas.' Economic planning for such a seedbed is clouded by the uncertainties that surround the future of local authorities. In its draft proposals, the Local Government Commission recommended replacing the county council and six district councils with four unitary authorities. And the council has been capped by the government for the second successive year, and has had Pounds 10m lopped off its proposed budget. All three political parties had voted in favour of the higher budget. (The council has been hung since the mid-1980s, but in May the Liberal Democrats increased their share of seats to two short of an overall majority.) Mr Sewell says education, in particular, is suffering as a consequence of the capping. As for the proposed council reorganisation, he describes the commission's proposals as a non-starter. All three parties had voted for the status quo. Michael Honey, the council's chief executive, is confident that the commissioners are now listening. 'The public is saying it wants the existing two-tier structure, which works very well here; and it is certainly not worth spending Pounds 20m or more and going through all the upheaval to unstitch it. From the business point of view, the message we have heard loud and clear is: if you are going to change the status quo, go for a single unitary authority, which has enough clout to look strategically at the issues.' The need for this clout resulted this year in the setting up of an economic strategy forum, a partnership between the public and private sectors. 'Ways need to be found to ensure unemployment is brought down by getting the local economy to outperform the rest of the UK,' Mr Honey says. The forum will be co-ordinated with similar initiatives in neighbouring counties to create a more effective voice. 'People realise we have to be part of a larger sub-regional force in order to be successful in getting inward investment into this part of the country.' He remains optimistic. 'One of the great assets is the delightful environment which is one of the attractions to firms staying here and relocating here. It is a thriving economy, even though it is suffering obviously from the rundown in the defence industries. But we have an economy rapidly retooling itself and diversifying into other areas.' Some defence-related companies have been slow to do this, but a strength of Gloucestershire is the variety of small businesses and often high-tech companies. Roger Empson, managing director of Krone (UK) Technique, a Cheltenham-based subsidiary of a German company making patented telecom and data connections systems, says it has more than doubled its turnover in the past six years to over Pounds 20m and is highly profitable. 'The Germans are convinced that their investment here was absolutely the right decision for market, technological and productivity reasons.' Other significant companies in their own market include Racal-Redac, the Tewkesbury-based subsidiary of Racal Electronics and the world's third largest software company for electronic design automation. Norville Optical, a family-owned company based in Gloucester, employs more than 800 people and describes itself as the UK's largest optical supplier. Sapa Holdings, with nearly 700 staff in the county, has big market shares in windows and doors. Vince Taylor, of the accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which is advising the strategy forum, says: 'The county has a large number of world-class companies and in some ways has been more of a leader than follower. It has been able to generate its own exports, which is interesting given that a lot of people think all the growth for the future will happen in the east, because that is nearer continental Europe.' This may be a good portent, since the Channel tunnel, due to open next year, otherwise threatens to emphasise the county's peripherality. Another positive indicator is that the head-office culture, and natural environment, should continue to attract senior staff and encourage a network of support companies and professional services. The strategy forum shows a recognition that, while Whitehall may adopt an attitude of laisser faire, Gloucestershire itself has to act to stay in the forefront of places to live and work. The expansion in the 1980s may have been counter-productive in one respect: it gave the impression to the outside world that Gloucestershire did not need more investment. As John Cripps, chief executive of Gloucestershire chamber of commerce, says: 'The message now is Gloucestershire is not closed for business, but open for business.'</p>

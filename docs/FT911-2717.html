			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Fraud office probes lending scheme: Banks and mortgage groups may have lost Pounds 30m through Castlegate THE Serious Fraud Office is investigating the possible loss of up to Pounds 30m on loans made by banks and mortgage lenders through Castlegate Group, a consumer finance company based in Reading, Berkshire. The company went into creditors' voluntary liquidation last December. National Home Loans, the mortgage company, said yesterday that it had written off Pounds 3.5m in funds provided to Castlegate for second mortgages and consumer finance. Other lenders involved include National Westminster Bank and an unidentified Scottish bank which is believed to have lent more than Pounds 10m through Castlegate. Mr Kevin Milner, chief executive of National Home Loans, declined to give details of how his company came to lose money through Castlegate. 'We have been advised by the Serious Fraud Office not to discuss the matter,' he said. Mr Michael Radford, senior partner at Radford, Sons and Co, the Southampton firm acting as liquidator for Castlegate, said: 'Things are an awful mess. Nobody has got any idea at all of the overall position of the group. One can do the figures until the cows come home and reach different conclusions each time.' Mr Radford said his work as liquidator had been hampered by the fact that the police had removed most of the group's records. Castlegate offered consumer finance and guaranteed-return investments. It told companies that participated in its lending schemes that all advances to borrowers were fully secured by mortgages on homes. The schemes broke down when valuations on the properties proved to be inflated and four small companies working with Castlegate were forced into administrative receivership during October and November. That triggered Castlegate's eventual collapse. NHL results, Page 8</p>

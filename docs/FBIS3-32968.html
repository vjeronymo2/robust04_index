The council members decided to answer with silence  and to abstain from answering any message. They will wait for  the results of an investigation being conducted by the Attorney  General's Office and Congress. This is President Gaviria's  answer to the State Council:    Given the declaration approved by you yesterday I want to  address, through you, all the council members to reassert, as a  citizen and president of Colombia, that that high-ranking  organization deserves my greatest respect; and, by defending the  government's views in connection with the cooperation given by  foreign military members in our country, I did not seek to  insult that important organization. Instead, I wanted to  clearly state our views on matters that are extremely important  for the country.    I fully share your views, meaning you would rather wait  until  a debate is held in Congress to carefully analyze the two sides'  position. In the end, allow me to tell you I do not consider  this disparity of viewpoints to be a confrontation between  branches. Instead, it is a characteristic of a democracy.</p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / British Gas likely to escape break-up in MMC report BRITISH GAS is expected to escape a recommended break-up in the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report due to be released tomorrow. However, the report is likely to call for a more transparent structure to the giant gas company and the phased removal of its monopoly of the tariff market for households and small businesses. A second report will also recommend a rate of return for British Gas's pipeline and storage business, setting the stage for greater competition by new entrants into the gas market. The contents of the two long-awaited reports have remained closely guarded since they were delivered by the MMC to the Department of Trade and Industry and Ofgas, the industry regulator, two weeks ago. Even British Gas has only seen part of the reports. It will receive both today, ahead of tomorrow's publication. Unusually, the MMC is expected to make a statement about the reports tomorrow. This is because of the complications caused by the four separate monopoly references which triggered the reports, and the fact that they are being released before the government has had the opportunity to decide what action to take. The DTI will be issuing the reports without comment. Ministers intend to study them for some weeks before deciding whether to accept their recommendations. Ofgas will have to decide whether to implement the recommendations for the pipeline and storage business, though it has already agreed to coordinate any action with the DTI. This will mean further uncertainty for British Gas which has been resisting a possible break-up. The expectation that the MMC's recommendations will be less severe on British Gas than originally expected helped drive the company's share price up 25p to 333p last week, a record high. Mr Michael Sayers, gas industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, said: 'I am not expecting the MMC to recommend a full scale break-up of British Gas. But I do think there will be a move towards complete accounting separation of the transport and storage business.' British Gas's competitors hope the MMC will recommend lowering the threshold for entry into the tariff market. At the moment, British Gas has a monopoly of all customers who use less than 2,500 therms a year, the majority of gas consumers. See Lex</p>

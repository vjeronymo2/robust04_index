			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo by Paz </F> Tejerina in Buenos Aires on 10 April]    [Text] [Tejerina] Will there be changes in the economic  plan after the elections?    [Cavallo] No. The election results, in this case, do not  have much bearing on the economic policy. We are going to  maintain the same course foreseen in the Argentina is Growing  program. I do not understand those who contend that there is a  clash between Cavallo and the president. The success of the  president's economic policy worked to our advantage in the  elections. Now the economic policy will be maintained and will  continue to have the same favorable repercussions as it has had  so far.    [Tejerina] Should we expect consumption to be more heavily  taxed now that we are to start a new stage geared to increasing  domestic savings?    [Cavallo] There may be a tariff improvement, but domestic  taxes will not be increased. Consumption already is  sufficiently taxed so as to discourage it. Now we must try to  control it, which does not mean it will go down.    [Tejerina] Will you resort to an increase in interest rates?    [Cavallo] That will come as a matter of course; interest on  housing anyway, because the average 16 percent currently in  effect is enough to provide enough protection to banks.    We are working on a reorientation of the domestic economic  scheme based on decisions made by companies and entrepreneurs.  We have already provided them with concrete elements to  understand this process.    [Tejerina] Do you feel reassured by the PJ's [Justicialist  Party] victory in Santiago del Estero Province?    [Cavallo] Victory is important. Federal trustee [Juan]  Schiaretti accomplished a remarkable task. He reorganized  Santiago del Estero and this was reflected in the election  results.    In other provinces, however, spending has increased. It is  important to change this. The privatization of the National  Savings and Insurance Fund, for example, will prevent the state  from running into further debt. Furthermore, we will generate  benefits by cutting back on expenditures.</p>

Seoul's top representative Song Yong-tae compared the break  to winter hibernation, hoping that inter-Korean relations would  wake up from winter sleep.    Song's North Korean counterpart Pak Yong-su chided they  wasted one whole season and called for successful conclusion of  their negotiations within the day.    -- Spiked words were exchanged even before the two sides sat  down for the negotiations.    Pak make the first strike after pointing to Song's big  briefcase. "I only brought a small envelope containing a draft  agreement because I am intent on reaching an agreement today,"  said Pak, "But I see that you brought a big briefcase and  obviously have a lot to say about this and that."    Song laughed it off, saying he brought the briefcase to take  home the presents since it's Pak's turn to give the gifts.    -- A remark on how Seoul is celebrating its 600th birthday  immediately met retaliation from Pyongyang who recognizes Koryo  Dynasty as the first unified Korea.    Song explained how Seoul was trying to restore Kyongbuk  Palace by 1997 to celebrate the 600th anniversary and is  preparing for the visit Korea year. He went on to say how he  wants to see foreign tourists travel back and forth between the  two sides.    Pak immediately retaliated Song's historical perspective. He  described how his country completed reconstructing the tomb of  King Wangkon, the founder of Koryo Dynasty last January to mark  his 1,117th birthday.    He named Wangkon as the first king of a unified nation as he  emphasized the historical surroundings linking Koryo to North  Korea.    -- Song changed the subject to just-ended Lillehammer Winter  Olympics, reminding how the Seoul team won a record-breaking  number of medals and saying he was sorry to hear North Korea  could not field its athletes due to injury.    He indirectly hinted how an inter-Korean unified team would  do so much better at international games and urged North Korea  to open to various exchanges.    Song replied everything will go well once the two sides  exchange presidential envoys.    -- Top interest among North Korean journalists was  apparently  who Seoul will pick as its envoy.    Many asked if the Southern side already decided who is to be  sent as the envoy while hinting that Pyongyang may choose  between Kim Yong-sun, party secretary for South Korean Affairs,  and Vice President Kim Yong-chu.</p>

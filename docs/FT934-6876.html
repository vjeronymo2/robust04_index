			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / People: Thomas Cook Graham Rider has been appointed managing director of Financial Institution Services at Thomas Cook. Rider, 40, joins the travel and financial services group from Storehouse, where he was group finance director, as well as being finance director of British Home Stores. Previous jobs were also in the retail sector as financial controller at Woolworths and at House of Fraser. A move to Thomas Cook's retail travel chain would have kept Rider in a mass consumer industry. His responsibilities on Thomas Cook's financial side will, however, be somewhat different. The subsidiary he will head provides travellers' cheques, foreign currencies, drafts and wires to about 8,000 financial institutions. Rider concedes that his new job is in a different line of business from his previous positions. But he says his retail background will help him fulfil Thomas Cook's aim for the subsidiary, which is to improve customer service. Another change is the move from a quoted UK company to an organisation controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank and LTU, the German travel group. Rider says that although he will no longer have to deal with shareholder matters, Thomas Cook is sufficiently large to provide him with other challenges.</p>

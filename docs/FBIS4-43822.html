			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting of some 20 French ambassadors to Africa in  Dakar has ended. They were meeting with the French foreign  minister and the French cooperation minister. Obviously a lot  was said about the effects of the devaluation of the African  Financial Community [CFA] franc. Nicolas Balique:    [Balique] There were two leitmotivs during this meeting,  which was attended by 20 or so ambassadors not only to  francophone Africa, but also to anglophone countries, such as  Nigeria and Ghana, and Portuguese-speaking countries, such a s  Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde.    First there was the follow-up to the so-called  postdevaluation period. According to Mr. Juppe, the first  results are promising for the change in parity regarded as  essential, and which certainly does not mean any sort of  abandonment by France. The French foreign minister added that  some 6 billion French francs, out of the 12 billion scheduled  for this year, had been released by the main partners of the CFA  zone.    The second aspect was the process of democratization. Here  too encouraging signs were noted, in spite of some backward  steps, especially in Burundi and Nigeria. The main thing, said  Mr. Juppe at the closing ceremony of this third meeting of  ambassadors -- coming after the ones in Tokyo and New Delhi --  is to keep heading toward democracy which is closely tied to the  economic recovery of the countries involved.</p>

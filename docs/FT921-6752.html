			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Iraq responds to UN arms plan Iraq said yesterday it would co-operate with UN plans to scrap its military industries and asked the Security Council to consider lifting trade sanctions. However, in a letter to UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, Baghdad neither accepted nor rejected controversial UN plans for monitoring its weapons industry but said further discussions with UN experts were needed. The letter, signed by Iraqi foreign minister Mr Ahmed Hussein, was in response to warnings from the council to comply with its directives or face 'serious consequences'.</p>

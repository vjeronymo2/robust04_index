			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- Forty-four deals between  South and North Korea worth 16 million U.S. dollars were  approved by the National Unification Board in April [NUB], NUB  said in a report Friday.    Comparable figures in the previous month were 72 deals worth  21. 55 million dollars.    Of all approvals, 37 were for buying North Korean products  worth 13.73 million dollars, 30 percent off from the 19.75  million dollars (59 cases) in March.    The remaining seven were for shipment of Southern products  worth 2.31 million dollars, up 29 percent from the previous  month. The sharp gain was attributed to an increase in the  shipment of raw materials under processing-on-commission  contracts.</p>

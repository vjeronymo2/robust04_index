			<p>BFN     [Text] Srinagar 6 June -- Justice Rangnath Mishra,  chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, has described  the human rights situation in the Kashmir valley as serious.  Meanwhile, the state administration, in order to hide its  shortcomings, did not allow the distressed people to meet the  commission delegation which arrived in Srinagar today. Mishra  called for taking immediate steps to attend to the complaints of  the afflicted people. He said that the National Human Rights  Commission will send an investigative team to the valley in  September to look into the complaints of human rights  violations. The commission members are visiting the state now.    Mishra said the commission has received nearly 50 complaints  about human rights violations in the valley. Of these  complaints, 14 were sent by mail to the commission in Delhi.  Twenty-five complainants met him on 5 June in Srinagar. Eight  complaints were received on 6 June.    Mishra said many complaints are against terrorists and  security forces. Asked whether members of the All Parties  Freedom Conference and the Kashmir Bar Association met him  during his two-day stay in Delhi, he said there was no response  from these organizations even though they were invited through a  special letter. Mishra said before coming here, the commission  had asked for reports from the state government about 14  complaints. About the alleged mass killings in Kupwara,  Bijbiara and other places, Mishra said large-scale violence has  been alleged at these places. We will find out the truth, he  said. He said the government report on the Kupwara incidents in  January will likely be received on 7 June. It is alleged that  17 people died from shooting by security forces.    Mishra denied that the commission is working on the advice  of  the state government. He said the commission is an independent  body and its programs are worked out independently. He said  they had come to the valley according to the program worked out  out by them. Mishra said most of the complaints involve those  taken away for interrogation by the security forces during their  raids and search operations and subsequently could not be  traced. All such matters will be referred to the state  government, which will present its views before carrying out  detailed investigations.    When Mishra and other members of the commission were asked  about complaints regarding custodial deaths in Pulwama, Anantnag  and Kupwara, they said they were unaware of such cases. They  asked the journalists to provide detailed information in this  regard so that they can investigate.    Asked whether the commission will visit Kupwara, Anantnag,  Pulwama, Badgam and Baramula, they said they had no such plan.  At the same time, they said the commission has received a  complaint from a villager in Kupwara that his brother, who was a  teacher, was arrested and later killed by the security forces  near a religious place.    Mishra said that a large number of people met the commission  members, but they were unable to visit some other places in the  valley to assess the situation correctly. Asked whether the  commission will visit the valley again in view of the `explosive  situation' here, he said the commission will first look into the  complaints received so far and visit the valley again if  necessary.    The commission was formed last year.</p>

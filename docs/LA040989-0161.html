			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CAMPAIGN WINDS DOWN;  </P> <P> CITY ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> RACE THAT STARTED AS INTENSE CONTEST ENDS IN EASY WALK  </P> <P> A Los Angeles municipal election campaign that began with prospects of a  citywide debate on growth, traffic, pollution, poverty and crime ends Tuesday  in a series of one-sided races that seem to have stirred little enthusiasm  among the voters.  </P> <P> As the year began, chances for an intense discussion of the future of the city  were bright.  </P> <P> The agenda was laid out late in 1988 by the Los Angeles 2000 Committee,  composed of business, political and community leaders and academics. In a  report called LA 2000, the committee called for new structures of government to  prevent the Los Angeles area from becoming "a balkanized landscape of political  fortresses, each guarding its own resources in the midst of divisiveness,  overcrowded freeways, antiquated sewers, ineffective schools, inadequate human  services and a polluted environment."  </P> <P> An ambitious Los Angeles city councilman, Zev Yaroslavsky, armed with more than  $1 million in campaign funds, was promising a mayoral campaign run on just  those issues. "Are you safer in your neighborhood than you were five years  ago?" he asked at a fund-raising event for his anticipated mayoral campaign.  "Are the streets and highways you drive on less congested . . . is the air you  breathe (safer) and is the water off our coast safer to swim in?"  </P> <P> But Mayor Tom Bradley inherited an apparently easy ride to reelection in  January, when Yaroslavsky dropped out after public opinion polls persuaded him  the mayor was unbeatable.  </P> <P> Bradley remains heavily favored for a fifth term despite facing questions in  the last two weeks over revelations that he earned up to $24,000 a year for  serving as director of a savings and loan and $18,000 -- which he later  returned -- as an adviser to a bank. Both financial institutions did business  with the city.  </P> <P> Only one of Bradley's foes, City Councilman Nate Holden, has vigorously  campaigned citywide -- and he is badly handicapped by lack of funds and a late  start.  </P> <P> Two of the eight Los Angeles City Council members up for election -- Marvin  Braude of Brentwood and the Pacific Palisades and Gloria Molina, a central city  lawmaker -- have no opposition at all.  </P> <P> Veteran City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the eastern San  Fernando Valley, is the only candidate that political analysts say may fall  below the 50% margin election night and be forced into a runoff.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, deciding to remain in his Westside City Council seat, has faced  scrappy and loud opposition candidates, whose campaigns have cited the warnings  of the LA 2000 report. But he is favored to win Tuesday. So is Councilman  Michael Woo of the Hollywood-Hollywood Hills area, who also has contentious  opponents who have raised the same issues.  </P> <P> Gilbert Lindsay, representing South-Central neighborhoods containing some of  the city's poorest residents, is considered safe, as is Joan Milke Flores,  whose constituency includes South-Central's poor and harbor area homeowners who  have expressed unhappiness with the quality of Los Angeles life. Complaints of  traffic, unrestricted growth and congestion have been raised against  Councilwoman Joy Picus in the West San Fernando Valley, but she, too, is  expected by her supporters to win.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low Profile Races  </P> <P> There are closer contests in elections for three of the seven seats on the  board of the 646-school Los Angeles Unified School District. In these races,  the teachers' union is trying to gain a board majority sympathetic to its  demands for better pay and more say for teachers in education matters. But  campaign consultants involved in those races say interest among voters seems  generally low.  </P> <P> The contests for three seats on the Los Angeles Community College Board are  even more low profile. The only incumbent in the race, attorney Lindsay Conner,  has no opposition, and candidates for the two open seats have not generated  widespread attention for their campaigns.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn faces no opposition and City Controller  Rick Tuttle is expected to win easily.  </P> <P> Also on the ballot are four Los Angeles city bond issues and two amendments to  the City Charter. Only two of these propositions -- bonds for libraries and for  police facilities -- have active campaign organizations behind them. Others  call for bonds to finance loans to improve old low-cost housing and to finance  installation of sprinklers in city-owned high-rise buildings. The two City  Charter amendments would change procedures for transferring money within a city  department and for enacting employee pay raises.  </P> <P> None of the six propositions has organized opposition.  </P> <P> Saturday, Bradley spoke at a rally at his Crenshaw District headquarters and  from a motorcade in a convertible that moved through the streets of  South-Central Los Angeles. But the streets were empty in the noon-day heat.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the bank issue continued to follow Bradley, with reporters  questioning him about it while he campaigned.  </P> <P> Bradley criticized news coverage of the issue when he was asked about a story  in The Times that Far East National Bank held about $500,000 in Los Angeles  Community Redevelopment Agency funds last year, when Bradley was a paid special  adviser to the bank.  </P> <P> "I think it was clear from the article that the bank had been receiving  investments from the city since 1962," he said. "I know nothing about that.  That's a matter of the treasurer or the agency making the decision.  </P> <P> "I think that the important question, which somehow the reporters refuse to  raise, is did I exert influence or even ask the treasurer to deposit a dime,  any money, in any of the banks of the city and the answer is 'No, no, no.' I  wish somehow you would get that message across rather than picking on some  contradiction or some speculation that the reporters seem to raise."  </P> <P> However, Bradley has admitted he did telephone City Treasurer Leonard  Rittenberg last month to inquire about city investment policies after the mayor  received a phone call from Harold Hwang, president of Far East.  </P> <P> Hwang called, Bradley said, to inquire about rumors that the city was planning  to drop its policy of depositing its funds in local banks.  </P> <P> After that conversation, the city doubled its deposit in Far East to $2  million.  </P> <P> Bradley has consistently denied that there was any relationship between the  telephone conversation and the doubling of the Far East deposit. However, in an  interview with The Times on Tuesday, he admitted that he had asked Rittenberg  if "had they (Far East) in the past" held city deposits.  </P> <P> That, Bradley said, was merely, "for the purpose of confirming the statement  that had been made to me that they did have deposits." Bradley said he then  returned to the bank all the consulting fees he received in 1988 along with a  letter saying his relationship with the bank had ended in December.  </P> <P> Bradley's aides have objected to an account of Tuesday's interview in The  Times, which indicated that Bradley did not sever his relations with Far East  until after last month's conversation with Rittenberg. Press secretary Dee Dee  Myers said Bradley had quit the bank last December. But she said the action was  done verbally and not documented.  </P> <P> Holden also made campaign appearances. Earlier in the week, his campaign mailed  out pamphlets to about 500,000 homes. Republicans got a pamphlet showing him  with GOP Gov. George Deukmejian. Democrats on the Westside received a pamphlet  with a picture of him and popular area legislators. And in black areas, the  pamphlets had a picture of the Rev. Jesse Jackson.  </P> <P> Bradley, too, campaigned through the mails. But there was no indication that  this last-minute flurry would result in a big increase in voter interest. The  only polling in the race has been done privately for some of the candidates. As  a result, there is no firm estimate of voter interest -- or reliable estimate  of turnout.  </P> <P> But primary election turnouts in Los Angeles have been dropping over the years.  In 1973, when Bradley and then-Mayor Sam Yorty were locked in an intense  contest, 60% of the registered voters went to the polls. In 1977, when Bradley  faced state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) in what was expected to be a close  race, it was 42%. But it dropped to 37% when Bradley was favored in a rematch  with Yorty in 1981 and to 35% in his strong 1985 election victory over City  Council President John Ferraro.  </P> <P> And reporters who have been covering the campaign have seen small turnouts --  20, 30, 35 people -- at candidates' forums all over the city. In addition, the  discussions at these meetings have been locally oriented: the proposed trolley  line through the Valley, planned destruction of homes to make way for new  South-Central Los Angeles schools, dangerous intersections, overdevelopment in  the Westwood area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Turnouts  </P> <P> While of vital importance to the neighborhoods involved, these meetings have  not produced much broad debate or even an examination of the regional concerns  raised by the LA 2000 report.  </P> <P> In March, about 35 people gathered at a community center in Van Nuys to hear  the mayoral candidates. The audience was small at the Saturday afternoon forum,  even though it was sponsored by every major homeowner organization in the area.  Bradley skipped it, as he has done with other forums.  </P> <P> Last Wednesday, two dozen people attending a candidates' forum in Pacoima  barely outnumbered the candidates and their families. Pacoima, a poor, black  and Latino section of the San Fernando Valley, is hard hit by crime and  poverty. Reporters covering the area have found deep community concern about  these issues. But those attending the session heard few specific solutions.  Again, Bradley did not attend.  </P> <P> The same phenomenon has been observed in Hollywood, the harbor area and in  other parts of the city.  </P> <P> Political analysts offered a number of reasons, ranging from the reluctance of  political office holders to gamble on losing their present jobs by running for  higher office, to a feeling on the part of voters that present governmental  structures cannot solve the complex problems of the Los Angeles Basin.  </P> <P> "There is low turnout because there is little competition," said Sherry Bebitch  Jeffe, senior associate at the Center For Politics and Policy of the Claremont  Graduate School. As an example she cited Yaroslavsky, who would have had to  give up his council seat to run against Bradley.  </P> <P> "What Zev typifies is the new breed of full-time politician, professional  politicians, whose only career is the office they hold," she said. "This  professionalism has come down to the local level. We see people whose first  goal, whose only priority, is to maintain the job they have. They are loath to  risk that job, so they are more inclined to stay in place.  </P> <P> "If Zev's seat were not up, he would be in the race, and at this point in time  he would have had a decent opportunity to make a dent."  </P> <P> Richard Weinstein, dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Architecture and Urban  Planning, and a member of the Los Angeles 2000 Committee, said one reason for  low participation is the fragmented nature of the region's system of  government.  </P> <P> "I think the political landscape is so complicated and so overlapping and  divided into so many smaller pieces that I think it is hard for the electorate  to think that any election is so consequential because they know the  accountability is too complex and diffused," he said.  </P> <P> "The aggregate experience of the average citizen is that he can't figure out  who the hell to blame or who the hell to reward," Weinstein said.  </P> <P> That is why, he said, that interest in elections, particularly statewide  balloting, often centers on initiative races. "Nobody is going to pass the  buck," he said.  </P> <P> Political science Prof. Bruce Cain of Caltech said he shares that view.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Responsibility Unclear  </P> <P> "Traffic, pollution, toxic cleanups, the bay, a lot of these issues are not the  single responsibility of any one single level of government or any individual,"  he said. "As a result, there is enough ambiguity of responsibility so that  those who are responsible can be deft enough to make sure they do not shoulder  the blame."  </P> <P> Cain also said low interest can be blamed on the change in local politics, from  low-budget campaigns run by friends and conducted door to door to expensive  operations dependent on mass mailings that require computer technology.  </P> <P> "We have a political system that depends on mass communications and money  rather than the localization of politics," he said.  </P> <P> That sort of politics depends on money, and big contributors give to those in  power -- the incumbents, he said. "There has been a movement away from precinct  organization, get-out-the vote kind of things. These were labor intensive, done  by activists. Campaigns are now run by consultants, not amateur activists."  </P> <P> Another reason was offered by Alan Heslop, who heads the Rose Institute of  Claremont-McKenna College, a political think tank.  </P> <P> Heslop said that City Council districts, like legislative districts, are drawn  so awkwardly -- to preserve the advantage of incumbents -- that voters have  little sense of their elected representatives.  </P> <P> These districts, with boundaries carefully drawn to preserve incumbents'  strength, ignore communities, and make communications within them difficult, he  said.  </P> <P> Heslop, however, said there could be a rise in interest after the 1990 Census,  which he, and others, predict will show a sharp increase in Latinos and Asians  in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Those Census findings, he said, will require a major reapportionment of the  City Council and Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors seats.  </P> <P> If that happens, incumbents will be threatened, elections will tighten up and  voter participation will increase, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Losses from problem Ford dealer take toll on Evans Halshaw LOSSES OF about Pounds 400,000 at a Ford dealership which broke head office rules proved the main dent in Evans Halshaw's first-half results. Pre-tax profit for the six months to June 30 fell 19 per cent to Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 1.87m) on turnover of Pounds 169.2m (Pounds 173.1m). Mr Geoffrey Dale, chairman, said the problem dealership, where local staff had carried out unauthorised trading, was being closed. It had never made much money. Against a background of disappointing August new car sales, Mr Dale reported softness in used car prices and unwelcome evidence that consumers were deferring car body repairs and servicing. The shares fell 33p to 201p. Gloom about the short-term outlook for the motor trade was tempered by a positive view of the group's longer-term prospects. It was continuing to invest in new projects, notably multi-franchise sites offering new and used cars from a variety of manufacturers. The group is spending Pounds 5m on two of these complexes in the Birmingham area, one of which will bring together volume cars from Vauxhall, Rover, Mazda and Toyota. Rover also gained Mr Dale's approval as 'one of the more enlightened manufacturers' for its new pricing and stocking policies. Although the reduced list prices would cut dealer margins and the scope for discounting, the changes on stocks held, funding and storing would help to reduce costs. Evans held its new car sales in the first half and added 17 per cent in August when the national increase was less than 2 per cent. But profitability remained depressed in a highly competitive market. Used car sales were 4 per cent down, rather better than the market contraction of 9 per cent. 'Over the last six to eight weeks there has been a decline in used car values.' He criticised manufacturers for selling direct to large customers at a big discount. A few months later these vehicles were coming back on to the used car market and causing a glut. Although contributions from servicing and repairs were in line with last year, 'people are fighting shy of having dents repaired' and tending to 'keep driving until the car breaks down'. The Ford operation was under the most pressure in terms of profitability on used cars and repairs and servicing, although it was holding up better on new cars. Earnings per share fell to 4.6p (5.6p). The interim dividend stays at 3.6p.</p>

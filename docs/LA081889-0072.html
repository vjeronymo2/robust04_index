			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN HOLDS FAMILY HOSTAGE; KILLS WIFE, SHOOTS SELF  </P> <P> An man with a history of child abuse who held his wife and eight children  hostage Thursday shot his spouse to death, then turned the gun on himself after  a 6 1/2-hour standoff with police, authorities said.  </P> <P> The gunman, Dang Cha Xiong, 35, a refugee from Laos, was in critical condition.  </P> <P> The identity of the wife was not immediately available.  </P> <P> The children were safe, said Deputy Police Chief Lucian Neely. He said the  gunman apparently had played Russian roulette with his hostages.  </P> <P> Dang, who reportedly was released from jail Thursday morning on an unspecified  charge, had been involved in a long-standing feud with his wife's parents and  was under court order to stay away from his family, Neely said.  </P> <P> The deputy chief said Dang had told officers during telephone negotiations that  he would surrender. But police then heard four shots from inside the apartment.  </P> <P> Officers rushed the dwelling, finding the children unharmed in a front room and  the couple in a rear bedroom. The wife was pronounced dead at Dameron Hospital  in Stockton.  </P> <P> Police Lt. Andy Jackson said officers went to the apartment in the Tyrolean  Village District, north of downtown, after a 12-year-old boy escaped from the  dwelling at 2:05 p.m. and reported the incident.  </P> <P> "He escaped from the apartment and told us about it and that's why we went over  there," Jackson said. The father "broke off negotiations about 5:25 p.m., but  we got them started up again."  </P> <P> The lieutenant did not say what precipitated the shootings and he did not  immediately identify the weapon.  </P> <P> The boy told police that Dang had played Russian roulette with the hostages,  apparently sticking a bullet in the chamber of his gun and clicking the trigger  at random.  </P> <P> Jackson said Dang recently had been ordered by a local judge to stay away from  his wife and children at the 1640 Tyrol Lane address.  </P> <P> Seven of the eight children were Dang's, police said. The youngsters were  reported to be between 1 and 13 years of age.  </P> <P> Last Jan. 30, five children were killed and 30 other people wounded on a  Stockton school yard by a man who then shot himself to death.  </P></p>

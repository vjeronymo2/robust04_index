			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, 26 Jun (AE) -- At a news conference PT  [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  today began to implement a strategy he had just proposed to PT  leaders; that is, to show the people the damage the Real Plan is  causing. Lula attacked the plan in noting that "it foments  misery; it overlooks development, the distribution of income,  and the creation of jobs; and it funnels social investment funds  into the Social Emergency Fund." He also charged the economic  team with "interfering in an absurd manner with the Judicial  Branch" in asking regional labor courts to refrain from granting  compensations for salary losses.    Lula said: "The right thing would be to first negotiate with  the workers a basic agreement that would not result in losses  for them." He also defended his vice presidential candidate,  Senator Jose Paulo Bisol (Brazilian Socialist Party), who had  proposed amendments to the federal budget that resulted in the  allocation of a total of $8.6 million to the municipal  government of Buritis (Minas Gerais State), where Bisol has a  ranch. Lula said: "It is absurd to criticize a senator for  distributing funds to municipalities. This is an entirely  normal action." Lula added that Bisol's action "is altogether  different" from that of Deputies Joao Alves and Ricardo Fiuza,  who were involved in the budget scandal. He said: "Bisol is a  friend of the mayor of Buritis. He is not like those two, who  allocated funds to municipal governments of their electoral  districts."</p>

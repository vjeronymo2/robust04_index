			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Technology: Voice and radar out on cassette International air traffic control agencies and large European radar system manufacturers are showing interest in a new technique for the continuous recording of radar information and voice communications between pilots and air traffic controllers developed by a small Hampshire-based company. Walton Radar Systems, with a turnover of Pounds 1m last year, has pioneered a new system integrating voice and radar recordings which has just won its first order from the Canadian defence department. It will be used in military air traffic control at the low-level flight training base at Goose Bay on the Labrador Coast. The CAA is interested in acquiring the new enhanced system integrating both voice and radar data on the same digital cassette. And Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based air traffic control agency, is also studying the use of the Walton system, especially as a last-minute recorder capable of replaying and locating conversations between pilots and air traffic controllers in the event of an aircraft incident. Recordings of radar and voice communications are increasingly regarded as providing important data in the investigations of aviation accidents. The CAA has been routinely recording air traffic control radar data for many years. But the new system enhances continuous radar recording by making it more compact and swifter to replay as well as providing voice recordings. Walton developed the radar recording technology for the Royal Navy in 1982. It was used during the Falklands war for tactical analysis and planning. The recorders were also used in the Gulf war. But the company sees the civil aviation market offering the biggest potential for its technology. 'Radar recording is becoming recognised as a vital part of air traffic control,' says Mike Jones, Walton's chief executive. 'But it is a specialised business. Our success has been based on the fact that we have developed systems specifically for the recording of radar data,' he explains.</p>

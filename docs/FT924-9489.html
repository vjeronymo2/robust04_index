			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / World Trade News: US farm groups stand firm US farm groups yesterday were anxious about the potential trade war with the EC but remained determined in their support for sanctions against European products. They have been urging Washington to take action since 1985 when EC subsidies began to hit their exports. The EC was then their best market, accounting for half of US oilseeds exports.

The market was never closed, but US producers, who receive the world price for their soyabeans (now Dollars 530-Dollars 540 a bushel) were competing against EC producers who could undercut their price. The subsidies made oilseeds output so lucrative that it soared to an estimated 13m tonnes. The American Soya Bean Association, which brought the case to Gatt, was seeking an agreement which would roll back production to the 1986-1987 level of 7m-8m tonnes. It rejected an EC offer which might have reduced output to 9.5m tonnes. 'Sanctions are our last resort,' a National Sunflower Association spokesman said. 'We feel we have no choice.' Between 1976 and 1985, the US exported about 2m tonnes a year of sunflower seeds to the EC. That market has totally disappeared. EC farmers, said Mr Craig Weir, of the ASA, 'have been living in a dream world.'</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Hanson appoints chief executive HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is to appoint Mr Derek Bonham, finance director, in the new post of chief executive, only two months after Lord Hanson told shareholders he did not intend to appoint a successor. The move follows the decision of Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries in the US, to appoint Mr David Clarke, president of Hanson's US arm, in the role of deputy chairman. One of Hanson's advisers said Lord Hanson, who has traditionally spent more time managing the businesses than looking for the acquisitions, wanted to have a more 'hands off' role within the group and decided to appoint a chief executive. 'Although Lord Hanson will still want to know the group's bank balance every week he has decided to have a more wide ranging role in the group.' While Lord Hanson does not plan to call Mr Bonham his successor that is how it is likely to be interpreted by those outside the group. Mr Bonham, aged 48, masterminded Hanson's complicated tax policy that resulted in the group paying one of the lowest corporation tax charges of any company in the FT-SE 100. His appointment is likely to be seen as a disappointment for Mr Tony Alexander, chief operating office in the UK, who has been seen as Lord Hanson's number two. Mr William Landuyt, chief financial officer in the US, will replace Mr Bonham as finance director.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Internationa Bonds: KfW raises DM1.5bn as German currency dominates THE D-Mark sector of the international bond market was active yesterday as domestic and foreign borrowers decided that the time was right to lock into German interest rates. The Bundesbank is widely expected to cut its leading interest rates at its council meeting on Thursday, following agreement at the weekend on the public financing for the 'solidarity pact' for the east German economy. Syndicate managers said the rate cut had been discounted by the market. 'Many issuers feel that German interest rates are close to the bottom of their cycle for now,' one syndicate manager at a German bank said. KfW International Finance USA, the financing arm of the triple-A rated German government agency for redevelopment, raised DM1.5bn through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. The bonds will be priced today, and are expected to yield 14 basis points over the 7 1/8 per cent bund due December 2003, the lower end of the indicated range. The bund yielded 6.54 per cent yesterday afternoon. An official at the lead manager, Dresdner Bank, said that the bonds were widely distributed at home and elsewhere in Europe. For some syndicate managers, the indicated yield spread on KfW's bonds appeared to be on the safe side, in order to allow some room for performance. They expected the spread to narrow to 12 basis points when the bonds were freed to trade. However, Dresdner said the bonds were fairly priced, in view of the 26 basis-point spread between yields on 10-year bunds and domestic bonds. By contrast, there was general agreement in the market that the pricing on the Kingdom of Denmark's DM700m five-year Eurobond issue was tight. The bonds yielded 10 basis points over the series 105 of medium-term German government bonds. Some syndicate managers believed that it would be difficult for the bonds to keep to the launch spread once they were freed to trade, which is likely to happen early today. WestLB, the lead manager, reported good demand for the bonds from central banks, attracted by their five-year maturity and the fact that the borrower is an European Community member. Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the debt department, foreign area, at Denmark's National Bank, said that the proceeds from the issue were for the foreign exchange reserves of the central bank. The issue will almost complete the central bank's first-quarter borrowing programme of DKr12bn. Mr Sorensen said the issue also lengthened the bank's debt maturity profile, which prior to yesterday's deal was about 1 1/2 years. 'We wanted to take out some longer-term debt now that German rates have come down,' he said. CCF took advantage of investors' hopes of lower interest rates in France to raise FFr500m worth of five-year reverse floating rate notes, its second such issue since November. The joint lead manager, Morgan Stanley, said the bonds were sold throughout Europe and were trading at their issue price late yesterday.</p>

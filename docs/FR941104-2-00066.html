			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the current depleted condition of the common murre population, extirpated colonies are not likely to be reestablished in the foreseeable future without human assistance. The San Pedro Rock colony has not recolonized over the past 85 years and the Devil's Slide Rock colony has not been recolonized in the 8 years following the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Apex Houston <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  spill. Similarly, the Prince Island colony in southern California has not been recolonized since extirpation in the early 1900's (Carter et al. 1992). Furthermore, all six nearshore colonies in central California have remained severely depleted since the mid-1980's. The reduction of the geographic range and small numbers of common murres in central California increases the risk for extinction for the central California population. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Studies of seabird colony formation in Maine demonstrated that recolonization can be achieved using social attractants (Kress 1978, Kress and Nettleship 1988, and Kress et al. 1991). The use of decoys and tape recordings has attracted prospecting seabirds, which have bred once a threshold has been reached. These techniques have assisted in the recolonization by several species of colonial nesting seabirds (Podolsky 1985; Podolsky and Kress 1989, 1991). Preliminary efforts at recolonizing common murres in Maine in 1992&hyph;1994 have attracted common murres during the breeding season (S. Kress, pers. comm.). However, social attraction techniques must be applied for many years before breeding begins and a self-sustaining breeding colony can be attained. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to refine recolonization methods and evaluate their success, reference information will be needed on the reproductive biology, behavior, and phenology of common murres at an unmanipulated near-shore site in the local area. However, little information is available from near-shore colonies in central California. Monitoring attendance patterns, arrival dates, reproductive success, and behavior of breeding and nonbreeding common murres at accessible colonies in the Point Reyes area will provide a comparison to evaluate recolonization of Devil's Slide and San Pedro rocks. The Point Reyes colonies (i.e., Point Reyes, Point Resistance, Double Point, and Miller Point rocks) are the closest to the recolonization sites, are the most ecological similar, and should provide a reference for what would normally be expected in a near-shore common murre colony as well as a good comparison with the recolonization site. The monitoring conducted at these unmanipulated colonies will be used to assess recolonization responses and common murre activity patterns at recolonization sites, as well as support refinement of recolonization methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, unique information will be needed from the common murre colony at the South Farallon Islands at Farallon National Wildlife Refuge in order to evaluate recolonization responses and refine techniques. Common murre reproductive success, diet, and breeding biology have been studied for over 20 years at the South Farallon Islands as part of long-term monitoring of seabird populations required for the Farallon National Wildlife Refuge and other research conducted by the Point Reyes Bird Observatory (Ainley and Boekelheide 1990, Ainley et al. 1994). As a result of these studies, a small number of individually marked birds of known age and sex exist at the Farallon Islands. Little information is available concerning the attendance of breeding and nonbreeding common murres at breeding sites, especially during winter. Information obtained on individually-marked birds, where age and sex are known, would give a better understanding of expected time-in-attendance and behavior at breeding sites for adult and subadult common murres during the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Detailed information on common murre attendance and prospecting in the winter will make it possible to evaluate the significance of winter attendance at the recolonization sites. If winter attendance is crucial to successful breeding, social attraction methods may have to be deployed for a longer period. In addition, all accessible subcolonies of common murres at the South Farallon Islands would be examined for more general attendance patterns throughout the year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

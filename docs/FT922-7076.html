			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Jaguar reveals 2-stroke project JAGUAR, the UK luxury carmaker, has developed a prototype two-stroke engine which might enter production in the next decade. The surprise disclosure of the project represents a pioneering step among European luxury carmakers. Several of the leading volume carmakers are developing two-stroke engines for small cars. Jaguar, a subsidiary of Ford of the US, said yesterday that development of the compact and lightweight V6 engine was the result of a 4 1/2 -year research programme. Its engineers have worked with Orbital Engine of Australia, the company that leads the development of two-stroke technology, and with Queen's University, Belfast. Mr Ron Lee, Jaguar manager of engine development, said the prototype 3.2-litre V6 was 40 per cent lighter than a comparable 12-cylinder engine but could give the same output. The company's present engine ranges comprise a 5.3-litre V12 and 4.0-litre and 3.2-litre six-cylinder engines. It is developing a V8 engine range, codenamed AJ26, which is planned for launch in 1996. Jaguar is expected to decide this summer whether the new engine will be made at one of its existing Midlands sites or at a Ford engine plant. Jaguar said that the next stage in the two-stroke engine project would be a full-scale development programme in Australia with Orbital. The company said it aimed to produce a 350 brake horsepower demonstrator engine in the next two years. Jaguar's work has included the performance testing of a three-cylinder development engine. According to the company, two-stroke engines might offer significant benefits to luxury carmakers because they would be substantially lighter and much more fuel-efficient than the present generation of large car engines.</p>

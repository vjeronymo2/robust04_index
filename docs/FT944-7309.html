			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Rail chairman with points to prove Even a company with as solid an asset portfolio as Railtrack will be judged ultimately on the quality of its management rather than the elegance of its Victorian stations or the robustness of its viaducts. In Mr Robert Horton, its chairman, Railtrack has a leader with a well-charted career history. He spent 35 years climbing to the top at British Petroleum only to be ousted in 1992 when a tough cost-cutting programme failed to reverse declining profits. Barely installed at Railtrack, he was confronted with a signal workers' strike and the first public test of his management skills. For someone long used to operating in a highly regulated industry such as oil, Mr Horton's performance before a Commons employment committee considering the dispute was surprisingly uncertain. His offer to donate to charity the difference between his Pounds 120,000 salary and the Pounds 46,000 earned by Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union, if it would resolve the dispute served only to demonstrate a bizarre sense of the theatrical. For all his long experience of big company management and his enthusiasm for the railway, Mr Horton is a newcomer to the business. Industry expertise at a senior level is provided by Mr John Edmonds, Railtrack chief executive and a railway man for 34 years. Under senior management comes a clutch of directorates for areas such as civil engineering and procurement as well as 10 zonal or regional directors. Railtrack's literature makes much of the zonal structure although some train operators say important decisions are referred to head office. They also accuse Railtrack of arrogance in its dealings with them. It will clearly be difficult for such a large monopoly player in the new railway industry to be loved by its smaller partners. Few doubt Mr Horton's ability to run a tight ship - but management might give some priority to polishing a somewhat tarnished image.</p>

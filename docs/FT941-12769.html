			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Observer: Henderson's new leisure So Sir Denys Henderson, 11th and last chairman of the old Imperial Chemical Industries, has a new job to while away his retirement in April next year. The chairmanship of the Rank Organisation is not, perhaps, the most obvious choice. On the one hand, Rank is the classic purveyor of entertainment for the masses: Butlins, bingo, Odeon cinemas and fruit machines. ICI's only real point of contact with the consumer is Dulux paint. On the other, Rank as a whole is an ungainly sprawl. Besides hotels, casinos and the rest of its leisure empire, it takes in a half share of Rank Xerox and some Pounds 600m of specialised sales to the film and TV industries. It was Sir Denys who decided ICI - a tightly focused business by Rank's stand- ards - was too diffuse, and last year broke it into two companies. What will he make of Rank? And, as a pugnacious Aberdonian, what will he make of Michael Gifford, Rank's equally pugnacious Australian chief executive? The appointment raises a broader question. ICI is a tightly knit culture, and Sir Denys is typical in having spent his entire working life with the company. His immediate predecessor, Sir John Harvey-Jones, is a mixed advertisement for the effectiveness of ICI Man in the wider world. On the one hand, Sir John on his retirement lectured the nation on how to run things. On the other, his own choice of directorships proved patchy, taking in as it did the now bust recruitment group Burns Anderson and the struggling aircraft leasing giant GPA. But ICI has quite a prominent record in providing bosses for the nation. It is 30 years since Lord Beeching - an ICI director - took the axe to the railways. The present chairmen of Lloyds Bank, BICC and British Airports Authority are all ex-ICI directors. Previous ICI chairmen went on to run Dunlop, Blue Circle and British Home Stores. In their time, other ex-ICI directors have run British Steel, British Coal, Rolls-Royce and Tate &amp; Lyle. Not all these companies have prospered: but that, of course, is another story.</p>

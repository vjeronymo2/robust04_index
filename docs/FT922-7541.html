			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Laporte ends relationship with Solvay LAPORTE, the speciality chemicals group, will today formally end its 21-year-old relationship with Solvay of Belgium as it finally unravels its stake in Interox, the 50/50 joint venture between the two companies. The upshot will be that the number of Laporte shares in issue will drop from 182m to 154m, and its capitalisation, on Friday's closing price of 644p, reduces by Pounds 180.3m to Pounds 991.8m. Although it is principally an accounting exercise and the fundamental value of the company is unchanged, it is likely that Laporte's short reign in the FT-SE 100 Index will end when the index of the 100 most heavily weighted listed UK companies is reviewed towards the end of June. It joined the Footsie at the beginning of January but financial analysts believe its share price will have to reach 740p if it is to remain. Laporte established its Pounds 500m joint venture in 1971 to fend off a hostile bid from Burmah Castrol. The decision to end the relationship followed a divergence of interest between Laporte and Solvay. While Laporte has shifted, over the past decade to high-value low volume products, Solvay, Belgium's largest company, has concentrated on bulk products.</p>

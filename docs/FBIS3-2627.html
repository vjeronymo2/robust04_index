The move is intended to protect the foreign experts'  standard  of living from the effects of the merger of China's two-tiered  foreign exchange rates and from the rise of prices.    For experts from abroad coming to work in China in the  future, said the sources, new salary policies will be applied,  under which the monthly salary of a foreign expert in the  culture and education sphere will be 2,000 to 4,800 yuan (230 to  550 U.S. dollars), and that of other foreign citizens working in  China 1,200 to 2,000 yuan (138 to 230 U.S. dollars).    Foreign experts' holiday subsidies are to be raised, too.    The salaries of other foreign experts in the culture and  education sphere, and of other foreigners, brought to China  under cooperation agreements of governments, friendly cities,  college-to-college exchanges and people-to-people exchanges will  be settled through negotiations, the sources said.    The new salaries are in addition to the continuing  arrangements providing the foreign experts with housing,  transportation and health care.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / More trains fail to stop commuter jams Twice as many trains ran on the strike-bound rail network yesterday than last Wednesday but jams still built up around the large cities as commuters attempted to get to work. British Rail estimated that about 1,000 out of a total of 15,000 trains ran, though many were only lightly used because travellers were unaware that services were running or feared being unable to return home. The InterCity Great Western operating company, which ran no trains last week, managed to provide an hourly service between London Paddington and Didcot with bus connections on to Swindon, Bristol and Cardiff. ScotRail estimated that it had been able to run 15 per cent of its normal service including trains between Edinburgh, Fife and Glasgow and from Glasgow to Paisley. It calculated that it had lost more than Pounds 300,000 in revenues. Other train companies to provide services included the recently modernised Chiltern Line, Great Eastern, Thames, Midland Mainline and the London, Tilbury and Southend railway. The Cardiff Valleys and Northeast Regional Railways both ran limited replacement bus services. Some lines faced a complete shutdown, however, including the Gatwick Express service between London Victoria and the airport which lost Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 85,000 in revenues. AA Roadwatch said London had by far the worst of the bad road conditions, and police said main roads and motorways in the Midlands were busier than normal with severe congestion on the M6 near Birmingham. Traffic elsewhere was said to be no worse than usual. Jams built up on approaches to the capital, especially in Essex and Kent, and the 10,000 extra parking spaces set aside in London parks and in Docklands soon filled. BR said disruption today over trains in the wrong positions was not likely to be as bad as last Thursday. Coach operators, particularly those running between Birmingham and London, said there were few vacant seats and many additional services were full. Hotels in the Midlands said bookings were up. The Institute of Directors said reports of heavy traffic in London and other parts of the country suggested that fewer people worked from home. 'Experience shows that the longer this type of strike goes on, the greater the determination to get to work,' it said. The strikes were putting enormous extra costs on companies thought to have made arrangements to lay on alternative transport for staff or put them up in hotels, it added.</p>

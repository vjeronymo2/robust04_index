			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Enhanced scrip from BICC - Companies hope to attract increased take-up and make ACT savings BICC, the cables and constr-uction group, yesterday joined the lengthening list of companies offering an enhanced scrip dividend. However, analysts believe that most companies for which the scheme has attractions, have by now decided whether or not to pursue them. Like other companies which have introduced enhanced scrip dividends in recent weeks - BAT Industries, RTZ, Coats Viyella, Ladbroke, Forte and Redland - BICC will offer shareholders a 50 per cent higher dividend in shares as an alternative to its final cash dividend for 1992. The net final dividend proposed was 13.25p, the scrip alternative is 19.875p. BZW, the stockbroker, is offering to buy any shares issued to shareholders who take up the scrip offer, at a price of 18.875p, free of commissions. The scheme enables companies to cut their advance corporation tax bills, as ACT is not payable on scrip dividends, and is beneficial for groups which are paying more ACT than they can offset against mainstream corporation tax. However, changes to the ACT regime announced in last month's budget are expected to make the scheme redundant. If they take up the scrip offer, tax exempt shareholders who normally reclaim ACT on dividends, would not receive a tax credit but this would be more than offset by the higher dividend. Tax-paying shareholders would be better off, although the extent of the gain depends on individual tax positions. Companies therefore hope for a much higher take-up of the offer than is usual with ordinary scrip dividends, which are rarely accepted by more than 5 per cent of shareholders. Mr Ron Henderson, finance director of BICC, said earnings per share would be increased by 1.5p in 1993 if there was a 50 per cent take-up of the scrip offer. BICC's 1992 earnings per share were 20.2p before exceptional charges. Full take-up would result in a 5.4 per cent increase in the group's share capital. Mr Henderson said the group had about Pounds 30m of surplus ACT and the final dividend would have required an ACT payment of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 13m. He said the group would use the cash retained, which could total Pounds 28m, to reduce gearing. Mr Henderson said the money would not be used for a specific project but that the group would continue to invest in its continental European and North American cable operations.</p>

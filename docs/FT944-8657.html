			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Banca di Roma to take control of south Italian bank Banca di Roma, which owns Italy's biggest banking network, has confirmed it will take control of Banca Mediterranea, based in southern Italy, writes Andrew Hill in Milan. Banca Mediterranea, which has about 90 branches in the Basilicata, Campania, Puglia and Molise regions, has announced a L280bn (Dollars 176m) increase in capital reserved for Banca di Roma, which will give the Rome-based bank control. Banca di Roma said it intended to take control of Banca Mediterranea, formed in 1992 from a merger between three regional banks, in the spring, when it would buy a 4.2 per cent stake in the bank. Banca di Roma has more than 1,200 branches across Italy. As consolidation of the fragmented Italian banking sector continues, many analysts expect Banca di Roma to look for further acquisitions in the south, while banks such as Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana, both based in Milan, attempt to expand in the richer northern part of the country. Banca di Roma announced a profit last year of L880bn before tax. Banca Mediterranea, by contrast, has been hit by recession in the south of the country, and lost L62bn.</p>

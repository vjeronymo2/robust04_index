			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hu Sheng (5170 4939): "What Is Socialism, How </F> Should We Build Socialism?--Studying the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, Volume 3 -- first of two installments)]    [Text] In the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  Volume 3, it is said: "In the past, when we Marxists went in  for revolution, we fought for the lofty ideals of socialism and  communism. Now, when we are undertaking economic reform, we  still must insist on taking the socialist path and upholding the  lofty ideals of communism. The younger generation, in  particular, must grasp this point. The question, however, is:  What is socialism, and how should we build socialism? We have  a lot of experience and lessons, the most important of which is  to be clear on this question" (Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, Vol 3, p. 116; hereafter only the page number is  noted when quoting passages from the Selected Works,  Vol 3). Regarding this question, what important and new  thinking did Comrade Deng Xiaoping advance? Some preliminary  studies of this question will be made in this article.    Of course, unlike ordinary textbooks, Deng Xiaoping's works  do not offer any general definition or explanation. Deng  Xiaoping's purpose does not lie in finding a generally  applicable formula, but in solving real problems, including real  problems in China's socialist construction. He said: "Marxism  must be a Marxism that integrates with China's real conditions,  and socialism must be a socialism that fits in with China's real  conditions and has Chinese characteristics" (p. 63).    However, we must deliberate on one question: What new  substance did Deng Xiaoping's expositions on socialism  contribute to Marxist scientific socialism? Aiming at solving  real problems, Deng Xiaoping summed up China's historical  experience in socialism, and also touched the historical  experience of international socialism, thus advancing a series  of new Marxist theses. Marxist socialist theories are an  evergreen that should develop along with practice and be  constantly enriched. Deng Xiaoping made important contributions  in this respect.    Four issues will be dealt with in the following passages: 1)  The development of productive forces; 2) The primary stage of  socialism; 3) Reform -- liberation of productive forces; and 4)  The socialist market economy.  <H5>  I. Development of Productive Forces </H5>   Deng Xiaoping said in 1986: "The first principle of  socialism is to develop production, and the second is to achieve  common prosperity" (p. 172). He reaffirmed this point in the  important remarks made during his inspection of the South in the  spring of 1992. He said: "The essence of socialism is to  liberate and develop productive forces, abolish exploitation,  eliminate polarization, and ultimately achieve common  prosperity" (p. 373).    Deng Xiaoping persistently stressed that concerning the  question of understanding what socialism is, we must give first  place to the development of productive forces, and he made this  point repeatedly for many years. "The fundamental task of the  stage of socialism is to develop productive forces" (p. 63).  "The primary task of socialism is to develop productive forces  and gradually improve the people's material and cultural living  standard" (p. 116). His thesis on liberating productive forces  through reform under socialist conditions is linked to the  requirements for developing productive forces.    To counter the fallacies uttered by the "Gang of Four"  counterrevolutionary clique during the "Cultural Revolution --  such as "We prefer impoverished socialism to affluent  capitalism" -- Deng Xiaoping asserted with his enlightening  voice that poverty is not socialism. He stressed this point not  only because he wanted to refute the "Gang of Four," but also to  counter the shortcomings that had existed in our party's guiding  ideology for a long time. He said: "If we say that we have  weaknesses following the founding of our country, they are a  certain neglect of the development of productive forces" (p.  63). Hence, he also said: "We are told by 20 years of  experience, from 1958 to 1978: Poverty is not socialism, and  socialism must eliminate poverty. We cannot describe ourselves  as fulfilling socialist requirements if productive forces are  not developed and the people's living standards are not  improved" (p. 116).    We also can see from our history that the thinking of  "worrying about inequality rather than scarcity" has a  longstanding and profound effect. Agrarian revolutions in the  feudal age always and could only set their goal of struggle on  implementing egalitarian measures. This sort of egalitarianism  is also a kind of impoverished socialism, which played a  progressive role in history, but is absolutely harmful to modern  life.    Of course, putting the development of productive forces in  the first place is not to say that socialism refers only to the  development of productive forces. Deng Xiaoping said:  "Socialism differs from capitalism precisely in its  characteristic of seeking common prosperity and averting  polarization. The fortune created belongs first to the State  and second, to the people, and it will not lead to the emergence  of new bourgeoisie" (p. 123). As far as socialism is concerned,  neither public ownership nor the system of distribution  according to work is nonessential. He said: "Public ownership  as the main part and common prosperity are the cardinal  principles of socialism which we must uphold" (p. 111). He also  said: "A new bourgeoisie will never emerge in our development  process because our principle of distribution is that of  distribution according to work" (p. 255).    Some people have asked the question: Is socialism aimed  at the public ownership system or at the development of  productive forces? One answer to this question is that only  public ownership is set as the goal from which we can never  deviate on the track of socialism. Another is that in order to  attach importance to the development of productive forces, we  must treat it as the end, and public ownership merely as the  means. In my view, raising and answering these questions in  this way is inappropriate. If we talk about the ultimate aim of  socialism, it is neither public ownership nor the development of  productive forces, but rather the general improvement of the  material and cultural living standards of society as a whole and  of the people (until we can enter communism), which -- in Deng  Xiaoping's popular language -- is called common prosperity. He  mentioned on many occasions that common affluence is the goal.  For example: "The goal of socialism is precisely to help all  the people achieve common prosperity, but not to make them  polarized" (pp. 110-111). In order to achieve common  prosperity, it is necessary to develop productive forces and to  have public ownership. If public ownership is forsaken, only a  tiny minority of people will get rich, even if productive forces  are developed, thus giving rise to polarization. If productive  forces are not developed, however, it will lead only to common  poverty, even if there is public ownership.    Before the rise of Marxism, every form of utopian socialism  advocated public ownership. We should say that the ideal of  socialism is always linked to the demand for public ownership,  and the so-called socialism does not exist if public ownership  is forsaken. However, past socialist thought gave consideration  to public ownership on the basis of low productive forces, and  almost all of them called for impoverished socialism. The  characteristic of Marxist scientific socialism lies precisely in  building public ownership on the basis of highly developed  productive forces, which are even higher than those of a  capitalist society. Marx and Engels said as early as the  Communist Manifesto: After realizing their own political rule,  the proletariat must try as quickly as possible to increase the  total volume of productive forces. Deng Xiaoping also said:  "Marxism pays the greatest attention to developing productive  forces" (p. 63). Therefore, paying attention to developing  productive forces and eradicating the worship of impoverished  public ownership and socialism is completely in line with  Marxist tenets.    On the issue of developing productive forces, Deng Xiaoping  did not repeat the views of the founders of Marxism, but  enriched Marxism with new things. He set out the idea of  treating the development of productive forces as the center,  while the development of public ownership and the system of  distribution according to work must be subordinate to the demand  for the development of productive forces.    Deng Xiaoping said: "Comrade Mao Zedong was the greatest  leader, and the Chinese Revolution was successful under his  leadership, but he had a major weakness: He neglected the  development of productive forces. I am not saying that he did  not want to develop productive forces, but that the method was  not correct. For example, he did not handle things according to  the law of social and economic development when dealing with the  `Great Leap Forward' and people's communes" (p. 116). Here was  revealed the reason Mao Zedong and our party had, in the past, a  certain neglect for the development of productive forces. We  can cite many remarks by Mao Zedong and other leading comrades  to indicate that they were very eager to develop productive  forces, but owing to the adoption of an inappropriate method,  the outcome was that, in reality, they neglected or overlooked  the development of productive forces.    Only when we handle things in accordance with the law of  social and economic development can productive forces be truly  developed. Here, questions in the following two respects are  involved:    On the one hand, the development of productive forces has  its  own law. The broad masses' political initiative, set off by the  emergence of the socialist system, can play an important role in  social development. However, it cannot be transformed into  modernized productive forces if we do not work through  scientific technology. Hence, Deng Xiaoping emphatically  pointed out, as early as 1975, that scientific technology was a  productive force. He said later that it should be considered  the primary force. No doubt, the effect of politics on  productive forces is displayed in rousing the masses'  enthusiasm, but it lies mainly in inspiring people to strive to  master scientific technology. When carrying out the "Great Leap  Forward" movement in 1958, we believed that direct reliance on  the masses' political initiative and on rousing their enthusiasm  could lead to a great leap in industrial and agricultural  productive forces, but the result was contrary to our wishes.  As a matter of fact, the movement gave first place to politics  rather than to the development of productive forces, and in  consequence, we could not fulfill the goal of developing  productive forces, but only distorted the role of politics.    On the other hand lies question concerning the relationship  between developing social productive forces and developing  production relations. Regarding the relationship between the  two, Deng Xiaoping laid stress on the leading position of  productive forces. This was a breakthrough in the erroneous  viewpoint prevalent in the international community and in our  country for decades. According to this viewpoint, since  production relations of socialist public ownership are advanced  and superior, they should remain unchanged, having once taken  shape, and social productive forces can be constantly improved  by relying on them, and if there is no progress in the  development of productive forces, we must make production  relations of public ownership more "advanced." As proved by  historical practice, this viewpoint does not conform to reality  and is unfavorable to the development of socialism.    Stalin once believed that production relations and  productive  forces in a socialist society entirely fit in with each other,  thus denying the occurrence of the problem of improving  production relations. Mao Zedong did not agree with Stalin's  rigid idea, but he still could not solve this problem. When  exploring ways to solve this problem, he tried to promote  productive forces with a more advanced form of socialist  production relations, as displayed, at least, in the policy  decision of setting up rural people's communes, whereas the  so-called advanced state referred to "being large-sized and  collective." As proved by facts, however, people's communes  were seen only as advanced in form, but could not really play a  part in promoting productive forces.    We should give first place to the development of  productive forces after establishing socialist production  relations in a preliminary way. The socialist public ownership  and its corresponding system of distribution according to work  are advanced, generally speaking, but the extent to which public  ownership applies and what is the concrete form to be taken must  be decided in accordance with the state of development of  productive forces. That is, the concrete form of socialist  production relations must be changed in line with the  development of productive forces and with the demand for  developing productive forces. Whether or not various concrete  forms are appropriate cannot be judged by the criterion of being  large and collective, but depends on whether or not the  development of social productive forces is promoted.    In summing up historical experience, Deng Xiaoping  courageously set out the viewpoint of giving first place to the  development of productive forces. This is a creative viewpoint  in line with Marxism. He emphatically illustrated this  viewpoint when the rural restructuring started. In 1980,  several provinces began to transform the people's commune system  into the contract responsibility system on a household basis  with remuneration linked to output, and they achieved results.  Many provinces, howver, had not done the same thing or had just  began to carry out this kind of reform. In remarks on the rural  policy issue in late May 1980, he said: "Some comrades worry  whether or not this way of doing things will affect the  collective economy. In my opinion, this worry is unnecessary.  Our overall orientation is to develop the collective  economy.... We can be sure that as long as our production, our  rural social division of labor, and our commodity market have  developed, low-level collectivization will develop into  high-level collectivization, and those parts of the collective  economy that are not consolidated will be consolidated. The key  is to develop productive forces, and we must create conditions  in this respect for the further development of collectivization"  (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping (1975-1982)," p.  275). That is to say, under the socialist system, the  development of productive forces can bring about progress in  production relations. We will only take a wrong path if we  break away from the development of productive forces and pursue  "advanced" public ownership according to abstract criteria and  believe that productive forces can be developed in this way.    Under China's historical conditions, setting out such  prinicples as giving first place to productive forces, suiting  the development of socialist production relations to the demand  for the development of productive forces, and displaying the  superiority of socialism in the development of productive  forces, has a very important meaning. Although these principles  may not be suitable only to China and may be universally  applicable, Deng Xiaoping did not set out these principles in  general terms, but applied them to practice while closely  linking them with China's real conditions. He not only urged  people to unswervingly treat the development of productive  forces as the work focus of the entire party and country, but  also put forward a series of important questions related to the  development of productive forces and of the socialist system  based on China's national condition of being still at the  primary stage of socialism.  <H5>  II. The Primary Stage of Socialism </H5>   The 13th party congress held in October 1987 treated the  thesis that our country was still at the primary stage of  socialism as the starting point for giving consideration to  every problem. Deng Xiaoping told foreign visitors two months  before the meeting: "Our 13th party congress is going to  clarify at what stage China's socialism is, which is the primary  stage. Socialism itself is the primary stage of communism,  whereas we -- China -- are at the primary stage of socialism,  which is an undeveloped stage. Everything must proceed from such  actual conditions, and we must work out plans according to these  actual conditions" (p. 252).    Over the years, people generally considered a socialist  society as the brief transition period, which could be  transformed into a communist society soon, thus there was no  need to divide a socialist society into several stages. As  shown by historical practice, this view was erroneous.    According to the original idea of Marx and Engels, a  socialist society was born after going through a revolution in a  country with a high degree of capitalist development. In such a  country, whether or not a socialist society should be divided  into primary and advanced stages still warrants consideration.  As for countries like China, where original economic  development was very backward, it is impossible for socialism to  be a rather short historical period; moreover, China must  proceed from the primary stage. Therefore, the CPC does not set  out the scientific concept of the primary stage of socialism in  a general sense, but proceeds from China's concrete conditions.    Mao Zedong and the leaders of his generation once were  affected by the unrealistic impetuosity of a rapid transition  from socialism to communism. They also took into account the  idea that China's socialism would last for a long time, and Mao  Zedong even suggested that socialism would have a developed  stage and an undeveloped stage. Overall, however, they failed  to consider China's problems by proceeding from the actual  conditions of the primary stage of socialism. Deng Xiaoping  said: "China did not only endure sufferings in this decade  (note: refers to the "Cultural Revolution"), before that, from  the latter half of 1957 on, we committed "leftist" mistakes.  Overall, it refers precisely to shutting the door against the  outside world, taking class struggle as the key link in domestic  affairs, neglecting the development of productive forces, and  making policies that overstepped the primary stage of socialism"  (p. 269). A series of new principles and policies implemented  following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, held in December 1978, were set out, taking an object  lesson from the past mistake of overstepping the primary stage  of socialism.    In Deng Xiaoping's view, to help China realize the four  modernizations, we should notice, at least, the two  characteristics, that is, having a poor foundation to start  with, and having a large population, but not many plows. In  1979, when discussing the point of a poor foundation, he said:  We achieved great success in economic construction after our  country's founding, but because our foundation is poor, China  now is still one of the very poor countries in the world, and  China's overall scientific and technological level trails that  of advanced countries in the world by 20 to 30 years. Regarding  the point that China's socialist construction is conducted on  the basis of poverty and backwardness, Mao Zedong and leaders of  his generation also noticed this. Mao Zedong used "poverty and  blankness" to summarize this situation. However, they often  underestimated the difficulty in socialist construction under  such circumstances, and sometimes they even considered that the  foundation of "poverty and blankness" was more favorable to  drawing the newest and most beautiful picture. Commenting on the  "Great Leap Forward" in the "Review of Certain Major Decisions  and Events" in 1958, Comrade Bo Yibo said that at that time,  people believed that "in a large country like ours, in which the  economy and culture were very backward, it seemed that as long  as we waged an arduous struggle for three years or more, we  could fulfill the task of socialist construction and begin to  shift to communism." He also said: "The one-sided viewpoint of  treating 'poverty and blankness' as our country's merit also  played a certain role in underestimating the difficulty in  putting an end to our country's backward face once and for all"  (see p. 720 of the book).    It is unrealistic to believe that we can act freely and draw  the newest and most beautiful picture of socialism on the  foundation of "poverty and blankness." If there is a newest and  most beautiful picture of socialism, it is definitely linked to  the extremely high productive forces of socialism. We cannot  talk about the newest and the most beautiful picture when  socialist productive forces are still very backward. Moreover,  we should not decide what kind of principles and policies to  implement based on the general concepts of socialism. The  importance of the theory of the primary stage of socialism lies  precisely in the way it clearly points out that every principle  and policy we implement must be in line with the actual  conditions at the primary stage of socialism, and never can we  adhere rigidly to the general form of socialism or make  judgments purely in accordance with the abstract criteria of  socialism.    In the democratic revolution, Mao Zedong found a correct  Chinese revolutionary path in accordance with China's concrete  conditions. For people who adhere rigidly to the general formula  of Marxism, this path is absurd. Indeed, if we are divorced  from concrete conditions and raise a general question on the  proletarian-led democratic revolution, that is, asking whether  the revolution should be city- or village-based, such a question  is unanswerable, or we can reply only that the revolution should  be city-based. Under China's concrete historical conditions,  however, the only correct path for a proletarian party is to go  to the villages and mobilize the vast numbers of peasants to  carry out armed struggle and to encircle the cities from the  rural areas.    The same is true for socialist construction. As we are  carrying out socialist construction on the foundation of  "poverty and blankness," we must admit that we are now at the  primary stage of socialism. In this way, we must pay closer  attention to the development of productive forces, and in order  to develop productive forces, we must implement a series of  principles and policies in line with the primary stage of  socialism. Deng Xiaoping said: "Do not stick to the hard and  fast rules. In the past, we were steeped in hard and fast  rules; now we have to make a breakthrough" (p. 261). The hard  and fast rules mentioned here include the general formula of  socialism in the book. Breaking through the hard and fast rules  refers precisely to integrating the general principles of  Marxist socialism with China's actual conditions at the primary  stage of socialism and to smashing the trammels of the general  formula. Deng Xiaoping dared to break through the hard and fast  rules and found the path of socialism with Chinese  characteristics, which -- just as Mao Zedong dared to break  through the hard and fast rules and found the victorious path of  the Chinese democratic revolution -- requires great theoretical  courage.    It is difficult to make decisions on many problems if we are  fettered by hard and fast rules. Starting from 1978, the  people's commune system was transformed into the contract  responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration  linked to output. "At the time when we proposed implementation  of the contract responsibility system on a household basis with  remuneration linked to output, many people were against it,  asking if the household contract responsibility system could be  regarded as socialism" (p. 367). If we are divorced from  concrete historical conditions and ask, without proceeding from  actual conditions, whether people's communes, in which all  production means are publicly owned, or the household contract  responsibility system should regarded as socialism, then it is  really difficult to answer such a question. As proved by  historical experience, it seems that the commune ownership  (later the ownership was divided into three levels on the basis  of teams) had very strong flavor of socialism, but it could not  enhance the social productive forces in the countryside and  improve peasants' living standard, whereas the contract  responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration  linked to output (plus the system of unified management,  combined with independent management), opens up broad  development prospects for socialist villages in our country.    As early as 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We must  allow some localities, some enterprises, and some workers and  peasants -- owing to their hard work and great achievements --  to earn more income and lead a better life." He said: "This is  a major policy that can affect and give an impetus to our  national economy" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  (1975-1982), p. 142). Later, he repeatedly talked about  this idea. In February 1984, for example, he said: "We must  let some localities get rich first; egalitarianism will not  work. This is a major policy which everyone must consider" (p.  52). In the last decade or so, we really did it and achieved  very good results. Viewed from an abstract sense, it seems very  odd to put forward such a major policy. Socialism aims at  achieving common prosperity; does this contradict the idea of  letting some localities and some people get rich first?  However, if viewed from the actual conditions at the primary  stage of socialism, this policy is entirely understandable and  essential. China is so large and various localities are so  widely different from each other, if all localities and people  were to advance at the same pace, such egalitarianism would only  sink us into poverty.    Allowing various economies of non-public ownership to exist,  but with the public ownership at the core, is also an extremely  important major policy. Deng Xiaoping said: "We allow the  development of the individual economy and also the development  of Sino-foreign joint ventures and solely foreign-invested  enterprises, but socialist public ownership remains the main  body" (p. 110). Concerning the question of foreign investment,  he said: "The socialist economic foundation is very large, and  will not be rocked by intakes of tens and hundreds of billions  in foreign capital. Taking in foreign capital definitely can  serve as an important supplement to our socialist construction,  which in today's view, can be described as indispensable" (p.  65). In light of this viewpoint and also according to the  concrete historical situations of the areas of Hong Kong, Macao,  and Taiwan, he set out the unprecedented idea of "one country,  two systems." He said: "Socialism must be the main body of  China, but some areas in our country, such as Hong Kong and  Taiwan, are allowed to practice capitalism" (p. 59). "Socialism  is socialism in a region with a population of 1 billion. This is  a prerequisite without which things will not work. Under such a  prerequisite, we can allow alongside us the practice of  capitalism in small areas and within a small scope. We believe  that the authorized existence of capitalism within a small scope  is even more advantageous to the development of socialism" (p.  103).    We cannot adhere to the book formula on how to construct  socialism. It seems that this is a very clear argument, but it  will be a major breakthrough when we grasp this point in  practice. Just like the idea of encircling the cities from the  rural areas put forward by Mao Zedong in those days, dogmatists  will reckon Deng Xiaoping's viewpoints as absurd arguments that  depart from the classics and rebel against orthodoxy. Deng  Xiaoping stressed that Marxism must be developed and that we  could never treat it as dogma. He said: "In the past, we scored  a victory in the revolution by encircling the cities from the  rural areas. This point is not covered by the books on  Marxism-Leninism. Now, we still uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao  Zedong Thought. Here, we have some parts of inheritance and  some parts of development. To be precise, what we mean by  socialist construction is to build socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and only in this way can we truly uphold  Marxism" (p. 191).    What was said in the books written by Marx and Engels was  only a envisaged idea of the future socialist system. Since  they summed up the reasonable elements of the desired socialist  pictures depicted by generations of advanced figures, and in  particular, studied the rise of capitalism and its development  history, and pointed out that the capitalist system was doomed,  so their envisaged idea of the socialist system was scientific  in nature. However, their envisaged idea could only sketch a  broad outline of the socialist system. Lenin had preliminary  practice of socialism, but it was still impossible to set out  relatively systematic views on socialist construction. Deng  Xiaoping said: "The socialist system is not equivalent to the  concrete practice of socialist construction" (Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping (1975-1982), p. 214). If we copy  indiscriminately the concept of a fully developed socialist  system, even if this is a completely correct concept, instead of  exploring the long process of socialist construction, we  definitely can say that nothing will be accomplished. Our  modernization proceeds on the track of socialism, but we cannot  adhere rigidly to the basic concepts of the socialist system and  treat them as a current program of action. In light of our  national conditions, we must be good at taking various measures  that are favorable to the development of social productive  forces; otherwise it will be impossible to develop our socialism.    We differentiate capitalism from socialism according to  abstract criteria, thus suffering too many losses. We once  believed that as we were practicing socialism, anything that  emerged in capitalist society should be rejected. It was in  this spirit that the once- popular slogan of "fostering  proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" was  advanced. Deng Xiaoping said: "In today's view, this old  slogan is one-sided and not very accurate. Without carrying out  investigation and analyzing the situation in an all- round  manner, certain comrades even criticize some of our current  reforms, which contribute to the development of production and  the socialist cause as if they are capitalist. This practice is  incorrect" (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  (1975-1982), p. 298).  <H5>  III. Reform -- Liberation of Productive Forces </H5>   A socialist society can never be full-grown and perfect at  birth; in the process of its growth and development, it is bound  to undergo various changes in its economic, political, and  social systems, just like all other kinds of social formation  experienced in human history.    In no matter what country, no slave, feudal, or capitalist  society was unalterable from beginning to end. After noticing  that certain malpractices have arisen in the society ruled by  them, the ruling class in the society of class exploitation  needs to make some changes in certain aspects in its economic,  political, and social system and to take resolute actions to  bring about these changes, which are called reform. In the  society of class exploitation, the difference between revolution  and reform lies in the fact that revolution is started by the  class of the ruled, while reform is started by the ruling class.  If the revolution is successful, it will result in a  transformation from one kind of social formation to another,  whereas reform, generally speaking, means changes within the  same type of social formation. (There have been cases in human  history when reform led to changes in social formations. For  example, a slave society was transformed into a feudal society,  and a feudal society was transformed into a capitalist society.  This is because although the two initial social formations were  different, both were, after all, societies with the class  exploitation system.) When the United States was undergoing the  severe economic crisis from 1929 on, the "New Deal" implemented  by President Franklin Roosevelt was precisely a relatively  important reform in the development history of capitalism. Once  the implementation of Roosevelt's "New Deal" was begun, it  caught public attention from all over the world. Different  sorts of comments were made at that time, and some people even  believed that Roosevelt had transformed capitalism into  socialism. In reality, however, what Roosevelt implemented was  merely a kind of reform within the limits of the capitalist  system. This kind of reform really helped capitalism to bring  its unused vitality into play to get over the crisis. During  the 300-400 years following the rise of capitalism in the world,  various countries underwent numerous self-reforms to varying  degrees. This phase of history merits review.

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONORAIL INITIATIVE  </P> <P> Earth Day 1990 highlighted truly challenging problems for each one of us  individually and as a group to solve. With a little creativity and sound logic,  solving these challenges will be truly rewarding for each one of us and a lot  of fun with minimal expense. In fact, some of the options now on the horizon  for solving these problems are truly exciting.  </P> <P> For instance, in the Earth Day edition of The Times, "Irrelevance of Good  Intentions" (editorial, April 22) highlights the need for just one of these  pending options. Take air pollution, transportation and solid waste for  example. We desperately need to clean up our air, cut down on traffic  congestion, build new public transit and solve our out of control trash  problems. Sounds like an impossible task. Right? Wrong! There is currently an  effort under way to do all four in one project.  </P> <P> It's called the Southern California Monorail Project ballot initiative. It  creates the publicly elected regional Southern California Monorail Transit  Authority, one of the missing governmental links in the region according to The  Times. It instructs this publicly elected authority to select a private master  developer through the bidding process. It then mandates that this  private/public partnership shall be fully operational not later than Dec. 31,  2010, at minimum a 2,000-mile, regional six-county transit system.  </P> <P> The system shall carry passengers 24 hours a day and in off-peak hours shall  carry freight and during special hours shall collect the solid waste from all  six counties and take it to remote central processing facilities. The public  puts up one-third of the cost through a 20-year half-cent sales tax in the six  counties and the private sector puts up two-thirds of the total cost. The  freight and solid waste allow the entire system to operate at a profit,  generate its own energy, recycle every Southern Californian's solid waste,  eliminate the need for new landfills and possibly could even replace some  existing oil- and gas-fired electric plants in our populated areas.  </P> <P> People cannot be expected to make changes in their daily lives for the  betterment of society and the environment unless options such as the Southern  California Monorail Project are provided. This is just one example of a  self-supporting alternative now in development which will help to recover some  of our lost quality of life while setting an example for people everywhere on  how to solve our many collective urban and environmental problems with a little  creativity.  </P> <P> If you have any questions, call us at (213) 852-6958.  </P> <P> CRAIG HENDRICKSON  </P> <P> Founder, SCMP  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> A SOMETIMES EXPENSIVE SHERIFF  </P> <P> To his credit, Sheriff Brad Gates has gone the extra mile to combat the problem  of drugs. But on another score, he's proving to be something of an  embarrassment for Orange County, and running up quite a bill in the process.  </P> <P> The county recently hoisted a white flag by agreeing to shell out $475,000 to  settle out of court with a local private investigator and his lawyers; they  contended that the sheriff harassed critics and improperly handed out gun  permits to cronies. The award to Preston Guillory is the second time in four  years that the county has agreed to pay big money in cases involving  allegations that Gates used his department to investigate political rivals. In  1987, the county had to pay $375,000 to former Orange County Municipal Judge  Bobby D. Youngblood, a former candidate for sheriff.  </P> <P> Taken together, these settlements paint a disturbing portrait of how business  sometimes is done with the county sheriff, and what can happen if you cross  him. He denies all of it. But if there weren't merit to the lawsuits, it's  highly unlikely that the county would have to go to its deep pockets.  </P> <P> Part of the agreement bars evidence that Guillory gathered from being disclosed  until after March 9, the filing deadline for candidates for sheriff. Gates is  running unopposed for reelection so far, but that section of the agreement  leaves a lot to the imagination. Guillory has said Gates gave out almost 200  gun permits to friends, and that many others went to people who were not  qualified.  </P> <P> These are troubling allegations, but another way to look at the settlement is  to think in terms of cost to the taxpayer. In effect, the county is in the same  position as any government entity that insures itself and then has to pay off  claimants for the recklessness of one of its employees. Add these settlements  to his salary and Gates sometimes seems an expensive sheriff.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Phaisan Sicharatchanya under the rubric of "From </F> The Editor's Desk": "Outbursts by Khmer Leaders Do Not Solve  Bilateral Sore Point"]    [Text] Judging from their relentless criticisms of alleged  Thai military assistance for the Khmer Rouge [KR], Cambodian  government leaders must have harbored some deep ill feelings  against Thailand. But the successive salvos of stinging attacks  by Cambodian co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and  Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut last week hardly  served to address the crux of the problems.    By airing their grievances to the mass media, both Ranariddh  and Sirivut must have hoped to drum up international pressures  to force Thailand to terminate what they believe is continuous,  clandestine Thai support for the outlawed guerrilla faction.  But although they might have succeeded in re-focusing media  attention on the subject, the crude tactics they adopted also  achieved the counter-productive effect of souring the atmosphere  of bilateral relations with Thailand.    Ranariddh kicked off the latest anti-Thailand barrage by  claiming he possessed photographic evidence that showed Thai  troops helped Pol Pot escape the recent Cambodian government  attack on Pailin. But he clarified his accusation a day later by  explaining that he actually meant the Pol Potists--a reference  to the Khmer Rouge--but not the guerrilla leader himself.    Since the said evidence was not made public, it wasn't clear  whether Ranariddh was just bluffing. Indeed Ranariddh could  contribute to improving relations by producing the evidence if  it was really in his possession, so that this bilateral  sore-point could be seriously addressed.    There are enough Thais in this country who do not condone  clandestine support for the Khmer Rouge and would certainly  question any such shady military practice. Given the persistent  denials by the Army leadership of any such assistance, it would  be bound to weed out undesirable elements stationed in the  border areas which violate the policy that is, on the face of  concrete evidence.    But the breach of diplomatic protocol committed by Sirivut  was more disturbing. What on earth was he trying to achieve by  publicizing this contentious issue in Kuala Lumpur aside from  further aggravating an already strained atmosphere of bilateral  ties with Thailand? Surely he could have been more discreet,  especially since this is very much a Thai-Cambodian problem  which can be resolved only by the two countries.    As a result of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's recent visit  to  Cambodia, Bangkok and Phnom Penh were supposed to put into place  a hotline to coordinate various bilateral problems of a serious  and urgent nature. But judging from the surprised reactions by  senior Thai officials, who claimed they have to verify  wire-service reports to ascertain that both Ranariddh and  Sirivut were not misquoted, it was apparent there was a  breakdown of communications both through the normal diplomatic  channels as well as the special hotline contact.    Notwithstanding the Cambodian leaders' undiplomatic  outbursts, the deep-seeded resentment inherent in their latest  accusations nonetheless call for serious attention and  investigation by the Thai side. In essence, it would require a  combination of policy adjustments and changes in attitude by  both sides for relations to improve. Thailand and Cambodia are  neighboring countries that have no other choice but forging at  least a proper relationship of peaceful coexistence if not  substantive political and economic ties.    With the embarrassing police discovery of a huge secret  arsenal near the Thai-Cambodian border last December still fresh  in our memory, the Thai Army cannot simply dismiss the latest  Cambodian accusations outright. Army Commander Gen. Wimon  Wongwanit should be believed and trusted when he says the Thai  military does not support the Khmer Rouge. Indeed there is  probably no such policy. But the conduct of certain military  officers stationed at the border who enjoy longstanding  connections and share certain vested interests with the Khmer  Rouge is a different matter.    One alleged piece of `evidence' warranting investigation is  an undated photograph found in Pailin and released by AFP which  purportedly shows senior Khmer Rouge commanders and Pailin chief  Kim Chean toasting out-of-uniform Thai soldiers at an  undisclosed Khmer Rouge headquarters in western Cambodia. Are  those identified as Thai soldiers really Thai soldiers? That  should be easy enough for the army to find out.    The Thai civilian and military leaderships have the  collective task to weed out whatever wayward elements stationed  on the border areas which collude with the Khmer Rouge. It is  the conduct of these elements that presents the bone of  contention with Cambodia and casts Thailand in a poor light  internationally. Persistent accusations of complicity by some  officers in the gems and timber trade with the Khmer Rouge must  be investigated and those found to do so eliminated. Otherwise,  the mistrust of the Thai military will not be mollified.</p>

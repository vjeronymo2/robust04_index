Derwinski told former House colleagues  Thursday that pointing the way to a restroom could lead to a Cabinet post.  </P> <P> The former Illinois congressman told how 22 years ago he ran into a "freshman  Republican congressman by the name of George Bush."  </P> <P> "I didn't know him; he didn't know me," Derwinski said. "But he said: 'By the  way, where's the men's room?' " Derwinski pointed the way, and Bush "was  forever grateful for that help."  </P> <P> "That's how you get to the Cabinet, fellows," said Derwinski, during a ceremony  where he received the distinguished service award from the Assn. of Former  Members of Congress.  </P></p>

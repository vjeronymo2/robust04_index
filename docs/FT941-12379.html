			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Derecognition of unions expected to rise this year Union derecognition is likely to increase this year although the trend is attributed to practical factors rather than hostility towards unions, according to an industrial relations report published today. Companies featured in the survey by Industrial Relations Services, the independent research organisation, largely dismissed hostility towards unions in their decisions. Most of the companies which admitted derecognising unions said that a desire to establish a closer link between pay and performance was the main reason for doing so. Some companies, such as Yorkshire Electricity Group, cited the need to rationalise bargaining arrangements with fewer unions. Only a small proportion blamed poor management-union relations and one company said the impetus had come from the workforce. Of the 98 which responded to the survey, 25 said they had removed collective bargaining rights in some cases. Many of the cases involved recently privatised public companies or National Health Service trusts. North American companies also featured strongly. Alcan Consumer Products in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, which last year derecognised the TGWU general union, said the move had been at the request of employees since only a fifth of the workforce had been in the union. The union was told it would be derecognised unless it increased its numbers. But Alcan said it failed to do so. British Telecommunications derecognised collective bargaining for 7,500 over managerial grades between 1990 and 1992 by the introduction of personal contracts. The company said: 'We wanted to create clear links between individual managers and the company and to promote greater flexibility in the terms and salaries we could offer.' Pembrokeshire NHS Trust took issue with the report's belief that it had derecognised unions. Mr Keith Brown, head of personnel, said the trust still recognised its 16 unions for the purposes of representation and consultation. Before becoming a trust, the authority had recognised national collective bargaining which meant that no local bargaining arrangement had existed to derecognise, he argued. He said: 'We don't get involved in a national pay bargaining. We decide for ourselves what people get paid. I'm all for it.' He added that Pembrokeshire was one of the few trusts to organise its pay system locally. 'The rest of them are wimps,' he said.

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ICI insurance arm in marine deal at Lloyd's IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' insurance subsidiary, IC Insurance, is to reinsure more than Pounds 1m worth of business underwritten by a marine syndicate at the Lloyd's insurance market. IC Insurance, which was formed in the 1920s to underwrite ICI's own risks, already sells insurance to other companies, but this will be the first time that it has had any dealings with Lloyd's, where insurance rates are rising strongly after three years of heavy trading losses. IC Insurance will underwrite 5 per cent of a whole account 'quota share' reinsurance policy for syndicate 741, which is managed by AJ Archer Holdings, the listed Lloyd's agency. The syndicate specialises in marine risks such as ship hulls and oil rigs and expects to underwrite under Pounds 40m in premium income in 1993. Quota share involves reinsurers assuming a set percentage of risk in return for the same portion of the original premium, less a commission. However, new Lloyd's rules approved last summer, have increased syndicates' ability to make use of these arrangements in order to boost their capacity to accept premiums. Under Lloyd's solvency rules the syndicates can only accept premiums equal to their capacity, which directly reflects the capital traded by the Names who back them. Following the rule change syndicates are allowed to underwrite an extra 25 per cent of premiums if all of this amount is reinsured by quota share with a company outside the market. This year a number of syndicates have agreed such deals. Mr Robert Godden, IC Insurance marine manager, said: 'It is a good opportunity. It didn't stretch our resources and there is no clash with the rest of our business.' IC Insurance had examined reinsurance deals with six Lloyd's syndicates. Mr Godden stressed that IC Insurance also did deals with insurers outside Lloyd's. 'There is nothing new in it as far as we are concerned.' The deal has attracted interest because Lloyd's is currently examining ways in which it can attract institutional investors and insurance companies to participate directly in syndicates, in order to boost the market's shrinking capital base. IC Insurance underwrites all classes of insurance. Its annual gross premium income amounted to about Pounds 110m in 1990.</p>

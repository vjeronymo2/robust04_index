			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Leading Article: Protecting Iraqis EVENTS IN Iraq get steadily harder for the layman, and perhaps even the specialist, to follow. Reports of the savagery used by President Saddam Hussein's regime to suppress the March uprisings and to punish the communities which took part in them continue to pour out. Yet not only does Mr Saddam himself keep proclaiming his intention to turn over a new leaf and introduce democracy: the leaders of the Kurdish rebellion themselves appear to take his statements at face value. They say they have reached agreement with him 'in principle' on Kurdish autonomy, and that they regard democracy in Iraq as the best guarantee of such an agreement. They are even photographed embracing him on both cheeks. Meanwhile Kurdish refugees on the Turkish border are refusing to leave the mountains even for the camps being established under US, British and French military protection; the western allies are extending their protected zone eastwards along the border; and Britain, supported by its European partners, is proposing the creation of a UN police force to give the Kurds greater and longer-term security within their own country. It is indeed ironic, and at first sight inexplicable, that Kurdish leaders, who a few weeks ago were pleading in vain for western intervention in the Iraqi civil war, should now appear more respectful of Iraqi sovereignty than the western powers. Western attitude But their attitude now has to be understood in the light of the western attitude then. Rightly or wrongly, the west declared its unwillingness to remove Mr Saddam from power, or even to support those Iraqis who were trying to do so. More recently, it has been reported that the US Central Intelligence Agency now believes Mr Saddam capable of staying in power for some time, perhaps indefinitely. The Kurdish leaders have taken note of that. They do not and cannot regard the 'safe haven' being constructed along the Turkish border as a solution to their people's problems. In the first place, it is not large enough to contain anything like all the refugees. Second, it is clear the allies do not intend to stay there indefinitely, and the Kurds have to ask what will happen after their departure. Third, if the Kurds do not soon return to their homes further south there is a real risk that much of their homeland will be repopulated with Arabs and so become lost to them for ever. Key question If Mr Saddam is going to stay in power in Baghdad they need a deal with him, however repugnant that may be. As for the embraces, they do not imply any affection. They are simply the Middle Eastern equivalent of a handshake. But the agreement has still to be negotiated in detail. The key question is bound to be: what will make it look convincing enough to persuade Kurdish families, who fled in utter and justified panic a month ago, that they can now safely return? Here is where western and Kurdish strategy may converge again, in the shape of Mr Douglas Hurd's proposed UN police force. The Kurds should latch on to this in their negotiations with Baghdad, and insist that Iraq itself, as part of the deal, request the deployment of such a force not merely in the north but throughout the country. Iraqis need protection from their own government not only in Kurdistan but 'in many parts of Iraq', as was recognised by the UN Security Council three weeks ago when it passed Resolution 688; and the Kurds for their part need to demonstrate their solidarity with the rest of the Iraqi population, to rebut the inevitable accusations of betrayal from other opposition spokesmen. Their instinct is right: democracy throughout Iraq would be their only long-term security. Mr Saddam now claims to be offering that, but he must know that without external protection Iraqis will never feel free to vote against Ba'ath party candidates. A UN police force is essential if genuinely free elections are to be held; and sanctions should not be lifted until free elections have taken place.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 11 Feb (AFP) --  At a time when Chiapas State faces social unrest following the  seizure of the mayor's offices by the civilian population, the  Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] demanded in a  communique published on 11 February that all Chiapas mayors  resign or be removed.    At the same time, the EZLN, in another document sent to the  media, asks journalists to be "patient" regarding the beginning  of the peace dialogue. Regarding the peace dialogue, the EZLN  argues that the delay is due to details over "security for our  delegates" and not due to "disagreements in the agenda."    The EZLN believes that "most" Chiapas mayors "are the  product  of electoral fraud, the trampling of the popular will." In this  document, dated 8 February and addressed to the Civic Front of  Mapastepec, the rebels state that "municipal councils chosen  democratically by the people" should fill the mayor posts that  are left vacant.    In the past days, the civilian population has seized five  mayors' offices in Chiapas to demand the dismissal of the  mayors, who are all members of the ruling Institutional  Revolutionary Party, and whom people accused of mismanagement.  The offices seized include those in Cacahoatan, Huehuetan,  Teopisca, Tuzantan, and Mapastepec. According to witnesses, the  police on 10 February eliminated the blockade of the Mapastepec  municipal palace with tear gas and shots, leaving a total of 15  injured. Before the police intervened, residents partially  burned the mayor's office in order to protest that their demands  were not heeded.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPLORING WENDY WASSERSTEIN'S 'HEARTLESS STEREOTYPES' OF WOMEN  </P> <P> Some comments about Wendy Wasserstein, the subject of Barbara Isenberg's Oct. 7  article, and Wasserstein's play, "The Heidi Chronicles":  </P> <P> I too am a sad person, serious and, yes, even sexy. I am also female, and I too  go to a gym.  </P> <P> (A story about a gym is an important part of Wasserstein's play.)  </P> <P> When I stand in the locker room after a workout, naked and sweaty and, yes,  tired, I don't see "types" around me. I don't see tight jeans and power suits  and super women, all my adversaries. I see other women just like me, naked,  physical "flaws" for the others to see, insecure, vibrant, also tired, and all  going through their day-to-day live trying desperately to remain hopeful.  </P> <P> How can I feel stranded when they are all reflections of myself? Yes, even the  27-year-old, single professional women that Wasserstein so heartlessly  stereotypes.  </P> <P> And another thing. I have close friends who are "power" women in the  entertainment industry. I have eaten lunch with them. Not once have I been  dismissed or ignored the way Susan dismisses and ignores Heidi when Heidi is  obviously in turmoil.  </P> <P> In fact, the friendships I have with women are just as compassionate, just as  nurturing, just as passionate, as the friendships I have with men.  </P> <P> Why must the healthiest friendships in a play written by a woman about a  woman's odyssey be those between a man and a woman? Why must Heidi's only  consistent and long-term female friend abandon her over lunch? And why must  Peter and Scoop get the best hugs?  </P> <P> CATHY REINKING  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

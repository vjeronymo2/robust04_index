			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>   [Text] Ashgabat January 13 TASS -- The last week in  Turkmenistan marked the beginning of a transition period from  the past to a future. A national referendum will be held in the  republic on Saturday, January 15, to decide on the extension of  President Saparmurad Niyazov's rule by another term in office.    This is "the will of the Turkmens", based on the  incontrovertible logic dictating that the reforms now underway  and the whole programme "10 years of prosperity" should be  completed by the president whom the people call "Turvenbashi",  father of all Turekmens. Time has shown that Turkmenbashi "is a  capable helmsman" who can steer the state free of shallows and  reefs, according to the unanimous opinion of all local  newspapers promoting the idea of prolonging Niyazov's term of  presidency.    It would not be an exaggeration to say that the president  himself has uttered enough pronouncements about the results of  his activity which can be used to effectively sell the idea.    Speaking at the first meeting of the cabinet of ministers  this year about the results of his official visit to Teheran,  the Turkmen leader made clear that he was quite close to  translating into life his cherished dream -- to lift the veil  of isolation which is shrouding Iran, a great neighbour country  with a multi-million population which, according to Niyazov, is  making a rapid economic headway and is willing to engage in  international cooperation.    The Turkmen leader said that having elevated special  relationship with "two great neighbours", Iran and Russia, above  the common, he now has "new guarantees of peaceful and  progressive development", which most countries of Europe and  Asia need above all.    Niyazov said the same to the commanders of the CIS border  troops at their meeting in Ashgabat. Thanks to mutual  benevolence and trust linking Turkmenistan with Russia and Iran  it becomes possible to solve all problems, including those on  the borders, he said. According to him, the existing borders  must be inviolable thus strengthening peace and quiet.    Talks between Niyazov and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani of  Iran showed that the presidents see eye to eye on these and  other aspects of cooperation.    Niyazov's "own political style" was manifested again in his  telephone conversation with Boris Yeltsin during which both  presidents confirmed the importance of the latest agreements  between Russia and Turkmenistan and agreed on the need to hold a  conference of Caspian states.    Yet another argument in favour of Niyazov was remembrance  day  held in Turkmenistan on January 12 to commemorate all victims of  violence in the country's history. By decreeing that this day  be marked annually, Niyazov added another chip to his extensive  popularity in the republic.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ORANGE;  </P> <P> CANCER PATIENT HOME AFTER MARROW OPERATION  </P> <P> A 31-year-old cancer patient who successfully underwent an operation last month  to help his body produce white blood cells was released Friday from St. Joseph  Hospital in Orange, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Kenneth Summersgill, diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in 1982, had been under  protective isolation at the hospital since Dec. 20, when he received a bone  marrow transplant, hospital spokesman Dennis Gashen said.  </P> <P> Hematologist and oncologist Richard W. Opfell said the transplant enabled  Summersgill's body to produce disease-fighting white blood cells without  transfusions. Summersgill was in good spirits Friday when he left the hospital  wearing a protective mask to prevent infection and should be under the  supervision of visiting nurses for no more than a week, Opfell said.  </P> <P> "He's now producing white blood (cells) very nicely," Opfell said. "He has a  50-50 chance of living out a normal life span without any other problems with  the Hodgkin's disease." Without the transplant, Summersgill's chances of  surviving 5 years would have been 10% or less, he said.  </P> <P> Summersgill was resting at home Friday and was unavailable for comment. His  wife, Tammy, said she is optimistic about her husband's recovery and happy to  have him home. So are their children, 9 and 4, who eagerly awaited his return,  she said.  </P> <P> "They are so glad to have daddy back. They couldn't sleep last night."  </P></p>

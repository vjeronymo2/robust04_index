			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / 'We're yuppie miners - we're well paid': British Coal is close to extensive restructuring, coal supply contracts that will pave the way for privatisation are almost complete. The corporation has already undergone radical change since the miners' strike of the mid 1980s / In coalfield communities, miners are well accustomed to change and have surprisingly few worries about the coming upheavals David and Paul, in their early 30s, have been with British Coal since they left school at 15 and work at Rufford colliery, Nottinghamshire. David: We're all yuppie miners - we're well paid. The big change came after the strike. Paul: It's what MacGregor (Lord MacGregor, former British Coal chairman) said: there would be fewer men, earning more money. David: That's what it's all about now, getting as much as possible for the job. We basically work what hours we can work. We've all bought Coal Board houses; bought them then sold them. You sell it, you improve yourself, then you move again. I vote Labour, but I can accept that they've had to change with the times. You do get Conservatives - you don't get the attitude that we're working-class - we'll vote Labour. Paul: You lose before you start if you have the attitude of fighting the management; we're all on the same side. There is a young and good management here. When the new manager arrived, we'd had two review meetings, we were losing a lot of money, we'd failed to invest. Morale fell, overtime dried up. but now with these new machines we can earn enough to get new cars, pay our mortgages off. David: British Coal at this pit listens to our advice about how to work the mine. Paul: We're the experts, we'll have a discussion and we'll resolve it. Paul: Some people have left and now they're low-paid taxi drivers on Pounds 130 a week. They're sorry they left. When we were 16 it was Pounds 31 a week and that was a good wage, it was Pounds 12 to Pounds 15 anywhere else. It's always been a good wage. I hope we'll get some shares. Most of us have Telecoms. David: We've got to produce cheap coal, but its still too much. You get firms like PowerGen - they buy our coal and say they want it cheaper. You never get a reduction in your electricity bill - they'll keep the difference. Tom Watson manages Westoe colliery in South Shields. I've always been in the north-east and always with British Coal. We've produced at considerably less than Pounds 1.50 per gigajoule, and that's our target this year. But we are at a disadvantage because of the transport costs of coal to the south-east. No, the costs won't significantly reduce now, we're on the hard part. We'll have to work hard to get any further. But there are still efficiency schemes to introduce - and bigger and better machines that will give better performance. In recent years, each colliery has had to buy its own machinery, so we could only buy what we could afford. People in the north-east are generally concerned about the state of the industry and don't know if they have a future. The media hype gets through to a young person who may have moved two to three times already. I share their concerns. We don't have a power station on our doorstep, and that makes it harder. But I want to be in the frame, I want to be the manager of a pit that's privatised. I need to meet my target, I want to be top of the league. What you've got now in this industry is people who are committed and want to see it go on - the disenchanted people are the older ones. There are actually people here in the older age bracket who want to go but I can't let them go because I need the men. But it's much the same culture as it always was - the characteristic dialogue, humour, sharing problems. I don't see that any different than when I was a lad. Clive Ponder, manager at Markham colliery, Derbyshire. Joined British Coal in 1974 after gaining a degree in mining engineering. My father was in mining. He said 'don't go into it', because the Robens era in the 1960s had closed a lot of pits. Also, it's hard work and long hours. But I never thought of doing anything else; I loved it. I joined for life. That had always been the way. The colliery used to revolve round the pit village. They went on the bus to Blackpool and Skegness for their holidays; probably rented accommodation from the Coal Board. It's totally different now. They probably have massive mortgages. They want all the perks their neighbours have. Of course we've had problems. You can't come down from 2,500 men to near 1,250 without problems, but the men are realistic. They have done what was necessary to do to keep the pit going. It's a very young workforce. The average age is 32, they have a couple of children, they can't afford to be off work. About 99 per cent of miners here have worked at another pit that closed, and they don't want that to happen. Everybody is here because they want to stop here. Everyone who wanted to go has taken voluntary redundancy. There is a very honest and friendly environment between me and the men. They'll say 'not like that, gaffer' if they disagree, but they won't not do it. We're not fighting for Pounds 10 more a week now, we're fighting to survive.' Privatisation holds no concern for me. But I wish they'd get the size of the market agreed.' Bill Cook, Glen Hardy and Keith Harris, union officials at Markham, Derbyshire. Keith joined in 1965, Glen in 1962 and Bill in 1966. Glen: This industry has been the ruination of itself. We weren't answerable to anyone, and it was unbelievable the amount of money that was wasted. It was never realised by either the workforce or the industry that it had to be managed the way you would your own company. Now people feel they have responsibility. Keith: We can never compete with foreign coal, and if we did they'd just drop the price. Bill: When oil was cheap we never knew the real price of coal; and now it's gas. The EC thinks it's madness to close pits and madness to buy imported coal - then there's the risk to the balance of payments. If I could buy my electricity elsewhere I would. David Moult, manager of Welbeck colliery, Nottinghamshire. In his early 30s, he is one of the youngest British Coal managers. People used to treat this like an institution which provided them with something to do; somewhere to live. The Coal Board owned all the shops and houses - the pubs - so all the money the men earned went back into the Coal Board. Now, they're in their early 30s with a high percentage of homeowners. A lot live outside the local villages, have nice cars - maybe two. Every village still has a miners' welfare, but they struggle because they don't get custom. A lot of the men don't want to mix with miners out of work. Change has been forced on the men. They know they have to keep the cheapest coal in the industry as well as the cheapest coal overall to survive. Of course there are still hardliners. But no matter who you talk to they all have the same aim - to make sure they have a job. Privatisation doesn't worry me either way. Even as a nationalised industry we are striving to be competitive. But somebody has to decide what they want. We can't be left to close a few pits every year. The trouble is that nobody really has an energy policy. Let's know where we stand. If the government wants to burn gas, that's fine, but there should be a stated policy. Jane Jones helps redundant miners find new jobs at the job shop run by British Coal Enterprise in Dawdon, Newcastle. We've gone down from 15 to five collieries in the region, so a lot of men are looking for jobs. They end up doing all sorts of things - one had a ballroom dancing business, someone did antique restoration, we even had a priest. One miner went to drama school: we saw him recently, and he said he wakes up in the morning and can't believe it's him. It usually takes about two months to re-employ them. Only about 1 per cent are impossible to place, but we don't give up even after two years. Miners are very resilient people; they will survive. A lot of younger ones go and work offshore, so they don't take salary cuts.</p>

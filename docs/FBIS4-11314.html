			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- In an explicit  acknowledgement of the cultural excellence of those who live  outside the island, the Cuban Government expressed its support  for the reestablishment of stable cultural bridges between the  nation and the emigrant communities.    The official position with respect to this issue was  expressed by Abel Prieto, president of the National Cuban  Writers and Artists Union [UNEAC], in a special address during  The Nation and the Emigrants Conference that began yesterday  with the participation of more than 200 Cuban guests living  overseas, mainly in the United States.    He indicated that only the establishment of fluid links in  the cultural arena will allow us to overcome schematic  perceptions, biases, and stereotypes that have risen on both  sides during the past 30 years.    Prieto, together with Vice President Carlos Lage and Foreign  Minister Robert Robaina, is one the youngest members of the  Cuban Communist Party [PPC] Political Bureau elected during the  Fourth PCC Congress that took place in October 1991.    He emphasized that only serious and strong cultural  association based on exchange and mutual respect, as well as the  conscious adoption of Cuban awareness, will open the doors  allowing the substitution of stereotypes for higher qualitative  communication.    The Cuban official only excluded contacts with those  emigrants who advocate the island's annexation to the United  States and present the country's national culture as something  inferior and geopolitically dependent on the U.S. empire.    Prieto included in this group writer Guillermo Cabrera  Infante who, in his quest to subordinate the Cuban nation and  culture to Washington, has even attempted to drown the patriotic  thoughts of national apostle Jose Marti.    The UNEAC president stated that while Cabrera Infante places  the island in a subordinate and colonial situation because of  its proximity to the U.S. coast, Marti described it as "faithful  to the Americas," reason for which it must continue as a free  nation, as well as a bastion of independence and sovereignty.    Prieto stressed that, despite efforts by the United States  and advocates of annexation to wipe out the values of Cuban  culture, "a genuine innovation continues to grow among Cuban  emigrants, completely divorced from any score-settling and  anticommunist obsession, an innovation that continues the debate  on the conflicts of its divided identity and seeks to draw  closer to its nation and its roots."    In the arts, literature, social sciences, and thought, we  find valuable contributions to an understanding of the Cuban  national being and its everyday happenings, he added.    He indicated that there is an effort in some artists, who  are  considered "Cuban Americans," to draw closer to the mythical  island, to reconstruct this hazy world, seen in dreams, that  their parents abandoned, where they find something clean and  genuine.    In another part of his address, Prieto indicated that the  Cuban Revolution came about to interrupt the growing process of  denationalization the island was being subject to and replace it  with Marti's unfinished ideals and those of the founding fathers  of the Revolution. January 1959 represented the opportunity to  complete the national project and even safeguard Cuban identity  and culture, Prieto stressed.    The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which is scheduled  to conclude tomorrow, is aimed at normalizing ties between Cuba  and the emigrants, whose relations have been marked by  historical U.S. hostilities toward this small island.</p>

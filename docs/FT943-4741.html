			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Success through an innovative approach - SPL has carved itself a niche in the satellite communications business High winds and hurricanes test satellite communications to the limit. Four years ago, winds gusting to 70 mph and more raked a north American ground station owned by Teleglobe, Canada's overseas telecommunica-tions utility. Two of the three 100ft dish antennae had to be lashed down for safety. The third featured controls built by Signal Processors, a small UK technology company. Blown about so badly that the dish was forced onto its brake stops, the system nevertheless returned the antenna to the right track and data flow from the satellite continued uninterrupted. Mr Robin Smith-Saville, co-founder and chairman of Signal Processors, tells this story with relish as an example of European success in an industry dominated by large US corporations. Based on the Cambridge science park, the company is in two principal businesses: ground station antennae controllers - electronics which ensure the antenna is pointing at the satellite - and satellite data modems. Both are key to the satellite communications business. Modems are the electronic black boxes which translate analogue data signals into digital form and vice-versa. Comstream of San Diego is one of the biggest players in this market; SPL reckons to be the largest European satellite modem manufacturer. Privately held, the company will turn over about Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2.25m) this year, 35 per cent up on last year. Mr Geoffrey Walker, finance director, expects a further 30 per cent growth next year. SPL was founded in 1982 as a spin-out from Cambridge Consultants by Mr Smith-Saville, Mr Martin Smith, now technical director, and Mr Roscoe Turner, production director. It has been profitable for 10 of its 12 years' trading, albeit at a low level. Its growth has been steady, if unexciting. Mr Smith-Saville blames chiefly the dollar exchange rate. The recession in Europe has not helped. It numbers among its customers AT&amp;T, British Telecommunications, the European Space Agency, and both the US and UK defence departments. In 1993, for example, it managed a Dollars 1.5m project for AT&amp;T involving the retrofitting of five 32m and two 11m dishes with its controllers. Now the company is looking ahead to the burgeoning data broadcasting market  -customers in this field include financial dealers who want information gathered across the world on their desks. If there are growth opportunities ahead, there is no lack of competition. In its core antennae control business, SPL faces stiffening opposition from large US manufacturers like Comsat-RSI, which are beginning to offer antenna and controller as an integrated package. This presents SPL with a marketing problem. It supplies its controller as a plug-in unit about the size of a large suitcase, but it does not manufacture dishes or the motors which move them. It points, however, to its record of innovation. It pioneered antennae controls which track satellites through space by modelling their orbit mathematically. American competitors are now beginning to use the same technique: 'But we have 14 years of software development behind us,' Mr Smith-Saville says. SPL was the first to develop a low-cost method of correcting the errors which inevitably creep into satellite transmissions; now it has developed a printed circuit board which slips inside a conventional personal computer turning it, when an antenna is added, into a satellite data receiver. SPL's catalogue is a combination of 'me-first' products and 'me-cheapest'. It has developed an antenna control system for the important VSAT (very small aperture terminal) market, which is being used increasingly to provide two-way communications services to businesses in the US and Europe. The SPL system costs Dollars 5,000 while providing the facilities found in Dollars 25,000 systems. Mr Smith-Saville does not believe the company will have to find new money to fund what he sees as its expected growth and exploitation of the data broadcasting market. He is trying to balance equity, overdraft and medium term loans. Initial funds of Pounds 75,000 were boosted in 1988 by a business development loan from NatWest of Pounds 250,000 which will be repaid next month. A second loan of the same amount was drawn earlier this year. In 1989 MTI, a venture capital fund, bought 33 per cent of the equity for Pounds 400,000. The investment has a fixed life and it is now time for MTI to exit and close the fund. Mr Smith-Saville says he is open minded about the future. It is entirely possible that MTI could reinvest in the company; going public is another option. He favours, however, the replacement of MTI by a new investor who could help to improve SPL's access to the satellite communications marketplace. It would not necessarily be a UK company.

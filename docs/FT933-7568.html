			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown disposes of abattoir to Goodman HILLSDOWN Holdings, the food group, has sold another abattoir as part of its programme of reducing its involvement in the red meat slaughtering industry. The sale, for an undisclosed sum, is within the provisions the group set up in 1992 to cover such sales. Hillsdown shares rose 5p to 171p. The buyer of the abattoir, which is at Torrington in Devon and employs 189 people, is a member of the Goodman International Group, the Irish-owned beef processing group which in 1990 sought protection from its creditors. A sharp deterioration in profits from its meat business, in an industry suffering chronic overcapacity, persuaded Hillsdown to announce in March an accelerated reduction in its activities in this area. Hillsdown took a Pounds 92.3m provision in its 1992 accounts covering this and other problems. The Torrington abattoir processes 5,000 lambs, 3,000 pigs and 800 cattle a week, mainly selling to supermarkets and for export. In April, Hillsdown sold an abattoir, which processed 4,000 lambs and 800 cattle a week, for Pounds 2.5m. The Torrington abattoir, part of Hillsdown's North Devon Meat subsidiary, is EC approved. New EC regulations on abattoirs were introduced in January this year, but those abattoirs which have not met the new standards can continue to operate for three years, sustaining the over-capacity problem in the industry.</p>

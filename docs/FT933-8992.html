			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Westinghouse starts asset sales with Dollars 1.1bn division WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the troubled US conglomerate, is set to sell its electrical distribution and control equipment business to Eaton Corporation, the engineering group, for Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 745m). Cleveland-based Eaton is also assuming certain liabilities. The sale is conditional on government approvals and the waiver by Germany's Siemens of a 'right of first refusal'. Siemens, which was granted the right in 1988, said it was 'looking to see how things develop'. Westinghouse added it had been in close contact with the German company, which should be in a position to make a 'prompt' decision. If the Siemens' waiver is not received within 30 days, Eaton can terminate the deal. If the sale goes through, it will be the first element in an asset-sale package announced last November by Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse, which has been dogged by bad property loans. As well as quitting financial services, it revealed plans to sell four non-strategic operations: the distribution and control business; Westinghouse Electric Supply; the Knoll International office furniture unit; and the Westinghouse Communities property development subsidiary. It pledged to cut debt by more than Dollars 5bn in two years. Mr Michael Jordan, who took over the chair in July, said the proceeds would help pay down debt resulting from the financial services unit's losses. The distribution and control business makes low-voltage circuit protection equipment and employs about 12,500 people at 36 plants, mainly in North America, South America and the UK. Eaton said the Westinghouse operations would be combined with its industrial control and power distribution business to create a division with sales of about Dollars 1.6bn. Group sales should increase by about 25 per cent. Last year, the company - best-known for the manufacture of truck transmissions and axles, engines components and electrical equipment and controls - had turnover of Dollars 3.87bn. Eaton plans to fund the purchase initially via bank borrowings. However, it added that it was also planning an equity issue. Westinghouse shares closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 15 3/4 , while Eaton ended the day up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 45 3/4 .</p>

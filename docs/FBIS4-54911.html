			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First of several in a series of unattributed articles: "The </F> Image of Party Programs, Part I"]    [Text] NEPSZABADSAG has conducted an all-round inquiry  among the political parties that succeeded in presenting a  national list in order to make it easier for the readers to  decide on whom to vote for. We wanted to publish the summaries  according to an alphabetical order, but the answer of the  Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] arrived yesterday  after the press deadline, so we will publish their short program  in our next issue.    Questions:    1. What are the three major political, economic, social, or  welfare tasks facing the governing forces in the next four  years, tasks that your party accepts and will give preference to  even at the cost of other problems?    2. What are the three larger-than-average economic,  political, social, or moral burdens facing the society or some  strata of the society in the next four years, burdens connected  with or independent of the aforementioned tasks that you do not  accept or accept only partially, and which you force into the  background compared with other similar problems?  <H5>  Agrarian Alliance </H5>   1. Preparing the agricultural sector for the role of  governing, the agricultural program is the most developed part  of our party's program, and its title also expresses the essence  of our conviction: The crisis that emerged in the agricultural  sector requires the reorganization of agriculture. Our party  places agriculture in first place among the sectors capable of  accelerating our national economy. Our main goal is to put an  immediate end to the crisis and to create legal and income  security for agricultural producers. For this, we want to raise  our agricultural concept to the level of a government program  that enjoys a broad parliamentary support, and thus create  guarantees for the supply of budget resources necessary for the  implementation of the national agricultural program.    It is clear for the Agrarian Alliance that agriculture  should  play a lasting stabilizing role in Hungary in an economic policy  that asserts this country's interests well, and agriculture  should have a greater national economic weight in our Gross  Domestic Product [GDP], exports, and employment, compared with  the more developed countries.    Modernization also contains the requirement that Hungary  should develop proportionally and the level of development of  various parts of the country and types of settlements should be  balanced.    If the current trends continues, there will be a danger of  increased territorial inequality and social division. This will  appear not only in the confrontation between towns and villages  and between the capital city and the provinces, but also in the  increasing differences in the people's life expectations,  quality of life, and social situation.    The universal realization of the fact that the development  of  intellectual resources -- education and scientific research --  is the most profitable investment must be raised to the level of  government policy. The level of extent of these resources  determines today the level of economic development and the  possibilities of participation in the international integration.  At the same time, investments aimed at increasing the  intellectual capital are directly connected with the bourgeois  transformation of society.    2. The situation is obviously sensitive: One has to speak  of forcing important issues into the background on the eve of  parliamentary elections. Among the various possible issues, we  mention first the fact that, no matter how justified it is to  increase the professional level in the ministries and government  offices, we would not be able to pay for really good  professionals in the future either, because, in the state  administration, we will continue to be unable to compete with  the income possibilities prevailing in the sphere of enterprises  and private ventures. The development and modernization of  Hungary's defense forces is an even bigger issue, and it  requires considerable resources. At the same time, the budget  will not enable an adequate increase in defense expenditure in  the near future. And now an example from the world of culture.  The construction of the new National Theater is a really  important national issue that was decided long ago; however, it  is highly improbable that the necessary budget can be allocated  for this in the coming four years.  <H5>  United Smallholders' Party [EKGP] </H5>   1. The EKGP regards the following as partial measures of the  three major tasks:    -- irrigation development of up to 1 million hectares;    -- a maximum interest level of 10 percent;    -- industrial export subsidies of 7-8 billion forints  annually and agricultural export subsidies of 30-35 billion  forints annually;    -- an encouraging tax system;    -- an annual export volume of $8 billion and $4 billion  respectively;    -- a maximum annual global consumption quota of $200  million,  without private cars;    -- a maximum of $100-$150 million agricultural imports  annually;    -- an annual foreign trade surplus of $1.5-$2 billion;    -- a maximum annual budget deficit of 100 billion forints;    -- a streamlined army personnel, good technology, and state  administration;    -- the use of customs charges [vampotlek] (3-5 billion  forints annually up to the year 2000);    -- acceleration of investments with subsidies of 15 billion  forints annually (industry-agriculture and price-interest).    2. "Burdens" connected to important things cannot be left  "unsettled!" There can be only slight "burdens" connected to  the aforementioned "key tasks" (burdens that can only enjoy less  government interference and smaller financial resources);    -- sports;    -- film production;    -- state finance for other arts;    -- social support for inactive strata of the society  (between  20 and 55 years of age);    -- tax exemptions [adokimeles] for luxury and prestige  consumption;    -- government aid to unsuccessful banking or insurance  activity.  <H5>  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] </H5>   1. According to the Fidesz, the three major tasks of the  coming four years are the following: the creation of jobs,  educational reform, and the development of backward areas.    The new government will have to face the fact that the using  up of the future [jovofeleles] carried out by the governments in  power in the past 10 years can no longer continue; in other  words, it is impossible to accumulate the foreign and domestic  debt continuously. If the credits are used to temporarily keep  the level of social consumption high and not for increasing the  economic performance, the Fidesz will not accept further  increases in debts. Using up future resources primarily limits  the living conditions of the young generation, because they are  only left with repaying the interest on the debts accumulated by  their predecessors, while they hardly have any share of the  temporary higher consumption.    Therefore, the most important task is to improve the  economy's competitiveness, carry out investments aimed at  creating new jobs, and conduct an economic policy that  encourages saving. In addition, it is absolutely necessary to  reform the system of budget redistribution and to come to a  social consensus. The most important element of the latter is  an agreement with the trade unions, an agreement that will make  it possible to reduce inflation by at least 5 percent in one  year.    From the increased economic performance resulting from the  aforementioned steps, greater resources than hitherto should be  allocated to prevent the final degradation of backward areas  particularly affected by the crisis.    2. Although almost everyone in Hungary today feels that his  living standard is lower than the one he deserves, one can  nevertheless not promise an increase in the level of consumption  in the short term. We only have a real chance to catch up with  the developed countries if we first allocate more resources to  investments that lay the foundations for a competitive  performance.    All this demands that social consumption should not increase  according to our wishes. This is particularly true in the  situation in which both our domestic budget balance and our  international balance of payments show an unparalleled deficit.  The new government will receive this situation as a starting  inheritance.    Only a few social groups will have the possibility to obtain  greater resources than permitted by the overall economic  performance through social redistribution. According to the  Fidesz program, these are the young people and the young  unemployed. We would support them with the increased  development of education and through employment. In addition,  we will pay particular attention to preserving the value of the  pensions of people older than 70 and people living below the  minimal wage level.  <H5>  Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] </H5>   1. The illustrious figure of the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF], Mr. Lajos Fur, said the following: "The MDF succeeded in  halting Hungary's fall. We stopped at the bottom of the pit."  We can believe Mr. Fur. He should know. One can, at the most,  argue about how deep this pit is.    The above quotation is rather cynical, but essentially we  must start from a factual conclusion. Our homeland is in mortal  danger! Only firm, clear, and rapid measures can help.  Concretely, we should immediately put an end to the squandering  of this country's property. We must create the bases of a real  constitutional state. The present government kept legislating  innumerable laws, laws that often contradict each other and  leave legal gaps. And their economic and financial consequences  are not elaborated properly. Patchwork does not lead anywhere!  When building a house, one should start at the base, not at the  roof.    In other words, we need a new constitution! We must  determine the basic values of our society! Based on this, we  must create a really pro-venture legal and economic environment  that leads to economic progress. We must immediately reduce  public burdens considerably in order to increase the interest of  ventures and entrepreneurs. We must see to it that property  relations are settled in a way acceptable to all. We must  reexamine the handling of our debts, which has become almost  unbearable.    We must eliminate unemployment. In the previous development  phase of market economy, as a result of spontaneous  manipulations partially based on certain interests, unemployment  was a real economic category. This is something antiquated  today, and it is unacceptable for us.    Young people should receive housing, jobs, opportunities to  study, and prospects, and elderly citizens should receive an  honest subsistence.    We must carry out these tasks in a rather short time, and  not  in the distant and foggy future. The Hungarian people should  get their confidence back, a confidence that the previous  governments that openly served the Russian interests and the  recent post-communist government tried to rob in the past  decades. We can count in months, or years at the most. The  people's patience is limited! This country is in mortal danger!  We must act accordingly. The FKGP has detailed programs based  on exact evaluations.    2. The people were promised democracy! In reality, a  monolithic power based on a hidden pact policy is increasingly  emerging with an arrogance exceeding that of the previous  dictatorship. Hungary's economy, culture, and society are  deteriorating rapidly. From a consistent evaluation of this  process, we can draw the conclusion that we are not only talking  about an unbelievable dilettantism here, but also about a  deliberate destruction of this country. And all this is taking  place in a way as if there were democracy here. In other words,  they try to blame democracy for the infamy carried out against  the Hungarian people. The FKGP wants to stop the ravages of this  government. The FKGP accepts the implementation of this task  and it takes upon itself to return the confidence of this nation.    It is obvious that one cannot disregard certain groups of  social tasks in a society that is at the bottom of the pit. It  is particularly impossible to disregard the fact that they want  to break the faith of the Hungarian people in order to make them  helpless and slaves.    Naturally, there can be priorities in economic life. Driving  sectors are needed, but the basic conditions of development  should be created in all areas of society. This is the historic  task of the FKGP today.  <H5>  Republic Party </H5>   1-2. The program of the Republic Party outlines three major  tasks. The consolidation and subsequent stabilization of the  economy presupposes the reduction of inflation. For the  economic conditions to improve and become attractive for  domestic and foreign investors, and for the living conditions  and quality of life of the population to improve, there is a  need to develop the infrastructure more rapidly than the average  development. Along with this, unemployment should be reduced to  an acceptable level, unemployment that causes one of the biggest  shocks to Hungarian society.    Obviously, this needs a different economic policy based on a  new type of distribution of the domestic income (one that will  not increase after the change in the government either).  Consequently, along with a gradual reorganization of the tax  system and the reduction of tax burdens, we can no longer delay  the reform of the large distribution systems, the budget, and  state management either.    However, it is also clear that the implementation of the  aforementioned major goals and the restoration of our domestic  and foreign economic balance is a long-term task and requires  certain deliberate compromises.    According to well-founded evaluations, a complete  elimination  of unemployment along with a consistent implementation of an  anti-inflationary policy is not a realistic goal. Therefore, we  will have to live with an unemployment rate of about 5-5.5  percent in the coming years. If we tried to force unemployment  under the aforementioned level, it would become impossible to  reduce inflation.    At the same time, the planned reduction of the unemployment  rate limits the reduction of inflation. Thus, we can expect a  lasting period of 10-15 percent inflation in the coming years.  However, with such an inflation rate, there are realistic  opportunities for settling and accelerating the economy.    On the other hand, it is necessary to considerable reduce  over- distribution and the budget deficit. One can see today  that we can only achieve economic consolidation, a  venture-friendly economic environment, a better welfare network,  and an improvement in the situation of pensioners (protecting  the real value of pensions) if the budget deficit in the coming  years is not lower or higher than 5 percent of the GDP.    With such a budget deficit, the international evaluation of  the Hungarian economy can be lastingly positive, there will be  no need to withdraw capital worth 150-190 billion forints from  the economy, and this surplus income can contribute to the  implementation of our development goals.</p>

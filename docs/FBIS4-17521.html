			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Movement of Democratic Reforms (RMDR)  "approves both the basic ideas and the principles" of the  president-presented draft Agreement on civic accord in Russia,  however, it "cannot sign it" until the document is  "substantially revised and supplemented, especially with respect  to the actions of the government," chairman of the RMDR Gavriil  Popov declared at a press conference on Thursday in Moscow.    In his opinion, it is "harmful" to include the obligations  to  observe the RF Constitution into the text of the document  because "this allegedly gives the right not to observe the  Constitution to those who do not sign this document." Popov  believes that the draft is saturated "with promises, statements  of intent, and declarations" which have much in common with "the  CPSU Central Committee appeals on May 1," said Popov.    One can voluntarily oblige oneself to temporarily not use  the  rights granted by the Constitution, for example, the right to  urge early elections, only in the case "if it is clearly and  precisely stated for what sake the participants of the agreement  are abstaining from these or those rights." To this effect Popov  noted that the draft document "does not contain any precise or  concrete program of actions with determined dates which are also  coordinated between major participants of the agreement."  "There are practically no concrete obligations in the  agreement, namely to lower taxes by so-and-so percent, to ensure  such-and-such a rate of inflation, etc.," he said. He drew  attention to the fact that "the draft does not contain any  obligations of the government to resign and the State Duma's  obligations to announce about its self-disbandment in case it  fails to fulfill concrete obligations in concrete terms."    According to Popov, "the activity around this document  disorients Russia's peoples, creating an illusion of progress."  He warned that the Agreement "could be a trap into which the  president and his advisers are being driven."    Responding to Interfax, Popov reported that the majority of  the members of the movement's political council which is to  finally determine the RMDR position adhere to the same point of  view.</p>

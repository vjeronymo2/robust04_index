			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Sulzer to sell assets as part of shake-up SULZER Brothers, the Swiss engineering group, has agreed to sell its industrial and utility boiler activity to ABB Asea Brown Boveri and its valves and control systems division to IMI of the UK. No terms were disclosed, but Sulzer said the sales were part of a restructuring. Concentration in the thermal power generation industry led to the sale of its boiler business to ABB, which is now one of the world's top power generation equipment suppliers with annual sales of SFr2bn (Dollars 1.53m) in this field. By contrast, Sulzer's annual sales in this area are only SFr110m. Similarly, IMI is already a world leader in a broad range of fluid power systems, while the Sulzer business, with annual sales of SFr80m, was specialised mainly in valves for hostile environments. Sulzer said the businesses being sold were profitable and the new owners intended to maintain them in their present Winterthur facilities. No redundancies are foreseen. IMI said the acquisition of Sulzer's Thermtec's industrial valves business would strengthen its position in the power generation market.</p>

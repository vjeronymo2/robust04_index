			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Upwardly mobile in healthcare supplies - A look at the growing vision of the optician who is expanding Intercare AN OPTICIAN'S vision of increasing commercial opportunities in healthcare lies behind the rapid growth of Intercare, a Stockport - based company which has made a string of acquisitions in the last three years. Mr Peter Cowan, 47, acquired control of a loss - making shell, Pennine Optical, in 1989, strengthened the renamed group's optical business and moved into dental and other health products, most significantly, mobility scooters for the elderly and disabled. Mr Cowan trained as an optician at Manchester University and joined his father's business, building one shop into a chain of 19 outlets. They reversed into a small public company, Prestwich, which built the chain to 45 shops before selling it to Cooper Vision for Pounds 10m in 1986. Mr Cowan moved with the business. Within 18 months the chain had grown to 110 shops, third nationally behind Boots and Dolland &amp; Aitchison. When Cooper Vision sold the business in 1987, he tried to stage a buy-out, but was outbid by Dolland &amp; Aitchison, part of Gallaher, the UK subsidiary of American Brands, the tobacco group. However, he was determined to build a business which could exploit changes in the National Health Service, moves towards more care in the community and an ageing population. 'I could see a lot of changes would be taking place, both here and internationally, and that there would be lots of opportunities for professionals to buy services and products.' He bought into Pennine, an optical distributor quoted on the Third Market, in 1989 and returned it to profitability by combining it with Sovereign Optical, which was acquired for Pounds 417,000 the following month. In November of that year Intercare paid Pounds 1.5m for A-Z Dental Holdings, a Bolton - based business which has the UK's largest dental laboratory, making dentures, crowns and bridges. A - Z is now moving towards higher - margin cosmetic techniques, such as ultra-thin porcelain sheathing. The company is also trying to develop its non - laboratory distribution side, and is agent for an oral video camera which dentists can use to illustrate cosmetic treatment options. It also has European distribution rights for Cedeta, a new electronic anaesthetic system which is controlled by the patient. A - Z is in Intercare's medical products division along with acquisitions such as Nationwide Ostomy, which distributes incontinence products, and Impharm, which supplies retail chemists with pharmaceuticals. Last year the group paid Pounds 2.6m for SAFA, one of the leading suppliers of first aid and healthcare products to large corporate customers. Intercare also strengthened its optical division last year by paying Pounds 4.33m for Birmingham Optical Group, a large prescription laboratory which also makes instruments and equipment for opticians. Birmingham is agent for the latest computer-controlled US and Japanese equipment, which allows opticians to finish lenses and put them into frames on their premises. However, Intercare's star performer is undoubtedly Booster Electric Vehicles, a Huddersfield - based company which was bought for Pounds 2.37m in the spring of 1991. A few months later the group paid Pounds 3.16m for a 75 per cent stake in Montis, a Dutch distributor of healthcare products, including the electric vehicles assembled by Booster. Started by Mr Allan Baker, a lecturer in mechanical engineering at Bradford University, and his son, Peter, Booster makes battery - powered scooters and four - wheeled vehicles to aid mobility. Last year the combined sales of Booster and Montis leapt from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 8.7m with pre-tax profits advancing from Pounds 1.2m to Pounds 2.1m, accounting for nearly 60 per cent of group profits. An important factor behind Booster's rapid growth is that one of its vehicles is the leading scooter recommended by the Dutch health authorities, which offer free mobility vehicles to registered disabled under 65. However, UK sales also grew by 43 per cent last year and the group sees strong growth potential in oversees markets such as the US and Japan. Intercare is particularly interested in establishing Booster dealerships in modern, welcoming premises, which diminish the disabled stigma attached to mobility vehicles and makes them attractive to the potentially much bigger group of customers who are less able or elderly. Booster's products are not available on the NHS, although people can put their mobility allowance towards the cost of the vehicles, which range from Pounds 1,600 to more than Pounds 2,000. Mr Cowan had expected Booster's customer base would be middle class, but found this was not the case. 'If people need a vehicle, often the family will subsidise it to improve the individual's quality of life.' Intercare's pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.6m last year on sales of Pounds 29.1m were boosted by contributions from acquisitions, but the businesses owned for the full year grew by 25 per cent. Mr Cowan sees limited scope for growth on the dental laboratory side, apart from cosmetic work, but believes there will be increasing synergies to be obtained in the pharmaceutical distribution businesses. The addition of sunglasses and an agency for contact lenses would also complete the group's optical businesses. Intercare will continue to make acquisitions, but must also decide how quickly to expand Booster. Mr Cowan does not want to run just a mobility company, but admits: 'Mobility has to be the priority, because there we have an international opportunity.'</p>

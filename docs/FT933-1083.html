			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Ferrum Pounds 1.5m in the red SHARES in Ferrum Holdings fell 3p to 16p as the engineering company reported a fall to pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.49m for the six months to end-June. The decline - from a profit of Pounds 424,000 - was forecast by Mr Simon Miller, chairman, in his annual statement last March, and was struck on turnover of Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 19.2m). Trading was weak across the whole business, Mr Miller said, and the loss was struck after 'provisions totalling Pounds 725,000 covering restructuring and refinancing costs together with a general provision against contracts'. In addition, tax changes announced in the March budget had held back exploration activity in the North Sea, which adversely affected the services division. Losses per share came out at 4.6p (0.97p earnings) and in view of the results the interim dividend is passed, against 1.1p. However, following the reorganisation the group would now operate on a lower cost base.</p>

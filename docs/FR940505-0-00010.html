The List of Foreign Margin Stocks (Foreign List) is composed of foreign equity securities that have met the Board's eligibility criteria under Regulation T. The OTC List and the Foreign List are published four times a year by the Board. This document sets forth additions to and deletions from the previous OTC List and additions to the Foreign List.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  May 9, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Peggy Wolffrum, Securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulation Analyst, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, (202) 452&hyph;2781, Board of Governors of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551.

This supersedes the last OTC List which was effective February 14, 1994. Additions and deletions to the OTC List were last published on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4549). A copy of the complete OTC List is available from the Federal Reserve Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTC List includes those stocks that meet the criteria in Regulations G, T and U (12 CFR parts 207, 220 and 221, respectively). This determination also affects the applicability of Regulation X (12 CFR part 224). These stocks have the degree of national investor interest, the depth and breadth of market, and the availability of information respecting the stock and its issuer to warrant regulation in the same fashion as exchange-traded securities. The OTC List also includes any OTC stock designated for trading in the national market system (NMS security) under a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule. Additional OTC stocks may be designated as NMS securities in the interim between the Board's quarterly publications. They will become automatically marginable upon the effective date of their NMS designation. The names of these stocks are available at the SEC and at the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and will be incorporated into the Board's next quarterly publication of the OTC List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also listed below are the additions to the Board's Foreign List, which was last published on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4549), and became effective February 14, 1994. There are no deletions from the Foreign List. The Foreign List includes those foreign securities that meet the criteria in section 220.17 of Regulation T and are eligible for margin treatment at broker-dealers on the same basis as domestic margin securities. A copy of the complete Foreign List is available from the Federal Reserve Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comment and Deferred Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to notice and public participation were not followed in connection with the issuance of this amendment due to the objective character of the criteria for inclusion and continued inclusion on the Lists specified in 12 CFR 207.6 (a) and (b), 220.17 (a), (b), (c), and (d), and 221.7 (a) and (b). No additional useful information would be gained by public participation. The full requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to deferred effective date have not been followed in connection with the issuance of this amendment because the Board finds that it is in the public interest to facilitate investment and credit decisions based in whole or in part upon the composition of these Lists as soon as possible. The Board has responded to a request by the public and allowed approximately a two-week delay before the Lists are effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR Part 207  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banks, Banking, Credit, Margin, Margin requirements, National Market System (NMS Security), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR Part 220  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banks, Banking, Brokers, Credit, Margin, Margin requirements, Investments, National Market System (NMS Security), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR Part 221  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banks, Banking, Credit, Margin, Margin requirements, National Market System (NMS Security), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 12 CFR Part 224  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Banks, Banking, Borrowers, Credit, Margin, Margin requirements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority of sections 7 and 23 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (15 U.S.C. 78g and 78w), and in accordance with 12 CFR 207.2(k) and 207.6 (Regulation G), 12 CFR 220.2(u) and 220.17 (Regulation T), and 12 CFR 221.2(j) and 221.7 (Regulation U), there is set forth below a listing of deletions from and additions to the OTC List and additions to the Foreign List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CONCERT SHOWS BREADTH OF XENAKIS' COMPOSITIONS  </P> <P> Heard individually, the compositions of Iannis Xenakis assault the ear with  their abrasive insularity. But entertaining a sampling of his music, especially  works written for various media, brings out unexpected connections with more  familiar 20th-Century traditions. Wednesday night's program at UC San Diego's  Mandeville Auditorium, the first concert of the university's week long Xenakis  festival, provided such an opportunity.  </P> <P> "A Colone," a moving ode for men's chorus and 12 instruments, brought to mind  the rhythmic iterations of Stravinsky and the sustained, dissonant harmonies of  Balkan ensemble singing. Using an Attic-language text from Sophocles' final  tragedy, "Oedipus at Sophocles," Xenakis' stark choral declamation conjured  antique pathos aptly framed by his dense but sporadic instrumental commentary.  Conductor Philip Larson's disciplined beat kept his forces together, although  the 20-voice chorus did not end with the stamina and clear diction with which  it commenced.  </P> <P> Two instrumental solos focused on Xenakis' demanding virtuoso expectations.  "Mikka" and "Mikka S" for solo violin found UCSD professor Janos Negyesy  executing one continuous multivoiced glissando. Although its sinuous shape  suggested an organic model, the raw sound of "Mikka" also hearkened back to the  sonic experiments of Edgar Varese much earlier in this century. Negyesy played  the two short works with customary panache.  </P> <P> Even more impressive was Heather Buchman's performance of "Keren" for solo  trombone. The San Diego Symphony principal trombonist was unruffled by its  angular, athletic lines, and she sustained a well-focused, ingratiating tone  even when growling out the lowest multiphonics. Despite the work's overly  sectional structure, Buchman forged it into a broad, sustained arch from start  to finish, and her use of mounted mutes was pure finesse.  </P> <P> Under the direction of UCSD music faculty member Rand Steiger, SONOR gave a  spirited reprise of "Thallein," the 1984 Xenakis opus the ensemble performed  here in mid-March. No less striking or demanding on a repeat performance, in  the context of these other Xenakis offerings "Thallein" called to mind the  percussive rhetoric of Bartok.  </P> <P> It may take a long time for Xenakis to become mainstream, but the sheer  visceral appeal of his structures may eventually win over those who have little  patience for the mathematic metaphysics that undergird his compositions.  </P> <P> The Xenakis festival continues today at 8 p.m. with a piano recital by Alan  Feinberg in Mandeville Auditorium -- also the site for a Saturday 8 p.m.  concert. The final concert is outdoors at 5 p.m. Sunday, on the grounds of the  Salk Institute.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / India's October exports up 27% India's exports soared 26.9 per cent in October to Dollars 2.2bn, confounding fears they would be affected by the plague which hit parts of the country and caused panic around the world. The October increase, the biggest monthly improvement this year, took the rise in exports for the first seven months of the financial year, starting in April, to 13.9 per cent, above the 9.4 per cent recorded in the first three months when concern arose about apparent sluggishness of exports. But that growth rate still lags behind the record 20 per cent posted in the year to March 1994 and is short of the government's 15 per cent target for 1994-95. Imports in October also rose sharply, by 29.7 per cent, to Dollars 2.33bn, mainly because of a sharp increase in industrial output which draws in imports of machinery and other capital goods. The commerce ministry said that while the recovery in industry, after three years' stagnation, was welcome, the trade deficit needed watching. The ministry said the impact on trade of the plague, which killed about 50 people before it was brought under control in October, had been 'insignificant' despite curbs imposed by many importing countries. While relief may be premature, since the curbs could have affected shipments made after October, it is clear that estimates of export losses of Dollars 1bn are wide of the mark. The government's latest sale of shares in state-owned companies has had a poor response, with investors taking up only 12 per cent of the 345m shares on offer. The sale of the shares in six state-owned undertakings, all of which are listed on the stock exchanges, raised Rs22.3bn (Pounds 443m), a fraction of the government's target. India is selling shares in about 35 central government businesses to raise funds and grant a measure of management independence. But the government is retaining a controlling stake of at least 51 per cent in each company and has no full-scale privatisation plans.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Mid Kent shows marginal advance to Pounds 4.28m MID KENT Holdings, the water supply company, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.21m to Pounds 4.28m in the half-year to September 30. Operating profit rose to Pounds 3.99m (Pounds 3.78m) on turnover 6.6 per cent higher at Pounds 15.6m. Mr Robert Atwood, finance director, said the results reflected the fall in Mid Kent's K number - the rate at which it is allowed to increase prices above the rate of inflation - to 2.5 per cent in 1992-93, against 9 per cent last year. Mr Atwood said the severity of the drought and the recession in the south-east were key issues in the group's relations with Ofwat, the industry watchdog. Mid Kent planned at least Pounds 15m in capital spending this year, mostly on the enlargement of its treatment plant, meeting quality requirements, opening up new water reserves and a pilot metering scheme. The limits of a water company's immunity from the recession were amply demonstrated by the group's experience of the past six months. Water levels were low, and although a hose pipe ban was lifted last month, customers were warned it would be re-imposed in the spring. There had been few new connections with the dearth of new housebuilding, and it faced a mounting bad debt problem with a programme of 1,000 disconnections under way. Mr Atwood added that while the group had the organisational framework in place to meet the demands of 'the post privatisation regime', further streamlining would be necessary. 'Water companies, without exception, have to examine their staff numbers critically.' The interim dividend is 4.75p (4.5p), payable from earnings per share of 19.3p (19.1p).</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION  </P> <P> I, too, am a non-Orthodox Jew who identifies strongly with the Jewish people  and resents any particular Jewish denomination or other subgroup dictating the  criteria for who is a Jew. It is particularly offensive when the dictation  comes from one of the smallest grouping of the Jewish people -- the religious  fundamentalists.  </P> <P> We in the Jewish community are well aware of the efforts of this small sect to  dictate their terms to all Jews but the larger Southern California community is  quite unaware of it. Your objective depiction of the issue is, however, more  than a journalist's effort to bring attention to hitherto relatively unknown  facets of our civilization. The phenomenon of the resurgence of religious  fundamentalism is quite general throughout the world, from the Khomeini Shiites  to the growth of a particular type of American Christian fundamentalism. Your  article contributes to needed public education on this development.  </P> <P> WILLIAM SHONICK  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

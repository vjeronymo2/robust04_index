			<p>920728 FT  28 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Jakarta updates trademark law Indonesia has updated its trademark law which should give more protection to trademark owners, analysts said, Reuter reports from Jakarta. But the first new trademark law in 31 years, which takes effect next April, could take a while to bite. The new law will stop the Indonesian trademark office giving licences to new users of widely known trademarks. Local businessmen have registered duplicates and tried to sell them back to the original owners. The law includes criminal charges against 'copycats' and allows appeals before a licence is awarded. Violators could face seven years' jail.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / People: Bagri - the new LME chairman Raj Bagri, chairman of the Metdist Group, is to take over chairmanship of the London Metal Exchange, the world's main terminal market for physical metal, on January 1. He moves in earlier than expected because of the enforced departure of the present incumbent John Wolff who is leaving Rudolf Wolff, the metal and commodity broker where he is marketing director and which his family sold to Noranda, the Canadian natural resources group, in 1981. LME rules insist that when a board member changes companies he must resign. Bagri, 62, apart from owning a successful metal trading business, has extensive non-ferrous metals manufacturing operations in Malaysia and India, including a copper tube plantand rod and wire mills. His Metdist Trading is one of only 16 ring-dealing members of the LME. He became a member of the exchange 22 years ago, served on its management committee from 1973 to 1982, has been a director since 1983 and was elected vice chairman in August 1990. He says he will take over an organisation 'in very good health. As long as we continue to keep offering services relevant to the needs of industry, the LME has nothing to fear'. Ralph Kestenbaum, joint managing director of Gerald, was elected vice-chairman. ***** Eric Thornton has been appointed md of FARAH UK; he moves from Fred Perry. ***** Martin Parker has been appointed chief executive of LISTER &amp; CO following the retirement of Michael Dracup. ***** Jeffrey Marston, a director of WARDLE STOREYS and md of its safety and survival division, has resigned to pursue his own interests. David Nuwarr, marketing director GQ Parachutes, becomes acting md of that company; Uel McChesney, plant director of RFD Dunmurry, becomes acting md of RFD Ltd. ***** Anthony Green has been appointed deputy chairman of PATERSON ZOCHONIS. ***** Geoff Twigg, formerly general manager, is promoted to md of UCAR Carbon, a joint venture between Union Carbide and Mitsubishi; he replaces John Harvey, who has just completed a year as Master Cutler, and who retires this month. ***** Robert Rae, formerly finance director of Federal Bakeries, part of Dalgety, has been appointed finance director of EDINBURGH CRYSTAL. ***** Ronald Pressman (above), formerly general manager of central and eastern Europe area for GE International, has been appointed ceo of GE POWER SYSTEMS EUROPE, based in London. ***** Murray Steele has been appointed head of the strategic management group at CRANFIELD SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT.</p>

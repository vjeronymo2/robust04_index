			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / House price figures hit hopes for recovery HOPES that an upturn in house sales would lead to a swift recovery in prices were damped yesterday after Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, reported that house prices on average had fallen by 0.4 per cent in January. The Halifax's figures conflicted with a survey by Nationwide, the second-largest building society, which reported that prices on average had risen by 1.2 per cent last month, the biggest monthly rise since May 1991. Both societies, however, agreed that there had been an increase in the number of potential purchasers requesting mortgages and inquiring about properties for sale. Halifax said increased activity had yet to feed through to firm mortgage offers. Nonetheless market activity was expected to show a stronger recovery by spring, when prices should have started to stabilise. 'There might be some modest monthly increases in the second half of this year provided that economic confidence generally begins to recover,' said the society. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, Nationwide's chief executive, said his society's figures should be taken as an encouraging sign that stability might be returning to the mar-ket. He said: 'One swallow does not make a summer, but we believe there are grounds for cautious optimism. If the latest fall in interest rates helps to stimulate the economy generally and to boost consumer confidence, a more active and healthy housing market should emerge.' The monthly house-price surveys published by Halifax and Nationwide have occasionally disagreed. Nationwide says this is mainly due to differences between the societies in what constitutes an 'average house'. According to Halifax the average price of a home fell by 7.7 per cent to Pounds 60,471 during the 12 months to the end of January, compared with Nationwide which estimated the average price of a home last month to be Pounds 52,507. Halifax also estimated that the price of a new house had fallen by only 1.9 per cent on average to Pounds 67,060 since January last year. Mortgage lenders, estate agents and builders have reported a sharp increase in agreed sales since before Christmas. The Building Societies Association last week reported the first December increase in mortgage approvals compared with November for 16 years. Part of the improvement is thought to be buyers returning to the market after the autumn sterling crisis. The extent of the damage inflicted on buyers' confidence by wildly fluctuating interest rates was underlined yesterday by the publication of mort-gage lending figures for the final three months of last year. The number of mortgage applications during the fourth quarter fell by 24 per cent to 173,000 compared with the last three months of 1991, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Their total value fell by 28 per cent to Pounds 9.34bn. Mr Mark Boleat, the council's director-general, said: 'Evidence that significant falls in mortgage rates were beginning to have a positive effect on the housing market occurred too late in the quarter to be reflected in the latest lending figures.'</p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: BREAKS ON GREENS DIFFER FROM THOSE ON BEAMS  </P> <P> Courage is a much overused word in my profession. It has been used to describe  everything from boldly going for a green over 200 yards of water to trying to  slip a fastball past Henry Aaron with the bases loaded.  </P> <P> Some people think courage is facing down a lion with a high-powered rifle and  scope sight, but others know that it's staring down at one with nothing more  than a short spear and a flimsy shield.  </P> <P> Lee Trevino once said that courage was not playing a guy with tattoos and a  scar on his cheek for $100, it was playing him for $100 when you only had $10  in your pocket.  </P> <P> Reggie Smith once said that stress was not playing center field in Yankee  Stadium, stress was trying to feed your family when you were unemployed.  </P> <P> So Walt Zembriski will have to smother a laugh when someone refers to his  courage in pulling off a dangerous shot in the senior division of the MONY  Tournament of Champions at La Costa. He knows that real courage is walking an  eight-inch steel beam on top of a skyscraper in a high wind with a rivet gun on  a short wire.  </P> <P> Courage is not hitting a high iron, it's walking one. Courage is not risking  your nerves putting for $100,000, it's risking your life riveting for $13 an  hour.  </P> <P> You see, to play golf, Walt Zembriski first had to take off a hard hat and  asbestos gloves and come down 50 or 60 stories to sea level. He was one of  those guys putting up high rises 1,000 feet above Manhattan or New Jersey  traffic.  </P> <P> If you're one who gets the bends and turns faint looking out over the parapet  of the Empire State Building, if you even hate to look out a window above the  50th floor, just imagine a guy who stood there, pounding rivets, a quarter of a  mile in the air with nothing beneath him but a skeleton of steel girders.  </P> <P> Even a circus aerialist has nets. The only thing to break Zembriski's fall was  the ground. Or the Hudson River if you consider that any improvement. From that  altitude, it, too, would be like falling on concrete.  </P> <P> The worst thing that can happen to you if you miss a seven-foot putt is you  lose out on some of Bob Hope's or ABC's money. You misread a steel beam, you  don't drop off the money list, you drop off the universe.  </P> <P> Zembriski has seen a lot of his pals miss the cut on the tour. But they get to  tee it up the next week. He's seen half a dozen of his pals miss a step and  they have missed the cut forever.  </P> <P> There was Red Dalton, for instance. Walt had lunch with him the day Red stepped  off that tour. Those were the days before the walkie-talkie method of  communication. Dalton was signaled by flags where to take his stand on the 11th  floor. The signal was missent. Red took a stand on a beam that was not  fastened. He plunged to his death on the rocks below as the beam up-ended like  a berserk seesaw.  </P> <P> Walt saw five others pass him on the way down to their deaths. Another toppled  into an empty elevator shaft when a barrier broke.  </P> <P> You play golf in 75-degree weather in the Sun Belt. You go up in a high-rise  scaffold if it's zero. You wear a glove in golf only to keep your grip from  slipping. You wear a hat to keep the sun out of your eyes. You wear a glove on  a building shaft to keep the rivets from burning your palms. You wear a hat to  keep the debris from slashing your skull.  </P> <P> Even the gloves didn't help Walt when two steel cables came together across his  right hand and snipped the end of the thumb off. They rushed him to the  hospital where the thumb was sewed back on. It's no help in his putting because  there's no feel in it but, fortunately, the right thumb doesn't come into play  much in the golf swing.  </P> <P> Then there was the time the crane was swinging a load of lumber over the floor  where Walt was standing. Someone misjudged the trajectory. Instead of going  over Walt's head, the load came swinging right at it.  </P> <P> He had two choices. He could leap, but since the nearest point of relief was 20  stories down, that was really not an option, it was a calamity. Or he could  grab onto the front edge of the lumber and hang on for dear life as it swung  past. This, Walt did. And he swayed out over the city, clinging precariously to  a cluster of 2 x 4s. He had to dig splinters out from under his fingernails for  weeks.  </P> <P> After that, how could a 25-foot, two-break putt ever make his heart pound or  his throat go dry? How could a low iron to a guarded green ever top high iron  with a load of lumber coming at you? What par-five could ever make your hands  sweat?  </P> <P> Walt got into the construction business originally because he couldn't keep up  with the big boys on the regular tour. He got his card. He played the gutty  game of the short knocker who had to work with four-woods where Jack Nicklaus  and Arnold Palmer were feathering seven-irons. He couldn't keep up.  </P> <P> So he left the green grass and the manicured greens for the treacherous slides  of prefabricated steel. He traded in his visor and alpaca sweater for a hard  hat and asbestos gloves and went to building high rises for senior citizens and  senior partners of Wall Street. It's a profession so dangerous that they prefer  to import sure-footed young braves from the Blackfoot tribe to prowl the  skeletal towers of downtown Manhattan.  </P> <P> Walt climbed down when his marriage broke up -- his father-in-law was in the  construction business -- and tried the mini-tour, the golf loop for players a  cut below star level, trying to crack the regular tour. Walt was successful  enough so he never had to climb into an outside elevator again. He won 15  tournaments there in a little more than five years.  </P> <P> How did he keep his game during his years of walking high iron?  </P> <P> "I put down a carpet in the basement of my home in Jersey. When it was snowing  out, I practiced chipping and putting on it."  </P> <P> As soon as he got to be 50, Walt ran to the senior tour. At first, he had to  qualify on Monday mornings. That is stressful but not to be compared to being  50 floors up when a gale moves in.  </P> <P> In 1988, Walt broke through. He won the prestigious Vantage Championship in  Palm Desert, where he was the only player in a Who's Who field of senior  golfers to break par. He pocketed $135,000.  </P> <P> The senior tour now has its Mr. X, Miller Barber, and its Mr. Z, Zembriski. And  this week, in the MONY senior division tournament, Mr. Z has a chance to become  the game's latest millionaire.  </P> <P> Why do comparative unknowns like Walt succeed where the superstars seem to fail  in the seniors? Walt has a theory.  </P> <P> "They don't practice enough," he says. "They think they can come out and throw  a ball on the tee and win everything. They don't practice like they used to  when they were on the regular tour."  </P> <P> That may be the reason. On the other hand, it just may be they know they don't  have to go back to walking high iron if their low ones don't work.  </P></p>

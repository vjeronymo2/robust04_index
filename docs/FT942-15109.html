			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Motoring: Tamed, but still exciting - Stuart Marshall finds that the new Porsche 911 Carrera has appeal for all / Road test The latest 911 Carrera with Tiptronic is pure, triple-distilled Porsche. It looks like a son - even a grandson - of the original 911 of 30 years ago, and it still goes in a way that would satisfy a fast and skilful driver. But it has been tamed. Any driver of moderate competence can now enjoy it enormously without fear of getting into trouble. Whenever I drive a 911, it strikes me as being more animate than mechanical. This one made me feel as if I had been put up on a racehorse - only to find, to my great relief, that it could be ridden as easily as a wise old hunter. For me, there is no better transmission than Tiptronic, which is an extra-cost alternative to the standard six-speed gearbox. It offers the choice of fully automatic or clutch-less manual gearbox. In town, you simply let the transmission get on with it while you concentrate on the traffic. On the open road, you move the lever sideways into a different slot. Then you have a manual gearbox that makes instant, clutch-less shifts, under full power if you wish. All you do is push the lever forward to change up, pull it back to change down. A tiny red tell-tale on the instrument panel lets you know which gear you are in. If you leave your Porsche in the wrong one, electronics come to the rescue. Say you forget to down-shift and come to a stop in fourth - Tiptonic will pick second gear automatically for re-starting. Tiptronic has been a Porsche exclusive for five years. Now, Audi has chosen it for the new A8 quattro, an all-light alloy luxury saloon which goes on sale later this year. The 911 Carrera is a two-seater with a pair of notional rear seats that could, I suppose, accommodate stoical children for short journeys. Normally, though, they will be used for luggage that overflows the inadequate space under the bonnet. What in the average car would be the boot is full of six horizontally-opposed cylinders with a total capacity of 3.6 litres and which produce a lusty 272 horsepower - plus the most wonderful noises when working hard. Early 911s had a well-deserved reputation for biting the hand that steered them around wet corners; even now, you would not take liberties with the mighty muscle of the latest 911 Carrera. But a new, multi-link rear suspension and ever-advancing tyre technology combine to keep it securely on line at cornering speeds that would have courted serious trouble in older examples of the marque. Brakes on 911s always have been enormously powerful; now, they are equipped with an anti-lock system, too. And should the unfortunate driver make a blunder, twin air-bags are there to cushion the impact. The 45-series tyres, more than twice as wide in cross-section as they are high, thump and bang on rough roads, but the suspension is not harsh and the motorway ride reasonably comfortable. Build quality, panel fit and finish are what you would expect of a car costing Pounds 53,995, plus Pounds 2,865 for Tiptronic. At its introduction last year, Porsche called the 911 Carrera the 'ultimate evolution of a sporting legend.' And it continues to survive despite detractors who have said this charismatic vehicle should have been pensioned off years ago. Certainly, it is true that this 168 mph (270 kmh) car with rocket-like acceleration is a sheer indulgence that can be given its head only on a private track. But the ultimate 911? My feeling is that it ought to live for ever.</p>

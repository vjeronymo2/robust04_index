That is not to argue that the British and Irish  governments should not have put forward the Downing Street  Declaration on Northern Ireland. The province's problems are  such that any well-based and well-intentioned attempt to  overcome them should command a sympathetic and patient hearing.  But the Ulster impasse is so intractable that the risk of  failure is always likely to outweigh the prospects of success.    It is still too early to say that the declaration has failed  completely in its main aim of persuading Sinn Fein and the IRA  to renounce violence and enter the normal political process.  The Republican high command appears genuinely tempted by the  opportunity it offers it to get off the treadmill of violence on  which it is trapped. On Wednesday [2 February] in these pages  Paul Vallely reported on the mood among Sinn Fein activists  across the province as they debated their response. A majority  seemed to favour acceptance. But Sinn Fein, of course, has  little inherent respect for majorities. In an organisation that  accords more weight to the Armalite than the ballot box, and in  which death at the hands of one's colleagues is an ever-present  possibility, even a majority of 75 per cent is not necessarily  conclusive. In these circumstances it could be very many months  before the Sinn Fein/IRA leadership is ready to risk any move,  for or against the declaration. For Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn  Fein leader, this prevarication is anyway paying handsome  dividends. Not only has it enabled him to claim a specious aura  of political respectability, but he also hopes it will now  elicit either concessions from London and Dublin (in which case  the Republicans will have effectively entered negotiations  without having to renounce violence) or gain him what amounts to  a veto on all other political activity in the province while  Sinn Fein and the IRA make up their minds.    Either scenario is clearly intolerable for the rest of  Northern Ireland, for London and for Dublin. The problem that  immediately faces the two governments is how, having failed to  impose a deadline earlier, they now respond. As a stratagem for  putting pressure on Mr Adams, the intention of Sir Patrick  Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, to table outline  proposals on devolution and ways of increasing co-operation with  the Republic, and to restart his bilateral talks with the  province's parties, looks weak. Coming just as the Sinn Fein  leader steps off the plane from America, the announcement smacks  of panic. And since both governments are agreed that the  declaration will stay on the table, it is likely to be seen as  at best a stop-gap.    Faced with Sinn Fein's snubs and prevarications, however, it  is important that Sir Patrick's initiative be given as much  credibility as possible. A great deal will now depend on  Dublin. When both the Sunningdale and Anglo-Irish accords ran  into trouble, its interest in the province waned. Now that the  declaration shows signs of going the same way, Dublin must not  be allowed to wash its hands for a third time. Up to now it has  invariably cast itself as the champion of the nationalist SDLP  [Social Democratic Labour Party] and its leader Mr John Hume.  In the wake of the declaration, a more dispassionate stance  would be more constructive. Dublin should vigorously reassure  the Unionists, with action as well as words, that it is not in  Mr Hume's pocket and that it takes their concerns as seriously  as it does the Nationalists'. It must make clear to the SDLP  that they should take seriously British efforts to make  political progress within the province. This time Dublin must  stand shoulder to shoulder with London, otherwise the  declaration will surely fail.</p>

A  discussion paper addressed to congressmen said that the U.S.  Government will make economic and military assistance  conditional to freezing, rolling back, and eventual destruction  of the nuclear program. It has been clarified to Pakistan also  that freezing the nuclear program will not be enough. The  program will have be rolled back if it wants to receive the aid  which is now lying in the pipeline.    Pakistan should not foster any optimism after the clear  indication by the U.S. Administration because the United States  is not even satisfied with our present position and it wants a  total scrapping of the nuclear program. Given this situation,  Pakistan is left with no alternative but to achieve  self-sufficiency in arms production and to try to become a  self-reliant country to get rid of economic aid and loans. The  government should pay immediate attention to making basic  changes in the nation's economic structure and policies so that  the objective can be achieved. It should give top priority to  reliance on domestic resources, checking waste, increasing  national production, and especially to developing Pakistan's  relations with the economic bloc of Islamic countries.    It is encouraging that Pakistani scientists and engineers  have begun work on attaining the capability to design and set up  nuclear power plants. It will at least help overcome the  country's power crisis, thereby accelerating the pace of  industrial development. Since India has already become a nuclear  power, it will not be affected by the U.S. restrictions.  Furthermore, the United States is also giving preferential  treatment to India. Pakistan has refused to accept any  unilateral U.S. restrictions.    After the U.S. Administration's latest decision, Pakistan  should now depend on its own resources to meet its defense and  economic requirements instead of seeking help from the United  States. We can fully overcome this trial if we can master the  subject of efficient planning and rely on our own resources. We  should never think of renouncing the nuclear technology which we  acquired with our own labor, talent, and resources because it is  a matter of protecting our sovereignty and independence. Any  compromise on it will be tantamount to national suicide.</p>

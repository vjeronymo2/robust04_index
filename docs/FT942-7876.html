			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Sanaa hit by missile explosion A Scud missile exploded yesterday in a densely populated neighbourhood of the Yemeni capital as northern troops pushed into southern oil fields, AP reports from Sanaa. Reporters who got to the Al-Qaa area of Sanaa before soldiers sealed it off saw five demolished houses. At least one body was seen being pulled from under debris. The missile landed close to the city's Jumhouriya Hospital. President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the northern leader, has a residence about 800 meters from the scene. International relief agencies prepared to move up to 5,000 Somali refugees from a camp on the front lines in the civil war. Refugees say at least 175 Somalis have been killed in cross fire. Yemen collapsed into all-out war between northern and southern forces on May 5. The conservative north had united with the formerly Marxist south on May 22 1990, to form the first multi-party democracy on the Arabian peninsula. In a broadcast on Sanaa radio, a military official said northern troops had on Sunday seized a key military base in Ataq, the capital of oil-producing Shabwa province. The south on Friday announced it was seceding, a declaration rejected by the north. Ali Salem al-Beidh, who was vice president of unified Yemen, was named president of the south's newly declared Democratic Republic of Yemen. In Washington, Mr Mike McCurry, State Department spokesman, said: 'The United States does not believe the critical issues which will shape the future of Yemen should be decided in the heat of battle. We will therefore not respond to the al-Beidh declaration.'</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEETING SOUGHT ON ALL-MALE CLUB  </P> <P> The Avalon City Council has asked officials of the all-male Tuna Club to meet  with them in July to discuss concerns that some of the club's practices  discriminate against women.  </P> <P> Avalon City Manager Chuck Prince said that "there are some continuing concerns"  about reports that the facility is divided into men-only and women-only areas.  </P> <P> "If that's the nature of the practice," Prince said, "simply an explanation  isn't sufficient. They're going to have to change that practice."  </P> <P> In a letter last month, City Atty. Michael Jenkins notified the sportfishing  club that such separate rooms would constitute sexual discrimination, "which  would be unacceptable to the city and unlawful in a publicly owned facility."  </P> <P> The club on Santa Catalina Island leases its oceanfront facilities from the  city.  </P></p>

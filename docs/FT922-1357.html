			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / De Klerk halts trip as ANC calls crisis talks SOUTH AFRICAN president FW de Klerk decided yesterday to cut short a visit to Spain and return home in time to chair a cabinet meeting tomorrow on the country's political turmoil. His change of plan follows a decision by the African National Congress - which on Sunday cut off bilateral talks with the government - to convene an emergency national executive committee meeting today. The ANC, which accused Mr de Klerk of insensitivity in leaving the country at this time, will discuss its response to last week's massacre of 42 people at Boipatong, near Johannesburg. It blames the attack on the Zulu-based Inkatha movement, and is incensed that three more people were killed on Saturday by police who opened fire on a crowd soon after Mr de Klerk aborted a visit to the township. The ANC, is expected either to suspend temporarily its participation in the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) - the constitutional negotiating forum made up of 19 political parties - or to make further participation dependent on the government's response to the massacre. South African financial markets reacted nervously yesterday to the deteriorating political mood. Worst affected was the financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners, which fell by 6.7 per cent from Friday's close to finish at R3.84 to the dollar. The discount to the commercial rand widened to 27 per cent, the highest this year. On the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the overall index closed at 3,639, down 42 points. This is the worst crisis in South Africa's negotiation process since the unbanning of the ANC in February 1990. But there were hints from both sides that they may be seeking to pull back from the brink. Mr Tertius Delport, the government's spokesman on Codesa, said it would be a 'tragedy' if the ANC was to pull out of the forum. Mr Delport said an invitation to the ANC by Mr Pik Botha, foreign minister and acting president in Mr de Klerk's absence, to join the government in talks was an effort to move forward. Professor Kadar Asmal, a member of the ANC executive, said the organisation was 'firmly committed' to negotiations, but added the way out of the impasse was to move quickly to an interim government. Britain urged all sides to return to the negotiating table. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was said to be 'very distressed' at the events. Editorial comment, Page 18 World stocks, Page 37</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Hachette/Matra By comparing his fledgling magazines-to-missiles group with General Electric and Siemens, Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere can at least be applauded for aiming high. But the logic of combining Hachette and Matra seemed no more compelling yesterday than it was when first mooted. Bankers will doubtless be attracted by the merger of a cash-positive defence supplier with a heavily indebted publishing company. Shareholders not in Mr Lagardere's orbit may be rather less convinced by vague arguments about extra international clout and increased management efficiency. Hachette, of course, is being rescued from financial disaster, while Matra can argue that the publishing group might yet prove a profitable partner at this stage in the cycle and with the La Cinq episode behind it. Both sets of shareholders, though, should bear in mind that if the new holding company runs according to form it will trade at a minimum 20-25 per cent discount to net assets. They might also ask themselves if the proposed unlimited partnership, which provides extra financial incentive but more protection for incumbents, is an appropriate management structure given the errors of the past. As for the capital structure, Mr Lagardere's continued control appears to come at a price. Almost half the banks' support is in the form of non-voting perpetual subordinated notes, which the more cautious count as debt. On this basis, Hachette's pre-merger gearing would be 160 per cent, even after the proposed injection of capital.</p>

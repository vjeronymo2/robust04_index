			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Charity Fund Investment (5): Enlightened self interest - Alan Pike reviews corporate community help MEASURED in financial terms alone, corporate support for voluntary organisations remains a small drop in a large, deep ocean. The median cash donation from the corporate sector in 1991-1992 was Pounds 152,000. During the same year Oxfam raised Pounds 17m from its charity shops alone. The latest Charities Aid Foundation survey shows that in 1991-1992, 213 of Britain's leading companies gave assistance worth Pounds 206m to charities and voluntary organisations - 41 per cent of it cash, the remainder in the form of sponsorship, secondment of staff, use of premises and other kinds of help. Although the support was important and in some cases vital to the recipients, it was modest in the context of the total income of all registered charities - more than Pounds 16bn in 1990. Corporate support for voluntary organisations is, however, one of the most sought-after types of assistance because it cannot be measured in financial terms alone. It offers voluntary organisations business contacts, opportunities for partnership, access to specialised skills and potential for the professional promotion of activities. Sponsoring companies can benefit not only from improving their image among customers, employees and the wider community, but by building community activities into staff development programmes. Last year 48 companies gave more than Pounds 1m in cash and other forms of support to the voluntary sector. British Telecom headed the list: its total support came to Pounds 14.49m. Mr Iain Vallance, BT's chairman, said in a lecture last month that the company believed community activities should be undertaken for BT's benefit as well as that of the community. In the company's view there were clear advantages in corporate community activity, flowing from the fact that its business depended very considerably on the health of the community. 'If that health is adversely affected by deprivation, crime, vandalism, racial tension, inner-city decay, homelessness or pollution, so too is our own business health. Our opportunities are reduced, our problems increase, our costs rise.' The company wanted to be seen as one with a genuine concern for the health of the community, but platitudes and donations were not enough to achieve this. It required the involvement of staff. 'Community involvement provides an opportunity for people in BT to widen their horizons, to see beyond their jobs, and to recognise the importance of the community upon which we depend as a company.' It would once have seemed a trifle vulgar for companies to admit that self-interest motivated their support for charity. Today, such attitudes are positively encouraged by enthusiasts for corporate community involvement. Companies are more likely to take community activities seriously - increasing the benefit for the community - if they see them in business rather than philanthropic terms. Many companies are establishing professional community affairs departments and turning their voluntary sector involvement into a mainstream business function. One consequence of this is a growing tendency to support activities which have a logical association with the company's own business activities. Fears are expressed in the voluntary sector that this approach to corporate sponsorship leads to companies restricting support to popular causes with an attractive public relations image. This need not be so, as the Sedgwick Group, insurance and reinsurance brokers, is demonstrating with a policy of deliberately including within its community programme unpopular causes that often find it difficult to attract sponsors. These include organisations working with Aids victims, ex-offenders and the homeless. The company's staff run a job club in Norwich prison, helping inmates with the difficult task of seeking employment when they are released. Victoria Secretan, Sedgwick's community programmes manager, says that less-mainstream voluntary sector programmes can still be linked to corporate objectives. The insurance sector's approach to Aids raises controversial questions, and she says that involvement with Aids care has given the company a more sensitive understanding of the issues involved. As part of its work with ex-offenders Sedgwick has, in conjunction with the Apex Trust, Business in the Community and Lloyd's underwriters, developed the Apex Bond - a fidelity bonding system to help overcome one of the barriers facing employers in the recruitment of people released from prison. A survey of business and voluntary sector leaders carried out by KPMG Management Consulting as part of this year's tenth anniversary celebrations of Business in the Community - which encourages corporate community activity  -found that, while 90 per cent of respondents believed the idea of community involvement made business sense, 56 per cent found it harder to identify benefits in the case of particular projects. Lack of clear knowledge of the business case among business leaders was the most frequently cited obstacle to corporate community involvement, and there were calls for efforts to measure the effectiveness of projects in, for example, reducing unemployment and raising socio-economic standards. A case study of corporate social responsibility, produced for the Chartered Institute of Bankers by Professor Kevan Scholes and a team from Sheffield University, says the argument in favour of an active community policy can be summed up in terms of good business. 'There is no real alternative, and a positive social responsibility policy may be seen as enlightened self-interest.' The case against, says the report, is that 'pursuing active social responsibility policies puts burdens on both business and society without producing the intended effect of social improvement.' The study examines National Westminster Bank, Britain's biggest corporate supporter of the voluntary sector until BT overtook it last year. Market research, says the report, showed 'strong staff support' - up to 98 per cent  -for the bank's approach to community-related projects, with employees seeking further progress on local initiatives. NatWest has recently re-focused its community programme to reflect its business priorities, and the report provides some evidence to support this approach. NatWest undertook a series of inner city projects after the riots of the early 1980s; the report says there were marked variations in the success of these. 'The projects which succeeded best were those which related to the bank's own business interests, such as training and technology, whereas those which were least successful were those which were furthest away from business interests, such as a day centre for the unemployed in Leeds. The latter was treated locally with suspicion and cynicism. There was also a belief that this project addressed symptoms rather than causes.'</p>

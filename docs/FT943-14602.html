			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Services take lead in Russia Services are now contributing more to the Russian economy than manufacturing  -a remarkable sign that reforms, painful and still far from complete, may be working. Figures from the state agency Tosaomstat reveal a momentous shift in an economy which in Soviet times was expressly dedicated to production. It means that Russia is now developing the beginnings of a profile associated with advanced economies - where services account for a higher proportion of gross domestic product and employment than making things. However, it appears that much of the improvement is due to the informal or 'grey' sector of the economy, so defined because it at least pays no taxes and parts of it may be wholly criminalised. Studies of this sector differ as to its size, but the average estimate is that it may account for around 25 per cent of gross domestic product. The figures for the first six months for this year showed that services of all kinds generated nearly 50 per cent of GDP estimated to total Rbs245,000bn. Manufacturing output, by contrast, contributed 42.5 per cent and has declined by more than 25 per cent in the first half of this year. Engineering was particularly hard hit, falling by about 44 per cent on the first six months of last year. Investment shrank by 27 per cent in the first half, but the share of investment in private and semi-private enterprises rose from just over 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the total. Foreign investments in the period was only Dollars 280m. At the same time, the figures show that real disposable income has gone up by some 10 per cent over the same time last year. Experts now in Moscow on missions from the main international financial institutions say the apparent paradox of tumbling production and rising income is explicable in large part because of the growth of the 'informal' sector, which remains largely a matter for estimations.</p>

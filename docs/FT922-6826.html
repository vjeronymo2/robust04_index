			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Observer: Uneasy riders Every observant motorist knows of the existence of the little publicised Society for Dangerous Driving at Slow Speeds. The biggest membership faction in Britain seems to be teachers meandering home in mid-afternoon. Things are different in Rio de Janeiro, where the society's rolls have just been swelled by several hundred motor-cyclists, given to inching along in line abreast and intermittently bumping into one another if not falling off unaided. Early theories that they must be apprentice Hell's Angels turned out wrong. They are in fact police in training to serve as outriders for the motorcades of the heads of state due to attend the Earth Summit in Rio next month. The necessary skills are rare in the city where motorbikes are normally few and far between, and although the police are doing their best to learn, they clearly have a long way to go. Still, a pile-up of more than 100 heads of state would be something to be seen.</p>

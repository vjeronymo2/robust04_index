			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius 2 May TASS -- Lithuanian President Algirdas  Brazauskas praised Russian-Latvian agreements reached in Moscow.    "The negotiation process with Russia which has caused many  disputes in Latvia has ended very effectively, namely with the  signing of very important documents," Brazauskas said in an  interview with the national radio on Monday.    He said that on Tuesday the leaders of the three Baltic  states -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia -- will meet in Riga,  adding that "we have what to discuss."    Brazauskas recalled that during Polish President Lech  Walesa's recent visit to Lithuania they signed a treaty of  friendship and cooperation between the two countries. "I think  it will be interesting for my Latvian and Estonian colleagues to  hear our opinion about that document. For my part, I would like  to learn about the results of Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis's  visit to Moscow and his talks with Russian leaders," he said.</p>

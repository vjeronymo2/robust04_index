			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Pressure on franc, krone THE French franc and the Danish krone came under renewed selling pressure within the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday, in spite of the Bastille Day holiday in France, write Stephanie Flanders and Peter Norman. Dutch and Danish central banks intervened in support of the krone, while the Bundesbank again bought francs. The krone closed at DKr3.8951 to the D-Mark in London, near its floor of DKr3.9016. The franc closed at FFr3.417 to the D-Mark, down from FFr3.414 previously. Mitterrand urges caution, Page 2 Currencies, Page 29</p>

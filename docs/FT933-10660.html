			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Arts: Handel's 'Deborah' - Concert There is always an audience for the little-known works of well-known composers. While a record company knows it may struggle to find buyers for unfamiliar composers from Albeniz to Zemlinsky, there will be no trouble if the disc has Mozart or Handel on the label. Even today there remain a few large-scale works by Handel that await successful recordings. The King's Consort recently performed and recorded the opera Ottone. Now it has turned its attention to the equally obscure Deborah, an oratorio. Obscure, but not unfamiliar. Handel, always ready to borrow from music he had written earlier, outdid himself in this score and whole sections from other previous works keep surfacing. Deborah is a patchwork oratorio, expertly sewn together, the new positioning of choruses and arias often as good as the old. It won popular acclaim when it was first performed in 1733 and a fairly warm reception at the Proms on Sunday. With over 100 singers and instrumentalists taking part in the premiere it was the magnificence of the music which impressed early audiences ('tis excessively noisy', wrote one commentator). Robert King added to that 100, topping up the choral numbers. In Handel's day the figures for choirs always look small against the instrumentalists to the extent that one wonders how the balance can have worked. King combined the Choir of New College, Oxford, with boy choristers from Salisbury Cathedral and was rewarded with some of the best choral singing that his group has had - a firm, decisive, sparkling ensemble. This was all to the good, as the choral sections are among Deborah's most striking moments. Choruses of Israelites are pitted against the Priests of Baal, rivalling each other with exhortations to war, for which the King's Consort armed itself with more rhythmic punch than the conductor usually delivers. The heroine Jael, who seduces the enemy commander and nails his head to the ground with a tent peg, does not get very bloodthirsty music, but Susan Gritton endeavoured to give her some character. Yvonne Kenny was the prophetess Deborah and Michael George the bass Abinoam, both singing well but in need of more personality. James Bowman is fully at home with the Handelian style and commanded the music of Barak with easy nonchalance. The vocal decorations generally sounded as if they might have been improvised, but they added little of worth. Surely singers in Handel's day would have wanted to show off more?</p>

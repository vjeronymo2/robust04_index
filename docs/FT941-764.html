			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Brussels backs Britain over 'mad cow disease' The UK has won strong backing from Brussels over Germany's threat of a unilateral ban on British beef exports because of fear of 'mad cow disease', or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The European Commission told Germany it would take legal action if Bonn attempted to introduce a unilateral ban. Health ministers of the 12 will also discuss the BSE row tomorrow afternoon. Mr Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, has been the prime mover for action against the UK. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture minister, complained yesterday that 'the hysterical reaction in Germany' had already caused 'measurable damage to British trade'. In January and February beef exports to Germany had fallen to less than one eighth of annual levels two years ago. But Mrs Shephard said the damage had spread to include cancelled contracts for British pork, lamb and even whisky. There was also, she said, a knock-on effect into neighbouring countries such as Belgium, where a fast-food chain had just cancelled a large order of British beefburgers. Mrs Shephard did not rule out the possibility of seeking legal redress. Bonn is calling for a ban on all live cattle and beef exports from the UK after the discovery in Germany of BSE imported from the UK. The commission has reminded Germany that it is the EU that sets veterinary rules, and that there is no scientific evidence proving a link between BSE and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, which affects humans. A series of restrictions have been imposed in the UK beef sector, which Britain and the commission say are working. In 1990 certain bovine offals, such as brain and spleen, were banned for human consumption. Since June 1990 there has been a ban on the export of live cattle over six months from the UK, and on the progeny of BSE-affected cows. In addition, all British exports of bone-in beef must be certified as coming from herds that have been free of 'mad cow disease' for two years. British officials say that the EU market will be disrupted unless all member states stick to the scientific evidence, and that Germany's threat of unilateral action risks an EU-wide collapse in beef consumption similar to the fall that followed the 1990 BSE scare. A British agriculture official said: 'We feel we have a sound case and other member states and the commission agree with us.'</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> SOME SAY TIMES OF TROUBLE MEAN TIME FOR GOLD;  </P> <P> INVESTMENTS: PRECIOUS METALS MAY BE A GOOD BET DURING SEVERE RECESSIONS, BUT  OVER THE LONG HAUL THEY USUALLY ONLY MIRROR THE INFLATION RATE.  </P> <P> These are times for people like Howard Ruff. The stock market is in turmoil.  The junk bond market has crashed. And people are uncertain about prospects for  the economy, inflation and interest rates.  </P> <P> In the worst of all possible worlds for investors, the U.S. economy might fall  into stagflation -- a period of rising inflation and stagnant economic growth  like that of the 1970s. And in the 1990s, with both the government and private  industry weighed down with debt, stagflation could be even more difficult to  handle.  </P> <P> Ruff, who through his financial newsletter "The Ruff Times" has been telling  readers to prepare for financial disaster for the past 14 years, believes that  it is time to stock up on gold.  </P> <P> He likes other precious metals such as silver and platinum, too, for several  reasons. They are things you can hoard with your canned goods in times of  economic Armageddon. And they are likely to stage a rally when the U.S. economy  falls into a severe recession, which Ruff believes is just around the corner.  </P> <P> "I think we are moving into one of the most dangerous recessions we've faced,  certainly since 1981 and 1982, which came within a gnat's eyelash of a  depression," he said. "And we may be moving into a recession as bad as the one  in 1928 and 1929. Will it turn into a depression? That depends."  </P> <P> Gold is a prime investment for bad times because it retains its value through  the ages. An ounce of gold would buy a fine suit of clothes in the time of King  Henry VIII, and it would still buy a suit at Brooks Bros. today, said Bruce  Kaplan, president of Kaplan &amp; Co. in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Over the long haul, gold's performance generally only mirrors the inflation  rate; it rarely exceeds it. And bullion or coins may carry storage and  insurance costs, further trimming the total return. But when it looks as though  inflation will wipe out gains in other investments, such as stocks, bonds and  money market accounts, gold can be rewarding.  </P> <P> Most economists don't agree with Ruff's gloomy predictions, expecting that  growth will simply slow in 1990, not come to a grinding halt.  </P> <P> Still, some industry experts believe that a number of factors have combined  lately to make gold -- and possibly other precious metals -- a stellar  investment.  </P> <P> Not all of the factors are bad news, either. Some industry experts believe that  price appreciation in gold and platinum will be driven, at least in part, by  rising demand. There are indications that both the Japanese and Soviet Bloc  countries might be interested in storing up gold, and platinum prices could  rise because more uses are being found for it in industry.  </P> <P> The argument for silver is simply that it's cheap. An ounce now sells for less  than $5.50, compared to 10 times that when it hit its peak in 1980. In  addition, it tends to move in conjunction with gold. So, if gold stages a  rally, silver is likely to follow.  </P> <P> In the past several months, gold and platinum have produced modest run-ups.  Since Nov. 1, Gold prices have risen $45 an ounce to $417.95 Friday, for  example, and platinum is up about $20 to $505. Silver, however, has risen only  several pennies, closing Friday at $5.28, up 12 cents since Nov. 1. Gold stocks  have risen even faster. One gold mutual fund, in fact, posted a near 65% annual  rate of return in 1989.  </P> <P> Industry experts do not believe that the rally is over, either. Kaplan predicts  that gold prices will hit $450 by year-end. And J. David Edwards, chief  investment officer of United Services Advisors, believes that the metal will be  worth $500 by then.  </P> <P> Not everyone agrees.  </P> <P> "If you are expecting dreadful inflation, gold is a tremendous thing to own,"  said Abby Cohen, chief investment strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert in New  York. "But I don't think we are on the brink of high inflation."  </P> <P> And even if higher inflation is a distinct possibility, there may be better  investment options, said David Wyss, chief financial economist with  DRI/McGraw-Hill.  </P> <P> "Part of any investor's portfolio should be in real assets, whether that is  gold or land or Oriental rugs," Wyss said. "I don't like gold as an investment  because there are very few times in history that it's out-performed other  investments."  </P> <P> TRACKING GOLD AND SILVER  </P> <P> Weekly close for gold and silver, cash price per ounce (Handy &amp; Harman).  </P> <P> GOLD  </P> <P> Friday's close: $417.95  </P> <P> SILVER  </P> <P> Friday's close: $5.28  </P></p>

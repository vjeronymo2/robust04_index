			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Buy-in team acquires Hydron for about Pounds 27m ALLERGAN, the US-based drugs distributor, has sold Hydron, the contact lens maker, to a management buy-in team for about Pounds 27m. Mr Tim Gibson, Hydron's new managing director who led the buy-in team, declined to disclose the full purchase price. He said CINVen and CVC Capital Partners, who arranged the finance, had jointly underwritten funds of Pounds 14m, entirely in equity. NatWest Acquisition finance is understood to be providing additional banking facilities of about Pounds 13m. Mr David Milne, CVC assistant director, said: 'In the long run it would seem sensible to float the company on the London Stock Exchange. But we have no immediate plans to do so.' Mr Gibson said: 'Hydron intends to be at the forefront of research and development in this sector which will be key to the company maintaining and increasing its market share.' The deal excludes the use of the Hydron name in the US. However, the MBI team is buying interests including manufacturing facilities in the UK (Farnborough), Australia and Spain, the contact lens sales force, research and development projects and the rights to patents and licences. The company had a co-operation agreement with Allergan. Hydron is forecasting sales of Pounds 30m for its first full year of operation but is not disclosing any previous results. The new, independent company is expected to employ about 500 people worldwide and will have operations in the UK, France, Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Austria. Hydron claims a significant share of the contact lens markets in each of these countries. Hydron was one of the first manufacturers makers of soft contact lens and has been operating internationally since 1972. It was acquired by Allergan in 1988.</p>

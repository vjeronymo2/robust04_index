			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Shenzhen Commission for  Restructuring Economy, the city soon will conduct comprehensive  experiments in 20 selected enterprises on the establishment of a  modern enterprise system. It will open up a new path by summing  up the experience gained in these experiments and lay a  foundation for the city to be the first in the country to  establish a market economy structure. The main contents of these  experiments include the establishment of the enterprise  legal-person system, the limited liability system, and the  scientific management system; the effective solution of such  crucial problems as property, personnel, and distribution  rights; and the adoption of appropriate supporting measures.  While carrying out these experiments, the city will continue to  do a good job in the work in three ways:    1. The city will reappraise the stocks and assets of  enterprises, register their property rights, harmonize property  rights relationships, and institute and perfect an enterprise  legal-person system.    2. It will reform and improve the enterprise internal  leadership system, and will set up boards of shareholders and  boards of directors, as well as a scientific leadership  structure of checks and balances -- under which functions and  powers are clearly defined -- between [words indistinct].    3. It will improve the enterprise distribution system and  set up a rational encouragement mechanism.</p>

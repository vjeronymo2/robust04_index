			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT TO WEAR OR WHAT NOT TO WEAR  </P> <P> Almost 20 years have gone by since parents collected funds to fight the Tustin  School District dress code. In 1971 there were very strict dress codes  throughout the county school system. Boys' hair could not extend over the  collar or ears and girls' skirts could not be above the knee.  </P> <P> Now the emphasis is more on learning and attending classes and less on hair  styles and attire. Rules and regulations that might have kept some students  </P> <P> from attending classes because of their clothing or hair no longer exist.  </P> <P> The final word of what is acceptable and what is not lies with the principal of  each school. Some schools are willing to accept purple, green and orange hair  and skirts at any length, while in a few schools that would be taboo.

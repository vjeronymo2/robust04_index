			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> LLOYDS BANK BUYS VEGAS CASINO  </P> <P> Lloyds Bank of London is the new owner of the shuttered, 498-room Landmark  hotel-casino a block east of the famed Las Vegas Strip. The resort closed in  August when no bids were tendered in a public auction.  </P> <P> The bank paid a reported $20 million for the property to protect a $25-million  loan made in 1988 to former owner William Morris. The sale places a $6-million  debt owed by Morris to Imperial Palace hotel-casino owner Ralph Engelstad in  limbo, along with another $1.7 million owed to taxicab company owner Charles  Frias, a bank spokesman said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Landmark hotel-casino, a space-needle shaped resort once owned by the late  billionaire Howard Hughes, is located across the street from the Las Vegas  Convention Center.  </P></p>

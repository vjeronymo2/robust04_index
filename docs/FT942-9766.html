			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: John Fairfax ahead 20% at nine months John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group in which both Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network and Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher, have minority stakes, yesterday announced a 19.8 per cent rise in operating profits to ADollars 144.9m (USDollars 104.7m) for the nine months to end-March. After-tax profits increased even more sharply, to ADollars 117.5m from ADollars 47.4m. This was partly due to an ADollars 40.1m abnormal tax benefit, but also to lower interest charges - down from ADollars 40.3m to ADollars 27.3m. Revenues increased by 8.7 per cent to ADollars 617.3m, while operating costs rose by only 5.5 per cent to ADollars 455m. The company said the improved results were 'mainly attributable to increased advertising volumes, derived from improved trading conditions and modest advertising rate and cover price increases'. Classified advertising volumes for the Sydney Morning Herald rose by 8.8 per cent, and for the Melbourne Age by 10.4 per cent. Display advertising volumes were up by 12.4 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively. The company, which has been at the centre of a high-profile Senate inquiry recently, added that trading results since end-March had 'continued to reflect the improving economic conditions'. Profit projections for the year to end-June were satisfactory. The Senate inquiry looking into foreign ownership of the print media and, more specifically, the circumstances surrounding the government's decision to let Mr Black raise his Fairfax stake from 15 to 25 per cent, is to make an interim report early next month and a final report by late September. This essentially delays the final report, while a privileges committee examines the Senate's powers to demand documents and whether the federal court should play any role. The inquiry has sought certain Foreign Investment Review Board documents relating to the various bids for Fairfax, but members of FIRB have refused to hand these over.</p>

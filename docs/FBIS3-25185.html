			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good evening. Blondin Beye arrived today and went  to work. First, he met with the observers to take stock of the  situation. Afterward, he met with the government negotiating  team. Blondin Beye informed the delegations of his visit to Cote  d'Ivoire--namely, the meetings with several politicians,  including George Moose, U.S. under secretary of state for  African affairs. Blondin Beye also met with Angolan Government  officials. He also met with Jorge Valentim, the only National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiator  present in Lusaka. The main body of UNITA negotiators has not  yet arrived, but reports say they could return to Lusaka at any  time. Analysts say the talks will remain deadlocked as long as  the UNITA delegation is not in Lusaka. Paradoxically, Blondin  Beye is set for a meeting with the UNITA negotiating team  tomorrow at 1000.</p>

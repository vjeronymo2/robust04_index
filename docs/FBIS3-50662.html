The report, the CSJ plenum stated, "notes the alleged  participation of state officials and employees during the 1980  to 1993 period when it accuses them and holds them allegedly  responsible for the forced disappearance of national and foreign  citizens and other human rights violations that took place in  our country. This situation calls for a thorough investigation  of the facts that are mentioned by the judges who are in charge  of criminal matters. [no closing quotation mark as published]    Therefore, in using the legal powers invested upon it, the  CSJ resolves:     -  First: To acknowledge receipt of the report on missing  individuals in Honduras through the Secretariat of this  Court.    -  Second: To create a special commission of prosecutors,  headed by Prosecutor General Juan Arnaldo Hernandez, to review  the documents contained in the report to b?gin the corresponding  penal actions in the cases that warrant it.    -  Third: To allow the  judges in charge of criminal matters, who know from where  complaints have been filed regarding the disappearance of  national and foreign citizens, to begin or continue, as  appropriate, the corresponding procedures to punish the presumed  human rights violators. The CJS Secretariat is to receive an  authentic copy of the report and attached documents.    -  Fourth: To  brief this resolution to CSJ General Prosecutor Hernandez and  other judges in charge of criminal matters who know of where the  reported incidents have taken place so that they can be informed  and proceed.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Oleksandr Rol, chairman of </F> Ukraine's Officers Union, SOU, by Mariya Bazelyuk; place and  date not given: ``The Defense of Ukraine Cannot be Guaranteed by  Other States'' -- first paragraph published in boldface]    [Excerpt] The Fifth Congress of the Ukraine's Officers  Union [SOU] held in Kiev on 18 December 1993 elected Major  General Oleksandr Rol as the SOU chairman. Rol was born in  Kiev, where he completed high school and received training at an  aviation club. He studied at the Chernihiv Aviation School and  later graduated from the Military Aviation Academy. He was a  fighter pilot, a bomber pilot, and also did staff work. For  three years, he was adviser to the commander of the Vietnamese  Air Force. Even though Rol's military service was almost  entirely outside Ukraine, he speaks very good idiomatic  Ukrainian and this points to his family's healthy roots.  for the state. [passage omitted]    Bazelyuk: Did you take part in elaborating the  Ukrainian Military Doctrine? What is your opinion about it?    Rol: It is centered on defense. The doctrine  adopted by the Supreme Council in October 1993 has become a  state document, which soldiers must adhere to rather than assess.    Bazelyuk: However, it is written in the doctrine  that ``Ukraine must become, in the future, a nonnuclear state if  other nuclear powers undertake similar actions.'' After it  became a state document, some people in the upper echelons of  power rushed to transfer nuclear weapons immediately to Russia.  What is your position with regard to our state's nuclear status?    Rol: Starting from 1991, I made many statements  for the press and spoke from various rostrums. I said that  Ukraine must have atomic weapons as a means of deterrence. Our  state must possess nuclear weapons as long as at least one  country, which may become our adversary and lead to a military  confrontation, keeps its nuclear weapons. This is my opinion.  No matter how big our army is, there is nothing like nuclear  potential as a means for defending Ukraine.    The position of our political leadership has led to several  negative processes. Back on 24 August 1991, Ukraine, for some  reason, proclaimed to the whole world that it was going to  become a nonnuclear state. Another example. Why, people are  asking, does Ukraine need the Black Sea Fleet, if it declared  that it only needs the fleet for local needs? This gave rise to  the problem of the Black Sea Fleet with all its consequences.  It is a pity that we gave away our tactical weapons so quickly;  they might defend Ukraine much better than the largest army. It  is impossible to guarantee national security without modern  weapons.    Ukraine must proceed from the fact that it is impossible to  ensure the defense of our state if we only rely upon guarantees  offered by other states. In questions of Ukraine's defense  capability and national security we may only rely upon our own  forces.    Why does the West help Russia in every way? Simply because  it has a powerful nuclear potential and is, in this respect, a  strong power.    Bazelyuk: What are Ukraine's real possibilities  for maintaining its nuclear status?    Rol: First and foremost, it is up to our  president. We might conduct a nationwide referendum on  Ukraine's nuclear or nonnuclear status. You know, I am very  annoyed when some state tells us didactically: ``You must give  up your nuclear weapons.'' Who would dare make such claims upon  China, Great Britain, or France?    Bazelyuk: How do you assess that the personnel of  the 43d Rocket Army has not, to this day, taken the oath of  allegiance to Ukraine?    Rol: I will investigate this situation as chairman  of the SOU.    Bazelyuk: You have been nominated as a candidate  as Ukraine's people's deputy. Do you agree to stand for this  post and why?    Rol: I agree, because I have a clear picture of my  work in the Ukrainian Parliament.    Bazelyuk: Thank you for the interview, from which  I have become convinced that, despite the enormous pressure  exerted upon Ukraine both from the West and from the East,  Ukraine will be able to create a reliable defensive shield with  all those types of weapons necessary for this.</p>

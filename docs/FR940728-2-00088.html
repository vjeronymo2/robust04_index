			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In formulating an approach, grantees are strongly encouraged to use the structure, technical descriptions, core data set, etc., which are included in the application kit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CDC supports the concept of comprehensive health information systems which give priority to the immunization information function. Documentation must be provided (amount of dollars and source) by the project if funds from other sources will also be used to support the development of a comprehensive health information systems. CDC will also support, in concept, the use of limited grant funds, if approved, for the development of some hardware or software interfaces that will ensure that key linkages can be made, such as to State offices of vital statistics and managed health care organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Review and Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for funds for the State Immunization Information System will be evaluated by a CDC-appointed Objective Review Committee (ORC) whose members have expertise in disease prevention and service delivery. These reviewers will be persons representing a variety of disciplines and may or may not have specific expertise with immunization programs or automated data processing systems. Grantees, therefore, should consider the clarity of presentation and the use of terms that are widely understood or clearly defined. The ranking of scores made by the committee and program need will determine which grantees will be funded in FY 1994 and FY 1995 for Component One, as well as which grantees will be funded for Component Two.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria (Component One and Component Two will be reviewed separately according to the criteria set forth below):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The applicant's understanding of the purpose of the program, the appropriateness and feasibility of the stated activities to meet the criteria set forth in the announcement, and the likelihood that the activities conducted by the applicant will achieve the desired outcomes. (Component One: 10 points); (Component Two: 25 points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The extent to which background information and other data demonstrate that the applicant has the appropriate organizational structure, administrative and technical support, accessibility to birth records, and accessibility to immunization records of the target population to implement the project and produce statistically valid results, evidence of support from public and private agencies and providers, and the ability to accomplish project objectives. (Component One: 15 points); (Component Two: N/A)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The degree to which long-term and short-term objectives are consistent with the purpose of the demonstration project and are realistic, specific, measurable, and time-phased. (Component One: 15 points); (Component Two: 15 points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The quality of the plan of operation for developing and implementing proposed activities and the degree to which the plan specifies the what, who, where, how, and the timing for start and completion of each activity. (Component One: 20 points); (Component Two: 15 points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. The degree to which the evaluation plan can be used in measuring achievement of each objective and the quality of methods and techniques to be used. (Component One: 10 points); (Component Two: 15 points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. The extent to which methods and strategies proposed are financially feasible and have a system capacity to link with the SIISs in other States. (Component One: 15 points); (Component Two: 15 points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. The extent to which qualified and experienced personnel are available to carry out the proposed activities of the project. (Component One: 15 points); (Component Two: 15 points)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, consideration will be given to the extent to which the budget request is clearly explained, adequately justified, reasonable, and consistent with the intended use of funds, and the extent to which the applicant is contributing its own resources to childhood immunization activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372 Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications are subject to review as governed by Executive Order (E.O.) 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of processed Federal assistance application.

			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BITES  </P> <P> Following are some capsule re views of the better restaurants recently visited  by our critics:  </P> <P> * Neon beer signs and colored lights make Golden China restaurant look like a  pizza parlor. But that's where the similarity ends. The two large dining rooms  with carved wood panels, Oriental chairs and lantern light fixtures are a dead  giveaway.  </P> <P> So are the 113 Mandarin and Sichuan items on the menu, most of which are rich  with garlic and ginger, and some very sweet.  </P> <P> The mixed appetizers are served on a wooden platter with a fire pot burning in  the middle. The resulting glow over the table is nice, as is the teriyaki beef  on a stick and the paper-wrapped chicken pieces. Pot stickers are particularly  delicious, with their flavorful sauce filled with chunks of garlic and ginger.  </P> <P> Entrees are highlighted by the fresh red snapper covered with extremely spicy  sauce and the shrimp in a basket of woven noodles, served with vegetables.  Moo-shu pork passed with flying colors too -- paper-thin crepes overflowing  with finely shredded pork and cabbage in a slightly smoky sauce.  </P> <P> Golden China is located at 1105 South Seaward Ave., Ventura, 652-0688. Lunch  and dinner are served 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Dinner for two, food only,  $20-44.  </P> <P> From the way the suns shines through the dining room, to the classical Mexican  and Yucatan cuisine, Cafe Vallarta is a treat for the senses. The new menu  includes such en trees as a calamari-stuffed chile relleno, a mild pollo  almendrado and an award-winning caldo de mariscos (or bouillabaisse). The beer  snacks, especially the cochinita pibil (pork cooked in banana leaves), are  worth trying. Cafe Vallarta is located at 620 E. Haley St., Santa Barbara,  564-8494. Dinner is served from 5 to 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Thursdays, and  5 to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant is closed Sundays and  Mondays. Dinner for two, food only, $28-40.  </P> <P> What's in a name? Everything, in the case of the Sea Fresh Restaurant. The  owners have their own commercial fishing boat in Ventura Harbor and have the  pick of fresh fish. Sushi is a house specialty and is offered as an entree or  an appetizer. Particularly good is the yellowtail roll. Main dishes include a  large selection of fish and chips, calamari and fish tacos. Sea Fresh  Restaurant is located at 533 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai, 646-7747. Lunch and dinner are  served 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday  and Saturday. The sushi bar is open 5 to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, and  5:30 to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Dinner for two, food only, $11-$28. Nothing  at the sushi bar is more than $3.  </P> <P> Don't let the six-foot-wide storefront entrance to Chez Kim mislead you. Once  inside, the place is like a French bistro. There is the intimacy, the simple  menu and the hearty servings. But again, don't be fooled. The menu leans toward  Italian. There are several types of fresh pasta in a coarse-textured pesto  sauce. Among the other entrees are salmon fillet poached in white wine and  served in a sauce of butter and dill, and filet mignon in cream sauce. Chez Kim  is located at 420 E. Main St., Ventura, 648-7028. Dinner is served 5 to 9 p.m.  Sunday through Thursday, 5 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Dinner for two, food  only, $35-55.  </P> <P> It may be hard to believe, but there is a place that serves pizza for both the  trendy and the traditional. Avanti's menu offers plain old pepperoni pizza  mixed in with the smoked salmon and cream cheese, basil and mozzarella and  barbecued chicken versions. Entrees include broiled lamb with garlic and sherry  sauce and pasta with a cream sauce of bay scallops, oyster mushrooms and bits  of tomato and oregano. But leave room for the hot, fresh Italian bread called  focaccia and the delicious desserts. Avanti is at 710 Ventura Ave., Oak View,  649-9001. Lunch and dinner are served Wednesday through Monday, noon to 9 p.m.  Dinner for two $15-40.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE PROBE FIGURE LACKNER PLEADS GUILTY  </P> <P> A somber Fred H. Lackner of Woodland Hills, Calif., pleaded guilty Friday to  federal conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery charges in the continuing Ill Wind  investigation into corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying.  </P> <P> Lackner, a 52-year-old free-lance defense consultant, admitted paying about  $6,000 in bribes to a Navy official for inside information on military  contracts.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton read the three charges to Lackner and  asked him how he pleaded. "Guilty," the consultant replied each time in a quiet  but firm voice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To Cooperate in Probe  </P> <P> Lackner faces 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. Under terms of the  plea-bargain agreement, he will testify against other suspects in the  procurement investigation.  </P> <P> Lackner and his attorney, James A. Twitty, refused to comment on the plea.  </P> <P> His admission closed a circle that included Alexandria, Va., defense consultant  William L. Parkin and Navy electronics specialist Stuart E. Berlin, both of  whom earlier had confessed to their roles in the scheme.  </P> <P> Teledyne Industries Inc. of Newbury Park, Calif., and Hazeltine Corp. of Long  Island, N. Y., also have pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in the case.  Teledyne will pay penalties of as much as $8.4 million; Hazeltine was fined  $1.9 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Executives Face Trial  </P> <P> The trial of three Teledyne executives on related charges is scheduled to begin  Monday. They are expected to argue that they authorized payments to the  consultants but did not know that the money would be used to bribe a public  official.  </P> <P> Prosecutors now have obtained 14 guilty pleas on charges arising from the  three-year Ill Wind investigation. Officials have described the inquiry as the  broadest investigation ever into corruption in the military's  $150-billion-a-year procurement system.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors, under the direction of Henry E. Hudson, U.S. attorney for  the Eastern District of Virginia, are continuing to build cases against a  number of defense consultants and Pentagon officials who have not been  indicted.  </P> <P> Documents in the case show that Lackner served as the conduit for money and  information passing between consultant Parkin and Navy official Berlin. Parkin  found corporate clients willing to pay large fees for inside information on  military contracts; Berlin sold the information to his longtime friend,  Lackner, who passed it to Parkin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Described as Go-Between  </P> <P> "Berlin's role was to provide information and whatever influence he could on  the procurement," according to the statement of facts accompanying Lackner's  plea agreement. "Lackner's role was to act as a go-between for Parkin and  Berlin so that they would not deal directly with each other."  </P> <P> Teledyne and Hazeltine agreed to pay Parkin about $200,000 for the inside  information. He split his fees with Lackner and a former Teledyne executive,  Michael Savaides. The three men chipped in a total of about $6,000 to give  Berlin, telling him that the fees were much smaller than they actually were.  </P> <P> Lackner's sentencing is scheduled for June 30.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Marina Deykun; from the </F> "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] [Announcer Sergey Shatunov] According to Israeli  immigration services, between 200,000 and 500,000 former  residents of Russia and CIS countries will move to the Promised  Land before the end of the millennium. Our correspondent  continues on the same theme.    [Deykun] Starting from 1922, foreign exile became a form of  punishment for crimes in the USSR. It looks as if now  emigration is becoming a punishment for the state itself. Its  present wave, the fourth one according to specialist, is  economic emigration. According to the Labor Ministry figures,  some 100,000 people leave Russia every year. Most are skilled  workers, qualified specialists, and artists. The most alarming  feature is the brain drain from theoretical science and the  defense complex. After all, Western economies now accept only  highly qualified migrants. Another alarming feature is that one  migrant in three takes a child with him/her. This trend is on  the increase against the backdrop of an already adverse  demographic situation.    Where then do former Russian citizens move to? Mostly, to  Germany. In the past three years more than one half of emigre's  from this country have settled there. The United States is  pursuing a more cautious immigration policy. Between 1991 and  1993, some 40,000 Russian nationals settled there. Emigration  to the Promised Land has dropped sharply--probably because,  according to Israeli sociologists, only eight percent of  emigrants from the CIS managed to integrate completely into  society.    Studies conducted in this country show that eight percent of  Russian nationals do not rule out the possibility of leaving for  good. They are mostly town-dwellers, male, aged between 25 and  29, graduates. In the past three years, according to official  figures alone, 300,000 former Russian citizens have bidden  farewell to their homeland. That amounts to the entire  population of a city the size of Penza. [video shows street  scenes, people at the airport]</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH INSPECTIONS, PERMITS TO BE NEW TOOLS AGAINST CRACK HOUSES  </P> <P> People who want to make crack must get a permit and open their drug dens to  health inspections or face fines of $10,000 a day under new regulations  intended to help police gain entry to crack houses.  </P> <P> The King County regulations take effect April 1, allowing time for them to be  amended and maybe even scrapped after a review by prosecutors, said Charles  Kleeberg, environmental health director for the county and Seattle.  </P> <P> Kleeberg, a lawyer, said preliminary research indicated that no similar measure  is on the books anywhere in the country.  </P> <P> Dr. Bud Nicola, director of the Seattle-King County Health Department, said  health officials would be notified by police "that a crack operation was going  on in a house."  </P> <P> The department then would notify the owner of an apparent violation of health  regulations and order him or her to produce a plan for reducing the health  risk. A $100 review fee also is required.  </P> <P> "We would not expect to get a plan," Nicola said. "We would then start the fine  process."  </P> <P> The measure, adopted Wednesday by the county Health Board, offers another way  for police to gain entry to crack houses and gather evidence needed to close  them, said Cynthia Sullivan, a County Council member who is chairwoman of the  Health Board.  </P> <P> "The Board of Health has far broader abilities in many cases to enter a  residence than the police do," she said. "They don't have to have evidence of  criminal activity. They only have to have evidence of unhealthful activity."  </P> <P> The regulations were adopted despite requests by Robert Stier, a senior deputy  prosecutor, and county police Maj. Jackson Beard for further review. Stier said  he was not opposed to the measure but wanted to be sure it could withstand a  court challenge.  </P> <P> The proposal would apply outside the city of Seattle. About 500,000 of the  county's 1.4 million residents live in the city, which is governed by a  separate Health Board. A similar measure will be proposed in the city,  officials said.  </P></p>

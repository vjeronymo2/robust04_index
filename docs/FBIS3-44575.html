The visit, which will start "immediately" after the Moscow  summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President  Boris Yeltsin, is the first by the U.S. Treasury Secretary in a  year.    Bentsen, speaking here today, said his visit was to follow  up  on the progress made in Seattle last November during the  ministerial meeting and informal leaders' meeting of Asia  Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.    "We must recognize that the United States has a substantial  interest in the Pacific region," Bentsen said. "The Asia  Pacific region today is the fastest growing economy in the world  and we must be part of it."    The secretary said that his mission in the forthcoming tour  was to finalize the APEC finance ministers' meeting scheduled  this year, and was "about how each of us sees APEC as a vehicle  to further growth and development."    Indonesia, with the fourth-largest population in the world,  has an average real growth rate of six percent for the last 25  years, while Thailand's gross domestic product has been over  seven percent for the past seven years.    The economic growth of China was estimated at 13 percent  last  year.</p>

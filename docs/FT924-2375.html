			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Advert for bond irks advisers - A complicated product from Scottish Widows ADVISERS this week rushed to complain about an advertisement from Scottish Widows which they believe to be misleading. The product which aroused their ire is the Scottish Widows Monthly Bond. In spite of its name, the bond is not a single insurance policy, but a complicated financial product. It is a 'back-to-back investment' in which part of the capital sum goes into a temporary annuity, and the remainder into a Pep which attempts to grow enough to replace the capital lost in the annuity. The aim is to get a high income, while taking steps to limit the danger of capital loss. A Pep might grow considerably over the years - but it might not, and there is no guarantee that it will go up rather than down. This is why the Widows' slogan 'Up to 9.20 per cent net of basic rate tax fixed for five years' could be misleading. The income from the annuity is fixed, but there is nothing fixed about the Pep. The use of a 'fixed' figure for interest implies the capital stays constant, and there is nothing in Scottish Widows' advertising to say otherwise, or even a mention that the bulk of the investment goes into a Pep. The warning is given in much smaller letters at the bottom of the advertisement: 'The value of stockmarket investments may fall as well as rise and investors may not get back the full amount originally invested'. A letter sent to clients by the independent intermediary RJ Temple also quotes the 9.2 per cent return, and then adds: 'The Monthly Bond aims to return your original investment in full at the end of five years - totally tax-free. Of course, the growth rate cannot be guaranteed and you may get back more or less than the sum you invested, according to the performance achieved. However, with Scottish Widows, you can rest assured that your money will be in very experienced and capable hands indeed.' John Spiers, of BESt Investment, would have gone into rather greater detail. He said: 'In order for a full return of capital to be obtained the assets in the trust must grow at 13 per cent per annum. This is much greater than that achieved by most equity funds over the past five years.' Another adviser has taken a similar view, and has made a complaint to Lautro. By his calculations, if the yield on the UK High Income unit trust, which backs the Pep, is maintained, annual capital growth of 8.3 per cent will be needed to return the capital in full. Assuming an average annual total return of 8.5 per cent (the lower rate prescribed by Imro, the investment managers' regulator), then an initial investment of Pounds 4,932 would drop to Pounds 4,016, and a Pounds 9,864 investment would drop to Pounds 8,032 at the end of five years - a drop of 22.8 per cent. If the Pep failed to grow at all, the capital loss would be 40 per cent; and the Pep could fall in value. David Graham, of Scottish Widows unit trusts, admits that the 13 per cent growth rate required is 'slightly optimistic' - not a judgment contained anywhere in the literature - but said that over each five-year period from 1974 to 1991 (but not 1987-92), it would have been achieved. He also said further projections of Pep performance would be sent to customers during the 'cooling-off period', and investors could withdraw then.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading HOPES OF a cut in base rates brought a sharp advance in stock index futures, although a downturn on Wall Street saw some of the gain surrendered late in the session, writes Joel Kibazo. Traders expected a good day when the March contract on the FT-SE opened 23 points above Wednesday's close at 2,786. After a temporary dip to 2,776, hopes of a rate cut led to strong demand for the contract and also helped to pull the underlying cash market higher. Sentiment in the futures was further boosted by good activity in short sterling, and the day's high of 2,798 was reached at around 2.30pm. The turnround in New York after initial firmness led to a reversal in the fortunes of March, and it drifted lower for the rest of the session as profit-takers cashed in on early gains. March closed at 2,785, up 22 from its previous close and around 11 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash. Turnover was a reasonable 8,503 contracts. Volume in the traded options returned to more modest levels, reaching 26,312 lots. The FT-SE 100 option, which expires today, was the main attraction. It had a total of 11,770 contracts traded, although there was little interest in the Euro FT-SE option, which saw a mere 737 lots change hands. TSB was the busiest stock option with a total of 986 lots dealt.</p>

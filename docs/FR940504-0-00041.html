			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Impose interest based on the rate of U.S. Treasury obligations (with maturities closest to the duration of the license term) at the time of licensing; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Allow installment payments for the full license term; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Begin with interest-only payments for the first two years; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Amortize principal and interest over the remaining term of the license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A license granted to an eligible entity that elects installment payments shall be conditioned upon the full and timely performance of the licensee's payment obligations under the installment plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If an eligible entity making installment payments is more than ninety (90) days delinquent in any payment, it shall be in default. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Upon default or in anticipation of default of one or more installment payments, a licensee may request that the Commission permit a three to six month grace period, during which no installment payments need be made. In considering whether to grant a request for a grace period, the Commission may consider, among other things, the licensee's payment history, including whether the licensee has defaulted before, how far into the license term the default occurs, the reasons for default, whether the licensee has met construction build-out requirements, the licensee's financial condition, and whether the licensee is seeking a buyer under an authorized distress sale policy. If the Commission grants a request for a grace period, or otherwise approves a restructured payment schedule, interest will continue to accrue and will be amortized over the remaining term of the license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Following expiration of any grace period without successful resumption of payment or upon denial of a grace period request, or upon default with no such request submitted, the license will automatically cancel and the Commission will initiate debt collection procedures pursuant to subpart O of this part. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The Commission may award bidding credits ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  payment discounts) to eligible designated entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Competitive bidding rules applicable to individual services will specify the designated entities eligible for bidding credits, the licenses for which bidding credits are available, the amounts of bidding credits and other procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any bidding credit for rural telephone companies will be available only for licenses in rural telephone company service areas and only if eligible rural telephone companies make an infrastructure build-out commitment beyond any standard performance requirement. The amount of the bidding credit for rural telephone companies will be based on the amount by which eligible applicants agree to expand or accelerate the build-out commitment. If a rural telephone company fails to meet an accelerated or expanded build-out commitment, it must make payment to the Commission within ninety (90) days of a penalty equal to the amount of the bidding credit. Grant of the license will be conditioned upon payment of this penalty if and when it becomes applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) The Commission may offer designated entities a combination of the available preferences or additional preferences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.2111 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Assignment or transfer of control: Unjust enrichment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting requirement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's Rules) of a license within three years of receiving a new license through a competitive bidding procedure must, together with its application for transfer of control or assignment, file with the Commission a statement indicating that its license was obtained through competitive bidding. Such applicant must also file with the Commission the associated contracts for sale, option agreements, management agreements, or other documents disclosing the total consideration that the applicant would receive in return for the transfer or assignment of its license. This information should include not only a monetary purchase price, but also any future, contingent, in-kind, or other consideration ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> management or consulting contracts either with or without an option to purchase; below market financing). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unjust enrichment payment: set-asides.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As specified in this paragraph (b), an applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's Rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor pursuant to a set-aside for eligible designated entities under &sect;1.2110(c), or who proposes to take any other action relating to ownership or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek Commission approval and may be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the Commission by cashier's check or wire transfer before consent will be granted. The Payment will be based upon a schedule that will take account of the term of the license, any applicable construction benchmarks, and the estimated value of the set-aside benefit, which will be calculated as the difference between the amount paid by the designated entity for the license and the value of a comparable non-set-aside license in the free market at the time of the auction. The Commission will establish the amount of the Payment and the burden will be on the applicants to disprove this amount. No Payment will be required if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The license is transferred or assigned more than five years after its initial issuance; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed transferee or assignee is an eligible designated entity under &sect;1.2110(c), and so certifies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unjust enrichment payment: installment financing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's Rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor through a competitive bidding procedure utilizing installment financing available to designated entities under &sect;1.2110(d) will be required to pay the full amount of the remaining principal balance as a condition of the license transfer. No payment will be required if the proposed transferee or assignee assumes the installment payment obligations of the transferor or assignor, and if the proposed transferee or assignee is itself qualified to obtain installment financing under &sect;1.2110(d), and so certifies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unjust enrichment payment: bidding credits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An applicant seeking approval for a transfer of control or assignment (otherwise permitted under the Commission's Rules) of a license acquired by the transferor or assignor through a competitive bidding procedure utilizing bidding credits available to eligible designated entities under &sect;1.2110(e), or who proposes to take any other action relating to ownership or control that will result in loss of status as an eligible designated entity, must seek Commission approval and will be required to make an unjust enrichment payment (Payment) to the Government by wire transfer or cashier's check before consent will be granted. The Payment will be the sum of the amount of the bidding credit plus interest at the rate applicable for installment financing in effect at the time the license was awarded. See &sect;1.2110(e). No payment will be required if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The proposed transferee or assignee is an eligible designated entity under &sect;1.2110(e), and so certifies; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The proposed transferor or assignor is a rural telephone company as defined in &sect;1.2110(b)(3), and the proposed transferee or assignee is also a rural telephone company and agrees to meet the same construction requirements as the transferor or assignor.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Communications Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William F.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, June 13 (SNARK)--The presidential governing  is the only acceptable form for Armenia, considers the Armenian  President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Speaking to the extraordinary  session of the Armenian Parliament which was devoted to the  discussion of the project of the new constitution, he said that  the parliamentary system may be effective only in those  countries where 2-3 powerful parties are established, and one of  them takes the parliamentary majority. "Such parties may appear  in Armenia only in dozens years. And even if we take we take  the parliamentary governing, in some time we will have to come  to the presidential governing but at the cost of greater  trials", said the president. He also mentioned that Armenia has  the unique chance to refuse from offering self-independence to  the regions and build the "classic unitary state".    According to Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the official project of  the new constitution reflects all the basic principles of the  international law to let the republic overcome the  inter-political crisis and civil war.</p>

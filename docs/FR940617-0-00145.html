			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EMA noted a difference between the NPRM definition and the definition given in the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA) upon which the EPA definition was based, but did not recommend EPA use the LIA definition in the definition EMA provided. The only difference between the EPA definition and the LIA definition is that the LIA definition of locomotive includes a piece of equipment without propelling motors but with one or more control stands. This item was not included by EPA since if it has no propelling motors it will not be of concern for purposes of engine emissions regulations. It is noted that neither the Association of American Railroads (AAR) nor any railroad companies that commented on the NPRM, such as Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, had any specific comments on the definition of locomotive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EMA provided definitions for ``locomotive'' and ``locomotive engine''. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under this definition, the regulation of any engine mounted on a locomotive (such as an engine driving a crane or winch) would be preempted. The dictionary definition of ``locomotive'' is a ``self-propelled vehicle, usually diesel or electric, that travels on rails and moves railroad cars.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EMA's definition of locomotive engine goes beyond the specific purpose of locomotion to include any other engine that might be placed on a locomotive. EPA believes that the term ``locomotive engine'' is limited to the engine used to propel the locomotive and other railroad cars. However, EPA does believe that the term ``engines used in locomotives,'' as found in section 209(e)(1)(B), can be defined to include other engines which are mounted on a locomotive regardless of whether they are used for purposes of self-propulsion. EPA notes that under this definitional framework the ``locomotive'' is only that piece of on-track equipment which is self-propelling and is designed for moving other cars containing equipment, freight, or passengers. ``Engines used in locomotives'' thus includes an engine placed in the locomotive to propel the train and also includes other engines mounted on the locomotive for auxiliary power generation for the train, but does not include engines mounted on the train elsewhere than the locomotive. An engine providing power for a crane or winch, for example, would only be considered preempted from state regulation (if it otherwise met the requirements for ``new'') as ``an engine used in [a] locomotive'' if such engine were mounted on the locomotive. EPA believes these definitions reflect the intent of Congress to reduce the burden on interstate commerce for the railroad industry, and address EMA's concerns regarding auxiliary engines. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EMA recommended the following definitions: ``Locomotive'' means a self-propelled piece of on-track railroad equipment (other than equipment designed for operation both on-highway and on-track) and ``Locomotive engine'' means an engine included in a locomotive. See Statement of Engine Manufacturers Association, Docket entry IV-G&hyph;19.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Websters II, New Riverside University Dictionary, 1988.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Letter from Glenn Keller, EMA to Joanne Goldhand, EPA, Docket entry IV&hyph;I&hyph;54.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has stricken the word ``carrying'' from the definition of locomotive. This was done to avoid implying that any persons or property that were moved by the engine had to be located directly on the locomotive. The word ``moving'' in the definition is all that is needed to give the correct meaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the final rule, EPA has decided that a ``locomotive'' means a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, specialized maintenance equipment, and other similar equipment) designed for moving other equipment, freight or passenger traffic. EPA has also decided that the term ``engines used in locomotives'' means either an engine placed in the locomotive to move other equipment, freight , or passenger traffic, or an engine mounted on the locomotive to provide auxiliary power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Cost Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has adjusted its estimate of the average annual cost of this rule upward from approximately $29 million to $70 million. EPA has decided to make the adjustment after analyzing new information provided by commenters with respect to the engine modifications required to meet the adopted emission standards and updated cost information provided confidentially by manufacturers. Based on EPA's revised analysis (see the final version of the Regulatory Support Document in the docket), the Agency has adjusted the present value of the per engine increase in retail price of a 1996 model year engine upward from approximately $110 per engine to approximately $220 per engine (in 1992 dollars).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

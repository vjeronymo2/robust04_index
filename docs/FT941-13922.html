			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Yes, you can defer CGT - Caroline Garnham is cheered by reinvestment relief on gains Details of a way of deferring payment of capital gains tax, published in the Finance Bill last week, really are as good as expected. The reinvestment relief for CGT operates to relieve all gains no matter how they are made, provided the gain is reinvested in the shares of an unquoted trading company, whether your own or a family company, or a company run by a complete stranger. The relief may not appeal to everyone, since unquoted trading company shares are regarded as inherently risky. However, there are circumstances, particularly within entrepreneurial families, where this relief could be a way of postponing payment of the tax indefinitely. To give you an idea of how it can be made to work, take for example Mr James: Mr James sold his retail business five years ago. He reinvested part of the proceeds - Pounds 700,000 - in the freehold of a shopping centre which has since increased in value (after inflation) by Pounds 200,000. His daughter, Jennifer, has a pre-packaged food business which she runs through an unquoted private company. The company needs additional finance to expand and Mr James is willing to assist, especially if he can sell his interest in the shopping centre and avoid an immediate charge to tax on the Pounds 200,000 gain. Provided Mr James invests at least Pounds 200,000 (that is, the gain on the sale of the shopping centre) in ordinary unquoted shares of his daughter's company, his gain on the shopping centre can be deferred until the sale (or gift) of the shares in his daughter's company. Let us further assume that since the sale of Mr James' retail business, he has been a full-time working director of his daughter's company. Let us also assume that he invests Pounds 250,000 in his daughter's company, which is 30 per cent of the ordinary share capital. His investment in Jennifer's company will now also start to qualify for retirement relief. Assuming Mr James works full-time for the company for a further five years before selling his 30 per cent stake for Pounds 400,000, not only would the gain of Pounds 150,000 attract 100 per cent relief, but in addition the Pounds 200,000 gain rolled over from the sale of the shopping centre would also attract retirement relief (on the first Pounds 100,000 at 100 per cent and the remaining Pounds 50,000 at 50 per cent at current retirement relief rates). Alternatively, let us suppose that Mr James is in poor health and has not worked for the company. He would like to sell his shopping centre to help his daughter but is reluctant to do so for fear of incurring a high CGT charge which would be avoided if he kept the shopping centre until his death. With this new relief, Mr James should be able to avoid not only the CGT charge, but inheritance tax as well. If Mr James were to sell his shopping centre and reinvest Pounds 250,000 to take a 30 per cent stake in Jennifer's business, on his death all gains, including the rollover gain on the shopping centre, will be exempt and the shares in Jennifer's company should qualify for business property relief and be totally exempt from IHT as well. Mr James need not necessarily become involved in the decision-making process of Jennifer's company. It is possible for him to gift his shares in Jennifer's company into a trust for himself and appoint Jennifer as a Trustee. Jennifer will then remain in full control of the decisions affecting the company and, assuming Mr James can claim relief for gifts of business assets, putting the shares into a trust will not give rise to an immediate charge, nor will it affect his eligibility for full CGT relief and IHT relief on death. The new reinvestment relief is not limited to sales. For example, if Mr James gave his freehold interest in the shopping centre to his son Paul, say, as a wedding gift, the tax on the gain (as calculated against market value) could still be avoided, provided Mr James invests a sum equivalent to the chargeable gain made on his shopping centre in unquoted private company shares such as in Jennifer's company. Of course, as with all reliefs where the gain is deferred, if the company and shares do not qualify and continue to qualify then the tax becomes payable immediately. As you would expect, there are a number of irritating conditions which must be satisfied before the relief is available. One of these is that if the company holds more than half of its chargeable assets in land, it will fail to qualify. There are provisions which permit the reduction of the value of land by securing debts against it. Therefore, if your land is relatively too high in value, the company could raise money using the land as security. In addition, or alternatively, it could invest in chargeable assets and thereby reduce the company's interest in land to less than half. In addition, you must continue to monitor the chargeable assets of the company to make sure that over the years, the value of the land does not increase beyond the value of the company's other chargeable assets and thereby disqualify the company. If this were to happen, all is not lost. Provided you invest more money (up to the value of the held-over gain) in other unquoted shares within the time limits, the held-over gain will not become chargeable. The new reinvestment relief is a useful addition to the other reliefs already available. Unfortunately,there is little harmonisation between the reliefs. To qualify for the 100 per cent IHT business property relief you must hold 25 per cent or more of ordinary shares, whether they are quoted or unquoted; for retirement relief you need to hold at least 5 per cent of unquoted qualifying shares; and, for reinvestment relief, the relief is available no matter what your holding is, provided your shares are unquoted qualifying shares. If you give business assets (and claim relief for gifts of business assets), you will not be liable for the tax but the person to whom you give the assets will be, although only when they dispose of them. However, if you sell assets and reinvest the proceeds in unquoted trading company shares (and claim reinvestment relief), you would still be liable for the tax on the gain but it will be deferred until you dispose of them. Avoid do-it-yourself tax mitigation schemes because of the complexity created through the legislation. Caroline Garnham is a tax and trusts specialist at City solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons.</p>

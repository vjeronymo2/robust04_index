			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 11 April, TASS -- The People's Party of  Tajikistan, a new socio-political organisation, would like to  actively assist the process of political, economic, and  religious renewal of the Tajik society.    The party's rules and programme were published in Sunday's  newspapers. The programme's strategic goal was named as being  "the union of all Tajikistan citizens, regardless of their  nationality, native language, political beliefs, and  professional and ethno-cultural orientation, for the sake of  building a law-based, democratic, secular state."    Further, the programme called for Tajikistan's "active  participation in a civilized transition to a market economy with  the maintenance of state-provided education, health care,  cultural programmes, social security for the underprivileged,  and other social programmes."    In their statements, the party's founders do not try to hide  their desire to come to power by nominating their  representatives to posts in state and governmental structures  and by receiving a majority of deputy mandates in the new  parliament. However, they categorically condemn any attempts to  achieve such goals through violence.    At the same time, note independent observers, the new party  does not need to win power, since the idea of organising the new  political structure originated in the highest governmental  structures themselves. Chairman of the new party's  organisational committee is First Deputy Chairman of  Tajikistan's Supreme Soviet Abdumadzhi Dostyev.    The social make-up of the new party is likewise easy to  foresee. Many heads of local councils and administrations, as  well as a majority of the Republic's industrial managers' corps,  have already declared their intention of joining the new party.</p>

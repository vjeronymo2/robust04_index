			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovene Defense Minister Janez Jansa by </F> Teodor Marjanovic in Ljubljana; date not given: "At the Moment,  We Are Not Threatened by War"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Marjanovic] You made a  statement recently, according to which, at the time before  Slovenia became a UN member and therefore did not feel itself  bound by resolutions of that organization, arms shipments to  Croatia and Bosnia were passing through its territory -- with  the knowledge of the Slovene bodies.    [Jansa] No. I said that, at the time, Slovenia helped the  two assaulted states, not by the permission to transfer weapons  through our territory, but rather by providing them with some of  the weapons expropriated from the Yugoslav People's Army. That  assistance ended long before our country was recognized by the  United Nations.    [Marjanovic] Slovenia, as one of the former Yugoslav  republics, is still subject to the arms embargo.    [Jansa] The entity on which the embargo was imposed -- the  former Yugoslavia -- no longer exists, and therefore the embargo  should not apply to us. There has been no embargo imposed on  Slovenia as an independent country. Nevertheless, it has been  applied in practice.    [Marjanovic] Does it prevent your entry into the Partnership  for Peace project?    [Jansa] We were told that it will not be a hindrance.  Precisely, our joining the "Partnership" is a feasible way of  leaving the entity on which the embargo was imposed.    [Marjanovic] Nonetheless, Slovene politics have not assumed  a consistent stand regarding that project.    [Jansa] According to public opinion surveys, most of the  citizens agree with our joining the "Partnership." That is in  harmony with the government and most deputies in the parliament.  After all, the parliament adopted a special resolution last year  stating that the Slovenia's objective is full membership in the  North Atlantic Alliance. There are forces here, however, that  oppose it. They do not have a majority, nevertheless they play  an important role on the political scale: They are, above all,  some of the liberal democrats, currently the strongest Slovene  party, and the entire party of the former communists. Even  these people understand, however, that a direct opposition runs  contrary to public inclinations, and therefore they have been  using all kinds of intrigues and frauds to block actual  cooperation with the Alliance. Because of one such intrigue, for  instance, the cooperation with the U.S. National Guard, which is  of a great importance to our army, has been jeopardized. These  are the same people who, as early as spring 1991, tried to  prevent the formation of the Slovene Army and render Slovene  independence impossible. Today, they disagree with spending on  the establishment of a defense system that would be comparable  with the European one. Therefore, none of our units has a  communication system compatible with the Western standards. At  the same time, the "Partnership" assumes precisely compatible  equipment so that one of the principal intentions could be  realized -- joint military exercises.  <H5>  Business as Usual </H5>   [Marjanovic] What exactly is the objective of the Slovene  communists?    [Jansa] The problem is that Slovenia has not passed through  such a change as the Czech Republic, for instance. The top  echelons of the past regime remained virtually unchanged in  Slovenia and continue to operate from the same positions they  held then. Hence, they are people who have, for 40 or 50 years,  been spreading fear about a West that thirsts for our blood, and  today, it is, for them, just a simple extension of business as  usual. For them, the North Atlantic alliance has always been a  tool of imperialism. Their goal is to keep Slovenia outside the  European and world integration, because they have not yet  abandoned the idea of joining Slovenia -- or at least  cooperating -- with those countries in which socialism has  survived, be it in the territory of the former Yugoslavia or on  a wider scale.    [Marjanovic] Does it mean that a substantial number of  Slovene politicians endorse the idea of the revival of  Yugoslavia?    [Jansa] Yes. It is not based on political ideas, however,  but rather on purely economic interests and, last but not least,  also on family relations.    [Marjanovic] What about President Kucan?    [Jansa] To a great degree, the president symbolizes this  situation: Until recently, he was -- the last -- chairman of  the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovenia. It is  characteristic of the situation that, at one of its last plenums  (before the party changed its name), their Central Committee  condemned the "politics of U.S. imperialism." Although they  speak differently today, the thinking of those people has simply  not changed.   <H5>    We Do Not Control Our Own Airspace </H5>   [Marjanovic] Can Slovenia today shop the world markets for  arms?    [Jansa] So far, we have not assigned any money for such  purchases. Whether anyone would sell us something depends on  how he views our country, either as an independent country or as  a republic of the former Yugoslavia. From the legal point of  view, the countries that recognized us should no longer apply  the embargo to us. Nevertheless, it is not just the sale of  arms. The world as a whole still refers to the term of "former  Yugoslavia," be it in matters regarding the UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] or other world undertakings. As soon as that term  disappears, the resolution on the embargo will no longer be  valid.    [Marjanovic] So, until then, foreign aircraft can fly over  Slovenia at an altitude of 6,000 meters and the Slovene anti-  aircraft defenses will not act --because of a lack of technical  equipment?    [Jansa] It would register them in some regions, but would  not be able to take any action against them. In other places,  they would not even be registered. We do not even control our  air space as a whole today, how could we think of defending it?    [Marjanovic] Upon the recent announcement of the NATO  ultimatum regarding the withdrawal of heavy equipment from the  proximity of Sarajevo, you said that the alliance did not adopt  any security provisions for the surrounding countries. Do you  believe that the danger still exists of dragging Slovenia into  the Balkan war?    [Jansa] At the moment, such a danger is not likely. It  would be different if the conflict again approached our border.  Regarding the ultimatum, one cannot but note that it did not  think of the possible consequences. If threatened, the Serbian  forces could act completely irrationally and endanger the  neighboring countries.    [Marjanovic] You do not consider the Slovene-Croatian border  dispute dangerous?    [Jansa] This does not concern such great problems that it  could become the reason for a military conflict.  <H5>  Muslims Are No Longer Naive </H5>   [Marjanovic] What would be the consequences of imposing  economic sanctions against Croatia? Do you believe that such a  step would be reflected in an even closer cooperation between  the Croatian and Serbian forces in Bosnia?    [Jansa] Yes, in the event of anti-Croat sanctions, one could  also contemplate the Serbs and the Croats coming closer  together. The pressure on Muslims would be only enhanced. The  key issue of Serbo-Croatian relationship would nevertheless  remain unsolved -- the conquered territory in Croatia.    [Marjanovic] How long, do you believe, can the war continue?    [Jansa] Neither of the so-called warring sides has such  supremacy that it could achieve an absolute military victory.  Not even the greater cooperation you mentioned, between the  Serbs and the Croats, could definitely defeat the Muslims in a  short time span. After all, they have also consolidated  themselves, and -- especially -- they are no longer naive. It  was precisely their naivete that resulted in such a large number  of Muslim casualties. They no longer say that they do not know  where the grenades are coming from.    If the world continues to let the war lie fallow, it can all  go on for a very long time. The peace potentials necessary for  the war to end by itself simply do not exist here. If it all  goes on, then, the danger of its spreading to our territory  remains. Measures to prevent this were taken in Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. The deployment  of symbolic U.S. units there means a lot for the situation. In  the case of Kosovo, however, the world assumed that the region  is an administrative part of Serbia.    [Marjanovic] Hence, it will not object to conceivable ethnic  purges?    [Jansa] They have taken place there for the past 15 years,  and the world had no objections.</p>

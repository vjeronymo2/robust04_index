			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Industry's financial health 'on the mend' THE financial health of industry is on the mend, a leading group of risk assessors said yesterday. It reported that the proportion of quoted companies at risk of failure was falling for the first time since 1988. Syspas, the London-based consultants, said industrial companies showing a decreasing risk of failure in the past three months outnumber those showing higher risk by 50 per cent, a reversal of past trends. The Syspas method involves defining the financial characteristics of companies that have failed in the past and finding how far existing companies conform to that pattern. Syspas claims to have predicted the present recession at the beginning of 1989, based on the rising number of companies shown to be at risk. It also identified Maxwell Communication Corporation as 'beyond saving in its present form' some time before the death of Robert Maxwell in November last year. At the peak of the boom in 1988, the Syspas model suggested that 11 per cent of all quoted industrial companies showed at least some risk of failure. The figure then rose to a peak of 26 per cent in May of this year. The present figure is put at 25 per cent.</p>

Dhlakama was reacting to the position of the political parties  that they will boycott the first free and democratic elections  in the country, scheduled for next October, if the Mozambican  Government does not make available money.    Afonso Dhlakama also told Radio Mozambique that he will  preside over his troops' demobilization ceremony at the Neves  Assembly Area in Inhambane Province on 18 March. The Renamo  leader said this shortly before his departure for Renamo's  headquarters in Maringue.</p>

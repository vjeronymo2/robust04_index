			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / World Trade News: GE invests in Austria GENERAL Electric of the US yesterday strengthened its position in European power generation markets through a Dollars 2.5m investment in Elin Energieversorgung, the Austrian power plant contractor, to underpin a broad joint venture by the two groups. The venture will put GE's expertise in gas turbine technology and combined-cycle power stations with Elin's power contracting activities in designing and managing the building of power stations. GE will thus take about 5 per cent of Elin Energieversorgung. Elin said the joint venture would concentrate on power projects in Austria, the other German-speaking areas of central Europe and Scandinavia. The two groups will also collaborate in the Far East and south-east Asia.</p>

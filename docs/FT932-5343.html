			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Travellers given flight options BRITISH AIRWAYS last night began offering three options to passengers who might be affected by a strike by its ground staff and cabin crew. These included booking them on an alternative BA flight on a different day; offering a flight the same day on another airline; or giving a full refund, including non-refundable Apex or other promotional fares. Passengers can contact BA at two numbers: 081-897 4000 in London and 0345-222111 outside the capital. The airline carries on average about 70,000 passengers a day worldwide. It said last night it would accept responsibility for travel dis-ruption caused to passengers by the industrial action. Under its contingency plans for a full 24-hour strike, BA said it expected to operate more than half its long-haul transcontinental services, 11 of its usual 150 services to Europe from Heathrow, and regional services to overseas destinations. There will be no domestic services from Heathrow or Gatwick. As many as 470 flights to and from Heathrow and Gatwick might have to be cancelled. BA said it did not expect Concorde flights to be affected. It expected to operate one flight to Latin America and two to South Africa.</p>

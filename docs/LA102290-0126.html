BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SOVIET PREDICTS OIL OUTPUT DROP  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's declining oil output will show another drop in 1991, a  senior government official said in an interview published today.  </P> <P> Old-fashioned equipment and supply problems are increasingly hampering the oil  industry in the Soviet Union, the world's largest producer of crude oil, at a  time when prices are high.  </P> <P> Artem Troitsky, state planning commission deputy chairman, told the Communist  Party daily Pravda that only massive amounts of new investment in the oil  industry could avert continuing production declines.  </P> <P> Official figures released Friday showed Soviet oil production dropped 3.35  million barrels to 61.85 million barrels in the first nine months of 1990,  compared to the year-ago period.  </P></p>

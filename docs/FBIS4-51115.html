			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Scott McKenzie] </F>   [Text] The number of emigrants returning to Hong Kong is  so high that businesses would be hard hit if they were to head  back overseas, the Government said yesterday.    More than 8,000 people who had fled Hong Kong to obtain  foreign passports had returned to take advantage of the economic  boom in 1992, said Deputy Secretary for Security Keith Kwok  Ka-keung. "In the event of an economic downturn they could very  well pack their suitcases and leave again. It is entirely  possible," he said.    He did not have figures for the number of returnees last  year, but said it was likely to be higher than 1992. Results of  a survey on the problem would be released later in the year? Mr  Kwok said.    Hong Kong University immigration expert Dr Ronald Skeldon  said he believed "huge numbers" of emigrants had returned to  Hong Kong in recent years and they were not reflected in  official figures.    Dr Skeldon said the territory should be very aware that an  economic downturn would send these people away in large numbers.  "The main reason they have come here is for the money they were  unable to make elsewhere and if that should change, they will  leave," he said. The departure of people who worked in  highly-skilled fields would leave a void far larger than that  caused by the 1989 Beijing massacre which acted as a catalyst  for emigration.    Mr Kwok said about 53,000 people emigrated from Hong Kong  last year compared with 66,000 in 1992. Economic good times in  the territory coupled with an economic downturn in countries  such as Australia and Canada were major reasons for the drop.    Another cause was a reduced intake from some destination  countries. The figures are based on the number of visas issued  by consulates in Hong Kong. They do not include immigrant visas  issued in other countries which an in creasing number of people  are turning to in an effort to bypass the long delays for visas  in Hong Kong.    Mr Kwok estimated a further 13 percent, or about 7,000, on  top of the 53,000 who emigrated last year could have done so  with visas obtained outside Hong Kong. That is an increase of  about 12 percent from the 1990 figures.    To counter the problem in 1989, the Government initiated the  British Nationality Selection Scheme which offered British  passports to 13,160 heads of households and their dependants.  The scheme offered an "insurance policy" to skilled people and  kept them working in Hong Kong rather than leaving to get  foreign passports.    Mr Kwok said it was "a bit risky" to say the scheme had a  direct impact on the drop in emigration numbers for this year.  But it might have had a stabilising effect.</p>

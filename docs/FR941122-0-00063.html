Experiences in North America indicate that human disturbance, even around active den sites, is not a significant factor affecting wolf survival or population growth (Service 1994a, Appendix 13). The rule protects active wolf dens during the earliest stages of wolf recovery, if necessary. Killing wolves is illegal except for a very few limited exceptions. The rule allows flexibility to reconsider land use restrictions if wolf populations do not grow toward recovery levels. Wolves in Montana have not needed land-use restrictions and, at this time, land-use restrictions do not appear necessary for wolf populations to recover in Idaho or Wyoming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 18:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Private individuals should not be able to kill wolves, even by permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The opportunity for private individuals to kill wolves in the experimental population areas is limited to when wolves are actually in the act of killing livestock. The Service has determined that wolves that exhibit this behavior do not further conservation of the species and for that reason are currently controlled (Service 1988). The selective removal of this type of individual by the public is warranted in certain limited circumstances and their removal contributes to conservation of the species. Agency control would be initiated anyway and, under tight regulation, public control can be more likely to remove the specific problem individual than agency control actions. If a wolf is taken in the act of depredating, further agency control would not be conducted unless additional depredations occur. This limited taking of wolves by the private sector could reduce the total number of wolves that might be taken in response to livestock depredations and reduces the opportunity for other wolves to feed on or learn to depredate on livestock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 19:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary has not made the determination that use of an experimental rule and reintroduction of wolves would further the conservation of the species as required by 50 CFR 17.81.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the Service's EIS, in the proposed rule, and in the final rule, removal of wolves from Canadian populations would not significantly impact those populations (59 FR 42110); the likelihood that wolf populations would become permanently established and grow to recovery level is extremely high (59 FR 42111); reintroduction would greatly accelerate wolf population recovery, enhance wolf population viability, and lead to subsequent delisting (59 FR 42110); and the reintroduced wolves and subsequent population that developed would not be affected by existing or anticipated Federal or State actions or private activities within or adjacent to the experimental population area (59 FR 42112), therefore, the release of the experimental wolves would further the conservation of the species (Service 1994a, Service 1994b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

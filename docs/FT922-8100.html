			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / MPs warn Lloyds Bank on Midland SENIOR TORY MPs yesterday warned Lloyds Bank that it may be prevented from integrating Midland fully for at least two years if its conditional bid for its fellow UK clearer is successful. The delay could arise because of the need for a private Act of Parliament to transfer assets and liabilities from one bank to another. 'Lloyds needs to take account of the fact it might be necessary for them to run Midland as a subsidiary for two years or more,' according to one MP. The warning came at a private meeting at London's Horseguards Hotel with six senior Conservative backbenchers, including two former ministers. The meeting took place against a background of increased lobbying at Westminster by both Lloyds and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, its rival for Midland. However, Lloyds advisers do not anticipate that the time needed for a private Bill to pass through parliament would present a problem because it would not wish to transfer assets immediately after a takeover. MPs present at yesterday's meeting with Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman, and Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds chief executive, included Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Tim Renton, former arts minister and chief whip. Other issues discussed included the effect of a Lloyds takeover on competition in the corporate banking sector and the question of how best to address the problem of the differing regulatory requirements applying to domestic and cross-border bids. According to one account, Mr Pitman argued 'forcefully' that Britain was overbanked and that a 'planned' reduction in capacity was the best approach. 'I found him persuasive on that point,' the MP said. Ten MPs signed an early day motion backing Hongkong's offer on the grounds that a takeover by Lloyds would reduce competition.</p>

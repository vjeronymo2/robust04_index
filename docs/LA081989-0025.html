			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ZEILE GETS OUT OF BOX QUICKLY IN BIG-LEAGUE DEBUT  </P> <P> Todd Zeile had been patient so far, but this time he couldn't wait.  </P> <P> The team bus wasn't leaving for another two hours, but Zeile wanted to arrive  at Riverfront Stadium before any of his new St. Louis Cardinal teammates.  </P> <P> For Ozzie Smith, Pedro Guerrero and Vince Coleman, playing a doubleheader  against the Cincinnati Reds might not be that thrilling. After all, they  already had played 119 games this season and hundreds before that.  </P> <P> But for Zeile, Friday was the first day of his major league career.  </P> <P> Zeile, who was called up from the Cardinals' triple-A team in Louisville on  Wednesday, was two for four in the second game after grounding out to third as  a pinch-hitter in the first game. Zeile's first major league hit was a single  to center in the fifth. He also had an infield single in the seventh.  </P> <P> "Half of me realizes I'm finally here and the other half thinks I'm dreaming,"  Zeile said before the doubleheader. "This is a goal I've been trying to reach  for a long time. I hope to make it last."  </P> <P> Zeile, along with Sandy Alomar Jr. of the San Diego Padres, have been touted as  the two best catching prospects in the minor leagues.  </P> <P> Before his promotion, Zeile had enjoyed success at every level of competition.  He was a third-round selection in the June, 1986, free-agent draft after  standout careers at Hart High and UCLA.  </P> <P> Playing for Springfield, Ill., at the Class-A level, Zeile was named co-most  valuable player in the Midwest League. He led the league with 106 runs batted  in and was second with 25 home runs. After suffering a broken bone in his right  hand, Zeile batted .270, hit 19 home runs and drove in 75 runs with Arkansas,  the Cardinals' double-A affiliate.  </P> <P> During the off-season, Zeile married former Olympic gymnast Julianne McNamara  of Encino. After making his first appearance at St. Louis' spring training camp  in St. Petersburg, Fla., he was ticketed to play a full season for the  Cardinals' triple-A team in Louisville.  </P> <P> "The Cardinals told me I would need to spend a full year in Louisville," he  said. "I didn't think I was going to be called up this soon."  </P> <P> In 118 games, he was second in the American Assn. with 85 RBIs and fourth among  all triple-A players. He also ranked in the top 10 with 19 home runs and a .289  batting average.  </P> <P> Zeile, who will turn 24 next month, replaced first baseman-outfielder Jim  Lindeman on the Cardinals' roster. He was informed of his promotion during a  team picnic.  </P> <P> "The manager called me to the side and said there has been a change of plans  and I was going to join the Cardinals in Cincinnati," Zeile said. "I first told  Julianne at the picnic and then I called my parents in Valencia. I told my mom  the news and for a half-second our hearts were beating and we didn't know what  to say."  </P> <P> Zeile's awe carried over to his arrival at the ballpark where he said he felt  like a fan walking into the Cardinals' locker room for the first time.  </P> <P> "Obviously, this is very exciting," Zeile said before the game. "I stood at the  door of the clubhouse for about five minutes and let everything soak in. I got  my stuff situated. I looked at my name on the back of my jersey. Then I'll get  into my daily routine and try and relax a little bit.  </P> <P> "I'm nervous, but that will change when the umpire says 'Play ball.' "  </P> <P> St. Louis thinks Zeile is ready to be the team's full-time starting catcher  beginning next season. Incumbent Tony Pena, who made the All-Star team for the  fifth time this season, becomes a free agent next year and his $2  million-a-year price tag may be too expensive to keep him.  </P> <P> The Cardinals hoped to trade Pena this week, but he failed to clear waivers,  negating a possible deal with the Philadelphia Phillies.  </P> <P> Zeile was told by Manager Whitey Herzog that he will share catching duties with  Pena until the end of the season.  </P> <P> "There's no way I'm going to come in and Pena's not going to play any more,"  Zeile said. "They're not going to turn their back on him. He's having a decent  year and we're still in the pennant race.  </P> <P> "I'm going to get 30 games under my belt and get some seasoning. I'll worry  about winning a starting job after next spring training. I just got here."  </P> <P> Sooner than most expected.  </P></p>

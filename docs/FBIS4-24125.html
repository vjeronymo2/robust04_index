			<p>BFN     [Text] The international members of the Supervision and  Control Commission [CSC] said in Maputo yesterday that they were  worried about the possibility of the government not being able  to complete the confinement and demobilization of its troops  within the timetable that it agreed to fulfill. A communique  received in our newsroom says the timetable already represents a  one-month delay in relation to the dates set by the May 1994 UN  Security Council resolution. The international members of the  CSC noted that between 14 and 21 June only 821 men reported to  government assembly points. Taking into account the personnel  involved, the joint communique said 11,448 troops still need to  report to the assembly points. The deadline for the confinement  and demobilization of troops expires on 30 June.</p>

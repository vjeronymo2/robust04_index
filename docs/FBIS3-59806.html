			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Steve Rodan: "The Settler Question"] </F>   [Text] Israel and the PLO might be fighting tooth-and-nail  over the details of the interim agreement for Palestinian  self-rule. But both sides quietly agree that the fate of the  130,000 settlers is the chief issue in the talks on the  permanent status of the territories.    Publicly, the PLO says all the settlements have to go. In  November, the PLO organ, FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH, outlined the  organization's view that whatever came with the Israelis must  leave with them. It is a position that embraces the Jewish  neighborhoods built after the Six-Day War.    Jamil Zakut, a Gaza deportee and member of the Palestinian  delegation to the talks on implementing the interim accord,  agrees. "These settlements were the product of military  occupation," he says. "There is no way we can accept a military  entity inside a Palestinian state."    Privately, Israeli and PLO officials say there can be a  compromise. A senior minister says he has been given assurances  that Jewish settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza can remain as  Palestinian citizens. He says virtually nobody in the  government wants to physically remove the settlers.    But senior PLO sources make it clear that even if the  settlers are allowed to stay, life will not be easy for them.  First, they say, 'Arafat will not agree to such a large number  of Jews living in areas they consider strategic, such as the  Jordan Valley, and the ridge from Ramallah to the north to  Hebron in the south.    "We cannot digest such a large number of foreigners," one  PLO  source says.    Some PLO officials already have a solution. After they  insist on a reduction in the number of Jewish residents in the  territories, the Palestinians will insist on "changing the  demography of the settlements themselves," as one official put  it.    What does that mean? Take Efrat, the PLO official says,  with more than 600 families. The PLO might allow Efrat to  remain, but would take control over all its land and construct  housing for Arabs. Apartments sold or abandoned by Jews would  be filled with Palestinians. The Jews would no longer be a  majority in their own community.    "No matter which way you look at it," the PLO official says,  "we're not going to let them be Israeli citizens in a  Palestinian state."</p>

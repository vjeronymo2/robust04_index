			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to local </F> Croats at Franciscan hospital in Nova Bila, central Bosnia, on  14 June -- recorded]    [Text] On my visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sarajevo and  other places, I could, naturally, not avoid visiting Nova Bila,  that is, I had to visit Nova Bila first. Nova Bila is first  because it has become a symbol of Croatian resistance, of the  Croatian survival, of the determination on the part of the Croat  people of the Lasva valley -- as well as of the whole of the  Croatian homeland, and not only Croats in the homeland, but also  those in the diaspora -- to survive here and everywhere else  where Croats live.    Someone said that this used to be a marginal area. The  entire Croatian nation used to be marginal. At that critical,  historic moment of the disintegration of the Yugoslav dungeon  and the socialist hell, no one wanted an independent, sovereign,  and autonomous Croatian state. Consequently, the Croat identity  in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself was in jeopardy.    Despite this, due to the unity of all Croats, we have  managed  to establish a democratic and sovereign Croatia because the  Croats from Herceg-Bosna, from this Lasva valley, from all over  Bosnia, fought first to establish and defend the Croatian  republic, the Croatian state. This is why later we could offer  assistance to you -- humanitarian and other kinds of assistance  -- and prevent the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina from falling into  the hands of greater Serbia. This is why we supported the  creation of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, so we could take  part, take decisive part in resolving the destiny of the entire  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is why we managed -- to the surprise  and awe of the world -- to defend the Croatian state. There was  even this miracle that took place here in Nova Bila where  doctors, you, defended the Lasva valley from those who wanted to  conquer the Croatian areas.    Consequently, the doctors performed miracles in God's temple  by operating on even the most serious cases. Thanks to such  miracles, relying only on our own strength and on our own  wisdom, the world had to recognize us. Today, not only do we  have an internationally recognized Croatia but we have allies  and friends, too, including the United States, the world's  biggest superpower, and all over the world, all the way up to  China and Europe.    The Washington agreement on the Croat-Muslim federation and  the confederation of this Bosnia-Herzegovina federation with  Croatia has made it possible for you to no longer remain on the  sidelines, so the Croat man here in Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer  has to be oppressed and subjugated. He can be sovereign in this  federation. By relying on Croatia, Bosnia can remain and become  ever more Croatian. [applause]    Rest assured, what we have achieved is in the interest of  all  Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Rest assured, this is in the  interest of the Croatian state which will now survive. We have  not allowed, we will never allow new Bleiburgs to take place  [reference to massacre of Serbs and Croats by Tito's partisans  in 1945]. Croatia is today a recognized country in the world  and has powerful friends and allies. The sole problem rests  with the fact that even here in Bosnia-Herzegovina we should get  used to a situation in which Bosnia-Herzegovina is now a  Croatian country, too, in which the Croatian man is entitled to  sovereignty in it.    Consequently, we have secured the survival of the Croatian  state. We have secured the survival of the Croatian sphere in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the sovereignty of the Croatian sphere in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are going to restore what has been  destroyed. I promise, we are going to build a new modern  hospital in Nova Bila in the interest of the Croat people  because this area deserves it. Likewise, we are going to build  schools and cultural and economic facilities in the interest of  the Croat man. No one is going to chase us away, all the way up  to remote Canada, America and Australia, any longer. We are  everywhere, from the South to the North Pole. We are going to  turn our Croatia into a country to which people will return;  they are already returning.    This has been accomplished by you, by us all. We can be  proud of this miracle performed by the grace of God. Our fate  here in Bosnia-Herzegovina is in our hands. Trust yourselves,  trust the leadership that made this possible. Greetings.</p>

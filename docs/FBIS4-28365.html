			<p>BFN     [Text] "The Subcommittee on Pensions, Medical Care, and  Other Welfare Work" [name as published] (chaired by Minoru  Yanagida) under the ruling coalition's Tax Reform Committee  [name as published] has disclosed the contents of its draft  report on a vision for the social safety net and expenditures  for the social net. The draft report says that under the  current tax system, it is difficult to secure equitably obtained  and stable financial resources for social security, which is  necessary to create a welfare society. It says: "Basically, it  is desirable to establish a fair revenue system through an  increase in the ratio of indirect taxation." The draft report,  however, expresses negative views on the introduction of a  welfare tax.    The subcommittee is entrusting to another committee the  decision concerning by what percentage indirect taxes should be  raised. The other committee will reach a conclusion at a 6 June  meeting and then will submit its decision to the Tax Reform  Committee.    The draft report notes the need for realizing a stable  pension system, streamlining medical care, and promoting  quantitative and qualitative improvements in welfare work such  as nursing for the future social security system. To create an  ideal welfare society for the future, it proposes to promote the  structural reform of a social security system to prepare for the  aging and low-birthrate society. It also proposes that the  "government" and the "private sector" cooperate in realizing a  "high-quality welfare and equal- burden society."    The draft report also stresses the need to urgently review a  "10- year plan for the promotion of health care for the aged  (gold plan)," which is effective from FY 1990 until FY 1999, and  to formulate a comprehensive plan to support child rearing  (angel plan). It then provides specific measures to support  nursing and rearing.    The draft report says it is necessary to flexibly consider  appropriating some of the revenues from an increase in the ratio  of indirect taxation for supporting nursing and child rearing.    As for financial resources for pensions, the report draft  says: "The social insurance system should continue to be  maintained." Touching on a call by the Social Democratic Party  of Japan that the ratio of the national treasury's burden for  basic pensions should be raised (from the current one third) to  one half in the planned tax reform, the draft report says, "This  issue should be discussed separately from a tax reform," and  "This will be studied as a mid- and long-term assignment."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Responsibility May Not Be Shirked"] </F>   [Text] Opposition parties have brought the Parliament to a  stand-still the past few days, agitating for an explanation of  India's stand on the recently concluded GATT negotiations in  Geneva. These were based on the controversial Dunkel proposals,  and the prime minister is being pressed for answers. The BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party], already angered by the jailing of its  leaders, has gotten all the opposition parties together and has  vehemently condemned India's decision to sign it. The consensus  shown by the entire opposition in objecting to India's signing  as a "sell out," is praiseworthy.    However, this realization has come too late to the  opposition  parties. Rao government could not take a definite stand during  the Uruguay Round of talks which were held among specially  formed committees, away from administration's view. The  developing nations had not devised a common approach and any  secondary effort by India would have only met with failure. The  opposition parties that are raising such a hue and cry did not  propose even a single alternative then! Our representatives did  not have any backing to present to Europe and to the U.S.,  possible disadvantages to India in signing the pact. One of the  reasons U.S. dominated the Uruguay Rounds is that there was no  political stability in India. V.P. Singh Government was busy  securing its place and was unable to give GATT issues the  serious attention they deserved. The Chandra Shekhar regime was  interested only in extending its time in power, and our  politicians also had to concentrate their energies on that.    The Rao Government which has already subjugated itself to  directives of major financial institutions in embarking on a  more open trading system, could not address the true interests  of India in Uruguay the way they should have been. Not a single  political party is devoid of the blame of neglecting such  serious issues of grave national consequences as multinational  entry into our trade sector, etc., in preference to other less  important matters. The opposition parties can only pride  themselves for having frustrated the ruling party for  sacrificing the country's sovereignty but no one can shirk the  responsibility for allowing multinational authority over Indian  indigenous agriculture, trade, and commerce.</p>

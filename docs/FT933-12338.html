			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Sharp rise in yen unsettles Nikkei average A SHARP rise in the yen, reports of a spreading bribery scandal, and further uncertainty over the shape of the next government discouraged investors, and the Nikkei average lost 1.9 per cent on arbitrage-linked selling amid low trading volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index fell 381.24 to 19,734.57, a loss on the week of 2.9 per cent. The index opened at 20,049.80, but tumbled below the 20,000 level during the morning session in tandem with the futures market. Arbitrage unwinding depressed the index to a day's low of 19,733.77 just before the close. Volume fell to 200m shares against 236m. Declines overwhelmed advances by 900 to 99, with 141 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 24.96 to 1,609.33 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.24 to 1,224.46. A sharp rise in the yen depressed investors, with the dollar trading below the Y107 level for the first time since July 8, and finally closing at Y106.55, down Y1.73. Reports that a provincial governor was likely to be implicated in the country's bribery scandal involving Hazama, the construction company, also hurt investor sentiment. A move by opposition parties, including the splinter groups from the Liberal Democratic Party, to form a coalition, added to the negative impact on prices. Construction companies were sold on fears of the bribery scandal spreading further to other contractors and local governments. Hazama fell Y10 to Y435 and Obayashi lost Y30 to Y611. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 309.71 to 21,835.55 in volume of 13.8m shares. Roundup PROFIT-TAKING emerged in some of the Pacific Rim markets after their strength in recent days. TAIWAN surged 2.4 per cent in active trade on low short-term interest rates, news that the central bank had agreed to ease curbs on foreign investment and after small deposit rate cuts by local banks. The weighted index opened higher and late buying pushed it up more than 100 points at one stage. It closed 95.43 ahead at 4,027.58, or 2.9 per cent higher on the week, in turnover that rose to TDollars 21.3bn from Thursday's TDollars 12.56bn. All sectors rose but the Taiwan dollar's fall against the US currency caused buying to focus on export-related shares, especially electronics. MANILA set a third consecutive record close although profit-taking began to take a toll after the week's strong rally. The composite index rose 8.83 to 1,715.78, up 6.2 per cent on the week. AUSTRALIA recovered early losses and the All Ordinaries index finished 4.2 higher at 1,806.8, or 0.4 per cent higher on the week. The market found support in strong offshore and local buying and renewed hope of an early interest rate cut. NEW ZEALAND's four-day rally ran out of steam and profits were taken amid concern about the strength of the local currency. The NZSE-40 index closed down 9.27 at 1,720.07. SEOUL ended lower in weak trading, depressed by worsening labour disputes at Hyundai subsidiaries and tight liquidity. The composite index shed 4.75 at 741.81, a 2.4 per cent weekly decline. HONG KONG again saw selling by foreign institutions, worried about the Chinese economy, but the Hang Seng index, which was more than 50 points lower at one stage, recovered much of the loss to finish 9.69 easier at 6,750.33 or 2.5 per cent down on the week. SINGAPORE saw late buying of speculative Malaysian shares and the Straits Times industrial index added 4.67 at 1,823.08 for a 2.6 per cent rise on the week. BOMBAY was officially open, but no deals took place as a result of a brokers' protest against the suspension of 11 Ahmedabad colleagues for not paying registration fees.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MOTHER DIES CHEERING HER SON  </P> <P> A woman died of heart failure after choking on candy while cheering her son  during a high school football game.  </P> <P> Shawn Overocker, a tight end at St. Theresa High School, caught his first pass  of the year during Monday night's junior varsity game against Monticello.  </P> <P> But when Candace Overocker began cheering, she choked on some hard candy, said  William Mundt, Piatt County medical examiner.  </P> <P> "Within two minutes, she was given CPR" by paramedics attending the game, Mundt  said. And crowd members tried the Heimlich maneuver, a squeeze that can  dislodge an object from the throat of a choking victim.  </P> <P> But Mrs. Overocker, 35, of Decatur was pronounced dead at Kirby Hospital in  Monticello.  </P></p>

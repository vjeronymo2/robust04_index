			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: HK issue will mature under Chinese rule HONG Kong's heavily indebted, state-owned Mass Transit Railway yesterday announced the issue of the first international bond from the colony with a maturity stretching beyond 1997 - when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty, writes Our Financial Staff. International bankers' confidence in Hong Kong has been shaken by Peking refusing to back a HKDollars 100bn international airport project. The MTR has built a reputation among international financial institutions as a reliable borrower. It said its HKDollars 280m private placement bond, maturing in 1998, was the first on the international market by a Hong Kong issuer with a post-1997 maturity. Mr Roger Moss, MTR finance director said the issue should not be seen as a measure of confidence in the colony. 'We haven't suggested this deal signals confidence in Hong Kong beyond 1997. There are bigger (political) issues to look at if you want to discuss confidence in Hong Kong. 'This is a signal that a well-known borrower can complete a deal that goes beyond 1997. We've always said that when the time is right, we would go for a deal beyond 1997.' The issue, to be signed in Tokyo on May 22 but already completed with lenders, is arranged by the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and co-arranged by a syndicate of six Japanese banks. 'I'm quite sure this issue will be a success given the quality of the MTR and their relationship with the international market,' a source at a European bank said. However, a source at a Japanese bank which took part in the latest deal said: 'It's interesting, but it's too small to be significant. It's basically a private, targeted deal'. Mr Moss is credited with steering the railway company down an innovative borrowing path through instruments such as Eurocommercial paper with Euroyen options, Canadian dollar Eurobonds and Hong Kong dollar/US dollar dual currency medium-term notes. In 1989, a Euromoney survey published three months after the Tiananmen square massacre, showed that the MTR was considered the world's third most professional borrower after the World Bank and Sweden. At the end of 1990, MTR's total outstanding debt stood at HKDollars 18.49bn against HKDollars 17.39bn in 1989.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Technology: Heat of the moment Ceram Research, a consortium of ceramic manufacturers and electricity supply companies, is testing kiln technology that will provide savings in energy, time and spoilage. In the UK alone the annual energy saving could amount to Pounds 12m, according to Ruth Wroe of EA Technology, the company managing the project. The potential savings in Europe would be about 10 times as much. Microwave-assisted gas firing (MAGF) saves energy because microwaves heat ceramic objects volumetrically (uniformly). Volumetric heating eliminates the temperature stresses that occur as heat is conducted into the object from the surface in a conventional kiln. The absence of heat stress means temperatures can be raised much more rapidly, reducing firing time. Even though microwaves are more expensive, the energy cost (typically 8 per cent of the production cost) can be reduced by up to 40 per cent, according to Wroe. Ceramics do not absorb microwaves at low temperatures, so they cannot be fired efficiently with microwaves alone. MAGF uses conventional gas firing to raise the temperature to the point at which microwaves become effective. It may be possible to add microwave assistance to conventional kilns. The trials for the ceramic manufacturers include the construction of three kilns. The largest will be a 15-metre tunnel kiln for large-scale trial firings of consortium members' products. The first kiln has been commissioned. Consortium members will have the right to a non-exclusive royalty-free licence to the MAGF technology. Non members will be able to license MAGF later for a price at least three times that of consortium membership. The list of consortium members is confidential, but Wroe says it includes about half the leading UK ceramics companies.</p>

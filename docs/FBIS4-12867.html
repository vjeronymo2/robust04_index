			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, the president of  the Republic, has stressed that rebel John Garang's recent visit  to Israel was made after the failure of the self-determination  proposal put forward by the rebel movement and its failure to  internationalize the problem of the south. This was also  accompanied by the routing of its forces.    Speaking today during his meeting with media leaders at the  secretariat general of the Council of Ministers building, Lt.  Gen. al-Bashir said it had been confirmed that Israel and the  Zionist lobby were promoting an anti-Sudan media campaign in the  West and that Israel was using Garang as one of its tools with  which to fight the Sudanese Government. The president of the  Republic referred to the symposium organized by a number of  well-known leftist movements in Cairo to be held on 14 May which  is just two days before the resumption of negotiations between  the Sudanese Government and the rebel movement in Nairobi. He  said the organizers of this symposium had invited John Garang  and Riak Machar to attend.    During his meeting, Lt. Gen. al-Bashir stressed that the  Western world was trying to stir up discord in Africa, referring  in this context to the Israeli enemy's aim to gain control of  the sources of the Nile in the African continent with their  water resources, in order to put pressure on the main forces in  the region. The president of the Republic stressed the need for  the Africans to take the initiative to solve disputes within the  continent so as to preserve its security and stability.    Lt. Gen. al-Bashir declared that the rebel movement's  refusal  to sign the relief agreement with the government revealed that  the movement secretly intended to obstruct relief efforts in  order to prepare the way for foreign intervention in Sudan. His  excellency reiterated the Sudanese Government's determination to  ensure that relief operations were successful.</p>

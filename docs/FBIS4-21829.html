			<p>BFN     [Text] Mersin, Mar 26 (AA) -- A gunman was killed and a  policeman was wounded in an overnight election-related clash in  this southern city, police said on Saturday.    The clash started when gunmen, fleeing after throwing a bomb  at the election office of the pro-Islamic Welfare [Prosperity]  Party, fired on police, who urged them to surrender. One of the  gunmen was killed, the others fled.    Five other people, including a 12-year-old boy, were killed  and 26 were wounded in the last couple of days in several  assaults on party offices and candidates in the run-up to  Sunday's nationwide municipal elections.</p>

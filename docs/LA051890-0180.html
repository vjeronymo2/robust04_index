			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCHOOL BUS DRIVER PLEADS NO CONTEST TO SEX CHARGE  </P> <P> A Laidlaw Transit school bus driver pleaded no contest to a charge he had sex  with a minor, a 15-year-old hearing-impaired Burbank girl he drove to junior  high school, authorities said today.  </P> <P> Manny G. Acosta, 33, of North Hollywood entered the plea Thursday in Burbank  Municipal Court in exchange for a promise from the Los Angeles County district  attorney's office not to seek a sentence of more than 16 months in prison.  </P> <P> The plea was entered in a closed hearing after Municipal Judge Marion Gubler  granted a defense request to exclude the public and the media from the  courtroom. Deputy Dist. Atty. David Disco, who heads the Pasadena office, said  his office objected to the closed hearing in a previous meeting in the judge's  chambers.  </P> <P> Acosta, who Laidlaw officials said will be fired after the company is  officially notified of his plea, is scheduled to be sentenced June 8. He has no  prior criminal record, authorities said.  </P> <P> "Based on the facts of this case it was our view that the 16-month maximum  sentence was appropriate," Disco said.  </P> <P> The bus driver was arrested May 2 after a two-day investigation which began  after one of the 15-year-old girl's friends told a school counselor of her  involvement with Acosta.  </P> <P> Burbank police said Acosta drove a bus route which took the girl from Burbank  to Toll Junior High School in Glendale, where she attended special classes for  the hearing-impaired. Detectives said the girl fell in love with Acosta and the  two began a relationship. Police said Acosta and the girl engaged in consensual  sex in his van, not in the bus or on school property.  </P> <P> After the arrest, Burbank Unified School District officials said they would  consider discontinuing use of the bus company. Acosta's arrest was the fourth  time this year Laidlaw drivers were arrested in Southern California.  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (5): Vote deadline is November 17 - Nancy Dunne explains the US procedures for approving Nafta THE North American Free Trade Agreement, the most controversial US trade agreement since the second world war, has now entered the shadowy world of the Congressional fast track where legislative procedures are turned on their heads, a bill is not a bill, a conference not a conference, and legislation to implement trade agreements is born. The fast-track procedure mandates an up or down vote on the 'implementing legislation', thus evading deal-killing amendments designed to benefit special interests. Unlike a treaty, which requires a two-thirds senate vote for passage, fast track gives the responsibility of approval to a majority in both houses. The only hope for getting a trade pact through Congress without amendments is to ensure a majority vote in advance. This is achieved through a pre-approval negotiating process between the administration and the Congress. Representatives of both essentially write the implementing legislation together. Work on the 'non-bill' that will become the implementing legislation begins first in committees - the House Ways and Means Committees and the Senate Finance - which have primary jurisdiction over trade. Other committees with jurisdiction - like banking and agriculture - will also hold hearings. After holding hearings, Ways and Means and Finance each write a 'non-bill', in consultation with the administration and other committees. This process, ordinarily called a 'markup', to produce bills, is called a 'mock up'. The 'non-bill' makes changes in current law necessary for the implementation of trade agreements, provides for financing mechanisms and changes tariffs. It could also include the administration's interpretation of unclear portions of the trade pact. Other trade legislation can be attached. There is talk about adding a 'Super 301' provision to the Nafta in order to attract wavering Democrats. Super 301 requires the administration to negotiate away foreign trade barriers (or use sanctions if the trading partners baulk). The committees take their non-bills to a House-Senate 'mock conference' where they iron out their differences and most of the changes are made. Mr Richard Daley, the administration's 'Nafta czar', will be hard at work, making backroom deals in exchange for member votes. The result then goes to the president, who has a free hand with the 'non-bill'. He can tear it up, alter it, or submit it to Congress for fast-track action, at which point it becomes a bill. The bill can no longer be changed. It must be voted on in no fewer than 90 legislative days (days in session). The House committees have 45 days to debate its merits before it moves on to full House debate for 15 days. If it loses here - which may well happen - that is the end of the process. If it passes, it goes on to the Senate, where the committees have 15 days to debate and vote and the full Senate has 15 days. Both houses must schedule 20 hours of floor debate. The president has asked Congressional leaders to accelerate the process in order to get a Nafta into effect on January 1, as scheduled. Mr Tom Foley, the House speaker and Nafta supporter, has scheduled a floor vote for November 17. There is considerable speculation about whether or not the vote will go forward on schedule. The White House and Congressional leadership have vowed that it will. A senior Senate aide said that the administration wants to get the issue 'over and done with' to make way for more popular issues such as health care and crime legislation. 'Members don't want to go home and talk about it any more,' he said. 'The administration won't pick up votes by waiting.' Others say the administration has been forced to take a tough line on the Nafta schedule to stem the flow of defecting Republicans and Democrats, who are afraid a pro-Nafta vote will hurt them in their districts. They will not want to support the bill if they think the president might delay it or pull it for re-negotiation. But will the leadership act if a Nafta loss seems probable? November 17 is less than a month before the December 15 deadline for the Uruguay Round. There is concern that a failure of Nafta in US Congress would discourage politically-risky concessions in the Gatt talks, particularly if as expected, Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, comes out in opposition to the Gatt and promises to fund a fight against its passage.</p>

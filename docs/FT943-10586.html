			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Ashdown aloof on 'new-look' Labour Mr Paddy Ashdown is resisting attempts to change the political stance of the Liberal Democrats so the party becomes more clearly identified with Mr Tony Blair's 'new-look' Labour party. The Liberal Democrat leader made clear yesterday that he was unmoved by criticism that he should establish his party's preference for a government led by Mr Blair as opposed to further Conservative rule. Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank - one of the 'Gang of Four' who quit Labour to establish the Social Democratic party - yesterday underlined the difficulties facing Mr Ashdown by saying that Mr Blair could be 'a good prime minister'. Speaking on BBC Radio, Lord Rodgers called for a clear indication that the Liberal Democrats recognised that, with the emergence of Mr Blair, Labour had become electable again. Another two of the Gang of Four have spoken on the same issue. Lord Jenkins of Hillhead has described Mr Blair as the 'most exciting' Labour leader since Mr Hugh Gaitskell. While he has urged 'friendly relations' with Labour, Baroness Williams has gone further by suggesting that the Liberal Democrats should work with Labour towards a 'common programme'. Lord Rodgers forecast that as prime minister Mr Blair would be able to give the country the leadership it needed. He would have the authority which 'John Major desperately lacks'. Mr Ashdown is seeking to retain a middle-of-the-road position, claiming that the Liberal Democrats would be able to work with either Mr Major or Mr Blair. Mr Ashdown hopes that by keeping his party aloof it will retain its appeal to dissidents in both the main parties.</p>

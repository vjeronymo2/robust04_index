			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Fair Trade Commission [FTC] on 22 December  compiled the results of its survey on business practices by the  plate glass, auto, auto parts, and paper industries. The United  States is claiming that these four Japanese industries are  closed to foreign competition. The survey showed that "they  have been improving their business practices as can be seen in  one case in which a company has stopped giving rebates to its  agent, a practice which can prevent other companies from  entering the market."    The FTC had earlier conducted a similar survey based on an  agreement reached between Japan and the United States at a  follow-up meeting held in July, 1992 for the Japanese-U.S.  Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks. The results  showed that special agents dealt only with commodities from  certain makers and they were receiving progressive rebates from  the makers in return for their agreement to set targets for  business transactions between them.    In June 1993, the FTC notified the four previously-mentioned  industries of problems in their business practices. The recent  survey was conducted in November and December to see how the  industries had improved business practices following the warning.    The results of the survey apparently show that "each  industry  is making sincere efforts to improve its business practices."    According to the survey, companies in these four industries  have taken such measures as abolishing rebates and sending  messages to agents saying "we do not restrict your freedom to  deal in the products of rival companies."    The FTC plans to "keep watching to see if the industries  maintain their improvement in business practice."</p>

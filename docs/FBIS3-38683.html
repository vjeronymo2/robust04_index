Will the  massacre, the climax of the horror so far, change the world and  its policy? It is by no means certain, because baseness has  again and again been weighed in the balance and found to be not  enough to make the West intervene militarily.    At the 31st Security Conference in Munich, the traditional  semiofficial meeting of NATO strategists, U.S. Secretary of  Defense Perry expressed "horror and outrage," but then the new  Pentagon chief reverted to the old kind of language. A  "solution by negotiations" is more urgent than ever and,  therefore, the international community must exert "maximum  pressure" on all parties. On whom and how -- he left that open.  None of the foreign and defense ministers, senators, and  parliamentarians had a better answer.    The answer has not become easier after the debacle in  Somalia. Whoever wants to intervene in this war of everybody  against everybody else, must know from the beginning: Against  whom? Then: What is the goal? Just balancing powers --or  enforcing a political order, which can never satisfy everyone?  Finally: Democracies are not reliable providers of order.  Somalia has shown what democracies can do -- and where they  fail.    As long as the objective was just to feed the hungry, the  international community did wonderful things. But when it  prescribed a more ambitions vision for itself -- to disarm and  punish the fighters -- the debacle took its course. The  enormous moral stimulus waned, when suddenly the price had to be  paid in the coin of one's own casualties. And thus, the  Americans and the Germans will once again look one when the  Somalis again make "order" in their own way as of April.    Of course, it would not be difficult for the highly  developed  air forces of the West at least to loosen the grip of the siege  around Sarajevo and, in addition, change the Serbs' calculation  of risks. Over 22 months the Serbs have learned that the West  inflates itself every time, but then collapses like a balloon  with a hole. Surgical air strikes on vulnerable Serbian  positions and lines would not make peace, but they would restore  the credibility that any kind of diplomacy needs as urgently as  a lever needs power.    However, it hardly looks as if the massacre in the  marketplace will provide the will to use the power. The United  States hesitates as long as its partners hesitate. Belgium is  calling for air strikes, but London first wants to find out what  its blue helmets on site say. In Paris, they sometimes want to  attack the Serbs and sometimes the Muslims. And the German  foreign minister passionately calls for what is obvious: "With  the United States, we must find a way to end the war."    It is equally obvious that the Germans can exert pressure  only very cautiously. At the Munich conference, both Chancellor  Kohl and his rival Scharping once again presented the all-party  consensus that the Bundeswehr has no business in the Balkans.  Even though, in contrast to his position at the 30th  conference, Kohl does not want to stick categorically to the  principle that the troops of democratic Germany must never again  operate in those places where the Wehrmacht once marched in.  "Historical sensitivities," however, must be respected.    Whoever remembers past "military defense" meetings will,  while still hearing the echo of the mortar grenades, note with  pleasure that at least two other internal wars have been  canceled. Germans and Americans demonstrated complete agreement  on all other issues of "big policy" -- be it Russia, Eastern  Europe, or the future of NATO. Even more dramatic was the change  in the course of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] in the  election year of 1994, which Scharping outlined and which  reminds one of the change in direction (yes to a link with the  West) of the early 1960's. "Embrace" was the slogan and  Scharping's not so secret signal was: "We are amenable to any  kind of coalition."    The SPD chairman only avoided the key question about combat  operations by the Bundeswehr. However, the Constitutional Court  will probably give the answer for him in spring. Reportedly,  Karlsruhe has indicated to Scharping (at least that is what his  party colleagues are putting about) that the supreme court will  announce an extremely generous interpretation of those Basic Law  articles that have been interpreted -- also by the Union in the  past -- as a ban on out-of-area operations. This would be the  most practical of all solutions for Scharping, since he could  then keep the party's leftists quiet by paraphrasing an old  proverb: Karlsruhe locuta, causa finita -- the court has spoken,  the matter is closed.    The matter of the war in Bosnia will not have been closed by  then, however. But what will the Germans do when the judges  have freed them from their self-inflicted ties? Perhaps they  will look back wistfully to the time when they were still able  to sit in a quiet corner and leave the decision "to intervene or  not to intervene" to the others.</p>

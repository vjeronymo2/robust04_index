			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Circulation of The European rises to 200,000 THE EUROPEAN newspaper is about to enter its second year of non-Maxwell ownership with sales of about 200,000. The international newspaper, which many expected would not long survive the death of its founder and patron Robert Maxwell, was relaunched under the ownership of the Barclay brothers on January 6 last year. 'We have increased sales week after week since,' said Mr Charles Garside, editor of the weekly, which was losing about Pounds 1m a month under Maxwell. The newspaper's period of crisis after Maxwell's death severely affected its complex distribution system, and Mr Garside believes the paper has come from 80,000 to about 200,000 in the year, although official sales figures are not available. In May the paper was able to bring back its suspended third section Elan and resume promotion. Mr Garside said that the owners, Mr David and Mr Frederick Barclay, who live in Monte Carlo and own hotels and shipping lines, are pleased with the progress of their first newspaper. The main growth in sales has come from France, Germany and Spain. Sales in the UK account for about a third of the total, although that proportion is declining. Mr Garside would not disclose details of the newspaper's financial performance but said that all newspapers take about four years to break into profit. The European is now 2 1/2 years old. 'We have a more than a good chance of making it work in the not-too-distant future,' Mr Garside said. He is also encouraged by the number of his newspaper's reports that are being followed up each week by other newspapers.</p>

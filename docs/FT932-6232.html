			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Hopes for Gonzalez ride on last television debate THE LAST week of the closest Spanish election campaign in living memory will start on Monday with the conservative opposition ahead in opinion polls and government hopes resting on the final television debate between Mr Felipe Gonzalez, socialist prime minister, and Mr Jose Mara Aznar, leader of the conservative People's Party. Unless the former can reverse his public defeat at the hands of Mr Aznar in the first TV debate last Monday, he is given little chance of being able to form a government after the election on June 6. As Mr Gonzalez faces up to what will be his most anxious week in politics, he was at least freed yesterday of having to worry about a further serious attack on the peseta. After sharp falls on Wednesday and Thursday, the currency began trading yesterday at about Pta70.4 to the D-mark, just below its new parity of Pta79.11, before the Bank of Spain nudged interbank rates up slightly and brought speculation to a halt at Pta79.27 to DM1. Many analysts believe the first debate has already sunk Mr Gonzalez and his socialist party. He was badly prepared and had underestimated his opponent. The prime minister's fortunes are likely to depend on his personal performance, not on Mr Aznar's weaknesses. Even so, polls still put the socialists and the PP close to each other, despite the peseta devaluation two weeks ago and the first TV debate. A poll to be published on Sunday in the newspaper El Mundo is understood to show the PP leading by about 1.5 points, unchanged from 10 days ago. As a series of small bombs set by the extreme-left terrorist group Grapo hit targets in Madrid yesterday, the socialist party continued to insist it can, in one last week of aggressive campaigning, hold the PP to a draw at least. Parliament is to meet for the first time after the election on June 29 and, if the result has been close, the socialists and the PP will have spent the intervening period lobbying regional parties for support in forming a government. The communist-led United Left (IU) may yet be important in this. Polls give it more than 11 per cent of the vote, which could hand the IU some 25 seats and make it the third largest party in parliament. Last night, Mr Julio Anguita, IU leader and secretary-general of the communist party, was admitted to hospital in Barcelona with an angina attack. An IU official said Mr Anguita, aged 50, would take no further part in the election campaign and rest in hospital for a week.</p>

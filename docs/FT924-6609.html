			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ICI may be forced to postpone Zeneca move IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturing company, may be forced to postpone the demerger of Zeneca, its bioscience business, broker Smith New Court said yesterday. It also warned that ICI might need to reappraise its dividend policy because of poor trading conditions. In the first detailed analysis of the proposed demerger of ICI's pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialities businesses, Mr Charles Lambert, chemicals analyst, valued the separate businesses at 950p per share. On current conditions ICI was worth 350p and Zeneca 600p. The group would have to put most of its debt into Zeneca so the new ICI could generate sufficient cash flow to ensure its dividend. A share issue by Zeneca to clear the debt was a pre-requisite for the separation, Mr Lambert said. He thought this was most likely to be on a 1-for-4 basis, raising Pounds 1bn. A demerged ICI had massive scope for recovery, said Mr Lambert. He reckoned that the group would generate pre-tax profits of Pounds 643m in 1995, against an estimated Pounds 147m this year. However, he warned that market conditions suggested the new ICI's dividend would be uncovered in 1993, posing a real problem for the demerger's timing. The report predicts that Zeneca's pre-tax profits would increase from Pounds 428m this year to Pounds 712m in 1995. However, Zeneca's pharmaceuticals business, which generates 75 per cent of its turnover, has a mature product portfolio. Its pipeline of new products was described as 'somewhat lacklustre' and weighted towards the second half of the decade. The pharmaceuticals division's turnover could increase from Pounds 1.59bn last year to Pounds 2.24bn by 1995 and trading profits from Pounds 538m to Pounds 648m. Sales of Tenormin, Zeneca's best-selling heart drug, are forecast to fall from Pounds 652m last year to Pounds 411 by 1995. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, yesterday acquired ICI's world-wide Corsodyl business for an undisclosed sum.</p>

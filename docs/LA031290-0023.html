			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON COLLABORATORS  </P> <P> So Buchanan is calling the collaborators to account? It seems to me that a  world struggling to free itself from opportunistic and uncaring overlords is  bound to spawn leaders like Lenin, Mao, Castro, Ho and Ortega, standard-bearers  dreaming of national self-determination, affordable education and health care  and guaranteed employment. It's ironic that when the political offspring of  such revolutionaries begin to live like fat-cat Republicans, forcing the people  to throw them out, Buchanan should be the one sounding the call for a domestic  blood bath.  </P> <P> I ask him to look at how two terms of Reagan Administration mismanagement have  devastated our nation's economic, educational and health-care systems. We'll be  decades putting this country back together, spending billions to bailout banks,  savings and loans, pension funds and insurance companies. The United States may  never again be a world leader in public education and health care. We've been  raped by petty opportunists and uncaring ideologues, and indeed the time has  come to call the collaborators to account. Step forward please, Mr. Buchanan.  </P> <P> JON WILLIAMS  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

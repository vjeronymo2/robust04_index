			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- U.S. Trade representative  Mickey Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday [1 February] in a bid  to break the deadlock in bilateral trade talks prior to the  February 11 Washington summit between Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. Kantor, traveling with W.  Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic  policy, is scheduled to meet with Hosokawa, Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata and other key cabinet ministers on Wednesday and  Thursday.    Bilateral negotiations on automobile trade, government  procurement and other issues have been deadlocked over U.S.  demands for rules to measure progress in foreign access to  Japan's markets. The two countries are scheduled to hold  subcabinet-level negotiations on key pending issues in Tokyo on  Friday and Saturday.    U.S. officials have said Washington hopes that a  breakthrough  in the framework trade talks will lead to increased U.S. exports  to Japan and a significant reduction in Japan's vast trade  surplus, which last year topped 120 billion dollars worldwide.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> STEVE REICH, MUSICIANS AT WADSWORTH THEATRE  </P> <P> There were no premieres this time for minimalist master Steve Reich and  Musicians, who visited Wadsworth Theatre Saturday evening. But the familiar  program -- three recent works prefaced by an excerpt from the 1971 "Drumming"  -- generated its own excitement and proved once again the wide expressive range  of a style often regarded as purely mechanical.  </P> <P> The easy standout on this occasion was "Electric Counterpoint," a rare and  joyful exercise in almost lyric whimsy. Guitarist David Tanenbaum played with  eager, caressive elan and pinpoint accuracy, imposing a surprising feeling of  spontaneity on the prerecorded accompaniment.  </P> <P> The Sextet, for four percussionists and two keyboard players, had a curiously  stiff beginning. It settled into a rapt, limber flow, however, as the clearly  well-practiced ensemble let the interlocking patterns develop their own set of  musical checks and balances.  </P> <P> After intermission came "Different Trains," Reich's fusion of autobiography,  Holocaust remembrance and blatant musical pictorialism. This melodrama of taped  voices, imitated by a string quartet amid much motoric chugging and wailing  whistles, is not subtle stuff. But it has the courage of its convictions, both  musical and psycho-social, and the ad hoc touring quartet brought it off with  visceral urgency.  </P> <P> Reich took a hand himself in Part I of "Drumming," a declamatory statement of  rhythmic purpose. He and three other drummers ministered to a row of small  tuned toms, beating out all the motivic permutations with an almost casual  concentration. J. H.  </P></p>

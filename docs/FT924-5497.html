			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ML passes interim dividend as losses rise ML HOLDINGS, the defence and aerospace group, passed its interim dividend after reporting a Pounds 1.48m pre-tax loss for the six months to September 30, against a Pounds 1.31m deficit last time. Before interest and exceptional items, trading profits amounted to Pounds 988,000 (Pounds 2.04m). An exceptional provision of Pounds 1.06m related to the settlement of a long running legal action connected with a hovercraft supply contract. Losses per share worked through at 3p (2.6p). An interim dividend of 0.85p was paid in 1991. Sales totalled Pounds 40.2m, a marginal gain on the previous Pounds 40.1m, after adjusting for disposals and inflation. The company said it had continued to suffer from three fundamental and related problems: the impact of recession on margins, inadequate contract management and control leading to losses and claims, and a high level of borrowings. Although the effect of recession on the group's defence and aerospace businesses had been anticipated, it acknowledged that a cost reduction programme had not been implemented early enough nor with sufficient vigour. To resolve this situation, the company said improved financial controls had been imposed on all subsidiaries. The company also confirmed it was refocusing around its core defence and aerospace businesses. It planned to shed non-core assets when it could obtain realistic prices for these operations. The group recently won a contract to supply the US Air Force with up to 113 of its Slingsby Firefly trainer aircraft worth about Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m).</p>

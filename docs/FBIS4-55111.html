			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- One million plus votes  cast for the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) prove the party  has a stable voter base, and that Hungarian politics is  three-cornered now: The right is split but still led by the  Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the left is the Socialists,  leaving the Free Democrats in the middle, Gabor Kuncze, SZDSZ  prime minister candidate, told reporters today. What will be at  stake in the second round will be the Socialists' ability to win  an absolute majority in Parliament, something which the Free  Democrats see as undesirable, Kuncze said. He was happy to see  extremists squeezed out of Parliament.    SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto said that an agreement between the  four liberal parties (SZDSZ, Federation of Young Democrats,  Entrepreneurs' Party, Agrarian Association) means candidates  will withdraw from the second round in one another's favour in  13 constituencies. In reply to a question, Peto ruled out talks  on mutual withdrawals with the MDF.</p>

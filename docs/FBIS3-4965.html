This interview was the first exclusive  interview with a foreign news media after he took up the post of  vice premier.    During the interview, Zhu expressed great expectations for  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China scheduled for  19 March. He cited concrete figures when discussing the focal  issues of anti-inflation measures, future problems in the  Chinese economy, and relations with Japan, giving an in-depth  account of PRC's policy thinking as the highest responsible  official for China's economic reform.  <H5>  Impression of His Visit to Japan </H5>   [Zhu] "I feel that friendship and cooperation between China  and Japan and between the Chinese and Japanese people have  struck roots in the hearts of people here and have become a  trend sweeping across Japan. I feel that this kind of thinking  will not change, no matter how the Japanese political situation  develops and what happens in the rest of the world."  <H5>  Prime Minister Hosokawa's Visit to China </H5>   [Zhu] "We and Prime Minister Hosokawa have decided through  discussion that the prime minister will visit China in mid- and  late March. We have long since made active preparations to  welcome Prime Minister Hosokawa. President Jiang Zemin and  Premier Li Peng are looking forward to holding fruitful talks  with him in Beijing."    [Announcer] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also a member of  the Standing Committee of the CPC Political Bureau, was promoted  from his position as mayor of Shanghai three years ago for his  outstanding economic abilities. He has since been in charge of  the economic reforms advocated by Deng Xiaoping.    Discussing the problems and prospects of economic reforms,  for which he is the key leader, Zhu said, the Chinese economy  will be able to continue its rapid growth. He expressed  confidence in dealing with the crucial anti-inflation measures.  He said:    [Zhu] "Inflation was caused by excessive increase in  investment, which was not healthy, and by reform of our price  structure. The latter was an extremely important factor. Last  year, we lifted control of the prices of grain and most of the  capital goods. This could not but cause price increases.  However, this kind of reform is essential to instituting a  market economy. With the adoption of price-stabilizing measures,  I believe this year's inflation rate can be kept below 10  percent. Asia, and China in particular, is witnessing the  fastest economic growth in the world today. I believe that  strengthening economic cooperation with China and with other  parts of Asia will not only contribute to economic prosperity in  the region, but will also help Japan in its economic  readjustment and accelerate its economic revitalization. I feel  this is something worth considering."    [Announcer] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who has been in Japan  since 23 February, extended his stay by one day, and is  scheduled to return home the day after tomorrow [4 March].</p>

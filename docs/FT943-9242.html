			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Management: New light on the Grail of corporate renewal Like a politician's perennial promise of light at the end of the tunnel, top managers are forever telling their long-suffering staffs that successful corporate renewal is just around the corner. More often than not, their declarations are as empty as the politician's. The corners prove as unending, and the light illusory. Westinghouse, the troubled conglomerate which was once the worthy arch-rival of US General Electric and a host of European companies, has declared victory in its battle for strategic and organisational renewal on at least three occasions during the past decade. Each has proved a false dawn: the company has declined further and had to begin the process again. Westinghouse is far from alone. In the US, Eastman Kodak and IBM have made successive attempts to revitalise themselves, with little success until now. In Europe, most British clearing banks, like several continental electronics manufacturers, have encountered similar barriers with successive 'change' programmes. In Japan, Mazda, Yamaha and Matsushita have made highly publicised but hitherto ineffective efforts at renewal. The roots of this corporate sclerosis are intricate and intertwined, but two causes are particularly troublesome. Both are self-inflicted. First, many top managers fail to recognise how complex their organisations are. Far from being machines which can be changed by the hasty pulling of a few levers, they are complex, organic systems in which - if the desired transformation is to take place - a protracted series of linked actions has to be carried out. The second reason companies fail to transform themselves, despite any amount of new visions, 're-engineering', and other changes, is because they fail to establish an entirely new internal climate. The 'smell of the place', manifest in small details of how the organisation feels and functions, is unaltered. Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher Bartlett, business school professors from Insead and Harvard respectively, call this climate the 'behavioural context' of an organisation. They say that Westinghouse is trapped in an authoritarian climate where roles and relationships are characterised by four self-reinforcing 'Cs': compliance, contract, control and constraint. By contrast, US General Electric, ABB, Canon and other companies have broken out of this straitjacket and converted to a much more healthy quartet of characteristics: discipline, trust, support and stretch. These have been practised for years by consistently innovative companies such as Andersen Consulting, Intel, Ikea, Kao of Japan, and 3M. In an article about to be published in the US-based Strategic Management Journal*, Ghoshal and Bartlett explain the practical workings of a 'quality of management' model which they, with several of Ghoshal's colleagues at Insead, have developed around the four characteristics. Individually, the four facets of the model will be familiar to readers of literature about the management of change. Like most models, it is also a very simplified representation of reality. But it has two considerable virtues. First, Ghoshal and Bartlett do not have a behavioural science background - both have worked mainly in strategy, organisation and general management - so their discussion of the differences between the four facets, and the interaction between them, is low on jargon. For instance, they show clearly how discipline and stretch are each ineffective without the other. Second, they explain how each characteristic can be reinforced by several very practical actions. Discipline. Unlike compliance, this does not rely primarily on authority relationships or management policies. In organisations such as Intel and Andersen, self-discipline is encouraged through the careful socialisation of employees and becomes second nature to them. That is a fine distinction, but a vital one. Discipline is fostered by the provision of clear standards to which employees feel committed, plus open and rapid feedback. Support. Traditionally, delegation from boss to subordinate is policed by top-down control. By contrast, the academics say that even at disciplined and performance-orientated companies such as Intel and Anderson, managerial relationships are unusually supportive. This atmosphere - usually called 'coaching' - also fosters collaboration between colleagues. Trust. Instead of increasingly impersonal and distant (or 'contractual') relationships, most companies that have been able to renew themselves permanently have built trust and openness into their behavioural climate. To achieve this, fairness, involvement and levels of competence have all been increased. Stretch. In most companies, people's horizons and creativity are constrained by the organisation's relatively low and short-term ambitions. In self-renewing organisations, the internal climate encourages - even induces  -employees to strive for far-reaching objectives. As practising managers will recognise, the model is more challenging than it looks. The creation of an environment which is disciplined and stretching, yet supportive and trusting, is far from simple - especially for people used to taking decisions, rather than helping others make them. Whatever some top managers may think or pretend, corporate renewal is a long, treacherous and winding road. Above all, it requires their own roles to change. A bunch of relentlessly hands-on drivers must become navigators-cum-social engineers. *Linking context and action: toward a theory of quality of management. SMJ Summer 1994 special issue (15).

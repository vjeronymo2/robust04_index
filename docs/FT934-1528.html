			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Dublin aims at speeding Sinn Fein dialogue The Irish government's proposal to establish a 'peace forum' - referred to in this week's joint UK-Irish declaration - is aimed at bringing Sinn Fein rapidly into a formal negotiating process after the IRA has announced the ending of violence. Senior Irish cabinet ministers say Sinn Fein could be brought into the forum 'very quickly' after an announcement. This would be before the exploratory talks the British government has offered the party, which would start after a three-month 'quarantine'. The ministers also echoed the British government's view that surrender of IRA weapons would not be a precondition to Sinn Fein's involvement in talks. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, told the Dail yesterday: 'The joint declaration was the first stage in the peace process. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation could be absolutely vital to reaching a second stage, and to achieving a permanent cessation of violence. 'If we want to be realistic, we have to guarantee that there will be a political process, once violence is permanently ended. The forum could provide a useful input to wider negotiations.' The creation of such a forum was one of the main sticking points in the drafting of the joint declaration. Irish government officials say it was therefore decided to make it an Irish initiative, rather than a joint initiative with Britain. Mr Reynolds said the forum would be open 'to democratically mandated parties to provide a means to debate and devise appropriate alternative political strategies to violence'. Apparently acknowledging that unionists will not initially wish to be involved, he said the debate would take place 'among all strands of nationalism and hopefully a wider range of opinion, (and) in the aftermath of a permanent cessation of violence, could be a very healthy exercise'. Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, was cautious. 'A forum that does not contain representatives of both traditions cannot achieve the stated objective in the joint declaration to promote reconciliation.' The Irish parliament later backed the joint declaration without a vote at the end of a day-long debate in the Dail.</p>

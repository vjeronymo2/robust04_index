			<p>BFN     [Text] Igor Akhba, envoy of the so-called Abkhazia to the  Russian Federation, has declared that it is all the same for  Abkhazia who plays the role of peacekeeping forces -- UN forces  or CIS special units. According to Akhba, the key issue is the  deployment of forces solely in the buffer zone.    The clause in the agreement on the deployment of troops in  the conflict zone, unexpectedly for the Georgian side, was  presented by representatives of Russia, the UN, and the European  Union.    In the opinion of Georgian delegation members, the Abkhaz  version of the settlement of the conflict suits the UN, the  European Union, and Russia, because should CIS troops rather  than UN forces enter the conflict zone, the issue of financing  the troops will automatically be resolved as the CIS states and  Georgia will have to undertake this task.    According to some analysts, Georgia's signing of this  document could exacerbate the domestic political situation in  Georgia.    Talks are continuing in Moscow.</p>

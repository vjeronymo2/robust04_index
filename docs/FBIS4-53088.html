			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japan needs to upgrade its  social, economic and other infrastructures in order to enhance  its appeal as a major destination for investment by foreign  companies, an annual government report on international trade  said Tuesday [17 May].    Such efforts would eventually contribute not only to  expanding direct foreign investment in this country but also to  raising the overall living standards of the Japanese people,  according to the fiscal 1994 white paper released by the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    The paper said an overhaul of institutional systems that  hamper smooth industrial activity in Japan would facilitate an  inflow of reasonably priced high-grade foreign products into the  country and help reduce production costs and living expenses.    The amount of foreign direct investment in Japan has been  lower than that of foreign investment in any other major  industrial country, the paper said.    Rules and regulations serving as barriers to the creation of  new businesses need to be eased, corporate research and  development activities should be reinforced and capital market  regulations should be relaxed for more international financial  transactions between Japan and abroad, it said.    These measures would smooth the way for industrial  restructuring in Japan, helping it attain the chief goals of  narrowing a price gap between home and abroad, and curtailing  its huge global current account surplus.    The global trade structure has been changing rapidly  following activation of capital and technology transfers beyond  national boundaries which has been traced to the recent surge in  international investment, the report said.    Growth of services trade, for example, has gathered momentum  on commodities trade, with services trade accounting for 30  percent of overall global trade, it said.    The white paper described investment as "the fountainhead"  of  global economic growth.    There is a clear correlation between investment and economic  growth, it said, noting countries with an average annual  investment of over 30 percent as a percentage against their  gross domestic product (GDP) scored significantly high economic  growth during 1989- 1991.    The white paper said investment is also effective in  creating  employment on a long-term basis, noting east Asian countries  other than Japan, which recorded an increase in investment of  around 10 percent during the 1980s, saw employment grow 2 to 3  percent while Japan and European countries with lower investment  growth scored a gain of only around 1 percent in their jobs  markets.    The paper also noted South Korea, Taiwan and other newly  industrializing economies (NIEs) in Asia achieved remarkably  high economic growth after turning net investors in the early  1990s, while industrialization in countries of the Association  of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) quickened after their active  acceptance of foreign investment.    The paper said foreign investment in China, especially on  its  coastal areas, has been rising sharply, a factor pushing up the  country's vibrant economic growth.    Vietnam has been emerging as a major destination of  investment, reflecting the resumption of Japan's low-interest  yen loans in 1992 and the lifting of U.S. trade sanctions  against the country earlier this year, the white paper said.    It said Japan's mammoth current account surplus has been  attributed to a chronic excess of its savings over investment.    In 1992, for example, Japan's savings came to 160 trillion  yen and its investment 145 trillion yen, leaving a balance of 15  trillion yen which was equal to the current account surplus for  the year, the paper said.    In the United States, the current account balance has been  in  the red for years, due to massive net investment in the public  sector stemming from the large budget deficit, the paper said.    The white paper forecast Japan's savings ratio will fall in  the future in line with the rapid aging of the society, a factor  expected to push down the black ink in the current account  balance.    In order for Japan to play a key role in encouraging world  investment activity, Japanese companies should conduct their  business operations in a manner that would bring about the best  interests for global systems of production, distribution and  parts procurement, the white paper said.    Specifically, the paper said Japanese firms should stop  taking advantage of east Asian countries simply as areas to  secure a cheap labor force.    Japan also should take the initiative in promoting free  trade  in line with the spirit of the recently concluded Uruguay Round  of multilateral trade negotiations, the paper said.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / NatWest to charge daily for overdrawn accounts NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to impose a charge of Pounds 3.50 a day on current account holders who overdraw substantially without authority. The bank's new charging structure will penalise up to 1m customers who overdraw regularly. The bank, which has 6.5m personal customers, said yesterday the new monthly charging structure would benefit about 1m customers who only overdraw occasionally. It is to abolish its Pounds 20 fee for warning letters telling customers they are overdrawn. There has been considerable speculation that NatWest would become the first bank to introduce charges for customers who stay in credit. The new charges indicate that it has instead chosen to penalise its most unprofitable customers. NatWest is the first of England's big four banks to introduce a daily overdraft fee. Most banks already charge on a monthly rather than quarterly basis and impose fees for sending warning letters and returning cheques. Under NatWest's new structure, to be introduced from June 1, the most persistent overdrawn customers will suffer substantially. They face charges of up to Pounds 355 a quarter if they stay constantly more than Pounds 50 over their agreed overdraft limit. The fall in base rates since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism in October has made more current accounts unprofitable for banks because they can no longer earn as much from interest on re-lending their deposits. Mr David Powell, NatWest's director of personal financial services, said the new structure would remove some of the existing 'cross-subsidies' under which customers who regularly enter overdraft are charged less than they cost the bank. Mr Powell said that 60 per cent of customers would not be affected by the change because they remain in credit. He said customers who regularly overdraw typically cost the bank up to five times as much per account than others and it was fair that they paid more. He said the bank expected to neither gain nor lose under the new structure, although it hoped it would eventually save money by persuading customers to change their behaviour. NatWest is also removing the system of waiving fees for customers who go into overdraft provided that their average cleared balance during a quarter is above Pounds 500. Customers in overdraft will be charged Pounds 9 a month, and a Pounds 3.50 daily fee if they have an overdraft more than Pounds 50 in excess of agreed limits. They will not be charged for warning letters. NatWest produced figures to show that a customer with a Pounds 500 unauthorised overdraft for a quarter, who gets one warning letter and one returned cheque, will be Pounds 182 better off a year under the new structure.</p>

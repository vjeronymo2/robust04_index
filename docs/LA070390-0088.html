			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASIANS PROTEST CENSUS FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES;  </P> <P> MINORITIES: A PLAN TO LUMP THEM WITH WHITES IN A DOOR-TO-DOOR POST-EMUNERATION  SURVEY IS UNDER REVIEW, OFFICIALS SAY.  </P> <P> Census officials, reacting to criticism from Asian community leaders, said  Monday that they will consider modifying a post-census survey in hopes of more  accurately tabulating the nation's Asian population.  </P> <P> Asian leaders from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles have decried the  so-called "post-enumeration survey," saying it will ignore their community at a  time when Asians are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the nation.  </P> <P> The post-enumeration survey, scheduled to begin this month, is designed to  assure that minority groups and the poor are not undercounted in the nearly  completed U.S. census.  </P> <P> The study is to be based on door-to-door interviews with 150,000 households,  the results of which will be compared to completed census forms for those same  households. Discrepancies will be noted and used to determine if members of  minority groups or those who fall within certain income levels were  undercounted.  </P> <P> The criticism arose because Asians, while listed separately on the survey  forms, were to be grouped together with whites in the study. Los Angeles  officials have estimated that Asians were undercounted by 7.3% in the 1980  census.  </P> <P> "In the last decade Asian-Americans have fought two presidential  administrations to ensure a correct count," Secretary of State March Fong Eu  said Monday at a press conference in Los Angeles. "Now the Asian community is  back at ground zero."  </P> <P> Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu, who joined Eu at the press conference, said:  "There's absolutely no justification to exclude Asians. In fact, there's even  more justification to include us. Immigrants are not familiar with the  census-taking process and may have undercounted family members."  </P> <P> Rep. Robert Matsui (D-Sacramento) and Rep. Norman Mineta (D-San Jose) also have  criticized the study and, last week, joined with about a dozen other members of  Congress to sign a letter of protest directed at the Commerce Department and  the Census Bureau.  </P> <P> Before their announcement Monday, census officials had defended their policy,  claiming that Asians are such a small percentage of the U.S. population that  the post-census count cannot determine if they have been undercounted. Under  the bureau's current plan, blacks and Latinos would be included in separate  categories in the count. Anglos, Asians, Pacific Islanders and American Indians  who do not live on reservations would be in a third category.  </P> <P> On Monday, Charles Jones, associate director of the Census Bureau, said the  bureau would "look at" changing its study as the result of telephone calls and  letters demanding that Asians be counted accurately. "I can't promise anything  right now . . . but it's certainly feasible to look at that and see if we can  (count Asians) separately" in the post-census count, he said.  </P> <P> The Asian community has burgeoned with an influx of Chinese, Vietnamese and  Cambodian immigrants to the San Gabriel Valley, Orange County and the San  Francisco Bay Area. Asians and Pacific Islanders make up 12.6% of Los Angeles  County's population, according to 1990 estimates by the county Department of  Health Services. They make up about 9.5% of California's 29 million residents,  according to 1989 Department of Finance estimates. Blacks comprise 7.5%, and  Latinos 24.2%, of the state population.  </P> <P> Even if the Census Bureau agrees to change its way of conducting the  post-census count, it is unclear whether the results will be used to adjust  final census figures. Census officials said they have made no decision on how  and whether the count will be used despite demands by officials in Los Angeles,  California, Chicago, Houston, New York and Miami.  </P> <P> City and state officials charge that the Commerce Department failed to live up  to a court-sanctioned agreement that spells out the conditions under which the  census would be adjusted to correct for undercounted populations.  </P> <P> The cities and states argued in a 1988 lawsuit that they stand to lose millions  of dollars in federal funds as a result of undercounted minorities and the  poor. These critics contend that many members of minority groups and the poor  avoid the census because of language barriers, ignorance or distrust of  authorities. Latino and black civil rights organizations also were plaintiffs  in the suit.  </P> <P> In the settlement with the Commerce Department last year, Los Angeles officials  assumed Asians would be counted as a separate group in the post-enumeration  survey, said Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Christy Campbell report: "European Defence Links To </F> Replace NATO"]    [Text] Foreign Office officials are working on plans to  promote closer co-operation on defence and security between  Britain and Europe. The aim is to replace a defence policy  based on NATO, and relying on American support, with a more  pan-European approach.    The Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, is strongly behind the  change of emphasis and is understood to be seeking more  aggressive promotion of joint European defence projects after  next month's European elections. Britain is already committed  to more joint ventures under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty,  and an accelerating American withdrawal from Europe is now  thought to be inevitable.    However, Euro-sceptic Tory back-benchers are alarmed by the  new approach, which was reflected strongly in the recent Defence  White Paper. They believe it will jeopardise British  sovereignty and could put British security under European  control.    Ian Duncan-Smith, Conservative MP for Chingford, claimed  last  night he had wide backbench support for the challenge he is  planning to force ministers to come clean on what he described  as a "hidden agenda."    The White Paper states: "While defence and security policies  are likely to retain specifically British elements with an  ability for national action...the multilateral dimension will  increasingly influence our judgment."    Mr Duncan-Smith called this an admission that national  sovereignty over defence was effectively being put up for grabs  by Brussels. "It is an extraordinary statement -- a huge shift  of policy, which has neither been debated in the House of  Commons nor in the party," he said.    The defence document concentrates heavily on British  security  in the European context -- while admitting that "significant  reductions in the costs of the defence programme" will be  announced as soon as possible.    The results of a defence cost study ordered by Malcolm  Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, will be published in  July. It will present radical proposals to privatise support  services involving as many as 20,000 Government job losses.    There will be heated squabbles over cuts in military bands  and regimental mascots, but an underlying shift in global  security policy could cause a much bigger political storm.    "It's a dual track," said Mr Duncan-Smith. "The Government  is dressing up real cuts in our fighting capability while  claiming the front line will not be touched. At the same time  we are galloping into European defence agreements. The two are  clearly linked."    Julian Brazier, vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench  defence committee, said he was more concerned about the cuts'  effect on Britain's true fighting capability.    "The Army is being crushed by ever-expanding peacetime  commitments and cuts in resources," he said. "Anything that  might weaken the transatlantic connection would be a fatal  mistake."</p>

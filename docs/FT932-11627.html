			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Sport: Ode to joy - Soccer AFTER eight topsy-turvy months the struggle to be the first holder of the hideous new Premier League trophy has been reduced to a simple equation. Manchester United need to win one of their two remaining games to clinch their first league title since 1967. Even if they cannot manage that they will be champions if Aston Villa fail to win their last two games. So far United have shown little sign of the collywobbles which undermined a commanding lead in the league last year, but they face two opponents who will expose any weakness of nerve. The first, at Old Trafford on Monday, are Blackburn Rovers, the Premier League's form team whose last game was a 3-0 win over Aston Villa. The second are Wimbledon next Sunday. Wimbledon, according to accepted wisdom, are the last team anyone would want to face needing a win to clinch the title. Wimbledon are reviled among the soccer 'purists' who refuse to accept that part of the game's beauty is that it lends itself to so many styles of play. Wimbledon are not pretty but they deserve respect. For the purists this season has been a joy. The title has been a three-cornered fight between teams that play the game 'properly'. But there is also a huge difference between the styles of Villa and United. And what has separated those two from their main challenger, Norwich City, is not their attacking play but a characteristic they share with Wimbledon: steely pragmatism. Of the two contenders, Villa have been more enjoyable to watch. Ron Atkinson, their manager, has bought a string of canny veterans, comfortable with the ball at their feet, happy to work unrelentingly for the team. Their midfield is short on flair but long on intelligence. Villa can win matches with the breakaway pace of Dean Saunders and Dalian Atkinson, but they can be patient, too: penning opponents in defence, moving the ball fluently from wing to wing, picking away for holes. The movement off the ball is continuous; players find space and in turn receive uncomplicated ground passes, nearly every one delivered simply, securely, with the instep. Dwight Yorke won BBC TV's last goal-of-the-month award with a simple tap-in after a passing move involving nearly every Villa outfield player. At most Villa games this season the neutral fan has been able to settle back in his seat and enjoy a flowing display of deceptively simple elegance. United you watch from the edge of your seat. This is not because they live dangerously. Their defence is even tougher than Villa's and has given them an advantage in goal difference which may prove decisive. United's attack is addicted to risk. Paul Ince, Ryan Giggs, Mark Hughes and, most of all, Eric Cantona, disdain the simple technique of the coaching manual. Every United attack is conjured from flicks, chips and back heels. Even with players as gifted as these, such tricks fail more often than they succeed. As a result, United can go for long periods without mounting a coherent attack. But that is not the point. United's most terrifying weapon is the pace of Giggs, Lee Sharpe and, when he plays, Andrei Kanchelskis. Not for them the careful rhythm of Villa; they try to engineer breaks from midfield, or at least to prevent opposing defences settling into a comfortable formation. United's march in recent weeks has been characterised by sudden goals from rapid raids, starting with the three that destroyed Norwich's offside trap and title hopes, and most recently those from Hughes and Ince that pierced Crystal Palace 10 days ago. Last year, Alex Ferguson, United's manager, picked increasingly defensive teams in the final weeks; he blames injuries to strikers but that does not explain why Kanchelskis started just four of the final eight games. This year Ferguson has not blinked and he has kept picking four attackers. The policy has been a success psychologically as much as tactically. 'We went out dreading every game towards the end of last year,' says Hughes. 'Now it is a joy to play.'</p>

The Government of the Republic of Armenia is instructed  and it is proposed to the Central Bank of Armenia to discuss and  make the necessary changes within a week in decrees of the  Government of the Republic of Armenia and the Central Bank of  Armenia No. 383 of 26 July, No. 402 of 30 July, No. 519 of 13  October 1993 and in decree of the Government of the Republic of  Armenia No. 520 of 13 October 1993, having as its object the  maximum facilitation of the importation into the republic and  sale of food products and fuel, having provided for the most  favorable conditions for the establishment of foreign economic  ties for the individual entrepreneurs and other persons engaged  in economic activity who have been attracted into this business.  In the matter of the obligatory sale of the foreign currency  funds obtained to the Government of the Republic of Armenia, a  differentiated approach is to be developed to ensure the  continuous replenishment of the working capital of enterprises  and organizations and the conducting of normal economic activity.    2. The Government of the Republic of Armenia, jointly with  the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia, is, within five  days, to discuss the question of the need to review the  temporary prohibition on the conducting of trading transactions  in cash established by paragraph six of decree of the Government  of the Republic of Armenia and the Central Bank of Armenia No.  383 of 26 July 1993.    3. In view of the fact that conflicting interpretations have  arisen in the implementation of the decree of the Government of  the Republic of Armenia of 26 November 1993 "On the Exemption  from the Value Added Tax of Individual Types of Food Products  and Certain Children's Goods Being Sold to the Population in the  Territory of the Republic of Armenia," the State Tax  Inspectorate of the Republic of Armenia is instructed to extend  the above-mentioned decree of the Govermment of the Republic of  Armenia to the wholesale and retail trade in butter, vegetable  oil, sugar, granulated sugar, margarine, groats, cheese and  powdered milk both produced in the Republic of Armenia and  imported into the Republic of Armenia, having fully exempted the  importation and sale (trade) of these goods from the value added  tax.    4. The Government of the Republic of Armenia is instructed,  within five days, to establish a suitable procedure in the  Zvarnots [as transliterated] and Erebuni [as transliterated]  airports of the Republic of Armenia so as to preclude the  formation of any artificial barriers to the reception of cargo  planes in the republic, the organization of return flights, and  the importation of food products and other cargoes.    The attention of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the  Customs Administration of the Republic of Armenia, and the  leadership of the Main Civil Aviation Administration under the  Government of the Republic of Armenia is to be drawn to the  enormous state importance of this question and the need to  create conditions of the severest intolerance as regards any  illegal action.    5. It is to be established that, beginning 20 December 1993,  any organ of executive power is to be prohibited from conducting  checks in organizations (irrespective of the form of ownership)  importing into the republic and selling food products without  the special permission of the Government of Armenia. The  above-mentioned organizations are strictly bound, in accordance  with the procedure established by law, to submit a quarterly  report to the appropriate organs of the State Tax Inspectorate  of the Republic of Armenia on the overall results of the  economic activity they have conducted and in conformity with  this on the status of the payment of state taxes.    The Government of the Republic of Armenia is to establish  the  procedure for checking the quality of food products being  imported and sanitary fitness.    6. The Government of the Republic of Armenia, within two  weeks, is to specially consider the overall situation which has  arisen in the airports of the Republic of Armenia resulting from  the need for the reliable organization of flights, the  fundamental improvement of the business of transporting  passengers and freight, and the establishment of suitable  procedure in the area of financial and economic activity.    7. The Monitoring (kontrolnyy) Service under the President  of  the Republic of Armenia is to report every 15 days on the course  of the implementation of the present Edict.    [Signed] L.

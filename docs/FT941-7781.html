			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Metallgesellschaft plans DM1bn disposals Metallgesellschaft, the troubled Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial group, is planning to raise at least DM1bn (Pounds 390m) from disposals this year, according to its chief executive. At his first press conference since taking over before Christmas, Mr Kajo Neukirchen said yesterday that proceeds from disposals, alongside other cuts, would help halve the group's DM9.4bn debts by September. He indicated that losses from speculative oil derivatives trading in the US amounted to nearly DM1.5bn in the three months to December. This was in line with the figure given to bankers last month when a DM3.4bn rescue package was agreed. This brings the total amount lost in speculative oil futures trading, conducted through the New York-based MG Corp, to DM2.3bn. The explosion of activity in oil futures trading during 1993 was still not fully explained, Mr Neukirchen said. The volume of oil MG Corp contracted to deliver rose from 20m barrels to 160m barrels between October 1992 and the end of last year. The final position was equivalent to 80 days' oil production by Kuwait. Details of an investigation would emerge at a shareholders' meeting on March 30. Mr Neukirchen expressed cautious optimism about the group's future but said a strategy had yet to be finalised. Job cuts were to be limited to 7,500 of the group's 43,292 employees, which would save DM550m a year. He intended to cut the cost of materials and other items by DM1bn this year. Included on the list of 'for sale' candidates are the mining activities, grouped together in the 50.1 per cent owned Metall Mining Corporation, a Canadian company. Mr Neukirchen said the mining activities required too much capital. This was the first time that Metallgesellschaft had confirmed that the mining businesses were to be sold alongside the 46.7 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt, a supplier to the car industry, and three smaller holdings. But the disposal of mining is not surprising as Metallgesellschaft has pointedly omitted to mention it as a core business. Mr Neukirchen praised the big German banks for mounting the rescue operation which ensured the group's survival last month, but declined to pass comment on the role of the supervisory board in failing to prevent the crisis at MG Corp. He indicated that Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank director who is supervisory board chairman, would address the issue at tomorrow's special annual general meeting. Excluding MG Corp, there was a pre-tax profit of DM35.3m in the three months to December, on turnover of DM4.3bn.</p>

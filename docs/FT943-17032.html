			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Blair promises Labour will raise rate of growth Mr Tony Blair yesterday set out his plans for a 'partnership economy' in a keynote speech intended to demonstrate his economic credentials to be Labour leader. Aiming his remarks as much at business as at voters in Labour's leadership election, Mr Blair said Labour was the only party which could raise the UK's low rate of growth. Mr Blair, who was a Labour economic spokesman in 1987-88, is the runaway favourite in the three-cornered contest to succeed John Smith as Labour leader. His address to the Engineering Employers' Federation in Birmingham was his first attempt to set his modernising philosophy in a detailed economic framework. Mr Blair said Labour could win power by showing that it was the party of opportunity and competence, and setting out a framework for coming to terms with economic, technological and social change. He said the way forward lay through a partnership with industry in which government would improve education and training, encourage innovation and technology, strike a balance in industrial relations law, and promote longer-term investment through the tax system. Labour had to demonstrate that the 'simple market theory' of the Conservatives was incapable of correcting the low levels of investment that lay behind Britain's sluggish economic growth. On macro-economic policy he said Labour had to advance beyond a choice between traditional Keynesian economics and the blind alley of monetarism. He said both theories had yielded to the reality of global financial markets, leaving an incoming Labour government with the choice of running a siege economy or using diplomacy to influence the economic policies of main trading partners. 'The latter is the only serious alternative,' he said. Mr Blair attacked Tory 'incompetence' which offered Labour an opportunity to win the intellectual battle over economic policy. He said the Tories had created a low-success and high-tax economy in which low growth and insufficient wealth creation led to the high costs of unemployment and social decay. But he also offered a challenge to his two left-wing rivals for the leadership - Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr John Prescott - by saying clearly that the market economy was in the public interest. Mr Blair said the 'era of corporatist state intervention' was over, and 'the battle between public and private sector, or market versus state, is as relevant today as the ideas of medieval schoolmen.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A totalitarian dictatorship is emerging in Crimea,  built on the basis of open Russian chauvinism. The  newly-elected Supreme Council of Crimea and the autonomous  republic's president, Yuriy Meshkov, have embarked on an  unmasked course towards Crimea's separation from Ukraine. Thus  states an appeal to the president and Supreme Council of Ukraine  by Crimea's shadow parliament, the Civic Congress of Crimea,  formed to consolidate progressive pro-Ukrainian democratic  forces on the peninsula.    The pro-Russian chauvinists and their media, the document  stresses, are trying to convince people that Kiev is responsible  for all of Crimea's troubles, and that Ukraine is putting brakes  on the development of the autonomous republic's economy. Rumors  are constantly spread about accelerated militarization of the  peninsula. This campaign has already reached its goal: Fear is  common among Crimean residents and households are getting  involved in interethnic clashes.    The shadow parliament, the Civic Congress of Crimea, demands  that the Supreme Council of Crimea should be dissolved, the  republic's presidency abolished, and direct presidential rule  imposed here. The demands include urgent and fair settlement of  the Black Sea Fleet problems, withdrawal of Russian ships from  Ukraine, prevention of the lease of Ukrainian territories to  foreign military bases, and recognition of the powers of the  majles as a body representing the interests of the entire  Crimean-Tatar people.</p>

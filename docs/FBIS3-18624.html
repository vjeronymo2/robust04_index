Expressing regret at recent comments by James Molyneaux, Mr  Spring, leader of the UUP [Ulster Unionist Party], told the Dail  [parliament] yesterday he did not believe a strictly internal  solution to the Northern problem would work. The most likely  result of such an approach would be to marginalise the role and  influence of the leaders of the Unionist community, at a time  which could be of considerable importance for the future of the  island.    He hoped those leaders would reflect very carefully on their  position. "Their rightful place is at the negotiating table.  Recent opinion polls suggest that is where their own electorate,  as well as the two Governments, wish to see them."    Replying to Fine Gael leader John Bruton, the Tanaiste  stressed that no party had a veto on the resumption of the  three-stranded talks process. Both Governments were working  towards a framework to set out a basis for these talks.    He hoped very sincerely that electoral considerations would  not prompt any modification of the generally constructive line  the Official Unionists had taken over the Downing Street  Declaration. This agreement was far too important to allow it to  be exploited by political manoeuvering in the context of the  European elections.    Mr Bruton stressed the importance of the Government making  contact with the Unionists to dissuade them from pursuing what  the Taoiseach [prime minister] had aptly called a cul-de-sac.  The Government should table proposals on strands 2 and 3 of the  talks process to dispel suspicions -- wrongly held, he believed  -- in the North that Dublin was not really serious about these  strands.    The Tanaiste replied that efforts had been made over the  last  year to build up a relationship with the Unionist parties  because of the important role they had to play in determining  the future of this island. The Government would do everything  possible, including the handing over of papers setting out their  ideas for solution to the problem, to ensure that any doubts on  the part of those in the Unionist community were ended.    He would be holding further discussions soon with the  Northern Secretary on how the talks process could be advanced.    Mr Spring will meet Sir Patrick Mayhew informally in Dublin  tomorrow ahead of a full session of the Anglo-Irish Conference  in London next Thursday [10 March].</p>

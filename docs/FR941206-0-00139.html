			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The conditions under which a treated hazardous waste no longer is required to be managed in affected units using air emission controls under the subpart CC standards have been revised and expanded since proposal to include many alternatives from which an owner or operator can choose one with which to comply. The final subpart CC standards allow an owner or operator to use any type of treatment process that can continuously achieve one of the specified sets of performance conditions. These conditions have been changed to include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The average volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste exiting the process is less than 100 ppmw (except for certain site-specific situations where multiple hazardous waste streams are treated by a single process in which case a volatile organic concentration limit for the waste exiting the process is established by the rule procedures at a value lower than 100 ppmw); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The organic reduction efficiency for a process treating multiple hazardous waste streams is equal to or greater than 95 percent, and the average volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste exiting the treatment process is less than 50 ppmw; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The actual organic mass removal rate for the process is greater than the required mass removal rate established for the process. The alternative treatment process performance requirements specified in the final subpart CC standards are discussed further in section VII.A.2 of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed explicit exemption for hazardous wastes complying with the land disposal restriction (LDR) treatment standards is not included in the final subpart CC standards. The EPA concluded that the expanded number of alternatives for treated hazardous waste and other provisions added to the final rule provide a reasonable regulatory mechanism by which a TSDF owner or operator can determine whether a hazardous waste complying with the LDR treatment standards is exempted from being managed in accordance with the air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Waste Determination Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As already noted, the procedures that a TSDF owner or operator may use to determine the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste have been revised for the final subpart CC standards. For a case when direct measurement is chosen for determining the volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste, the proposed statistical calculation procedure using Method 25D results is not included in the final subpart CC standards. Instead, procedures are specified in the final rule to compute the mass-weighted average volatile organic concentration of a hazardous waste using Method 25D results for waste generated as part of a continuous process and for waste generated as part of a batch process. Under circumstances when the same batch process is performed repeatedly but not necessarily continuously, the final rule allows the owner or operator to determine the average volatile organic concentration of the waste from this process by averaging results for one or more representative waste batches generated by the process. In all cases, a sufficient number of waste samples for analysis (with a minimum of four samples) must be collected to be representative of the normal range of the operating conditions for the source or process generating the hazardous waste. Normal operating conditions for the source or process generating the waste include cyclic process operations such as startup and shutdown. Process malfunctions, maintenance activities, or equipment cleaning are not considered to be normal operating conditions for the purpose of determining the average volatile organic concentration of a waste. These waste determination procedures are discussed further in section VII.A.3 of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND IF THE SANDINISTAS WIN?  </P> <P> Though the initial returns won't be available for hours -- and it may take days  to fully sort out the results -- today's Nicaraguan election, one way or the  other, offers Washington the opportunity for a full-scale review of its rocky  relations with Managua. Has not the time come for the Bush Administration to  end this futile war with Nicaragua -- one that has waxed hot and cold, but  never off? Is it not time to follow the inspired lead of Costa Rican President  Oscar Arias Sanchez and work to bring peace to a region that has known far too  much war and sorrow for the last decade?  </P> <P> Consider all the monitoring of Nicaragua's election -- perhaps the only news  event more closely watched these past few weeks than the lives of Ivana and  Donald Trump. Everyone from United Nations officials to former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter have been down there, poking about for election irregularities.  </P> <P> What's surprising is not that some have been found but that relatively few  egregious ones appear to have been committed. This election may never be cited  in political-science textbooks as a model of democratic process. But, to be  fair, Nicaragua's voting may not have been any more irregular -- and perhaps  less -- than the kind common not so very long ago in underdeveloped places like  Cook County, Ill.  </P> <P> The problem, of course, is that if the Sandinistas win, many Americans will  believe that the election was rigged. This would be unfair to the Nicaraguan  people: Inept incumbent governments win reelection all over the world simply by  virtue of their incumbency. So in analyzing the voting this afternoon, and in  the days to come, the fact that the "bad guys" won doesn't make the election  bad or the results invalid.  </P> <P> On the contrary, American policy toward Nicaragua needs to change no matter  who's in power there. The Reagan policy of supporting the Contras and CIA  activity against the Sandinistas has brought us little but grief. Last  Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Washington  will normalize its relationship with the Nicaraguan government even if the  Sandinistas win -- if the election is fair.  </P> <P> While Washington has the right to ask hard questions about this election, they  shouldn't be so hard as to preclude the possibility of finally ending the cold  war with Managua.  </P></p>

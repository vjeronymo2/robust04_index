			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Letter: Bulletin Board share trading not for 'second-class citizens' Sir, Mr Paul King (Letters, September 9) is concerned about whether companies traded on the London Stock Exchange's Company Bulletin Board are treated as 'second-class citizens'. I can reassure Mr King that the exchange does not treat his company - or any other smaller company - as a second-class citizen. I could also like to put the record straight on a number of misconceptions that have arisen about the trading facilities for smaller companies' shares. The Company Bulletin Board was introduced to provide an effective trading mechanism for those companies with shares that are traded only sporadically, and where marketmakers can not profitably commit their capital to providing a trading facility. The very name Company Bulletin Board perhaps elicits some of the misunderstandings about the nature of this service. It is in fact a trading mechanism that enables investors to display to the market as a whole their buying or selling orders in each listed security. In addition, the Bulletin Board displays for each company a table of corporate and historical price and trading information which is of direct benefit to investors. The corporate broker, whose name and telephone number is prominently displayed, is obliged to facilitate trading. He is able to act as principal to help smooth inconsistencies in order flow, as indeed is any other member firm trading in Bulletin Board securities. He will also ensure that prices displayed are a realistic reflection of both supply and demand and the fundamental value of the company. In smaller companies generally, there is usually only a relatively small amount of shares available to be freely traded, the rest being held by directors, employees and long-term investing institutions. It is precisely because of these characteristics that marketmakers are finding it increasingly difficult to operate profitably in this area of the market. The pattern of trading in Mr King's company's shares is typical of smaller companies. Around 75 bargains took place during the last year, and one-third of those trades by value were executed around the announcement of the annual figures. Put another way, on average, only two or three investors wished to buy or sell shares during each fortnightly account period. Marketmakers cannot stimulate additional business at these levels; they can only execute naturally arising business. This can be equally well achieved through the Bulletin Board dealing mechanism. Finally, the Bulletin Board has already proved that it is an appropriate trading mechanism for smaller companies' shares. There is no evidence, from statistics collated to date, that trading levels are adversely affected by the transition from marketmaking to the Bulletin Board. We will, of course, continue to review and enhance the service in the light of experience. Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman, London Stock Exchange, London EC2N 1HP</p>

			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (14): Faithful to the dinosaur - Just-in-time on a mainframe / Nissan uses 'old-fashioned' technology to support one of the world's most advanced factories Just-in-time manufacturing is down to a fine art at Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK). Stockholding of some components is just 10 minutes - and the holding of all parts bought in Europe is less than a day. Yet while many companies move to distributed computing and so-called client-server systems, Nissan's Sunderland plant, one of the newest and most advanced in the world, depends largely on a traditional central mainframe serving simple terminals. What is more, virtually all the systems have been produced by the company's own IT staff - using a database management system and development language which have been around for more than 20 years. Construction on the 800-acre site started in 1984 and by late 1993 4,250 people were employed. Last year 246,000 Primera and Micra cars were built, with 80 per cent being exported. Nissan has moved beyond just-in-time to synchronous supply for some components, which means manufacturers deliver these components directly to the production line minutes before they are needed. These manufacturers do not even receive an order to make a component until the car for which it is intended has started along the final assembly line. Seat manufacturer Ikeda Hoover, for example, has about 45 minutes to build seats to specification and deliver them to the assembly line a mile away. It delivers 12 sets of seats every 20 minutes and they are mounted in the right order on an overhead conveyor ready for fitting to the right car. Nissan has close relationships with this dozen or so suppliers and deals exclusively with them in their component areas. It involves them and even their own suppliers in discussions about future needs and other issues. These companies have generally established their own manufacturing units close to the Nissan plant. Other parts from further afield are collected from manufacturers by Nissan several times a day at fixed times. This is more efficient than having each supplier making individual haulage arrangements. Car manufacturing schedules for each day are produced by the big IBM mainframe computer and sent to Hitachi process computers on the production lines so that they know what to expect in terms of factors ranging from colour to left-hand or right-hand drive. The process computers signal a Digital Equipment Vax computer when appropriate to transmit an order to the components manufacturers involved in synchronous supply. Meanwhile materials handling people on the production lines check on levels of other components, such as low-value items supplied in bins. If stocks get low, they use barcode readers to send orders to the mainframe, which transmits messages to radio data terminals in the warehouse. Orders to suppliers with longer delivery times are sent weekly, although this is being cut to once a day. Again, suppliers are given specific delivery times. More than 90 per cent of orders are sent via electronic data interchange, the exchange of business documents between computers run by trading partners with little or no manual paper handling. In some cases transport arrangements are also notified by this method. All the mainframe and Vax systems are written in the Natural language from Software AG and are based on the company's Adabas database management system, which has been in use since the early 1970s. Nissan in Japan has long used Adabas and Natural as standard, so when the UK IT department was set up with four development staff and a medium sized IBM mainframe in 1985, its first systems, supplied from Japan, were based on these products. Since then all the systems have been rewritten and others have been developed as the plant has moved from an assembly unit to a total manufacturing operation, taking raw metal into its foundry at one end and turning out cars at the other. 'We had Adabas and Natural from day one, so that limited our choice of program packages,' says John Hope, general manager of the information systems department. No doubt we could have taken packages written in other languages and linked them together but we are very much an integrated manufacturing facility in which the rate at which we receive and use parts is critical, so we wanted similar integration of our systems. We didn't believe packages could provide the sophistication necessary. In addition, we didn't want to have to support different products using different languages and database systems.' The only significant packages, for accounting and personnel, have also been replaced by systems written by the IT staff, again to provide the integration and facilities the business demanded. The development of all the systems to support such a sophisticated and time-critical manufacturing and business operation has been done with just 50 staff, an issue of some pride to Mr Hope, especially as none had experience of Natural or Adabas. 'Natural is an English-like language and is easy to learn,' he says. 'We train people in-house and sit them next to experienced people and they are writing programs after a couple of days.' However, Nissan's system development methods have played a major part. Nissan likens programming to the car production line. A four-hour standard is set as the average for program production for work planning, although some programs are completed in 20 minutes and some take much longer. All systems have the same basic screen displays, with standard displays for adding, deleting, changing and browsing through data and for the overall list ('menu') of facilities. There is a library of standard programs which carry out these functions and they are fitted together whenever a new program is written, considerably cutting development time. If business users want extra facilities, these are agreed with the system designer and added to the basic displays. 'This policy means all development staff work the same way and all can understand and maintain any programs without needing in-depth knowledge of the particular application,' Mr Hope says. About 500 simple display terminals link users to the mainframe systems. There are also about 500 PCs running word processing and spreadsheet systems but these are not connected to business systems as a matter of course: some can access the mainframe, but only to extract data for modelling in a spreadsheet program. 'We are very much a traditional mainframe set-up, because we strongly believe it's right for Nissan,' Mr Hope says. 'We try to minimise the technology in use, because that minimises the support skills we need. We have 50 development staff, which is significantly less than in other companies of our size. Some people say the mainframe is extinct, but after our success over the last nine years we are pleased to have stayed with the mainframe 'dinosaur'.'

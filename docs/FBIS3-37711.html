			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Lenskiy report under the rubric "Our Correspondents </F> Report": "Karabakh: Give Peace a Chance"]    [Text] A working meeting in Moscow between V. Sarkisyan  and M. Mamedov, Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers, with  the mediation of their Russian colleague, General P. Grachev,  and V. Kazimirov, Russian Federation Foreign Ministry special  envoy, ended with a protocol on a full cease-fire in the  Nagorno-Karabakh zone. Nagorno-Karabakh representative B.  Saakyan also took part in the meeting; he sat separately from  the state delegations, a fact which symbolizes the autonomous  participation of the unrecognized Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in  the conflict.    We were told by the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense  that a definitive date for the cease-fire would be established  later, following coordination with the political leadership of  Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh. According to the  testimony of an officer from the Russian Federation Ministry of  Defense, who took part in the talks, the atmosphere was entirely  amicable. Although the full text of the signed document will  not be published for certain reasons, the officer made it clear  that the protocol also contains more specific agreements.    Which specific agreements? Ramiz Rizayev, Azerbaijani  ambassador in Moscow and participant in the talks, stated in an  interview with PRAVDA that the withdrawal of the Armenian troops  from the occupied areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh has also been  coordinated and that this is an indispensable condition of the  truce. The approximate deadline -- 1 March -- was also  determined, but the schedule and other details are still being  discussed by the experts. The status of Nagorno-Karabakh and  the fate of the enclave as a whole were not the subject of the  talks and will be resolved later on during the peace process.    Despite the first optimistic results of the quadripartite  meeting, so far it is difficult to judge whether serious  progress has been reached in untying the tight Karabakh knot.  There are no clear guarantees of how the commitments that have  been assumed will be observed, and when and in what form  peacekeeping forces will be put into operation. B. Yeltsin and  N. Nazarbayev already tried to reconcile the opponents in  Zheleznovodsk in fall 1991 (and, it seemed, not without  success), and there have been several hopeful agreements within  the framework of the CSCE. However, in the attempt to move from  words to action, each time the peace signal turned out to be  false. Will today's protocol stand the test of time?</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Nigerian oil unions defy Abacha over strikes Nigeria's oil unions yesterday said they would press on with the six-week strike which has cut vital oil exports by a fifth, despite the military government's seizure of their headquarters and dismissal of executives. But industry sources said tankers were still loading on schedule at Nigeria's largest terminals and that there had been no immediate signs of an increase in strike action despite the crackdown. Police cordoned off the headquarters of the two main oil unions, Nupeng and Pengassan, as well as the Nigeria Labour Congress in an attempt to break the strike and end the stalemate in a political crisis which has halted normal business and polarised the Moslem north and Christian south. The unions are demanding the release of Chief Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last year's annulled presidential election, who is in detention facing treason charges. For the first time, protest spread from Mr Abiola's stronghold in the south-west to Kaduna, the political centre of northern Nigeria. Hundreds of people marched through the city in protest against the dismissal of the union leaders, residents said. Yesterday's moves followed a nationally televised broadcast on Wednesday evening by Gen Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military leader, in which he said his government was dissolving the executives of the three organisations, and would appoint administrators to run their affairs. Gen Abacha said that he would not hand over power to Mr Abiola, adding the government would not intervene to stop the opposition leader's treason trial, which has caused sporadic rioting. In Lagos Mr Wariebi Agamene, sacked president of the blue-collar union Nupeng, said: 'We are going underground to continue with the strike. . . The strike has not been called off.' His counterpart in the white-collar union Pengassan, Mr Bola Owodunni, said: 'We are still forging ahead with our strike and we are going to contest Abacha's action in court. 'Our association will not be run by an administrator because the administrator will have no one to work with at our secret-ariat.' Unlike Nupeng, he said, his union's dissolved executive would not go underground. 'Our association still exists. There is no need going underground.' Oil industry officials said it was unclear whether Gen Abacha's move would hinder operations further. Crude oil production had stabilised after falling by 20 per cent from normal levels of 1.9m barrels per day because of the strike. Exports have not been cut by an appreciable amount as oil that had been destined for domestic refineries, now closed by the strike, had been diverted to outside markets.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> QUALITY OF LIFE AND TUESDAY'S ELECTION  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles is in crisis. Crime has reached the doorstep of  virtually every resident. Drive-by shootings have become an everyday occurrence  all over town. Trash has piled up in our canyons and soon we will be forced  into a stringent recycling program. Our freeways and major streets are  gridlocked. The sewage system is overloaded, and our air is the filthiest in  the nation. Developers run the city. Warner Ridge and Porter Ranch are huge  projects that threaten to overwhelm the Valley's infrastructure, and continued  expansion of the harbor and LAX promise to do the same to the rest of the city.  </P> <P> Who is at fault for allowing this to happen? These problems did not creep up on  us overnight. The danger signals have been evident since the early '70s, and  the mayor did not take heed. In fact, he has systematically made things worse.  He has attended every photo opportunity and ribbon-cutting in town, while  failing to confront the real issues facing the city. The mayor has been dealing  with symptoms rather than the cause of our problems -- overdevelopment.  </P> <P> The solution to our troubles lies in controlling growth and setting limits. We  must preserve our neighborhoods and return control of them to the residents.  Nate Holden and other challengers have been stumping the city from San Pedro to  Lake View Terrace and have a good grasp of the problems as well as some  solutions worth trying. There is plenty of talent ready, willing and able to  make this city livable again. It is time for a housecleaning at City Hall.  </P> <P> GERALD A. SILVER  </P> <P> MYRNA L. SILVER  </P> <P> Encino  </P> <P> Gerald A. Silver is president of Homeowners of Encino.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAN ON BARBECUE LIGHTER FLUID  </P> <P> A deeply breathed, clean-air sigh of relief and thanks to the visionary and  wise James Lents, executive director of the AQMD, for outlawing the profoundly  polluting charcoal lighter fluid -- in two years. No more back-yard barbecues.  </P> <P> No more "put another shrimp on the barbie," for the Grinch has stolen back-yard  parties.  </P> <P> But it is not enough. Flatulence is a major source of foul pollution. Outlaw  burritos. And exercise. Burning additional calories produces carbon dioxide,  furthering the greenhouse effect and global warming -- heat pollution. No  exercise. No cigarettes. No fried food (too smoky). Why, with a little thought  and a lot of regulation, unelected Czar Lents could shut down civilization. But  why wait two years to do it? Do it now. Then we can sit in our clean-air caves  and enjoy.  </P> <P> JOHN JAEGER, Irvine  </P></p>

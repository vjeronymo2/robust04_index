			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: POLO PARTY A HEAVENLY ATTRACTION  </P> <P> "I think this is as close to heaven as most of us are going to get," said  Katherine Abercrombie (her husband, Stewart, was in polo whites) as she and her  co-patron chairwoman Cecelia Dalsemer, wearing a Faberge gold double-horse pin,  looked about at the beauty of the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club in  Carpinteria.  </P> <P> Skies were blue-blue, mountains purple, grass Van Gogh green, the polo ponies  playful, and chairman Tommie Spear was putting the finishing touches on the  Braille Institute Auxiliary of Santa Barbara gala luncheon before the Robert  Skene Invitational Polo Match.  </P> <P> The party brings out Santa Barbara bluebloods. Some had attended Una Noche de  Gala, the 29th traditional Fiesta Ball planned by Beverly Jackson a few nights  earlier at the Coral Casino in Montecito, and some had been to the Amy and Bob  Adams Fiesta dinner at Hope Ranch.  </P> <P> That's the good life in Santa Barbara. Joan Neville came up from Newport Beach  to house-guest with Tommie and Kellogg Spear. Winslow Maxwell's house guests  were John and Jeannette McCarty of Pasadena.  </P> <P> Prominent in the crowd, too, were newly appointed Ambassador to Jamaica Glen  and Gloria Holden, Harold and Annette Simmons (he's making the move to buy  Lockheed), Molly Danielson of Hope Ranch, Bob (the famous 10-goal polo player)  and Elizabeth Skene, Francis and Patty McComb, Richard and Rosemary Bergen,  Frank and Katharine Miller, Frank and Jean Mallory, Dulce and James Harris and  Adele and Bob Mairs.  </P> <P> Auxiliary president Eunice Fly, whose husband, Tom, is president of the Bank of  Montecito and knows everyone, did the honors when it was time to award the  crystal trophies to the polo players. Among recipients was three-goal player  Greg Araneta, who was joined by his wife Irene (daughter of Ferdinand and  Imelda Marcos).  </P> <P> PLAUDIT: Just when we think Rockwell A. Schnabel, U.S. ambassador to Finland  until last February, and his pretty wife, Marna, are coming home to roost in  the contemporary home in Brentwood designed for them by architect Frank Gehry,  it's necessary for them to do double residence in Washington, D.C.'s  Georgetown. That's because he's been named undersecretary of commerce for  travel and tourism. The former ambassador is former president of Bateman  Eichler, Hill Richards Group, Inc. and former deputy chairman of the board of  Morgan, Olmstead, Kennedy &amp; Gardner, Inc. (now Wedbush Morgan Securities).  </P> <P> TRAVEL WINDS: What a reunion. Jane and Bill Petersen (she's the former Jane  Browne of Los Angeles) invited longtime pals back to Lake Geneva, Wis., and a  party at their Victorian estate, Black Point, the highest point on the south  shore of the lake and in the Petersen family since it was built in 1888.  </P> <P> Among those having a perfectly wonderful time were Mary Morton, retired Los  Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard L. Wells, Kilbee and M. L. Brittain, Gene  and Daphne Kurchak and Rose Fox Noll, who came from San Francisco. They climbed  to the fourth story tower to watch the white sailboats on the lake. . . .  </P> <P> Lee Minnelli, back from Paris, says the fashionable Hotel Plaza Athenee "was  like Beverly Hills on the Seine." Jayne and Henry Berger (en route to Monte  Carlo) were entertaining Beverly Morsey (in Valentino yellow silk), Amen Wardy  (with a Nice tan), Lee and Franco Cozzo and Della Koenig, who was en route to  London for Dr. Armand Hammer's soiree for Prince Charles and Princess Diana.  </P> <P> KUDOS: To John E. Anderson, president of Topa Equities Limited and leading  benefactor ($15 million) of the John E. Anderson Graduate School of Management  at UCLA, named president-elect of the UCLA Foundation. To maximize volunteer  power in campus activities, there are 15 new members of the board of trustees  including James Miscoll, Dallas Price, Lester B. Korn, Edgardo Acosta, Morgan  Harris Jr., Wayne Ratkovich, Paul Griffin Jr. and William Finestone. . . .  </P> <P> To Roberta Schulman Holland, Los Angeles native (daughter of Esther and Mark S.  Schulman of Beverly Hills), newly installed in New York as the national Women's  Division Chairman of the United Jewish Appeal. She lives in Providence, R.I.,  and in Palm Springs. . . .  </P> <P> To interior designer John Saladino, whose retreat for Paul Junger Witt and his  wife Susan Harris (he just produced "Dead Poets Society") is showcased in the  newest Architectural Digest.  </P> <P> SUMMER CIRCUIT: A black-tie reception launched the "Timur and the Princely  Vision: Persian Art and Culture in the 15th Century" opening this week at Los  Angeles County Museum of Art. . . .  </P> <P> Sid Adair and Doyle Kutch, new co-chairmen of Los Angeles Friends San Diego  Opera, were in the spotlight at the Hancock home of Veneita and Macklin Butler  where KUSC's Jim Svejda's opera parody "The Barber From Nuremberg Strikes Back"  was the attraction. . . .  </P> <P> UCLA Chancellor Charles and Sue Young entertained at their residence to  celebrate Ralph and Goldy Lewis's $5-million gift to establish the Lewis Center  for Regional Policy Studies at UCLA. . . .  </P> <P> Marlene Billington, two-year president of Encore (170 former presidents of the  Affiliate Committees of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra), hosted  Encore's incoming and outgoing boards for a Basque luncheon at the Pioneer  Boulangerie. Now, Jan Corey of Claremont takes over.  </P> <P> FANDANGOS: The historic Gilmore Adobe at Farmers Market has seven gardeners,  and the grounds, we hear, were meticulously groomed the other evening for the  waltzes and fandangos at the home of the late Arthur Fremont Gilmore, who lived  there 125 years ago when the land was still called Rancho La Brea.  </P> <P> His great-grandchildren -- Henry Hilty, Virginia Krodell (party chairwoman) and  Kathy Laritson (immediate past president of the National Charity League of San  Fernando Valley) -- opened the Adobe and its patios for the debutantes of the  league for their summer waltz party, a prelude to the Debutante Ball Nov. 25.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> DOW ADDS 5.94 ON HOPES FOR PEACE IN GULF  </P> <P> Stocks rose moderately Monday, bolstered by optimism about a peaceful solution  to the Iraq crisis and by a major takeover bid.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index, which rose 40.84 points on Friday, added 5.94  to close at 2,565.59. The Dow's rise was held back by AT&amp;T's loss of 2 to  30 1/8, on word of its takeover bid for NCR Corp.  </P> <P> In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in  trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 964 up, 612 down and 444  unchanged. Most broad-market indexes advanced about 0.5% for the day, with  over-the-counter stocks registering sharper gains.  </P> <P> Big Board volume slipped to 177.01 million shares from Friday's 192.35 million.  </P> <P> Overtures of peace in the Persian Gulf, which sent oil prices plunging and  boosted stocks Friday, continued to provide support on Wall Street on Monday.  Oil prices were mixed, with the January crude contract on the New York  Mercantile Exchange rising 30 cents to $29.15 a barrel.  </P> <P> During the weekend, Baghdad signaled that it would accept President Bush's  offer for direct talks.  </P> <P> News that AT&amp;T made an unsolicited stock-swap bid worth $90 a share, or $6  billion, for NCR helped the overall market. Such large acquisition bids have  become rare in the past year as financing has dried up.  </P> <P> "The (AT&amp;T) bid indicates there may be a lot more liquidity than many  think," said Alan Newman, a technical analyst at H. D. Brous &amp; Co. "If  there's still enough liquidity for deals like this and MCA/Matsushita, that's  good news."  </P> <P> Last week MCA Inc. agreed to be taken over by Matsushita in a $6.59-billion  deal.  </P> <P> News of the AT&amp;T bid "underscores the fact that a lot of companies are  still pretty cheap," argues analyst John Brooks of Davis, Mendel &amp;  Regenstein.  </P> <P> Among the market highlights:  </P> <P> * NCR rocketed 24 3/4 to 81 1/2 on news of the $90 AT&amp;T bid. The wide price  spread suggested that Wall Street was wary of the deal. Other tech stocks were  mostly higher on the news, and on optimism about computer sales despite the  weak economy. (Story, D2.) AT&amp;T lost 2 to 30 1/8 on worries that it may be  overpaying for NCR.  </P> <P> * Airline stocks rose on expectations that they might benefit from the decision  of Continental Airlines to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. AMR,  parent of American Airlines, rose 1 1/4 to 48 1/2. UAL, parent of United,  jumped 1 7/8 to 99 3/8. Also, Delta rose 1 3/4 to 58 1/2, Southwest rocketed 1  3/8 to 18 7/8 and USAir inched up 3/8 to 14 1/4.  </P> <P> * Some retailing stocks gained after a Goldman Sachs analyst made favorable  comments. Limited rose 1 1/2 to 17 1/4, Gap added 1 3/8 to 33 and Wal-Mart rose  3/4 to 30 7/8. Also, Kmart rose 1 3/8 to 28 and Home Depot jumped 2 to 37 3/4.  </P> <P> * Some home builders' stocks rallied. Kaufman &amp; Broad rose 1 to 8 and  Centex added 1 1/8 to 24 3/4.  </P> <P> In Germany, share prices rose strongly on the back of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's  election victory and on improved prospects for peace in the Persian Gulf. The  30-share DAX index ended 21.35 points higher at 1,462.58.  </P> <P> Stocks finished higher after a calm session on London's Stock Exchange. The  Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 13.3 at 2,162.7.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stocks closed higher but well off their highs after early optimism  over the Middle East crisis faded. The 225-share Nikkei average ended up 271.36  points at 22,725.99. At midday today, the Nikkei was off 580.67 at 22,145.32.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Momentum Carries Bond Prices Higher  </P> <P> Bond prices were up moderately in a lightly traded market energized by  lingering momentum from Friday's sharp advance.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 11/32 point, or $3.44 per $1,000  in face amount. Its yield eased to 8.36% from 8.39% late Friday.  </P> <P> Credit market participants said it was a day of quiet reflection and profit  taking for traders who aggressively bought bonds and notes Friday. Bonds  settled at prices close to early-day highs built on the heated overseas  activity that followed President Bush's diplomatic initiative to Iraq and the  subsequent plunge in oil prices.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 7.438%, down from 7.50% late Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Traders' Wariness of Talks Bolsters Dollar  </P> <P> The dollar rose against major foreign currencies as the prospect of direct  talks between Iraq and the United States failed to convince traders that a war  in the Persian Gulf will be avoided.  </P> <P> In New York, the dollar bought 1.513 German marks late Monday, compared to  1.502 Friday. It soared against the Japanese yen to 134.73 from 132.50 Friday.  </P> <P> Many traders don't believe that talks between the United States and Iraq will  head off a war, the risk of which has pushed the dollar higher because of its  status as a safe haven.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> High Demand Seen; Soybean Prices Soar  </P> <P> Prices of soybean futures bounded to five-week highs Monday on the Chicago  Board of Trade in a late rally fueled by signs of tight supplies and prospects  for stronger export demand. Most grain futures also advanced.  </P> <P> Soybean futures settled 4.25 to 11.75 cents higher in Chicago, with the  contract for delivery in January at $6.01 a bushel, the first daily close above  $6 for a near-term contract since Oct. 25.  </P> <P> Wheat finished 1.50 to 2.50 cents higher, with December at $2.48 a bushel; corn  was 0.25 cent lower to 2.50 cents higher, with December at $2.30 a bushel.  </P> <P> The surge began in the soybean oil pit after a large number of oil delivery  notices were canceled, indicating that soybean oil supplies for delivery  against the December contract may be tighter than previously thought.  </P> <P> Steve Freed, grains analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said soybeans also were  boosted by reports that Germany is considering selling at least some of its  excess soybean crushing capacity to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, near-term oil futures gained 30 cents to $29.15 a barrel on the New  York Mercantile Exchange, following Friday's rout. Gold futures fell sharply on  New York's Commodity Exchange as the dollar rose. The dollar competes with gold  for safe-haven money. Gold settled $6.70 to $7.70 lower, with December at  $376.60 an ounce.  </P> <P> Silver, however, was 1 cent to 1.6 cents higher, with December at $4.14 an  ounce.  </P> <P> Market Roundup, D10  </P></p>

The estuary and the  numerous rivers that feed it, poisoned daily by tens of millions  of gallons of raw sewage and toxic industrial waste, symbolised  a dramatic decline in the health of Britain's rivers following  decades of government neglect.    Mr Heseltine pledged that the &pound;4 billion Mersey Basin  Campaign, with investment spread over 25 years, would bring back  plentiful fish life to one of Europe's most polluted waterways.  The dumping of untreated factory waste and sewage, he said, had  created `an environmental disaster which is an affront to the  standards which people rightly now expect.'    Ten years on, the flagship clean-up programme is in jeopardy  because of Ministers' determination to dishonour a decade of  political promises in order to avoid unpopular increases in  water bills.    Almost half of the Mersey Basin's 500 miles of waterway  remains classified by the National Rivers Authority as `grossly  polluted' -- that is, unable to support life, useless for  drinking water and dangerous to swim in.    Leaked Whitehall correspondence passed to The  Observer confirms the Mersey Basin is one of many pollution  blackspots where clean-up efforts are likely to be postponed  into the next century to keep down costs for the privatised  water companies.    A letter from Neil Summerton, head of the Department of the  Environment's Water Services Directorate, to Ed Gallagher, chief  executive of the NRA, makes it clear that the Government plans  to break repeated promises to establish a national programme of  legally binding water quality standards for the 26,000 miles of  rivers in England and Wales. Ministers have been promising since  1986 to introduce these standards, known as statutory water  quality objectives, coupled with compulsory clean-up targets for  water companies and industry.    The NRA's regional offices have drawn up draft standards  aimed at reducing levels of sewage, industrial and agricultural  pollution discharged into rivers. And, two years ago, the  authority stated that it aimed to clean up most of Britain's  2,500 miles of `grossly polluted' rivers by 1995.    But the letter to Mr Gallagher states that John Gummer, the  Environment Secretary, and John Redwood, the Welsh Secretary,  have decided that `in general' there should be no allowances  made for spending by water companies to meet these river quality  targets in 1995-2000.    The only exceptions are likely to be `high-profile schemes  that Ministers would wish to proceed because of the political  commitments that have been given.' The Mersey Basin, it  adds,`may ... fall into that category.'    Other long-awaited programmes to clean up Britain's most  polluted rivers -- including the Aire, the Tees, the Trent and  the Tame -- by the end of the decade are also in serious  jeopardy, say NRA sources. All are virtually lifeless waterways,  polluted by sewage debris and stinking industrial effluent.    Ministers claim expenditure on meeting river quality targets  must be postponed because of the high cost of reducing sewage  pollution under the EC Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive of  1991, which threatens to increase water bills substantially. The  European law will set minimum standards for sewage outlets to  rivers and coastal waters serving more than 10,000 people.    But environmentalists fear that the clean-up will not be as  stringent as the NRA's planned targets for the worst pollution  blackspots. They claim the Government will set the lowest levels  of treatment allowed under the directive for ecologically  sensitive rivers, estuaries and coastal waters.    They argue that these sites, including important wildlife  sanctuaries, will be properly protected only under a  comprehensive national programme.    Andres Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth,  said: `Ministers are using the fear of higher water bills as an  excuse for reneging on repeated promises to set tough national  water quality standards.    `Instead of forcing the public to finance the clean-up out  of  current charges, they should be required to cut their record  profits and spread the clean-up costs over a longer period of  time.'</p>

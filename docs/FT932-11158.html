			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading IT WAS a return to more familiar territory in the futures market yesterday as the excitement of last week's trading subsided and volumes were dictated by a lack of direction, writes Christopher Price. Following Friday's strong close, the June Footsie contract opened slightly firmer at 2,824, reinforced by stronger gilts and a positive overnight Wall Street. However, it was not long before June ran into sellers and slipped back, hitting a morning low of 2,820. It then recovered, reaching 2,830 by lunchtime on some good two-way business. A day's high of 2,834 was attained just prior to Wall Street opening, although the lack of direction here, too, contributed to June's slow drift downwards. It hit a low of 2,816 late in the session before finishing at 2,819, ahead by 7 points from the cash market. Volume amounted to 8,364 lots. Dealers said firmer after-hours' trading pointed to a higher opening this morning. Traded options were also a quiet market. Total volume came to 17,113 contracts, compared with 26,640 previously. Lonrho topped the stock options with 2,833 lots transacted. This included a buyer of 500 of the December 100 calls at 13p. Lucas Industries was second, with turnover reaching 1,068. There was a seller of 1,000 of the August 140 puts at 12p. Volume in Thames Water totalled 604 contracts.</p>

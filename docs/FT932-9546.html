			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Delors orders study into EC's unemployment crisis THE EUROPEAN Commission has opened a wide-ranging study of unemployment in the EC in response to fears that Europe is losing the battle to remain competitive with the US and Asia. The study is expected to tackle the politically sensitive question of whether Europe's welfare state is indirectly contributing to low growth, rising unemployment and the failure to create new jobs. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, has ordered 'dozens of papers' on Europe's unemployment crisis, according to Community officials involved. The aim is to produce a report at the EC summit in Copenhagen next month, along with the EC's modest 'growth initiative'. More than 17m people are out of work in the EC. Mr Delors' study into the causes of unemployment and his search for potential remedies reflects his concern about political instability in Europe, but also a nagging worry about the EC's long-term competitiveness. The EC created 9.4m net new jobs between 1983 and 1990, partly in anticipation of the 1992 single market. But since 1990 it has lost a net 1.4m jobs. The short-term economic outlook is bleak, with the EC unlikely to grow more than 1 per cent this year and probably less than 1.5 per cent next year. Senior EC officials yesterday described the Delors study as a 'medium to long-term' study of the EC economy, leaving no areas untouched. The areas it will attempt to assess include: the competitive impact of floating exchange rates in the US and the UK the potential counterweight of a future single European currency trade practices in the US and Asia industrial policy the use of applied research as a tool for generating jobs the role of the welfare state in Europe. The most controversial area is the role of the welfare state. Mr Delors has left colleagues in little doubt about his support for social policy; but his call for fresh thinking means the study is likely to tackle the automatic right to social security and the commitment to minimum wages. One issue intriguing Brussels officials is whether Mr Delors' intellectual curiousity will lead him to re-examine the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty which strengthens workers' rights and is the subject of controversy in the UK. The ruling Conservative government won a treaty opt-out on the social chapter, arguing that it would hurt UK companies' competitiveness. Mr Delors has already won support from Sir Leon Brittan in tackling the issue of European competitiveness. In an interview, Sir Leon said German industry's complaints about the costs of employment in western Europe showed the issue was 'creeping up the agenda'. The Commission could play an important role in opening public debate, without necessarily legislating, he said. Commission officials stressed yesterday that the Delors study was an academic exercise only, and there was no desire to create a US-style society in Europe, with minimum social provisions. 'But we do recognise that there may be problems with excessive non-wage costs, particularly among the lower-paid,' said one official. The Delors study was commissioned a few weeks ago amid concern about management weaknesses in DG-5, the social policy directorate. Mr Sigismundo Crespo, the Spanish director-general, was unable to communicate in English with his boss, Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish commissioner. Mr Crespo resigned his post last week.</p>

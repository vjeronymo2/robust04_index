			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Xu Yang: "Foreign Ministry Blasts HK </F> Report"]    [Text] A foreign ministry spokesman yesterday attacked a  recent report on Hong Kong by Britain's House of Commons Foreign  Affairs Committee.    The conclusion of the committee's lengthy report runs  totally  counter to Britain's professed desire to improve relations with  China Wu Jianmin told a weekly news briefing in Beijing.    The report persists in supporting the "erroneous" policy of  the British Government on the Hong Kong election issue and its  "continued" confrontations with China, Wu said.    The report had fully revealed Britain's intention to  "prolong  its colonial influence in Hong Kong."    However China has the resolve and capacity to maintain  stability and prosperity in Hong Kong long after it returns to  China in 1997 he said.    Wu also discussed the Qiandao Lake accident in which 32  people, including 24 Taiwanese tourists, died on a blazing  cruise boat on March 31.    He said the mainland side hoped the tragedy would not hinder  the further development of exchanges across the Taiwan Straits.    The case has been confirmed as murder and three men in their  twenties have been arrested.    Wu said representatives from the mainland's Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) are expected to meet next month to  discuss ways to protect people and property on both sides. But  he did not say where the meeting will be convened.    Top figures from ARATS and SEF will also do their utmost to  ease the effects of this unfortunate accident, Wu said.    He went on to back China's oil deployment efforts in the  Nansha Islands and their waters, saying it was entirely within  China's sovereignty.</p>

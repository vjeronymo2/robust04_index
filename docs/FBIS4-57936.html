			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the  Central Electoral Board (JCE) of the Dominican Republic  announced the conclusion of the initial vote count for the  general elections held on 16 May, the results of which indicated  President Joaquin Balaguer was the winner.    The electoral authorities, however, refrained from  proclaiming the Reformist Social Christian Party (PRSC)  candidate the victor because the official resolution on charges  of irregularities filed by the opposition is still pending. The  JCE considers the charges filed by the opposition parties to be  "nonexistent" despite the lack of verification of eight voting  tables, according to JCE spokesman Francisco Alvares.    According to the results of the JCE, Balaguer obtained 42.44  percent of the votes, while the largest opposition party, the  Dominican Revolutionary Party, led by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez,  who made charges of alleged fraud, obtained 41.40 percent.  Third place was held by the Democratic Liberation Party (PLD)  of former President Juan Bosch, which obtained 13.8 percent.    The results were suspended for a period of time until the  authorities were able to explain which of the two presidential  candidates had committed the least amount of electoral fraud at  the polls.    Even though the figures provided by the JCE gives Balaguer  the victory, Pena Gomez said he would continue until he has  exhausted all peaceful means to denounce the "colossal fraud" of  which he claims to have been a victim.</p>

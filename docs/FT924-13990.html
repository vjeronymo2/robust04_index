			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally after uncertain start A FIRM opening by Wall Street came to the rescue of a London market suffering from an acute bout of inactivity as the chancellor of the exchequer endured a detailed examination of his economic policy by the House of Commons Treasury committee. Market strategists ascribed a late strong run by London's equity market to a squeeze on short positions and to an unexpectedly firm opening by Wall Street after the three candidates in the race to the White house met in a televised debate. Some market commentators in London remained convinced that moves to lower interest rates in Germany and the US may take place later this week. There was more uncertainty, however, over the timing of another cut in UK interest rates. The equity market opened on a depressed note, with dealers demoralised by two bleak surveys of the UK's financial services and manufacturing industries, and last Friday's poor performance by Wall Street, which closed at its lowest level this year. Sentiment was also unsettled by a series of worrying corporate stories. Lucas Industries, the electrical and engineering the components manufacturer, delivered the expected steep fall in profits along with a programme of restructuring involving asset sales and heavy job losses. Vickers was also highlighted as its shares plummeted in reaction to news that the group had lost out to the US in its attempt to win a Pounds 1bn order to supply its Challenger tanks to Kuwait. Opening five points down at 2,535.6, the Footsie quickly retreated to show a 10 point-plus fall within 30 minutes. A good rally, said to have been triggered by aggressive buying of the Footsie Future, soon developed, however, and the index was in positive territory shortly after 10am. There was then very little genuine business in the markets until Wall Street began trading and the UK chancellor faced the Commons Treasury committee. Wall Street was quickly into its stride and showing a gain of 30 points following reports that Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, refused to rule out further cuts in the discount rate ahead of the November 3 election. And hopes persist in London that the Bundesbank will soon sanction another reduction in German interest rates, although a cut this week is viewed as unlikely by one leading UK securities house. The interrogation of Mr Lamont by the House of Commons Committee was seen as an anti-climax by market observers. 'Nothing unexpected,' said the top trader at a leading UK securities house, while another said the examination had been 'overhyped' by the media. By the close of business the Footsie was 17.7 higher at 2,558.9. The rise was not, however, accompanied by any surge in demand; turnover was a paltry 305.6m shares, the lowest since early September. The two new FT-SE indices, made their official market debuts. The Footsie Mid index of 250 stocks closed 10.1 higher at 2,403.0 and the Footsie 350, comprising the Footsie 100 plus the Mid 250 index, moved up 7.1 to 1,230.4.</p>

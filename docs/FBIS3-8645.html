			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, president of </F> the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia, by Sandi Frelih in Bled on 12  March--recorded]    [Text] [Frelih] President Janez Drnovsek, first our  congratulations on the formation of your new party.    [Drnovsek] Thank you!    [Frelih] How do you see the political center?    [Drnovsek] The Liberal Democracy of Slovenia [LDS] will  definitely be a party of the political center. I personally see  the political center in this party being a moderate party of  moderate political views, devoid of any special ideology. We do  not wish to change the world like various ideological parties  have aspired to in the past, but to merely survive in this world  in the best possible way. For this reason, this will be a party  that will primarily emphasize the need for stability in  Slovenia, the need for political and economic stability, a party  that will build on maturity in the leadership of the country and  experiences gained in it, and a party that will build on a firm  financial and economic system, which would give as much as  possible leeway to the free initiative of our people so that we  can assert ourselves in the spheres where I believe the Slovenes  are the strongest--namely, hard work and lots of initiative.    We will offer what we have been offering in the LDS for the  last two years, what is already producing results, and what is  leading Slovenia out of the crisis.    [Frelih] A new large formation has been created. You will  command one-third of all seats in parliament. What do you fear  more--internal frictions in the new party because of, shall we  say, strong personalities or coalition disputes in the  government itself?    [Drnovsek] The LDS has been a big party even so far. The new  LDS will also be a big, even bigger party. In any big party  there are different people and different interests that need to  be mutually coordinated. One must seek a balance between them.  As the leader of this party I have been doing this even so far,  relatively successfully, I trust. I am doing the same as the  head of the government coalition and the prime minister. In a  way, I am constantly juggling various interests; therefore, I do  not expect any major problems of that nature in the future. I  expect that we will manage to maintain and pursue a balanced  policy within the party and within the government.    Regarding powerful political personalities, there have been  many in the LDS so far. There are many in the present  government coalition and there were some in the previous  coalition, too, however, in both cases things functioned fairly  well, I guess.</p>

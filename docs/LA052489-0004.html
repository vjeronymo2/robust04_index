			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PLANS FOR $425-MILLION RESORT IN MISSION BAY'S DE ANZA COVE OUTLINED  </P> <P> A proposal to turn a section of De Anza Cove in Mission Bay into a $425-million  tourist resort with hotels, shops, public bicycle and jogging paths, a 13-acre  botanical garden and an improved golf course was unveiled Tuesday.  </P> <P> The plan by the Beverly Hills-based De Anza Group, which operates a mobile-home  park and campground on the property earmarked for development, would require  approval of the City Council and a change in state law because the land is  designated as public tideland.  </P> <P> The De Anza Group now holds leases with the city for the park and campground  and would need to have them renegotiated for another 50 years, to the year  2053, in order for construction of the resort to occur.  </P> <P> Such an extension would also need the concurrence of the Legislature, which in  the early 1980s placed restrictions on the length of the leases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $125 Million for 1st Phase  </P> <P> If the approvals are made, the first phase of construction would begin as early  as 1992 and would consist of 400 hotel rooms, two miles of bike and jogging  paths around the bay, retail shops beside Rose Creek and a bridge over it, and  improvement to the Mission Bay Golf Course, which the De Anza Group is in  escrow to buy. This first phase would cost $125 million, according to the  developer.  </P> <P> The second phase would cost $300 million and would include 1,000 more hotel  rooms, the botanical garden, a cultural arts center, shoreline park areas, open  space and a greenbelt. This phase of construction would occur after 2003.  </P> <P> That's a key date because that's when the current lease on the De Anza Harbor  Resort trailer park expires, and the 1,000 residents who make the park their  home would be gone. In a complex arrangement negotiated over 19 months, the De  Anza Group has promised to stabilize rents at the trailer park until 2003 and  to pay for both the tenants' equity in their mobile homes and their relocation  costs.  </P> <P> "The critical component was the needs of the residents," said Michael Gelfand,  De Anza Group's senior vice president. For years, residents of the mobile home  park, most of whom are older than 65 -- though young families also live there  -- have feared that commercial development of the park would lead to their  early "economic eviction," despite their leases, which stretch into the next  century.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Back 1st Phase  </P> <P> Ted Ball, a resident of the park and president of the park's chapter of the  Golden State Mobilehome Owners League, said a majority of residents supports  the first phase of the construction plan, which would occur while those living  in the 510 mobile-home spaces are still there.  </P> <P> Ball characterized the compromise agreement as an adequate safeguard for the  residents. Key points of the agreement, he said, include a reaffirmation that  residents can stay until 2003; "predictable and reasonable" rent increases; the  construction of a new clubhouse and swimming pool if Phase 1 of construction  occurs; the developer paying for moving about 115 mobile homes affected by  construction to other parts of the park, and a pledge by the developer to pay  for relocation expenses and equity in 2003.  </P> <P> Gelfand declined to say how much it will cost his company to take care of the  residents, but he said it would cost the city of San Diego about $25 million to  do the same thing. The city would be on the hook for the expenses, according to  Gelfand, because of existing state law governing the closure of mobile-home  parks.  </P> <P> In this case, the city as landlord of the tidelands would be forced to pay to  relocate the residents when the lease expires in November, 2003, Gelfand said.  In lobbying for its plan and renegotiated leases, the De Anza Group emphasized  that, without such approvals, the city faces a $25-million expenditure.  </P> <P> Councilman Bruce Henderson represents the area encompassed by the proposal. He  was not available for comment Tuesday, but a spokesman said his office hasn't  had time to analyze the proposal and has no position on it. The spokesman said  Henderson has been concerned about the fate of the mobile-home residents and  had been involved in an earlier rent-protection agreement. He also said that a  final decision may be a few years away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan to Consolidate 3 Leases  </P> <P> Although the mobile-home park would eventually cease to exist under the De Anza  Group's proposal, the affordable Campland on the Bay site, used by campers and  recreational vehicles, would be reduced by two-thirds, from 900 spaces to 300.  The lease for Campland on the Bay doesn't expire until 2017, but the De Anza  Group's plan is to consolidate all three leases -- for the mobile-home park,  the campground and golf course, which would be upgraded and kept open to the  public -- into one lease expiring in 2053.  </P> <P> Gelfand stressed that his company's proposal would provide significantly  expanded public access to Mission Bay, would rehabilitate parts of Rose Creek  and wouldn't make traffic worse in already congested Pacific Beach. He claimed  that, as a destination resort, traffic generated by the development would be  minimal and that the construction of a new bridge over Rose Creek would help  circulation in the area.  </P> <P> "We don't want people to think we're rushing into this," said Gelfand,  explaining that his company hopes to circulate its proposal in the Pacific  Beach community and elsewhere and reach a consensus of support. "We want to  take this to the community to get their input . . . so that what we propose  makes sense."  </P> <P> A first step in that process will occur tonight, when the plan is outlined at a  Pacific Beach Town Council meeting.  </P></p>

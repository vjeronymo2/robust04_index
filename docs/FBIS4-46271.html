			<p>1991'   <F P=102>   NC3005204894 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1910 GMT 30 May 94 </F> <F P=103> NC3005204894 </F> <F P=104>  Cairo MENA </F> <F P=105>  Arabic </F> BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 30 May (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has emphasized that deceased lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith  Madani was a link between terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, who was  killed in a confrontation with the police last month, and the  sources abroad who finance terrorism. He noted that  investigations have provided definite proof that the lawyer was  involved in conveying instructions, receiving funds, and  distributing them to the rest of the group members. Al-Alfi,  who was speaking to members of the American Chamber of Commerce  in Cairo today, said that Madani had been implicated in several  previous cases and committed an act of terrorism in 1991. He  noted that many documents and papers were seized with him and  that he was detained after obtaining a permit from the Public  Prosecution Office.    Al-Alfi said that all the procedures used regarding lawyer  Madani were legal and that not even the emergency law was used  against him or against any other. He said: We were concerned  to detain this man and to keep him alive but his health  condition led to his death and thus we lost much information  that we were supposed to obtain from him.

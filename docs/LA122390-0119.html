			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURGEON TIRES OF EFFORT TO PLUG GAP IN TRAUMA CARE;  </P> <P> HOSPITALS: A DOCTOR ON CALL IN EMERGENCY ROOMS SAYS THAT DISINTEGRATION OF THE  NETWORK PUTS INCREASING STRESS ON THOSE WHO PICK UP THE SLACK.  </P> <P> When it was created in 1983, the trauma care network in Los Angeles County was  hailed as the finest emergency medical response system in the nation. Based on  trauma care developed during the Vietnam War, 22 hospitals, strategically  located throughout the county, were equipped with the best technology and  staffed 24 hours a day to respond instantly to life-threatening injuries.  Highly trained emergency room doctors, surgeons, anesthesiologists and other  specialists stood ready to treat the victims of car crashes, industrial  accidents and urban crime.  </P> <P> Now, by all accounts, that system has all but collapsed. Faced with increasing  violence on city streets, a growing population of poor, uninsured patients,  rising medical costs and, from the beginning, inadequate public funds to pay  for indigent patients, nearly half of the hospitals have pulled out of the  system, increasingly leaving the county's other 80 hospitals with emergency  rooms to deal with trauma cases.  </P> <P> Doctors are leaving emergency medicine in droves, but one who has hung on is  Dr. Robert Pereyra, a 40-year-old vascular surgeon who was trained at Loma  Linda Medical School, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles and Cedars-Sinai  Medical Center. Now in private practice in Glendale with a group of seven other  surgeons, Pereyra does elective operations and is on call for emergency surgery  at two private facilities: Glendale Adventist Medical Center and White Memorial  Medical Center, where he is chief of surgery.  </P> <P> Although not technically part of the trauma-care network, the doctors who work  -- often without pay -- in these hospitals are picking up some of the slack of  the embattled public emergency care system. It is a job that for a number of  years has brought Pereyra considerable professional satisfaction, but at a  personal cost that is becoming increasingly hard to bear.  </P> <P> Q: What is your role in the trauma network? Do you consider yourself a trauma  doctor?  </P> <P> A: My speciality is vascular surgery. . . . Forty or 50% of my cases involve  fixing arteries on people with arteriosclerosis . . . 20 or 30% preparing (the  veins of) patients who are about to undergo (kidney) dialysis. . . . The rest  is emergency general surgery and trauma care. . . . I am not a trauma  specialist. No one in our group is a trauma specialist, but the nature of our  practice, working in inner-city hospitals, and the nature of our training, as  surgeons, meant we were good at it to start with, and we have maintained  competence in it because we end up doing a fair amount of it.  </P> <P> Q: Why do White Memorial and Glendale Adventist have trauma patients if they  are not officially part of the trauma network?  </P> <P> A: It's a matter of where they are located. At White Memorial, we're in one of  the poorest areas of the city . . . a lot of the residents are illegal aliens.  . . . We have about four or five big freeway interchanges surrounding us. We  get a lot of injuries from there. We're very close to the Vernon-South  Gate-South L. A. industrial area. We get a lot of stuff from there. And we're  unfortunately in the middle of a lot of urban warfare. . . . Everything that is  wrong with trauma in L.A. is very clearly seen at White Memorial, just as it is  at Big County (County-USC Medical Center), which is about six blocks away. . .  .  </P> <P> In Glendale, the level of acuity (the severity of the injuries) may not be as  great, but there are other problems. . . . Glendale Adventist serves Glendale,  where there is a lot of civilian violence and also the Highland Park-Eagle Rock  area, where there happen to be a lot of . . . people who don't have insurance,  and the ones who do are on Medi-Cal which means they have very little money and  are prone to serious health problems.  </P> <P> Q: How do trauma patients get to you?  </P> <P> A: What happens is that we do a combination of trauma care and other  emergencies that the county facilities simply can't handle. . . . MAC (the  county's central telephone communication system, which directs ambulances to  hospitals) will call and ask us if there is an OR (operating room) available .  . . if there is a surgeon in house. They'll ask, "Are you prepared to accept an  ambulance run with a critical trauma victim because County (County-USC Medical  Center) is overloaded." Appendectomies and bowel obstructions will be stacked  up at Big County in the hall. . . . I'll also get a call directly from a  resident who'll say, "I've got this appy (a patient with appendicitis) who has  been sitting in the hall for 16 hours, and he's got insurance. Can you do  anything?"  </P> <P> Q: Even though theoretically the county is supposed to send you only patients  with insurance or guarantee payment for those patients who aren't insured, you  in fact aren't always paid, are you?  </P> <P> A: I'd say, of the emergency surgery we do in my group, fewer than a fourth  have some kind of insurance, whether it's an emergency because of acute  appendicitis or a bowel obstruction or a gunshot wound. Of the trauma patients  we see, almost none has insurance, maybe 10 or at most 20%. . . . What happens  is we attempt to transfer that patient to a hospital where there are salaried  doctors on staff to treat indigent patients. We call the MAC center, but  they'll tell us, "All county beds are full. . . ." So you end up taking care of  them and, if you are a private physician working in a private hospital, you  take care of them for free. The hospital doesn't pay us anything.  </P> <P> Q: Despite what it costs you, does the system work for the patient?  </P> <P> A: Sometimes in private, non-trauma hospitals the patients get better care  because they'll have a regular surgeon, not a resident, working on them. But  sometimes we get patients we simply aren't prepared for.  </P> <P> Q: Can you think of an example?  </P> <P> A: The last night I was on call, I did a thoracotomy (a chest operation) for  stab wounds to the chest. The guy died. I cut his chest open. He had a big hole  in his heart. That depresses you because technologically we probably had the  horsepower to save that guy, but we're not a trauma center. . . . He was  dropped off in the main lobby at White Memorial Hospital. If they had dropped  him at the emergency room of County, he might have survived because they can  mobilize a large group of people that we may or may not have. Here, the time of  day dictates who is available and what can be done.  </P> <P> Q: Who was the patient? And why was he directed to White Memorial in the first  place?  </P> <P> A: When I say dropped off, I mean somebody drove by and opened the door, threw  him out and streaked. We got a lot of that. Dump and run. And they're usually  hurt in some gang-related thing or some drug-related thing. Lots of dump and  run. Every week. . . . It turned out this particular guy was an illegal alien  who got on the wrong end of a drug deal. I had already done an appy for free on  an illegal alien earlier that night, which is why I was still in the hospital.  If I hadn't been in the hospital when that guy came in the front door, he would  have been pronounced dead instantly. The ER docs simply couldn't have dealt  with him.  </P> <P> Q: What about the patients who survive? Are they thankful for what you do?  </P> <P> A: A lot of the patients are very grateful. But we also get a lot of difficult  patients. They leave against advice, and they cuss at you as soon as the tube  comes out of their mouth. We had one patient recently who I am sure would have  died if a sub-specialist vascular surgeon hadn't been immediately available. .  . . The guy got slashed across the throat in a drug deal. . . . His carotid  artery got chopped off. He was bleeding to death. The paramedics did a great  job. They got him to us alive. . . . We fixed that artery. It was really an  exciting case. It was really neat to do. . . . But the next day he pulled the  tube out himself, realized he was OK, ripped out all of his equipment and just  disappeared. Now that was probably $5,000 worth of service to him that was  really expert service. . . . We didn't even get the satisfaction of him saying,  "Thanks, guys, you did a great job, and I appreciate it."  </P> <P> Q: Given who many of your trauma patients are -- drug dealers, gang members,  illegal aliens -- why should taxpayers, who ultimately foot the bill, either  through taxes or their own health insurance premiums, care whether the county's  trauma system works or not?  </P> <P> A: Because anyone at any time can become a trauma victim. There are basically  three ways you come to be a trauma patient. You are in an industrial accident  at work. . . . You are in an automobile accident or have a recreational  accident, skiing, hiking in the woods, whatever. . . . Or you get caught in  some civilian violence. That may be the Saturday night knife-and-gun club. But  you also may be the innocent victim of a mugging. You may simply be in the  wrong place at the wrong time, when some random shooting occurs. And that is  increasingly happening all over.  </P> <P> Q: What can be done to rebuild the system -- or at least to keep it from  deteriorating further?  </P> <P> A: What is ironic about this is, L.A. County has in place the facilities and  the people to have the best trauma program anywhere. . . . The problem is, it's  the only (county) in the U.S. where there aren't major bucks being pumped in. .  . . I don't know whose fault it is. But I do know what the solution is. . . .  If it was profitable to do trauma care, everybody would want to do it, and they  would do it better. But it's not profitable. We have made a social decision  we'd rather not pay taxes to support trauma care. . . . As it was conceived,  the L.A. County trauma system was super, but as it works out, it is a financial  disaster. . . . Hospital after hospital has dropped out. . . . Doctors, who  used to sue each other to get on emergency room panels because it was  prestigious and because they could build a practice that way, are now resigning  in droves simply because they aren't being paid.  </P> <P> Q: What about you? If conditions stay as they are, will you move on with the  rest of them?  </P> <P> A: I've certainly given it a lot of thought. . . . A lot of people are just  opting out of inner-city practice. They are going to work for Kaiser. They are  leaving L.A. and Southern California. They are limiting their practice to  varicose veins. . . . There are fewer than 1,000 specialty certified vascular  surgeons in this country, and there's a lot of openings for them in private  practice and in teaching programs. So it's getting attractive to look  elsewhere. . . . When I was a resident and didn't have to make a living and I  didn't have kids, it was exciting. Now I've done all those things. I don't need  to learn how any more. It's still interesting. It's satisfying to save  somebody's life occasionally or to do something good for somebody, even for  nothing. But then it cuts into your life so much. . . . You wonder if you  should keep doing it. . . . And we're seeing worse and worse types of  accidents. We're seeing a lot of drug-related stuff. We're seeing a lot of  HIV-positive patients. Anybody who is a drug abuser has a high-percentage  chance to be HIV positive. All these things sort of get into it. It's not  viable financially. It's less and less desirable socially. It's just starting  not to make sense.  </P></p>

Due to open in the summer, the China Academy for Research in  Reform will study ways to bring the Chinese economy into line  with international norms.    The State Commission for the Reform of the Economic  Structure  vice-minister, Wu Jie, will be the academy's first head.    Mr. Wu, 58, a leader of the liberal faction of the party and  a former vice-governor of Shanxi province, is the son of the  late vice-president Ulanfu.    Economic sources in Beijing said Mr. Wu was recruiting  senior  staff for the academy, which will be affiliated with the  commission.    They said Mr. Wu, who spent two years researching economics  and information technology in the United States, was mainly  looking for young academics and cadres with exposure to Western  economies.    The sources said while the academy was a ministerial-level  unit its operations and methodology would be different from  similar institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences  (CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).    "The new academy accepts funding and research grants from  foreign institutions and foundations and has reportedly  collected pledges of US$50 million (HK$385 million)," said a  social scientist close to the new institution.    "It may have a more liberal policy than either CAS or CASS  in  inviting Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas scholars to teach and do  research there."    Aside from economic reform, the academy will look into ways  to modernise the political structure, social policy, education  and culture. However, analysts in Beijing said it was unlikely  it would devote itself to studies of Western-style democratic  institutions.    They said the Research Institute for the Reform of the  Economic Structure was dissolved after the Tiananmen Square  crackdown because of its advocacy of political liberalisation.  The research institute was also a primary thinktank for ousted  party chief Zhao Ziyang.    Analysts said, however, that the new academy enjoyed the  backing of patriarch Deng Xiaoping, who earlier this year did  the Chinese calligraphy for its official plaque. The  establishment of the academy coincides with the decision by the  leadership to roll back those market reforms that would  exacerbate social problems.    It is understood that the liberal wing of the party,  including former associates of Mr. Zhao and the late party chief  Hu Yaobang, have backed the academy. Mr. Wu, who is tipped for  further promotion, and his associates have recently made trips  to the coastal areas to learn more about the prospects of market  reform.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Tories pay high political price for foreign donations - How the Conservative party raises money from industry has long been one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a special report, Peter Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland Adburgham and Robert Peston, unravels some aspects of the mystery / Overseas Donors One of the main features of Conservative party funding which has dogged the Tories in recent years is the role played by private foreign donors, believed to be the source of millions of pounds in secret contributions. The often rumoured total figure of Pounds 15m in the 1980s has never been officially confirmed and recent revised estimates by senior Tory sources suggest a figure less than half of this. Nevertheless, some foreign donors have become fugitives from British justice, causing political problems for the party. Their cases have increased parliamentary pressure for more transparency in political donations. Concern about donations to the Conservatives by Mr Asil Nadir, the former head of the collapsed Polly Peck empire who jumped bail, led to an inquiry by the Commons home affairs committee, which reported in April this year. The Conservative majority on the committee saw no advantage in changing the rules on political cash contributions, although Labour continues to call for a ban on overseas donations. Tory insiders say the 1980s saw Conservative fundraisers led by Lord McAlpine, the then party treasurer, diversify from traditional supporters to more newly rich individuals who wanted to be accepted as part of the establishment. For years the identity of some foreign donors and the precise sums involved remained well out of the public gaze. UK registered companies are required by law to declare substantial political donations but the role played by offshore companies and individual donors was known only to a small group of senior Tories. Only in the early 1990s, after the ousting of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher as leader, did the party find itself having to field searching questions from parliament and the media about hidden donations. In September 1991 the party was challenged to disclose the extent of its dependence on 'foreign funds' by leading Labour MPs - Mr Jack Cunningham, Mr Gordon Brown, Mr Frank Dobson, and Mr Tony Blair, now party leader. In the following month it faced a further barrage from the Charter Movement, an internal Conservative party pressure group which said: 'Central Office is desperately looking for subsidies from almost any source, including foreign 'supporters'. We don't know what Central Office has to concede in return for this money, but we can be absolutely sure that the interests of party democracy are not enhanced.' While on a visit to Hong Kong in 1991 Mr John Major was widely criticised in the press for attending, while on government rather than party business, a dinner at which local businessmen were being asked by local supporters to contribute to the party. One of the first big donors to be publicly identified through a leak from inside the party to the press was Mr John Latsis, the Greek shipping billionaire who is thought to have contributed Pounds 2m to the Conservatives when Baroness Thatcher was prime minister. He used to send her bunches of flowers. A senior Tory confirmed: 'He was one of our biggest donors during the 1980s.' While unwilling to put a precise figure on the sums received, he recalled how Mr Latsis once wrote out two cheques for contributions of Pounds 200,000 each in less than two weeks. Tory insiders confirm that Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong millionaire and a former business associate of Mr Mark Thatcher, Lady Thatcher's son, was another significant foreign donor. He is thought to have contributed Pounds 500,000 after being approached by senior British business figures with interests in Hong Kong, including Mr John 'Algie' Cluff, the oil magnate. The Tory party's Hong Kong financial connection has continued with the involvement of Mr David Davies, the chairman of Johnson Matthey, the metals group, who is in charge of the party's overseas fundraising efforts. Mr Davies has many connections in the Hong Kong business community. In the past two years the Tory party has been hit by revelations that two fugitives from British justice, Mr Nadir and Mr Octav Botnar, the former head of Nissan UK, had contributed at least Pounds 440,000 and Pounds 1m respectively. One minister, Mr Michael Mates, resigned from the government in June last year over his links with Mr Nadir. A few weeks ago it was Mr Mohamed Fayed, the Harrods chief, who embarrassed the Tories by revealing that he had given a total of Pounds 250,000 in the mid-1980s when the government was being lobbied by his arch rival, the then Lonrho chief Mr Tiny Rowland, over Mr Fayed's purchase of Harrods.</p>

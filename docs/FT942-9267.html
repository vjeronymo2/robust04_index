			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Technology: Healthcare's Holy Grail - Technically Speaking Pharmaceutical companies have a problem: their customers want value for money. This would be taken for granted in other industries. But it is news to the drugs sector because not long ago, doctors decided which pills to prescribe and someone else paid without question. Now, those who do pay - governments, employers paying health insurance premiums, and insurance companies paying drug companies - are flexing their muscles and pushing down drugs' profit margins. The industry's solution so far has been to pour billions of dollars into buying health management organisations and pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen of the business. Last summer, Merck paid Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.10bn) for Medco; earlier this month, SmithKline Beecham paid Dollars 2.3bn for Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services. Other companies such as Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb have preferred alliances to takeovers, but the intention is similar: to force the middlemen to promote a narrow range of products. Such an approach would be doomed to fail in most other industries. Which kind of insurance broker would you prefer to deal with: one that peddled one company's products, or one that could offer the best product for your circumstances? It is not easy for the drugs industry to convince customers that it is offering good value. Once, the sales pitch discussed safety and effectiveness, and clinical trial results provided the facts. Now, the buyer wants to know whether the deal is good, but there is no reliable body of economic data. Everyone recognises that there is more to a good deal than price. One anaesthetic may be cheaper than another, but if it takes longer for the patient to recover from the operation, the extra cost of an overnight stay outweighs the saving on the drugs bill. According to Jan Leschly, the new chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, providing the right kind of healthcare for 'managing' diseases is better than curing them. But disease management relies on a firm knowledge of health economics. What are the patterns of drug use and the costs of different levels of treatment? How and why do hospitals and doctors vary in their costs per patient, per disease type and a host of other measures? Some of this information is in the hands of drugs companies. Much more is held by, for example, health insurers. Like all insurers, they need to know actuarial and demographic figures to charge competitive premiums that return a profit. Pharmacies, too, have information that the drugs companies do not. Dispensing data could be valuable to a drugs maker in the way that point of sales data from a supermarket is useful to a soap powder manufacturer: rapid feedback of the level of demand helps in the management of any manufacturing business. Then there are other drugs companies which, in the right alliances, could exchange information with partners. If any one big drugs company could combine these information sources, it would have the building blocks for a sales pitch that was as convincing economically as clinical trials are for safety and effectiveness. At the same time, it could avoid the accusation that customers were forced to buy its pills simply because the middleman was pushing them. It could offer doctors, hospitals, employers and governments the real holy grail of healthcare reform: a treatment that was rational in terms of safety, effectiveness and cost. Of the large pharmaceutical companies, Glaxo is one of the few yet to make public its strategy. It has plenty of cash, a distaste for takeovers and an image of itself as the world's foremost drugs company. Whichever company succeeded in pulling off alliances to exchange information could claim to have leapfrogged its rivals. It would offer customers what they wanted - a recipe for success in any business.</p>

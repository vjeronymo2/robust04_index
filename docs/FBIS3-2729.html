			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor, and Shiny Li in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Executive Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji's tax reform  program has suffered a major setback as opposition forces have  succeeded in partly stretching the timetable of the ambitious  policy under the excuse of maintaining social stability.    State-run large and medium-sized enterprises were given  preferential treatment by having the rate for unified corporate  tax reduced, while the most controversial value added tax (VAT)  on land and property was expected to be delayed, Chinese sources  said. The unified corporate tax introduced at the beginning of  this year stipulates that all firms in China should contribute  33 percent of their earnings to the state coffers without any  exception. The state regulations on the implementation of value  added tax on land and property is scheduled to be published next  month.    However, the most controversial tax reform package in more  than four decades of the communist rule in China has met strong  opposition from the central planners and the business community,  especially business people from the fastgrowing southeast  regions. Chinese sources said both central planners and  reformist regional officials joined hands to block the reform,  although they stood on quite a different ground.    In his government work report presented to the second  plenary  session of the Eighth National People's Congress yesterday,  Premier Li Peng apparently sidestepped the implementation of the  reform policy and failed to report on the timetable to introduce  the VAT on land and property sales. Mr Li mentioned that the  government was to introduce the tax reform package, but failed  to detail implementation of the fundamental restructuring  program in China. The government would "reform the tax system,  institute a turnover tax with value added tax as the main  component, introduce a uniform income tax on domestically funded  enterprises," Mr Li said in the report. This was the only  account on the tax reform.    "Mr Li apparently gave himself room for amending the reform  package and adjust the timetable for implementation," a Chinese  economist said.    Obviously due to the pressures from the coastal regions,  especially the special economic zones and coastal open cities in  which foreign-funded firms have been enjoying tax exemption and  holidays, Mr Li applied the uniform corporate tax only to  domestic firms. Initially, the uniform corporate tax would  apply to all firms no matter what status they enjoyed.    Central planners represented by Mr Li and his deputy and  former planning minister Zou Jiahua wanted to give state-run  firms better treatment, such as a lower tax rate or holiday,  while coastal officials hoped to keep their preferential status  to woo overseas investors, China analysts said. Despite having  different targets in mind, both camps joined hands to block the  reform package. Chinese sources said central planners had  worked out measures to reduce tax rates for loss-running state  firms.    Late last month, a central document jointly issued by State  Commission for Restructuring the Economy and the State Planning  Commission said some state firms with poorer performance or  lower profits would be given a lower rate of 27 and 18 percent  in the corporate tax. This would be within a two-year period as  a transitional measure to the 33 percent uniform corporate tax.  Some enterprises would have tax rebate for those reduced tax  payment until the end of 1993, if they obtained approval by  governments at the provincial level and were examined by the  Finance Ministry and State Administration for Taxation. For the  sake of supporting old state-run industries, the document said  they would not be asked to submit after-tax profits, provided  the central department approved.    The document also rolled back a reform policy on investment  to allow direct investment in enterprises by the government.  "Central and regional governments would inject more capital  into those firms listed by allowing financial injection by the  government instead of loans from banks in a move to increase the  firm's capital," Chinese sources quoted the document as saying.    However, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli yesterday sidestepped  rumours that Beijing was to delay the VAT on land and property.  "I have not learnt such a message so far," Mr Liu said.  "However, all regulations and decrees issued by the State  Council should be implemented. The state regulation on the  implementation of value added tax is being worked out now," he  said. Mr Liu's remark apparently confirmed the implementation  of the policy, originally scheduled for the beginning of next  month, would very likely be delayed.</p>

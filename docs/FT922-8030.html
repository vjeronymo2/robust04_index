			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sun shines on solar power Solar photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to electricity, could provide an unlimited supply of non-polluting energy. Sharp, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, has developed an improved single crystal solar PV cell with a conversion efficiency of 22 per cent, the first high-efficiency device of its type capable of being mass-produced. The new solar cell results from improvements to the reflective back surface of the cell. They improve the reflectivity of the surface to 90 per cent and reduce the loss of electrons generated when sunlight is absorbed by the silicon substrate. Sharp: Japan, 06 625 3007.</p>

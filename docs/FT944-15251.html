			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lucas closes brake foundry Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace components manufacturer, said yesterday that Eurofonderie, its braking foundry, is to cease operations in Gembloux, Belgium. The cost of the move, which forms part of the restructuring of the group's braking businesses, will be covered by past provisions. The foundry currently employs 255 people. Lucas said the operation was of 'insufficient scale to compete effectively against the world class foundries'.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DAMEWORTH SETS PACE FOR THE NATION'S BEST  </P> <P> Winning. The word has become synonymous with Agoura High distance runner Bryan  Dameworth. In fact, the last time Dameworth lost a race was in the state track  and field championships last June when he finished second to David Welsh of  Sacramento Jesuit in the 3,200-meter final.  </P> <P> Less than two months after conquering the nation's finest high school  cross-country runners in the Kinney national championships, Dameworth, a  senior, took his enviable record to the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden  in New York City.  </P> <P> The surroundings might have been unfamiliar but not the result. Overcoming a  case of nerves and a shaky start, Dameworth won the high school mile Friday in  4 minutes 14.52 seconds.  </P> <P> "Basically, when the gun went off, it was like 'Whoa,' " said the 6-foot-3,  163-pound Dameworth, who surged into the lead with 640 yards remaining. "It  took a while to get into the groove."  </P> <P> Dameworth defeated a field that included runner-up Martin Keino (4:16.63), a  senior at Fork Union (Va.) Military Academy and the son of former Olympic  champion Kip Keino of Kenya.  </P> <P> It was also win No. 2 indoors for Dameworth, who captured the same event  (4:17.77) in the prestigious Sunkist Invitational on Jan. 19 at the Sports  Arena.  </P> <P> There he outdistanced Keino (who finished third in 4:18.78) and Somalian Jama  Bile (fifth, 4:19.37), younger brother of Abdi, the 1987 world champion at  1,500 meters.  </P> <P> But the competition on the track took a back seat for Dameworth, who had other  concerns about visiting the Big Apple on his first trip to the East Coast.  </P> <P> "I was making sure I didn't get killed or anything," he said.  </P> <P> While Dameworth was watching his back, Agoura Coach Bill Duley was at home in  Calabasas thinking about being with his stepson.  </P> <P> "I stayed home and wondered and waited for the phone call (providing the  results of Dameworth's race)," Duley said. "I was fine until about an hour  before his race, then I really wanted to be there."  </P></p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Midlands Electricity at top endof City forecasts with Pounds 195m Midlands Electricity yesterday reported pre-tax profits at the top end of City forecasts for the 12 months ended March 31. On turnover slightly lower at Pounds 1.42bn (Pounds 1.54bn) the pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 167.1m to Pounds 195.4m. The performance was helped by a 2.7 per cent increase in units distributed, double the average national increase, and a reduction in the staff of its regulated businesses by 424 people, or 7.5 per cent of the total. The regulated distribution business turned in profits of Pounds 142m (Pounds 144.3m) after Pounds 20.8m of restructuring costs. The supply business reported profits of Pounds 33.4m (Pounds 18.8m) after a Pounds 4.2m charge. Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman, said he expected the review of the recs' distribution to be tough and he could not forecast what dividends the company could pay out in future years. The company swung from net debt of Pounds 6m in March 1993 to net cash of Pounds 167.3m at the latest year end. Unlike most other recs it owes no money to the government. Earnings per share rose to 65.2p (55.8p) and a final dividend of 15.55p lifts the total by 16 per cent to 23.2p. The company will seek shareholder approval at its annual meeting to buy back up to 10 per cent of its own shares. COMMENT Shareholders might have been surprised at a Pounds 2m fall in distribution profits to Pounds 142m but there is no need for alarm. Midlands is one of the few companies which has chosen not to collect its full entitlement from consumers under the price controls. That means there is a Pounds 10.8m under-recovery in distribution, rising to perhaps double that by the end of this year. If things get nasty with the regulator, Midlands could claw that back. Similarly, the supply under-recovery is likely to be about Pounds 15m by the year-end. The Pounds 195m headline profit is also depressed by the decision to make a Pounds 25m provision for restructuring costs. In addition, the company has Pounds 12.5m salted away to cope with potential problems over pensions which may never be needed. The market is perhaps a little nervous about Midlands' expansion abroad and about the effect of the regulatory review on the sector. But the shares, up 23p to 575p yesterday, are trading on a prospective yield of 5.8 per cent assuming a dividend of 26.4p this year, and look underpriced compared to other regional companies.</p>

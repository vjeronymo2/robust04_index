[Basyuni] Good morning.    [Abu-al-Majd] The timing of Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa's  visit to Israel is significant. It is part of extensive  Egyptian activity to promote the Middle East peace process and  coincides with the start of Arab-Israel talks in Washington.  What were the results of this visit?    [Basyuni] Actually it was a successful visit, during which  all the outstanding problems concerning the borders, crossing  points, the area of Jericho, security arrangements and movement  on the roads in Gaza were reviewed.    [Abu-al-Majd] Specifically, was there any response from  Israel on meeting the Palestinians' demands as far as these  issues are concerned?    [Basyuni] There is response from both sides, because both  are  doing their best to overcome the difficulties. Thus, there is a  mutual desire to reach an agreement. It is not an easy problem.  The path is not strewn with roses, but is full of problems. But  with effort, perseverance, and mutual desire, Egypt is trying to  reach solutions satisfactory to both sides. The problem has  persisted for a very long time, and we are trying to find a  solution to it so that we can start implementing the agreement  and begin the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Then, the  Palestinian authorities can begin to assume power on the ground.    [Abu-al-Majd] Minister Musa naturally has brought back  Israel's views to convey to President Mubarak and the  Palestinian leadership...    [Basyuni, interrupting] Minister Musa has managed to bring  the views closer over the crossing points themselves and the  procedures to be followed there, while maintaining the dignity  of the Palestinians passing through them. He discussed very  minute and complicated details and tried to solve these  problems; he discussed the best way to cross, and how to  increase the area of Jericho as much as possible. All these  issues were discussed in detail by Minister Musa.    [Abu-al-Majd] You said Minister Musa was successful in his  discussions of these issues. What tangible effect this will  have?    [Basyuni] Both sides accept the Egyptian views. As you know,  we are not negotiating on behalf of the Palestinians or  Israelis. We are trying to bridge the gap in views, offer new  ideas, and use our past negotiating, security, and  administration experience to give advice and try to overcome the  problems in a bid to achieve the desired goal. As for the talks  themselves, president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres will resume them in Switzerland on Saturday night  [29 January].    [Abu-al-Majd] Let us move to the Israeli-Syrian track and  Rabin's proposal to hold a referendum on withdrawal from the  Golan. How do the Israeli parliamentarians and ordinary people  view this proposal?    [Basyuni] Actually I do not want to interfere in Israel's  internal affairs or political map. I will give you my own  personal views. Proposing a referendum is very shrewd. The  objective is to gain the support of those who object to a  withdrawal from the Golan, whether they are from the ruling  coalition or the opposition. Concerning the ruling coalition,  there are approximately seven Labor MK's [Knesset members] who  object to full withdrawal from the Golan. There are also six  MK's from the Shas religious movement who back the government  but are not part of it.    Rabin said that should an agreement involving a major  withdrawal from the Golan or abandonment of settlements be  reached, he would opt for a referendum. This means that Prime  Minister Rabin intends to take steps and make decisions that go  far beyond the Labor Party's electoral program. Thus, his  promising a referendum indicates that the decisions he is about  to make will far exceed the electoral program. In such a case,  the opposition cannot continue to object to a full withdrawal  from the Golan until an agreement is reached, because Mr. Rabin  promised he would opt for a referendum if an agreement involving  a substantial withdrawal from the Golan is reached [sentence as  heard].    I believe that if an agreement is reached, it will be a  package deal based on a comprehensive solution. By this I mean  that it will not be an agreement with Syria alone, but there  will also be an agreement with Lebanon, Jordan, as well as on  full self-rule for the Palestinians. Thus, Israeli citizens  will be voting in a referendum on a comprehensive peace deal --  full peace with Syria, with Jordan, with Lebanon, and full  self-rule, as well as mutually acceptable security arrangements  in exchange for their full withdrawal from the Golan and the  other occupied Arab territories.</p>

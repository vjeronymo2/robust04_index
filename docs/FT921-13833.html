			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Lender to help on home arrears THE MORTGAGE Corporation yesterday became the first centralised mortgage lender to offer customers with mortgage arrears the chance to avoid losing their homes by becoming tenants. TMC, the UK mortgage arm of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, is to rescue 150 homes by launching a Pounds 15m Business Expansion Scheme in a joint venture with Smith &amp; Williamson Securities. It said the scheme would enable some of its most hard-pressed borrowers to stay in their homes for a rent well below their monthly mortgage payments. They may be offered the chance to buy back their homes at the end of the assured tenancy period if their circumstances have improved. Otherwise TMC will buy back the properties at the end of five years at a price calculated to give investors in the business expansion scheme a return of 137p on each 100p share before tax relief. Customers of the centralised lenders - the specialist mortgage companies with no branch networks which entered the mortgage markets during the 1980s housing boom - have been among those with the worst arrears and repossession problems. Other lenders came up with more than Pounds 800m for schemes to help their borrowers avoid losing their homes as a result of talks with the government late last year, but the centralised lenders were unable to follow suit because of legal and practical difficulties. TMC said yesterday it is talking to housing associations to see whether repossessed properties can be rented to homeless families.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Ulster peace 'only by political deal' Peace in Northern Ireland can only come through a political settlement, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, warned yesterday, as wrangling continued between London and Dublin over the pace of the peace process. Speculation mounted that the Anglo-Irish summit might be put back from the December 3 date favoured by Dublin after Downing Street gave its clearest hint yet that more time may be needed to set the framework for a settlement. Officials sought to lower expectations of the Dublin meeting and said much work on any draft communique was still to be done. Detailed British proposals for a new accord to replace the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement fall far short of Dublin's call for a significant element of joint responsibility in the administration of the province, while recognising Dublin's aspirations to a united Ireland. In London, Lord Tebbit, the former Tory cabinet minister, sought to pour more cold water on the Major-Reynolds initiative, telling an audience of Tory rightwingers that the IRA would only lay down its arms for a deal that undermined 'the union of Ulster within the United Kingdom'. 'So unless there is a willingness somewhere within government to undermine that union . . . I find it difficult to understand why those in authority speak of the prospects for peace,' he said. The Irish government would not be satisfied with anything that did not 'advance the cause of the alternative union - that of a united Ireland'. In Belfast Sir Patrick denied that differences between London and Dublin were widening. He said the people of Northern Ireland were 'longing for an end of violence and they are longing for a political settlement that will enable people in this divided community to live more tranquilly together'. His remarks came a day after Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, stressed in a television interview the possibility of achieving peace before a political settlement. The Army confirmed yesterday that many soldiers in Northern Ireland have abandoned helmets in favour of berets as part of a policy to 'soften' their public image.</p>

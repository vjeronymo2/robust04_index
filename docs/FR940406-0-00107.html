			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is important that nozzles used in the design and testing of ORVR-equipped vehicles be similar to those found in use. Should this committee reach consensus on fuel nozzle geometry specifications, EPA will use a nozzle meeting this standard in all refueling emissions compliance testing, if the nozzle manufacturers agree to adopt these specifications for future retail and commercial fuel nozzles and the auto manufacturers design their ORVR systems to accommodate a nozzle with this geometry. If no standard is developed for nozzle geometry or if the above agreements cannot be reached, EPA will use any commercially available nozzle in its testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Level of the Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule adopts a refueling test standard of 0.20 grams of hydrocarbon emissions per gallon (g/gal) of fuel pumped (0.053 g/liter). This standard applies to all vehicle classes covered by this rule and covers the full useful life. Setting the standard at this level ensures that the standard that meets the statutory requirement to provide a minimum emission capture efficiency of 95 percent, as discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The August 1987 NPRM included a proposed refueling emission standard of 0.10 g/gal (0.026 g/liter) of fuel pumped, which at that time represented about a 98 percent emissions reduction from uncontrolled levels. Subsequently, the 1990 CAAA called for a refueling emission standard representing at least a 95 percent reduction over uncontrolled levels. EPA determined that this reduction corresponds to a standard of about 0.25 g/gal (0.066 g/liter) and requested comment in the May 1993 notice on the setting of a standard in the 0.10 to 0.25 g/gal range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers supported a standard of 0.20 g/gal, arguing that this standard would satisfy the CAA minimum requirement while providing for full useful life compliance and design flexibility. API and other commenters felt that a standard providing a 98 percent level of control is justified based on demonstrated and cost effective technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After analyzing the comments and the projected in-use emission impacts, EPA has selected a standard of 0.20 g/gal. This standard was chosen because it meets or exceeds the statutory minimum requirement and, since it is representative of most refueling situations reasonably likely to occur (Cf  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Edison Electric Institute <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 2F.3J 438, 446&hyph;47 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). At the same time, it meets the manufacturers' need for adequate design margin and flexibility. As is discussed in the Summary and Analysis of Comments, the nature of the canister-based control technology is such that setting the standard at a lower level would not be expected to achieve additional emission reductions in use. Systems will need to be designed for essentially zero emissions, with the standard providing an allowance for vehicle and test variability. It may also enhance the use of liquid fillneck seals which are projected to have lower costs, good in-use performance, and present no safety concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Safety of ORVR Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 202(a)(6) of the 1990 CAA Amendments (as well as its predecessor provision) requires EPA to consult with the Secretary of Transportation regarding the safety of vehicle-based (ORVR) systems for the control of vehicle refueling emissions. EPA began this consultation in the Spring of 1986, prior to the NPRM, and the consultation has continued throughout the various stages of this rulemaking. DoT was represented by NHTSA throughout this process. A record of this consultation and the various analyses conducted by EPA and NHTSA to assess the safety issue is available in the public docket and is discussed in the April 15, 1992  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice regarding ORVR controls (57 FR 13220). Early in the consultation process, NHTSA raised concerns about the safety of ORVR canister systems, and throughout the various stages of the rulemaking, safety has been a central issue in the public comments and in the deliberations on the ORVR rulemaking. Unresolved concerns regarding the safety of ORVR canister systems (at least relative to Stage II systems) delayed promulgation of the NPRM prior to the 1990 CAAAs and, in April 1992, led EPA to decide not to require ORVR controls at that time. Given the concerns raised about vehicle safety, it is important to address the potential safety concerns as part of the implementation of the ORVR requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Test Procedure/Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The safety comments regarding ORVR canister systems focused primarily on the concern that ORVR systems would increase fuel system complexity and that this would create vehicle safety risks. Many manufacturers' comments on the NPRM indicated that the test procedure, as proposed in 1987, would force the use of non-integrated (separate) systems for refueling and evaporative emissions control. They characterized these systems as making the fuel vapor control system more complex than current evaporative control systems, thus creating the potential for a safety risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

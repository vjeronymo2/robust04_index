			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Pillar follows debut with a Pounds 60m spending spree Pillar Property Investments, which started trading only eight days ago, has lined up Pounds 60m of acquisitions including a Northampton shopping centre and the office complex that houses the Mermaid Theatre, in London's Blackfriars district. The deals are symptomatic of a management which built up Arlington Securities - acquired by British Aerospace in 1989 - and came into Pillar in May with the aim of transforming it into an active property investment and development group. Pillar is paying Pounds 28.5m to Provident Mutual for the 254,000 sq ft Weston Favell Shopping Centre, which will be partially redeveloped. However, the Provident Mutual can withdraw if Pillar does not also complete the purchase of the Blackfriars properties by August 26 for about Pounds 30m. Pillar would acquire the long lease on two office blocks at Numbers 1 and 2 Puddle Dock, occupied by KPMG Peat Marwick and Touche Remnant. It would also buy a sub-lease over the Mermaid Theatre. Mr Raymond Mould, Pillar's chairman, said: 'It would offer us a good income stream, a good location, and the scope for a major redevelopment.' He was confident that the deal would be signed this week. Redevelopment of Puddle Dock would be complicated by the Mermaid Theatre. The City of London holds the freehold interest in the properties, while Gomba Holdings, owned by the Shamji family, has a long-term 'pepper-corn lease' on the Mermaid. Mr Mould said Pillar had the option to redevelop on top of the existing theatre. It could also reach an arrangement with the Shamji family and the City of London, probably involving relocation of the unoccupied Mermaid. The site is on the fringe of the City and would have to compete for tenants with other redevelopment projects, including Greycoat's Paternoster project in St Paul's. The shopping project is being injected into Pillar's Pounds 250m joint-venture retail property fund with Canada's largest public pension fund, Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Appeal by the Union of Democratic Forces National </F> Coordinating Council: "Blue Coalition Appeals for Joint Actions  by All Democratic Organizations"; issued at meeting on 21 June]    [Text] After the people's vote of October 1991 was  distorted and after the exhaustion of the possibilities of the  parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS],  which was forced to become an opposition force and which for 18  months has defended the positions of the SDS, the SDS no longer  finds any reason for its parliamentary faction to participate in  the work of this parliament. With its actions the parliamentary  majority is destroying the notion of parliamentarianism,  democracy, and constitutionalism, and alienates Bulgarian  citizens from participating in political life.    The SDS warns of the danger of turning the Bulgarian  parliament, controlled by the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]  and its satellites, into a machine for recommunizing the country  and returning to the methods of the communist dictatorship which  existed for 50 years.    The pro-communist government of irresponsibility has caused  mass poverty, raging crime, and moral deterioration, and has  brought Bulgaria to the brink of a catastrophe. Lyuben Berov's  cabinet has displayed extremely unworthy political behavior,  which has compromised the basic principles of democracy.    In this fateful situation the only solution for Bulgaria is  in holding early parliamentary elections in the autumn of 1994.  These elections will give a clear four-year mandate to a worthy  political force, which will assume responsibility for  stabilizing and reviving Bulgaria, which is in a grave economic  and moral crisis.    The SDS refuses to participate in political haggling or in  forming a new cabinet within the framework of this parliament.    The SDS calls upon all the other political forces and  parliamentary factions who declared their readiness to support  early parliamentary elections to declare their clear refusal to  support Lyuben Berov's cabinet, and participate in or support  forming a new cabinet.    The SDS will continue to boycott the parliamentary sessions  until the moment the National Assembly demonstrates a clear  willingness to call early elections in the autumn.    The SDS is prepared to face the voters and assume  responsibility for saving the country.    We call upon all democratic forces that share the SDS's  principles and policy documents to carry out joint actions to  save Bulgaria.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> JURORS SELECTED IN HASENFUS CASE  </P> <P> A jury in Miami was selected to decide a lawsuit that blames retired Air Force  Major Gen. Richard V. Secord and a CIA-linked airline for the 1986 plane crash  in Nicaragua that helped trigger the Iran-Contra probe. Cargo handler Eugene  Hasenfus, who was captured and held for about three months after Nicaraguan  troops shot down the plane, and the family of the plane's co-pilot, Wallace  Sawyer Jr., contend in the suit that Secord and Miami-based Southern Air  Transport used unsafe aircraft in the Contra resupply effort.  </P></p>

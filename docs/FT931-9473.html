			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Schering-Plough plans further stock repurchase SCHERING-PLOUGH, the US drugs and healthcare products company, has authorised the repurchase of an additional Dollars 500m of its common shares. The buy-back is being made 'because current market conditions make the stock a good value'. It will be funded through existing cash balances and operating cash flow. A previously-authorised buy-back of Dollars 1bn is 97 per cent complete. The news prompted Moody's Investors Service, the US ratings agency, to cut the group's long-term debt ratings. Moody's said the extended repurchase programme 'will further reduce liquidity and raise leverage'. 'Schering-Plough has historically maintained large cash balances relative to debt, but share repurchases are substantially eroding the cushion.' Standard &amp; Poor's, another US ratings agency, yesterday affirmed its rating on Schering-Plough.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Comalco studies sale of US unit Comalco, the Australian aluminium producer controlled by the CRA mining group, is considering selling a 100 per cent holding in Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation, its Kentucky-based aluminium products operation, through a public flotation in the US. The Australian company said yesterday it had filed a prospectus with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, although it stressed it would not make a final decision until February. In the prospectus, Comalco said it was looking at selling 10m shares, with underwriters' over-allotment options comprising a further 1.5m. The indicated price is USDollars 23.75. Although there is no guarantee that this will be the actual price at which the shares are sold, it indicates a potential stock market valuation for CAC of about Dollars 270m. Comalco acquired the US operations from Martin Marietta, the defence group, almost a decade ago. CAC, which takes in aluminium rolling and recycling facilities in Lewisport, Kentucky, has remained a separate entity within the Comalco group of operations. According to Comalco's last annual report, CAC made a small loss in 1993, in spite of achieved record production and sales levels, with the latter figure standing at ADollars 607.9m (USDollars 471.9m), up from ADollars 544m in the previous year. The deficit was blamed on overcapacity in the US rolled products market, and in August this year, Comalco noted that its subsidiary had returned to profit on the back of higher average selling prices and continued volume increases. Although it said that price increases at that stage had only covered the increases in input metal costs, it suggested that market demand would remain strong. A cold rolling plant upgrade, due for completion in early 1995, should also expand capacity. Shares in CRA, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, rose 34 cents to ADollars 18.16 after its Hamersley Iron subsidiary said it had negotiated price rises for iron ore supplied to Japanese steel mills for 1995-96, in the annual round of contract negotiations. Prices for lump ore will rise by 7.9 per cent to 35.89 US cents per dry long ton unit. The price for fines by 5.8 per cent to 27.15 cents.</p>

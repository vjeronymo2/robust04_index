			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Let the Other Side State Its Point </F> of View"]    [Text] Vladimir Tolstikov, president of the Russian Society  for Friendship and Cultural Cooperation With the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea, sent a message to Russian Federation  President Boris Yeltsin stating that "it has become clear from  press reports that during your meeting with South Korean  President Kim Yong-sam it is proposed to discuss the so-called  nuclear issue in North Korea. Considering the results of the  South Korean leader's recent travels, we can assume that he  views discussion of this issue as one of the main objectives of  his visit to Russia. The results of his recent trips to Japan  and China also show that the essence of the 'nuclear issue in  North Korea,' exaggerated by the South Koreans in the footsteps  of their transoceanic patrons, amounts to an attempt to slander  and discredit the DPRK and then try to crush and destroy it. The  Russian Society for Friendship and Cultural Cooperation With the  DPRK expresses serious alarm and the fear that the South Korean  visitor will succeed in finding supporters in Russia for his  unprecedentedly impudent claims. The DPRK is our sovereign ally.  Therefore, if there truly were a need to officially discuss 'the  nuclear issue in North Korea,' it would be entirely natural to  invite Kim Il-song, president of the DPRK, to participate in  such a discussion. This is a truth not requiring any special  proof and falling within the realm of ordinary international  practice. The ancient Greeks had an immutable rule: 'Let the  other side state its point of view.' The Russian Society for  Friendship and Cultural Cooperation With the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea earnestly asks you, esteemed Boris  Nikolayevich, to take these considerations into account and see  to it that a state friendly to us--the DPRK--is not harmed for  many decades to come."</p>

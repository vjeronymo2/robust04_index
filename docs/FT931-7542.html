			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Doleful days for young jobless: Fears that an 'underclass' is being created LAST YEAR 20-year-old Diana Blackwood was unemployed and frustrated. 'I kept thinking there is some job out there I could be doing - how do I set about doing it? Is it my lack of qualifications or what?' The 18-24 age group which Ms Blackwood falls into showed one of the highest increases in long-term joblessness, although Ms Blackwood, a single parent, has just come off the register because she has gone on a childcare training scheme. Long-term unemployment among 18-19-year-olds rose by 51 per cent in the year to January, while for the 18-24 age group as a whole the increase was 42.5 per cent. The overall increase was 38 per cent. The 18-24 age group is seen by the government and bodies including the Confederation of British Industry as probably the most vulnerable among the long-term unemployed. They believe that new initiatives must be aimed at them. One of the options is compulsory training or work experience. Many, however, finish Youth Training, the main scheme for 16-18-year-olds, with no qualifications. The scheme has a deteriorating record of getting people into jobs - from a peak of 68 per cent in 1989 to about 50 per cent now. Providers of training say many long-term unemployed in this age group have failed to benefit from school or training. Mr John Philpott, of the Employment Policy Institute, an independent think tank, said: 'Around a fifth of the long-term unemployed are between 18 and 24, many of whom have not worked at all or only irregularly. Yet this is precisely the group in whom the habit of work needs to be instilled if they are to become active citizens. There is a clear danger that many such individuals may be lost permanently from the labour market if nothing is done to change their situation.' Mr Philpott says economists see this age group as the best-placed to get a job when the recession ends - but he argues that it is also the age group most susceptible to becoming a British 'underclass'. Eighteen is the peak age for male offenders, although those dealing with young offenders say there are no direct causal links between crime and long-term unemployment. However, Ms Vivien Stern, director of the National Association for Care and Resettlement of Offenders, says: 'Studies in the US suggest that unemployment has consequences that lead to the loosening of the social controls that prevent crime.' These include a decline in loyalty, family pressures, respect for other people and in hope. Ms Blackwood said: 'Most of my friends are on the dole. They know it's really difficult to get a job and some of them cannot be bothered to fight for one.'</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Reactions to Danish veto BELGIUM Mr Willy Claes, the foreign minister, regretted what he called 'the very slightly negative result of the Danish referendum.' Belgium, he said, 'remains committed to pursue, with its European partners, the direction indicated by the Maastricht treaty.' Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, said: 'We will just have to sit down and see what we do now.' Coincidentally, parliament yesterday began its ratification procedure of the treaty. DENMARK Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, said Denmark would seek to renegotiate parts of the Maastricht treaty but was not optimistic about the reaction of its European Community partners. He said he would raise the issue at an EC foreign ministers meeting in Oslo today. Mr Ellemann-Jensen also described the idea of a United States of Europe as nothing more than a 'beautiful dream' which could not be realised. FRANCE President Francois Mitterrand, a driving force behind the Maastricht treaty, announced that France would hold a referendum on the pact. He said, however, that there was no need to renegotiate the treaty because of its rejection in Denmark. 'Eleven of us will do what twelve cannot,' he was quoted as saying by government spokesman Martin Malvy. 'Renegotiating the treaty is not necessary at all.' GERMANY Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, regretted the Danish vote and said that other European Community states must press on with ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister and a leading figure in forging the treaty, said it might be possible to offer Denmark special treatment similar to the United Kingdom's opt-out clause relating to the treaty's social provisions. GREECE The Greek parliament, where the pro-European conservative government holds only a slim majority, has yet to set a date for debate on the Maastricht treaty. Greeks are overwhelmingly in favour of European political and economic union, according to public opinion polls, but much depends on whether the government can build a consensus on the need to achieve economic convergence within the European Community. IRELAND The government confirmed that the country's referendum on the Maastricht treaty would go ahead as planned. 'There is no question of calling off the June 18 poll,' a spokesman said. Nevertheless, the government held emergency talks yesterday in the wake of the Danish vote, and the opposition Labour Party leader Mr Dick Spring was expected to support calls in parliament for a postponement to allow for the situation to be clarified. ITALY Mr Gianni De Michelis, the foreign minister, said that Italy was in principle opposed to the Danish request to renegotiate the Maastricht pact but was prepared to study the proposal. The office of Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti noted the Danish vote 'with regret' but said that Italy reaffirmed 'its firm determination to carry out new steps forward on the path of European construction according to the same lines traced at Maastricht.' LUXEMBOURG The government, which is expected to achieve parliamentary ratification of the Maastricht treaty after some strenuous debate over constitutional amendments, refrained from official reaction to the Danish vote. One serious uncertainty, however, is the position of the opposition Liberals, since a qualified parliamentary majority is needed, with at least three-quarters of all deputies present, and two-thirds voting in favour. NETHERLANDS The Dutch government quietly submitted the Maastricht treaty to parliament yesterday for ratification. 'It was just a coincidence that the treaty was submitted today,' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. The treaty, unlike in several other EC countries, has attracted little critical attention in the Netherlands. Parliament is to examine the treaty over the next few weeks but is expected to approve it in early August. PORTUGAL The Foreign Ministry said Portugal, which currently holds the presidency of the EC council of ministers, 'will evaluate with Denmark and the other EC partners the consequences' of the Danish vote. Sources in Lisbon said there were plans to convene a special meeting of EC foreign ministers in Oslo today. Parliament is expected to approve the treaty in the autumn, the country's ruling Social Democrats anticipating few problems. SPAIN Mr Carlos Westendorp, secretary of state for the EC, said: 'When a decision like this occurs, something is happening or, as Shakespeare would say: 'Something is rotten in the state of Denmark'.' The Spanish parliament is expected to approve the treaty in the autumn but, meanwhile, is waiting for a court decision on whether the country's constitution will have to be altered to allow foreigners to vote or to stand in local elections. UK Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd cautioned the EC against being rattled by the Danish vote. The British government, which takes over next month as president of the EC council of ministers, easily won preliminary ratification of the Maastricht treaty in parliament last month, but Mr Major yesterday postponed a further two-day debate in order to study the implications of the Danish rejection. He rejected calls for a referendum.</p>

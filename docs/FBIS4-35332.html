			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "Important Call" to Aden's population] </F>   [Text] To the steadfast and the patient in al-Mu'alla,  (?al-Sawahi), Shaykh 'Uthman, Khormaskar, and (?Kuraykar); to  the worthy unionists: The hour of salvation from the band of  treachery, treason, and machination -- the gang of apostasy and  secession commanded by the professional criminal, the killers of  women, children, and the elderly, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who, on 13  January, 1986 ascended to power on rivers of blood in Aden's  streets and the skulls of your fathers, brothers, and children  -- is drawing near.    Brothers and sisters in unionist Aden: The army of unity,  democracy, and constitutional legality now stands poised at the  approaches of the patient Aden to rid you of this tyrannical  coterie in the Socialist Party leadership and cleanse it of the  squalor of this mutinous gang that has been fiddling with the  city and its population, violating sacred values, appropriating  your freedom and rights, nationalizing your property, and  authorizing the shedding of the blood of your fathers, brothers,  and sisters.    To the worthy population of the proud city of Aden: Be the  red-hot spears of unity, democracy, and constitutional legality  that pierce the chests of the traitors, agents, and plotters of  the gang of apostasy and secession. Reach out to your brothers  and sons in the forces of unity and democracy and constitutional  legality, who are coming to you in response to your unionist and  patriotic appeal to be saved from this murderous gang that has  spread corruption and played havoc with the land and people and  hatched plots against your unity, security, stability, and  freedom that was restored to you by the young unitary state on  22 May, 1990, after you had been denied them for the 27-year  duration of the rule of this rotten gang that can only live in a  quagmire of repression, terror, agentry, conspiracy, sacrilege,  disregard for women's honor, and looting and confiscating  property.    Brother officers and soldiers of the military in our  precious  city of Aden: In unity lies your dignity, freedom, and  salvation from the cycle of revolutionary violence. Be the  first ranks of the soldiers of unity and democracy and  constitutional legality. Pound the strongholds of the murderous  gang in the city of Aden, and reduce them to rubble, because  this battle is your battle, this is your hour, and time is on  your side. Do not believe the ravings and hallucinations that  the gang of apostasy and secession has been spewing from Aden  radio since it took office 27 years ago.    Brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers, sons and  daughters  in our beloved Aden: The forces of unity, democracy, and  constitutional legality are jealous of your women's honor, your  blood, freedom, property, security, and stability, and dignity.  You are called upon to be the best support and guide for these  forces. Act as their seeing eye and their hand that hits the  remnants of the gang of apostasy and secession. Disgrace to the  forces of apostasy and secession; victory and glory to the  homeland, unity, and constitutional legality.</p>

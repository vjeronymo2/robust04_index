			<p>BFN     [Text] Bandung, REPUBLIKA -- The circulation of illegal  anti-Chinese pamphlets has irritated college students in  Bandung. They have expressed concern over allegations that  their campus is masterminding the circulation. "The growing  activities of Bandung college students have never degenerated  and will never degenerate into racism and anarchy," a joint  statement of the Bandung College Students Council said.    The Bandung college students have in fact been hit by the  allegations because the circulation of the illegal pamphlets  coincided with student demonstrations in the city over the  Bapindo case [Indonesian Development Bank credit scandal] which  was one of the focuses of the illegal pamphlets.    In the official statement, which was received by REPUBLIKA  on  Wednesday (8 June), they expressed concern over the circulation  of the illegal pamphlets. The statement was signed by the  general chairman of the Bandung Pedagogy College Students  Council, head of the External Affairs Division of the Pasundan  University Students Council, and president of the Bandung  Islamic University Students Council. Students of the Pasundan  University and the Bandung Islamic University have been the most  frequent demonstrators over the Bapindo case.    They said: "We are concerned over the situation and are  trying to study the current phenomenon while playing a role in  restoring racial harmony."    For them, the Eddy Tansil mammoth corruption case, in which  many senior state officials are implicated, has created a  prolonged conflict. In addition, the case has also triggered  racist moves and opinion. "Accordingly, we ask all interested  parties to immediately and fairly settle the extremely  destructive national case," concluded the statement.    Bandung has apparently become the source of illegal  pamphlets  and anti-Chinese rumors in recent weeks. Rumors that ethnic  Chinese-owned shops have been and will be destroyed have  surfaced several times.    Last Thursday, the chief of the West Java Provincial Police  said he knew about the pamphlets and was studying the case. In  the same week, copies of a letter warning the general public  against being provoked by misleading issues emerged. The letter  was handwritten and bore the unsealed name the Military District  Command 0618/BS.    The Bandung college students have in fact been determined to  continue demonstrations over the Bapindo case until Sudomo  [chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council chairman], Sumarlin  [chairman of the State Auditing Board], and Nasruddin  Sumintapura [member of the Supreme Advisory Council] are tried.  The determination angered Major General Muzani Syukur,  commander of the Siliwangi Third Military Region Command, who  later issued a ban on street demonstrations.    Anti-Chinese illegal pamphlets subsequently spread during  the  murky situation in which citizens were urged to take to the  streets on Sunday (5 June). Armed Forces Commander General  Feisal Tanjung said in Jakarta on Tuesday (7 June) that the  pamphlets were made by persons who just wanted to kill time.    In the meantime, the Bandung college students of 1966 and  1978 said in a separate statement that they reaffirmed support  for the college student activism. In the statement to REPUBLIKA  on Tuesday (7 June), they said that the college students have  been cornered and considered a dangerous element in society.    The former college students who called themselves "old  demonstrators" hoped that the college students would remain  constant in the current struggle. "Either morally or  physically," concluded Thomas Sitepu and friends.</p>

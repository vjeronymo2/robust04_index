			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Sarajevo, Jan 4 (AFP) -- The Sarajevo-based  Belgian general in charge of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina is  to be withdrawn, Brussels said Tuesday, amid outspoken  complaints by him and other top peacekeepers over their  powerlessness to intervene in the war. Lieutenant-General  Francis Briquemont was due to end his term as military commander  in Bosnia in July but Belgium said Tuesday it wanted to recall  him, a move that was immediately condemned by a top Bosnian  government official.    A Belgian defence ministry official said Briquemont had  agreed to return and would resume a post in his country's forces  in Germany after leaving Bosnia before the end of January.    In New York, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali said the UN would not be perturbed by Briquemont's  early departure from his post. "If he wants to be relieved, he  will be relieved," said Ahmad Fawzi. Briquemont was in Zagreb  on a visit and did not comment on his plans.    Briquemont has been increasingly critical of the UN's  inability to protect civilians and stop attacks on aid convoys,  a point echoed by the UN Commander in the former Yugoslavia  General Jean Cot, who complained Monday of humiliations suffered  by international peacekeepers. Cot also said that UN troops  were ready for an "offensive intervention" in Bosnia.    Ejup Ganic, the number two to Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic, said Belgium's decision showed that the  international community was not taking the crisis in his country  seriously. Ganic said that personally he felt that as soon as a  UN military official got to grips with the situation, he was  replaced.    French General Philippe Morillon, Briquemont's predecessor,  was also recalled and had also been outspoken in his criticism  of the inadequacy of international intervention in the stricken  country.    Briquemont recently demanded reinforcement of the 12,000  strong UN Protection Force contingent in Bosnia and said that he  no longer bothered to read unheeded UN resolutions on the civil  war.    Ganic hinted that the recall might be to do with his  criticisms of a peace plan dividing the country. He noted that  Briquemont, like Morillon, had expressed the view that the  partition of the country between the three warring groups was  not a solution.    Belgian diplomats said they hoped that Briquemont's  replacement would also be Belgian but the appointment rests in  the hands of Butrus-Ghali. [passage omitted]</p>

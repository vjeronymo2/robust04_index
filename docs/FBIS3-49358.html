[no closing quotation mark as received]    At the same time Zieleniec stressed that there were many  questions of mutual interest in the Central European region  which should be solved within the Visegrad Four group (the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary). These were the questions  directly connected with life in the area, economic cooperation  and cooperation in the building of the region's infrastructure  as well as "several political problems," he said.    On the other hand, however, the philosophy of the  transformation of Czech society is characterised by "relying on  its own strength," Zieleniec said. He said he did not consider  it appropriate to unnecessarily emphasise the exclusiveness of  the Visegrad group. The exclusion of other countries from the  European integration processes was not in the interests of Czech  foreign policy, he said.</p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Retired women win gas cash deal Sixteen women who were compulsorily retired by British Gas at 60 have won an Pounds 812,794 out-of-court settlement after pursuing a claim for discrimination, Lisa Wood writes. The women, who were retired in 1986, went through the UK courts to the European Court of Justice and to the House of Lords. In 1992 the Lords ruled that the women had been discriminated against because they were retired at 60 when men doing the same work were allowed to stay until 65. The case was remitted by the Lords to the London South Industrial Tribunal with the case for compensation scheduled to start yesterday. There is no ceiling on the amount a tribunal can impose. Unison, the public service union which backed the women's case, said: 'The company made the offer of Pounds 812,794 which averaged Pounds 50,799 for each applicant.' British Gas said that the figures included lost earnings as well as lost pension. It was pleased the issue had been settled out of court in spite of the fact that under UK law the retirement age was 60 for women and 65 for men.</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICES TO HEAR SWAGGART TAX CASE  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, agreeing to hear an appeal from evangelist Jimmy Swaggart,  said Monday that it will decide whether he can be forced to pay California tax  on the sale of religious pamphlets.  </P> <P> The case, to be heard in the fall, may clear up a dispute over the First  Amendment, which prohibits the government both from making laws concerning the  "establishment" of religion and from interfering with the "free exercise" of  religion. At issue are claims that these two prohibitions may sometimes  conflict with one another.  </P> <P> Just two months ago, the high court ruled in a splintered opinion that Texas  had violated the "establishment" clause by exempting religious magazines from  sales tax. The exemption amounted to favoritism for religion, the court said in  a ruling that struck down such exemptions in 15 states.  </P> <P> Now Swaggart contends that any such tax on religious publishers amounts to  interference with the free exercise of religion and thus violates the other  half of the First Amendment's religion clause.  </P> <P> </P> <P> California Tax Policy  </P> <P> California, along with the majority of states, taxes sales of religious  literature the same as other publications, but Swaggart contends that this  policy violates his rights. Between 1974 and 1981, Swaggart conducted 23  crusades in California and sold thousands of books, pamphlets, records and  tapes through the mail. He was assessed $185,167.02 in sales taxes.  </P> <P> "The 'free exercise' clause protects the right to hear and receive the  religious message as well as the right to preach," Los Angeles lawyer Charles  R. Ajalat told the court on behalf of the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries. To allow  states and localities to impose sales taxes on religious literature, he said,  could "chill" the practice of religion and endanger "religious liberty."  </P> <P> Attorneys for California argue in the case (Swaggart Ministries vs. Board of  Equalization of California, 88-1374) that the state's policy does not  discriminate either for or against religion.  </P> <P> The Swaggart Ministries "is attempting to avoid paying its fair share of  support of state government expenses by asking for constitutional exemption of  its religious activities from fair non-discriminatory state sales . . .  taxation which is applied equally to all sellers," state attorneys said.  </P> <P> In the Texas case, the high court split 6 to 3 in favor of Texas Monthly's  assertion that it was unfair, based on the "establishment" clause, not to tax  religious publications.  </P> <P> But three of the judges in the majority -- Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor  and Harry A. Blackmun -- said they did not know how they would rule if a  religious publisher insisted that a sales tax interfered with the "free  exercise" of religion.  </P> <P> In other actions Monday, the court:  </P> <P>  -- Said that Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis cannot stop the Defense  Department from sending the state National Guard to Central America for  training.  </P> <P> State militia units are part of the regular army in wartime but are generally  under state control in peacetime. The Constitution says that Congress controls  the militia but reserves to the states the "authority of training in the  militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress."  </P> <P> When the Ronald Reagan Administration said that it wanted to send National  Guard units to Honduras for training, several governors, including Dukakis,  refused. In 1986, Congress changed the law to take away the governors' power.  Dukakis filed suit. He lost in a district court and an appellate court, and  without comment the justices denied his appeal in the case (Massachusetts vs.  Department of Defense, 88-1223).  </P> <P>  -- Agreed to decide whether U.S. agents can search the home of a reputed  Mexican drug dealer without a search warrant issued by a federal court.  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, had said that they  cannot. It said that the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches  "imposes substantive restraints on the federal government, even when it  operates abroad."  </P> <P> In its appeal, the Justice Department said that the ruling (U.S. vs. Rene  Martin Verdugo-Urquidez, 87-1353) would hamper the U.S. war on foreign drug  traffickers.  </P> <P>  -- Threw out a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that forbade judges in a  Los Angeles County courthouse in Huntington Park from imposing an English-only  policy on their employees. Both sides in the highly publicized case called the  one-line high court order a victory.  </P> <P> A Spanish-speaking employee who challenged the policy, Alva Gutierrez, has  moved on to another job, and in January she signed a settlement in which Los  Angeles County agreed to pay her $85,000 in damages and attorneys fees. But  lawyers for the Huntington Park judges appealed anyway, urging the justices to  overturn the 9th Circuit ruling (Municipal Court, Southeast Judicial District  vs. Gutierrez, 88-1395).  </P> <P> In response, the Supreme Court said: "The judgment is vacated and the case is  remanded to the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 9th Circuit with instructions to  dismiss the appeal as moot." Despite that, Gutierrez has her $85,000.  </P></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC defends new trade group plan EC officials yesterday launched an attack on environmental groups' claims that proposals for a Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) would weaken countries' ability to protect the environment. In a strongly-worded letter to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), a prominent opponent of an MTO, Mr Tran van Thinh, EC ambassador to Gatt, said the MTO would be a democratic, rules-governed body taking decisions by members' consensus. It would not be, as WWF and others had implied, a supra-national body with powers to impose policies on weaker, developing countries, Mr Tran added. 'The Uruguay Round agreements will neither prevent governments protecting the environment nor force on them policies hampering their development.' Existing exceptions in Gatt to protect human, animal or plant health would be strengthened. The MTO would offer 'a continuous negotiating forum to develop further the trade and environment relationship'. The MTO, first proposed by the EC and Canada in 1990, would subsume Gatt and envisaged sister-bodies on services and intellectual property, enforcing trade rules with tighter disputes procedure. Trade officials in Geneva said yesterday that several governments planned to follow the EC in rebutting what they see as a misleading campaign by the WWF and other groups against the MTO and related draft accords under discussion in the Uruguay Round.</p>

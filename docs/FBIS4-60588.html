			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Program and the Prime Minister's </F> Credibility"]    [Text] In an interview with the GULF NEWS, former Army  Chief General Aslam Beg claimed that during the tenure of her  previous government, Ms. Benazir Bhutto withheld research on the  nuclear missile program. He added that despite that order, work  on the manufacture of long-range nuclear missiles continued for  one year until August 1991. Efforts were also made to acquire  M-11 missiles from China. But they were not be successful at  that time. Gen. Beg also explained that since the United  States is trying to deprive Pakistan of a means to carry a  nuclear warhead by suspending the supply of F-16's, the armed  forces of Pakistan should give priority to the manufacture of  missiles to carry warheads. According to Gen. Beg, research had  been continuing until the end of his term despite Ms. Benazir  Bhutto, in her capacity as the prime minister, banning it.    Gen. Beg's revelation requires the prime minister to take  the  nation into confidence and to explain why she issued orders  against the production of missiles, which are so indispensable  for the defense of the country and the nation. Earlier, Ms.  Bhutto herself revealed that during her previous tenure of  office she helped Rajiv Gandhi crush the Sikh freedom movement.  Reports have also appeared now about Ms. Bhutto capping  Pakistan's nuclear program during her previous term of office.  These reports will definitely create doubts and apprehensions  among the people about the credibility of Ms. Bhutto as a  national leader and prime minister of Pakistan. Therefore, it is  imperative upon Ms. Bhutto to make necessary clarifications on  the television and try to remove doubts and misgivings.    The Pakistani nation is much more sensitive than India on  defense matters and there is a national consensus that we must  be equipped with a nuclear deterrent to protect ourselves from  Indian aggression. The nation rejected the recent U.S. pressure  and it is not ready to allow an inspection of its nuclear  installations in exchange for F-16's. The government should not  make any mistake in realizing the sentiments of the nation and  the needs of the country.    The reports published the other day about the meeting of the  troika -- the president, the prime minister, and the army chief  -- in connection with the upcoming visit of President Farooq  Leghari to the United States are not at all a matter of  satisfaction for the nation. These reports said that the  government formulated a policy of rejecting a unilateral roll  back of the nuclear program. The fact is that Pakistan cannot  roll back its nuclear program even bilaterally, let alone  unilaterally. First of all, India will not agree to it. The  second is that Pakistan is several times weaker than India even  in terms of conventional forces and weapons. Therefore, progress  in the nuclear field should be our only aim in order to ensure  the security of our nation and the protection of our country's  independence.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Norway warned over state control of banks The Norwegian government's continued control of commercial banks risks distorted competition in the sector, Mr Finn Hvistendahl, Norwegian Bankers Association chairman, yesterday warned. Mr Hvistendahl, who is also president of Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest commercial bank, said the government should make it an objective to re-privatise state-owned commercial banks. 'The government stake in the major Norwegian commercial banks will inevitably affect competition in the (domestic) banking industry,' he told the association's annual meeting. Norway's banks returned to profit last year for the first time in several years, after emerging from the country's worst banking crisis since the second world war. The crisis forced the government to make a far-reaching rescue operation, in which it became the single biggest owner of the capital of the top three commercial banks, DnB, Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank. In March, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warned against that continued dominant government involvement in the banking industry.</p>

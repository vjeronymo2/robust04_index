			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / US and Vietnam in accord on MIAs A HIGH-LEVEL delegation from the US has left Vietnam with an agreement to base three State Department officials in Hanoi. They will be the first US diplomats in Vietnam since the end of the war in 1975. The agreement was reached after three days of talks in Hanoi with ministers and other senior Vietnamese officials. The diplomats will work with US military personnel in Vietnam searching for evidence on the fate of servicemen listed as missing in action (MIA). For Vietnam, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said his government has accepted the proposal, although he said some technical questions had still to be resolved. Mr Winston Lord, the US assistant secretary of state who led the delegation, stressed the three officials would be in Vietnam strictly to work on the MIA issue. However, Vietnamese officials said privately they hoped the move would make diplomatic exchanges between the two countries easier and lead to a gradual improvement in relations. The US delegation said the diplomats would also 'support American citizens, including families of our missing and the Vietnam veterans who have been invited by the Vietnamese government to visit Vietnam'. President Bill Clinton ordered the US delegation to Vietnam to assess local co-operation in the search for MIAs. Hanoi says it is already doing all it can, but many Americans are not convinced and Mr Clinton has said there must be tangible progress on the issue before relations between the two countries can be normalised. Mr Lord and his colleagues said at the end of their visit that they were pleased with the assurances they had received. However, the four representatives of Vietnam war veterans' groups in the delegation said they would not be convinced until they saw some concrete results. The Vietnamese government believes that, with US diplomatic representation in Hanoi and with Mr Clinton's recent decision to unblock international lending, the process of normalisation with the US has taken a big step forward. Vietnamese officials are now hoping for the US trade embargo to be lifted. This comes up for renewal on September 14 and Mr Clinton is under pressure from US business interests to let them into Vietnam.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by KOMMERSANT-DAILY scientific editor Nikita </F> Kirichenko: "The Deficit Has Exceeded Expectations"]    [Text] According to information received by the  editorial staff, specialists in the Russian Government and the  State Duma will begin next week to analyze the indicators  prepared in the Federal Treasury on results of implementing the  1993 budget. The document was sent to leading parliamentary  committees yesterday. KOMMERSANT-DAILY's scientific editor,  Nikita Kirichenko, comments on the results of implementing  Russia's budget.    Just as KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts expected, the Ministry of  Finance put together a budget which deviates substantially from  the indicators set by legislation in July 1993.    Revenues of the federal budget were on the order of 17  trillion rubles [R] with a shortfall of R7 trillion against the  plan. Receipts from the NDS [value-added tax] (a shortfall of R2  trillion), excise taxes (a R1.6 trillion shortfall), and incomes  from foreign economic activity (a R2.1 trillion shortfall)  "lagged behind" substantially.    Now about expenditures. Despite the fact that the Ministry  of  Finance indicated the figure of R34 trillion in its official  record of the 1993 results, in order at the very least to blend  with the maximum figures of the budget deficit designated in the  Ministry of Finance-Council of Ministers statement No.  1-10/2-204 of 18 October. Let us remind you that the statement  said the budget deficit in 1993 may be "squeezed" to R17  trillion as opposed to a possible R22 trillion as a result of  the combination of measures being proposed by the Ministry of  Finance.    However, the KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts are inclined to  appraise the actual sum of budget expenditures in 1993 not at  R34 trillion, but R42 trillion. As we have already written, the  point is that liabilities in unsequestered expenditures from the  1993 budget totaling R8 trillion were carried over to the  beginning of 1994. Including debts to the Ministry of Defense  (R1.2 trillion), to the APK [agroindustrial complex] for crop  purchases last year and subsidies (R2.7 trillion), and to the  construction complex for work already completed (R1.5 trillion).  Now this fact has been acknowledged officially by members of the  cabinet--by Aleksandr Shokhin, Sergey Dubinin, and Viktor  Gerashchenko.    They managed to "turn over" this debt to some extent through  a simple strategem--the money was sent to numerous budgetary  enterprises in the last days and hours of 1993, and the  enterprises were physically unable to pay ewmployees' wages in  time. This created a serious problem for them, inasmuch as  beginning on 1 January 1994, the budgeted money not taken out  was automatically entered as unclaimed income for the 1994  budget. It was claimed, naturally, but in 1994. After carrying  over the old debts to the new year, the Ministry of Finance  asked the TsB [Central Bank] for R7.5 trillion in credit for the  first quarter of 1994.    But what will come out of all this? First of all, the real  budget deficit in 1993 may be estimated at R25 trillion, or 15.4  percent of the gross domestic product. (According to the latest  data from the Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], the  GNP in 1993 totaled R162.3 trillion.)    Secondly, credit for the budget in the first quarter of  1994,  asked for by taking into account the old debts, essentially  exhausts the Central Bank limit for this period and completely  deprives it of the opportunity to refinance the country's  economy in the first quarter through the commercial banks. (Let  us remind you that in 1993, the Ministry of Finance was ashamed  to take more than 50-60 percent of the total sum of the Central  Bank's credit investments for itself--the rest went to extend  credit for the economy anyway.)    Thirdly, repayment of the old debts will inevitably turn  into  a powerful inflationary surge by the end of the first quarter.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Implementation of the Russian Federation's Federal Budget in 1993 (in Trilli-|  |ons of Rubles)                                                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Item                     |Precise Budget Indicators|Actually Implemented     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total income             |24.4775                  |17.1538                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total expenditures       |39.4539                  |34.0832                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Deficit                  |14.9764                  |17.2514                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |including what was finan-|11.9264                  |15.8006                  |  |ced through national sou-|                         |                         |  |rces                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The deficit in percentag-|38.0 (30.2)*             |50.6 (46.4)              |  |e of budget expenditures |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The deficit in percentag-|13.1 (10.4)              |10.6 (9.7)               |  |e of GNP                 |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |*The deficit financed from national sources is indicated in parentheses.     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------     <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-021-57A>           Sources to Cover the Budget Deficit in 1993 </FIG></p>

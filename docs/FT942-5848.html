			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Polish bank to be sold this year Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH), one of Poland's largest banks, is to be privatised by the end of this year through a stock exchange flotation of 50 per cent of the equity, the finance ministry announced. The sale of the Krakow-based bank will be followed next year by an invitation to foreign and domestic investors to take up a large share of the remaining equity in 1995. Three per cent of the bank's shares are to offered to management and employees. The bank, which reported a 773bn zloty (Dollars 35.5m) net profit last year on a balance sheet worth 33,071bn zlotys, was originally to have been sold by the middle of this year to a strategic investor and through a public share offer. However, this method was used for the sale earlier this year of Bank Slaski, the last state-owned bank to be privatised. It led to the resignation of Mr Marek Borowski, finance minister, and the ministry's top banking officials, and put a question mark over the BPH disposal. Critics charged that Bank Slaski had been sold at an excessive discount. Meanwhile, Mr Janusz Quandt, the BPH chairman who has in the past five years built a nationwide retail network and who sees the bank combining this with an investment banking role, has been urging for a capital increase for the bank through a sale of new shares to selected domestic investors. He has argued against having one strategic investor buy into the bank. The finance ministry has chosen to auction half of the bank's equity through the bourse and then search for a strategic investor once a market price has been established for the BPH.</p>

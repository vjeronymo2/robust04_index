			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Government of the Republic of </F> Angola on 21 May]    [Text] The Government of the Republic of Angola strongly  condemns the actions carried out by the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] against the World Food  Program [WFP] planes rendering humanitarian assistance to the  victims of war and other disasters. The government feels that  the actions against WFP planes in the city of Malange on 16, 18,  19, and 20 May, forcing the WFP to suspend humanitarian  assistance to Malange residents, constitute a flagrant violation  of UNITA's pledge regarding the distribution of humanitarian  assistance to all needy Angolan people, regardless of the area  where they are found.    The government would also like to inform the national and  international communities about the raids carried out by UNITA  armed elements against the warehouses of international  nongovernmental organizations in the provinces of Uige and  Huambo. It also condemns the diversion of goods destined to the  needy for military purposes.    In view of this unfavorable picture created by UNITA, the  Government of the Republic of Angola has decided to temporarily  suspend the WFP and international nongovernmental organizations'  flights to the provinces of Huambo and Uige until the United  Nations is able to inform the Government of the Republic of  Angola that conditions have been reestablished for the  continuation of humanitarian flights in conditions of security.    The government would once again like to call on the  international community to exercise pressure on UNITA to respect  the principles of humanitarian assistance and not use this  assistance for other purposes.</p>

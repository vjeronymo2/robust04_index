			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> Newman's Own Verdict: A jury in Bridgeport, Conn., on Thursday rejected a  delicatessen owner's claims that he was promised a slice of actor Paul Newman's  gourmet food companies. The Superior Court jury deliberated five hours over two  days before deciding that Newman never promised Westport deli owner Julius Gold  8% stock in the companies, Newman's Own Inc. and Salad King Inc., for the help  Gold said he provided in launching the businesses. "It's just tragic, all of  this energy and time could not have been spent in more charitable pursuits,"  Newman said after the verdict was announced. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, one commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;11) stated that hazard certification is unnecessary, because that company has ``a good hazard assessment program that addresses PPE. A properly trained Compliance Officer can make a fair determination concerning PPE.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those commentors indicated that requiring hazard assessments for each job, if followed literally, would create considerable costs for shipyard employers, without increasing employee safety. Those commentors also stated that requiring employers to certify their hazard assessment activities would increase shipyard operational costs and paperwork burdens, with no safety benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on those comments, OSHA requests input regarding the appropriateness of a documentation requirement; the manner in which shipyards currently document their hazard assessments; and suggested language for a verification requirement that would address concerns specific to shipyard employment. In particular, the Agency solicits information regarding hazard assessment programs currently in use in shipyards and experience concerning the effectiveness of such programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Agency is considering the extent to which current hazard assessments performed by trade or occupation provide the necessary information for selection of appropriate PPE. The following are examples of typical trade-based hazard assessment formats that OSHA may consider to be acceptable:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Example 1: Welder  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which welders are exposed, the equipment listed below is the basic PPE required for this occupation. This does not take into account a job location in which additional PPE may be required such as where the welder works from an elevated platform without guard rails. In this situation the welder must wear the proper fall protection equipment, such as a body harness.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Hard hat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Welding Shield (Face)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Welding Gloves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Safety Glasses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Safety Shoes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Welding Sleeves (welding in the overhead position)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (Signed and dated)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Example 2: Yard Maintenance Worker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which shipyard maintenance workers are exposed, the equipment listed below is the basic PPE required for this occupation. Where maintenance workers are exposed to other hazards, such as asbestos exposure where the insulation on a pipe is being repaired, the maintenance worker must be provided with the appropriate supplemental PPE (requirements for asbestos PPE are set out in &sect;1915.1001). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Hard Hat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Safety Glasses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Work Gloves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Safety Shoes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (Signed and dated)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issue 2_Certification of Training and Training Elements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;1915.152(d) required that employees be trained in the proper use of their personal protective equipment. The proposal did not address certification of training nor did it address specific training elements. The revised PPE standard for general industry requires employees to be trained and retrained, as necessary, in at least the following:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> When PPE is necessary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What PPE is necessary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The limitations of the PPE; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Useful life and disposal of the PPE  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This training may be provided in a variety of ways, such as through tool box training or at safety meetings. Once this training has been completed, &sect;1910.132(f)(4) requires employers to verify through a written certification that each affected employee has received and understood the required training. This certification requirement may be satisfied through a training log or other document that the employer has already been using to keep track of its training activities. For compliance purposes, a record which provides the names of the employees who have successfully completed the training, the date of the training, the type of certification (that is, completion of PPE training), and the signature of a supervisor or trainer would be sufficient. OSHA solicits additional information concerning whether it is appropriate to clarify the requirements of proposed &sect;1915.152(d) by incorporating the above-noted training elements and whether the Agency should add a new requirement for written certification of training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the notice of reopening, OSHA received comments (Exs. 9&hyph;6, 9&hyph;8 and 9&hyph;9) which stated that training can be satisfied during new employee orientation. Another commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;7) supported OSHA's intent for general requirements for training. The commentor also believed that ``documentation of all training should be in the form of training logs, which would be the equivalent of ``written certification'' to avoid the non-value added redundance of record keeping.'' In addition, a commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;9) stated that most shipyards are already complying with the OSHA PPE training standard under consideration. Most of the shipyards that responded to the notice of reopening stated that they already have a written certification program and a new hire training program in effect. One commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;11) stated that requiring employers to certify their training activities would increase shipyard operational costs and paperwork burdens, with no safety benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

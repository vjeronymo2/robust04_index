The Bundestag Commission for German Economic Ties with East  Europe has just produced a report on the results of a poll on  the development of economic relations with CIS states and former  Soviet states (a comprehensive report is to be released in the  spring).    What has been established less surprisingly is that of all  the CIS states, Russia still remains the most important trading  partner for German exporters. With exports totaling almost 5  billion German marks [DM], the volume of trade is almost twice  as high as it is for exports to all the other CIS countries,  which are considerably below DM2 billion. Russia is followed by  Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the Baltic states. On the  imports side, Russia is of even greater importance: More than  80 percent of German imports from the CIS come from Russia and  amount to somewhat more as DM5 billion.  <H5>  Fewer Problems With the Baltics </H5>   The poll shows that fewer problems have only been  encountered  in trade with Baltic states and some German companies have  reported that they are satisfied with their Baltic trading  partners. In the case of all other CIS members states, the  problems are similar to those experienced in trade with Russia.  Many companies believe, however, that positive political and  economic conditions are also lacking in the Baltic states.    In contrast to other former Soviet states, assessments of  Baltic partners in terms of deliveries and payment range from  satisfactory to good.  <H5>  Less Readiness To Pay </H5>   According to the poll, a serious factor in the development  of  trade relations with Russia is that Russian partners have become  much less willing to pay. This applies to almost all partners  and has in the meantime become the most important factor  disrupting trade with Russia. There have been cases of payment  extending over a long period of time, and delays have already  led to the use of Hermes guarantees. In the case of barter  trade, there has been a considerable deterioration in the  quality of goods.    An old experience is being confirmed: There is a lack of  clarity about decisionmaking structures at both company and  state administration levels. The general trend to  decentralization is also partially being countered by  recentralization trends.    In the personnel field, the motivation of Russian employees  is considered high, technical training adequate, and management  skills low. In almost all countries, it is considered that  competitors from Western states possess advantages in the form  of state subsidies or a combination of commercial loans and  state loans (soft loans) on favorable terms.</p>

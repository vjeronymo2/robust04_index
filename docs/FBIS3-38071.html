			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] The holding of joint military exercises is  noteworthy now. As journalists often say, such a thing was  quite unthinkable just a few years ago. Joint exercises were  held very rarely, and as a rule only with our former Warsaw Pact  allies. Joint exercises are now being held perhaps not so much  more frequently, but every exercise is considerably more  interesting, especially those conducted with our former enemies,  members of the NATO bloc. Joint exercises with the Americans  are planned for July this year. Colonel General Georgiy  Kondratyev, deputy defense minister, talks about the details of  these exercises.    [Begin Kondratyev recording] This will be the first time not  only in the history of the Russian armed forces, but also in the  history of the entire former Soviet Union, that such exercises  have been held. They will be joint exercises, involving the  27th Motor Rifles Division of the Volga Military District of the  Russian Armed Forces, and the 3d Infantry Division of the United  States. The commanders of the Russian Federation land forces of  the Volga Military District and I, as deputy defense minister,  have already worked out a plan for conducting the exercise. We  determined that the main goals of the exercise should be: to  examine jointly issues relating to possible planning of  peacekeeping operations; what documents are necessary for this;  how to train the personnel; and directly, during the course of  the exercise, to work out questions relating to real actions,  approximating the actions of U.S. and Russian subunits in  conflict zones, that is, real actions during peacekeeping  operations. These command and staff exercises will involve not  only the commands of the two divisions but also a number of  subunits. We agreed on somewhere around 200 or perhaps 250 men,  up to two companies, with their own standard combat equipment  and reinforcement assets. I think these exercises will go off  very well indeed, and our officers will get a certain amount of  experience in planning and conducting peacekeeping operations  not only in CIS countries but also perhaps in other spots round  the world.    Why has this need emerged? Starting in 1992, as you know, we  have been carrying out peacekeeping operations, and we are doing  so currently in the Dnestr region, in South Osetia, and to some  extent in North Osetia and Ingushetia, where a troop is  involved, and we have taken part in the Abkhaz-Georgian  conflict. According to the latest understanding between  President Boris NIkolayevich Yeltsin of Russia and Mr.  Shevardnadze in Tbilisi, it is possible that Russia will carry  out peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia, under the aegis of the  CSCE and perhaps the United Nations, something which we are  aiming for. The need to share experience in conducting  exercises has therefore become urgent. And we shall hold such  exercises. I believe this is useful both for the Russian side  and for the American side, and indeed, useful for other  countries, too. [end recording]</p>

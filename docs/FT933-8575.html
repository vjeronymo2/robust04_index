			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Health cuts cost jobs and trade, say drugs companies GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS to cut National Health Service spending on drugs have cost thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of pounds of exports, according to pharmaceuticals groups operating in the UK. The measures - including the surprise extension of the blacklists of products no longer available on prescription and a 2.5 per cent price cut - have undermined drugs companies' confidence in the stability of the British market, they say. Manufacturing investment has been particularly affected, they claim. Imports of drugs into the UK are already increasing more rapidly than exports, although there is still a trade surplus of Pounds 1.3bn. Mr Mike Wilson, the managing director of Cyanamid UK, a subsidiary of American Cyanamid, said: 'The extension of the selected lists (blacklists) is disastrous. It is hitting some companies extremely hard, affecting investment, jobs and exports, while generating little financial gain for the Treasury.' The government's measures are aimed at keeping under control NHS drugs expenditure which was Pounds 3.4bn last year and increased 14 per cent. Groups that have deferred or decided against investment in Britain after the announcement of government measures include: Parke Davis, a subsidiary of the US group Warner Lambert, which announced this year it planned to move most production from Pontypool, south Wales, to the US or continental Europe within three years. Staff at Pontypool will be cut from 1,000 five years ago to 300. Lundbeck of Denmark, which bought a 20-acre site at Seal Sands near Middlesbrough at the beginning of the year, has now frozen development. The board is now looking at building at another location outside the UK, after the introduction of the limited lists. All production from Seal Sands would have been exported. E. Merck, the German group which, according to the independent industry newsletter Scrip, might have made an investment of more than Pounds 100m, generating 200 jobs at Pontypool, has been lost to the continent because of the limited list. Syntex of the US, which is closing its finished product plant at Iver, Buckinghamshire. Most production is being diverted to Spain. Cyanamid which has frozen development of a 28-acre site acquired last year at Gosport in Hampshire. The company was forced this week to halve the price of Traxam, an anti-inflammatory product with UK sales last year of Pounds 10m, to avoid it being blacklisted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] After President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's speech and since there were no deputies who  had registered their names to speak against Mr. Mirsalim's  ministerial appointment, three deputies spoke in favor of his  appointment. They pointed to the sensitive nature of the  current situation and the importance of the Ministry of Culture  and Islamic guidance's responsibilities. They considered that  Mr. Mirsalim was qualified for the post.    Next, Mr. Mostafa Mirsalim, minister of culture and Islamic  guidance, explained the main points of his programs aimed at  achieving the cultural objectives of the revolution. He  described the extensive dimensions of the western cultural  onslaught against Islamic culture. He said: In confronting such  an onslaught, we should safeguard our indigenous culture and  Islamic values with all our being. He emphasized: The most  important factor in spiritual growth is to raise the cultural  level of the public and this is a priority and an essential part  of our work. All programs should be formulated and supplied  within the framework of Islamic values.    The minister of culture and Islamic guidance said that the  lack of clear opinions based on religious jurisprudence that  could resolve certain matters concerning the art world, the  unequal distribution of art facilities in the country, and also  the question of training and retraining of specialized and  effective managers for the cultural and art sectors of the  country, are among existing bottlenecks. He hoped that through  the efforts of relevant officials, these bottlenecks will be  removed as soon as possible.</p>

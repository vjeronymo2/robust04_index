			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Fall in US visitors hits Partridge Shares of Partridge Fine Arts yesterday fell by 6p to 73p after the antique furniture dealer warned shareholders that trading in the current year had been badly affected by the fall in the number of visitors, particularly from the US. Mr John Partridge, chairman, told the annual meeting that the decline in trading would hit first half profits. The position would not improve until more people came to the UK. Turnover rose 2.9 per cent to Pounds 13.2m for the year to end-October, although pre-tax profits advanced 28 per cent to Pounds 4.1m as a result of increased cash resources.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hedley Thomas] </F>   [Excerpt] Governor Chris Patten may appeal for clemency  for a Hong Kong youth sentenced by a Singapore judge yesterday  to 12 strokes of the cane. The family of 17-year-old Shiu  Chi-ho, who was found guilty of four charges of spray-painting  cars with American Michael Fay and others, will be consulted by  the Hong Kong Government before any decision is made.    "We will wait until we have a formal report and have taken  advice before we react," a spokesman for Mr Patten said last  night. Legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing urged supportive and  sympathetic action by the Government on what she described as a  cruel punishment. "When Hong Kong people get into trouble  overseas, of course they look to the Government for help, but it  is doubtful whether anything can be achieved because the  American protests [over Fay's sentence] have had absolutely no  effect," she said.

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Travel: Trunk calls only to north India - Michael J Woods visits the elephant fair at Sonepur, Patna WEARING A red cap fringed with silver, a sweeping rich red cloak, large and opulent earrings and delicately applied make-up, Moti (Pearl) looked every inch the star he was. His owner claimed proudly that he was the best elephant on sale at the fair, which explained his high price - the equivalent of Pounds 8,140. As his owner was Mr Solanki, the district president, who had three armed guards, who was I to argue? 'Either I sell him for that price or I take him home. I will not bargain', he said, as Moti rocked back and forth on his shackled legs, the chains clinking slightly with his restlessness. From time to time his mahout, who sat beside him on a bed of reeds, cut a stem of sugar cane into convenient lengths, tied them with some blades of grass and passed them to Moti's questing trunk. The animal hoisted them to his mouth and munched them with relish. The mela, or fair, at Sonepur, near Patna, in northern India, is reputed to be the largest in Asia, an immense gathering of traders who come to buy and sell cattle, horses, buffaloes, mules, oxen, goats, camels and, most famously, elephants. A little like an Indian version of the Royal Welsh or Bath and West agricultural shows, manufacturers have stands at Sonepur to promote fertilisers or tractors, and state departments such as forestry and railways have their own exhibits. There is a large fun fair with three big wheels and a variety of stalls forming a vast bazaar. Here women sit beside the piles of dye of pure, almost luminescent red, orange and yellow, while next to them may be cauliflower or egg sellers or street barbers. And there is food for sale everywhere. Curries bubble and steam, fresh samosas gleam golden from leaf dishes while a skilled cook expertly twirls his bag of flour paste over a pan of boiling butter to create distinctively shaped sweetmeats called gilebi. At times, it is difficult to linger because of the press of the crowds. The pedestrians who fill the roadways have to draw aside to allow bellowing buffaloes or Brahmin cattle to pass, or to give way to the strident bells of the tricycle rickshaws, or the hooting of buses. The mela originated as a religious event and begins on the day of the full moon in November, Kartik Punima. At dawn, large numbers of Hindu pilgrims gather for a ritual dip at the confluence of the Rivers Gandak and Ganges, where a mythical battle took place between an elephant and a crocodile, the reincarnated forms of two brothers. At its climax, when the elephant appears doomed, Lord Krishna steps in and the crocodile is killed. Pilgrims stream in from miles around, pouring over the old iron bridge into Sonepur itself, arriving by train at what is India's second longest platform or clotting the road with traffic until the resultant jam seems gridlocked. Arriving at the back of such a queue, you need a top-class fixer, and we had one in the form of Zubin Mody, our guide and major domo who travelled with us throughout our trip. Stepping lightly from the bus, Zubin quickly found the local chief of police and, by means about which we did not inquire, enlisted his help to shuffle lorries off the road and clear a space across the market square so that we could rumble through to our camp site. Parts of that jam were eight hours old. Once the mela gets going, it does not stop for a month and is a 24-hour-a-day affair. As the light melts away and the day comes to an end, the dust in the air appears to thicken and is joined by the smoke of dozens of newly-lit charcoal and dung fires. When night comes properly, the circus opens and the evening shows begin. We entered through a thin board facade of a castle entrance, the sort of thing you might see at the landward end of a failing pier at a second-rate seaside resort. Inside, the great canvas hall was divided into four sections, denoting four ticket prices, by barbed wire hung on bamboo staves to keep the groups of men (these shows are for men only) apart. Our show consisted of a series of modern Indian songs, with music so amplified - to reach those at the back - that it was painfully distorted near the front. While they remained fully clad in knee-length, long-sleeved, high-throated dresses, the pelvic thrusts, hip wiggles and breast-shaking of the singers left little to the imagination. It seems the fences are also necessary to keep susceptible country boys at bay. At first light the elephant lines stir. Fires are rekindled and new fodder arrives. One by one, the chains are loosed, the mahouts climb astride the elephant's neck by grasping both its ears and walking up the animal's trunk, and they pad off to the river. Gentle as lambs, they rolled amiably on to their sides in the Gandak to be scrubbed with bricks or stones like pumice: faces, ears, sides, back, even the soles of their feet. With one side done they stood up, turned round on command and lay down for the washing to be completed. The sun had almost risen when Moti came striding along, full of self-importance. At the top of the bank he stopped but, try as he might, Moti's mahout could not persuade the stubborn pachiderm to approach the water. Good looking he might be, but such intractability banished thoughts of raising Pounds 8,140. I was not going to buy an elephant which refused to be washed. Michael J Woods travelled with Twickers World, which offers a 15-day Indian journey that includes two days at the Sonepur mela and also visits Delhi, Jaipur (where elephants, bought at previous fairs, can be ridden to the Amber Fort), Agra, Patna, Calcutta and Bombay. There is only one departure a year to coincide with the mela: this year it will be on November 22, costing from Pounds 2,165 plus government hotel tax.</p>

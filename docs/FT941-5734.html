			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Slow Canadian recovery reflected in CIBC results Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce lifted first-quarter income by 27 per cent, due largely to strong contributions from investment banking, mutual funds and credit cards. But like most of Canada's other big five banks which have reported over the past 10 days, CIBC's results reflect the relatively slow recovery in Canadian business activity, compared with the US. Growth in credit demand remains slow and there has been only a relatively modest drop in loan-loss provisions. The Canadian banks have been buoyed, however, by their strongly-performing securities-dealing subsidiaries and their ballooning mutual funds business. CIBC's earnings rose to CDollars 214m (USDollars 159.7m), or 86 cents a share, in the three months to January 31, from CDollars 169m, or 74 cents, a year earlier. Return on equity improved to 11.6 per cent from 10.6 per cent. Return on assets rose to 0.59 per cent from 0.54 per cent. CIBC, which is Canada's second-biggest financial institution, had total assets of CDollars 144.4bn on January 31, 6 per cent higher than a year ago. Loan-loss provisions charged against income were unchanged at CDollars 220m, although estimated loan losses of CDollars 880m for the year as a whole are lower than the CDollars 920m posted in fiscal 1993. Non-performing loans fell for the fourth consecutive quarter to CDollars 2.2bn, or 2.1 per cent of total loans, from CDollars 3.1bn, or 3 per cent of total loans, last year. The loan-loss record of most Canadian banks has recently been distorted by transfers of surpluses on the market value of their Third World debt portfolios. One analyst predicted yesterday that the banks would continue to use surpluses on their LDC debt and other securities holdings to smooth overall earnings trends over the next year or so.</p>

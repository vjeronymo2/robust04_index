			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that, as  planned, the government is step by step approaching the  conclusion the nation is yearning for in the struggle against  terrorism. Ciller addressed her party's assembly group meeting  today.    In her statement, Ciller reported that the organization's  balance has been totally upset as a result of the blows dealt to  the bandits both inside and outside the country in a planned,  systematic, and determined manner. The initiative has been  placed in the hands of the state forces at every point, Ciller  announced, stressing that the separatists, who suffered a  significant loss of personnel, are in a state of moral collapse.  Under these circumstances, Ciller explained, there has been a  300 percent increase in the number of terrorists fleeing the  organization or surrendering to the security forces of their own  free will. She remarked that the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] has totally lost the people's support and is  therefore trying to recruit militants by the use of force and  violence.    Pointing out that the terrorists are trying not to engage in  large-scale clashes with the security forces that will result in  heavy losses, the prime minister said that it was learned that  heavy pressure is being applied and horrible executions are  taking place within the organization in a bid to prevent  desertions. Ciller revealed that the terrorist organization's  logistics support and warehouses of provisions have largely been  destroyed.    Ciller announced that the developments in northern Iraq,  which are very important for Turkey's national security, are  also being followed carefully. All necessary steps and measures  are being taken to prevent events from taking a turn that may  threaten Turkey's interests, Ciller stated. Noting that there  is full agreement and cooperation with Iran concerning the  antiterror struggle, the prime minister disclosed that there are  signs that certain neighboring countries are still supporting  terrorism.    [Begin Ciller recording] I want to clearly say the following  to them: You reap what you sow. I especially recommend that  they learn this Turkish proverb. Furthermore, I remind them  that such behavior does not comply with the concept of a serious  and honorable state. [end recording]    In the 270 terrorist incidents that occurred over the past  two weeks, Ciller explained, 314 terrorists were killed and 122  terrorists were caught, while only 50 members of the security  forces were martyred. She underlined that it is evident that  the past 10-month period yielded more effective results than the  past 10 years.    Ciller explained that the bandits urged innocent  Kurdish-origin citizens to immigrate to northern Iraq by the use  of force and various lies and they now wish to use this as a  means of propaganda against Turkey at the United Nations and in  world public opinion. In this way, Ciller noted, the bandits  are trying to bring foreign political pressure to stop the  operations in the region and to secure safe havens for  themselves.    The prime minister announced that the PKK, which is  beginning  to crumble inside the country, has adopted the strategy pursued  by ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] in  the past, of dragging the struggle into the international arena  and onto a human rights level. Ciller recalled, however, that  all the citizens in Turkey are equal and this is guaranteed by  the Constitution and the laws. Pointing out that the citizens,  who were forced at gunpoint to immigrate to northern Iraq, are  now hungry and destitute, Ciller continued:    [Begin Ciller recording] I am calling on these citizens not  be instrumental in the plots of the terrorist organization, not  to succumb to it, and to immediately return to their motherland  and homes. I hope that everyone will note and understand that  the terrorists' real goals are not related to the interests of  the regional population and that the organization itself is a  tool in the hands of known foreign centers. A large group of  youths -- mostly mere children -- who have been instigated into  undertaking terrorist acts against their state and who have been  driven to the mountains by a handful of traitors -- who are  leading a safe and luxurious life abroad -- are not actually  aware of who and what goal they are serving.    I would like to remind them once again that they have only  two options and no other ways out. I say to them: Come and  surrender to the compassionate hands of the state. We will  treat you with the compassion of a state and a mother. You  either opt for this alternative, or we will end up with youths  who will die in security force operations with the stamp of  traitor on their foreheads. I genuinely feel the compassion and  sorrow of a mother. I am again calling on all our youths. I am  again appealing on all the mothers and fathers: Let us embrace  our children. Let us together prevent them from pursuing a  dead-end road. [end recording]    Ciller emphasized that, as promised, this matter will  definitely be concluded before 1995. She also reported that the  National Security Council decision recommending the extension of  the state of emergency -- currently in force in 10 provinces --  for another four months as of 19 July will be submitted to the  Turkish Grand National Assembly after being assessed by the  Council of Ministers.</p>

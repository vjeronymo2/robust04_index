Diez and L.R. </F> Aizpeolea: "Gonzalez Convinced That He Can Count on Pujol's  Support To Govern Through 1996"]    [Text] Head of government Felipe Gonzalez is convinced he  has assured the survival of his government for the next two  years by obtaining a commitment from the Convergence and Union  (CiU) coalition to lend its support in parliament to the PSOE  [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] in the 1995 budget battle.  CiU's backing would absolutely guarantee the Socialist cabinet's  staying power. In the next 10 days, with the general strike  over, Felipe Gonzalez will meet with the president of the  Catalonian autonomous government, Jordi Pujol, to discuss the  so-called autonomy dividend. Gonzalez is confident that the  Catalonians will not insist all their demands be met  immediately, and that Pujol will not present them as a  nonnegotiable package.    CiU Spokesman Miquel Roca says the government can count on  its support so long as its policies are reasonable. In private,  the nationalists are more open in pledging continued support for  the government, though they acknowledge some friction will be  inevitable. On the socialist side, Felipe Gonzalez readily  admits the vital importance of CiU's collaboration, which  implies Spanish Government espousal of Catalonist policy tenets.    The socialists say they are prepared for the possibility of  an electoral setback in June--in the European and Andalusian  elections--and will continue to concentrate on the medium-term  economic recovery they confidently expect, striving above all  for the [social and labor] tranquility which, with the  indispensable help of the CiU, will virtually guarantee them a  continued parliamentary majority.    Gonzalez thinks the nationalist coalition will guarantee his  government's survival at least to the end of next year, since he  has a verbal promise--CiU balked at signing any document--that  it will support his 1995 budget bill.    Despite highly publicized indicators that the economy may be  stabilizing, Gonzalez admitted in a talk with a group of  journalists that the economic situation is of extraordinary  gravity. By way of example and to dash any false hopes, he cited  the fact that the unemployment rate is now equal to what it was  in 1982. Back then, Gonzalez considered labor's plight  intolerable, and he painted a grim picture of the legacy  bequeathed to him by the UCD [Democratic Center Union]  governments.    Gonzalez notes the seriousness of the current situation and  is very pleased with progress on the CiU accord, which will  allow legislation to go forward. He is also pleased that the PNV  [Basque Nationalist Party], despite some harsh verbal exchanges,  supported his investiture as prime minister, refrained from  trying to amend the budget bills, and has supported labor reform.    All of which is to say that the Basques of PNV have  contributed with their votes, as they are wont to say these  days, to those important elements of socialist policy from which  in the past they had notably distanced themselves--an aloofness  somewhat alleviated by the well-publicized meeting last  Wednesday [19 January] between Deputy Prime Minister Narcis  Serra and PNV leader Xabier Arzalluz.    The socialists have plans on the books extending as far as  the end of 1995. For example, they are counting on CiU's support  in that year's budget battle, though they admit there is not and  will not be a written pact with the Catalonian nationalists, as  the latter prefer to take one day at a time without making  commitments for the future.    In official statements, Miquel Roca and other leaders of his  party boast that the government's survival depends on their  cooperation and say their continued support will depend on the  specifics of the government's policy. In private, however, they  take pains to give virtual guarantees of continued collaboration  so long as the socialists move forward on issues they feel are  important.    Furthermore, cooperation is very close in all fields and in  all the ministries. As evidenced, for example, by the close  collaborative ties which Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch  and Transport Minister Jose Borrell maintain with CiU  representatives.  <H5>  Friction Ahead </H5>   The head of government is under no illusions; he is well  aware there will be some inevitable friction with the  nationalists, and among the nationalists themselves, though he  does not think disputes between Convergence and its Union  partners will affect CiU's relations with the central government.    Ten days from now Gonzalez will be meeting with president  Jordi Pujol to resume the suspended transfer process with  Catalonia, which Catalonians call the "autonomy dividend."  Gonzalez's initial impression is that Pujol will be moderate in  his demands at this meeting and give the government a reasonable  period of time to meet them.    Also, leaders of the Basque government will meet next week  with the minister for public administration, Jeronimo Saavedra,  in an effort to renormalize relations between PNV and PSOE. At  the same time, the PNV spokesman in Congress, Inaki Anasagasti,  will be resuming the "democratic impetus" dialogue.  <H5>  Stay the Course </H5>   Both in the People's Party [PP] and in United Left [IU], the  idea has been gaining currency that Gonzalez will dissolve  parliament next fall because of the supposedly chaotic situation  that will result from the fall-off of parliamentary support, the  continued rise of unemployment, and the expected drubbing of the  PSOE in the European elections and the Andalusian regional  elections next June. Gonzalez is aware of these prophesies and  has strongly and insistently denied there is any truth to them.    There will be no early elections, even in the event of an  electoral debacle in June, Gonzalez insists. The government has  already analyzed the unfavorable electoral environment for  European incumbents regardless of ideological orientation.  Opposition Laborites in Great Britain are rising in the polls  against conservative John Major, and the same phenomenon is  working against Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.    European governments are going to lose elections, members of  the Spanish cabinet say, because the wave of pessimism now  sweeping the continent will result in voters casting ballots to  "punish" incumbent political leaders. With this stoic hypothesis  the socialists will try to endure the "bitter cup" they must  drink in June and set their sights on future economic recovery.  They realize, however, that even when recovery comes the  opposition PP will continue to gain in strength, and Jose Maria  Aznar's party is just biding its time until after the 1995  regional and municipal elections. Only then, assuming the PP  meets its goal of winning in the majority of city hall races,  will Aznar demand early elections.    Within the PP, there are divergent views respecting when  would be the opportune moment to make their big bid for power.  If elections were held this October, the PP would be prepared.  But the difficult economic situation frightens them, and some in  the party would prefer to come to power after 1994, when the  economy is on the road to recovery.</p>

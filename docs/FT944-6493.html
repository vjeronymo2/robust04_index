			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield sale gives boost to NCC NCC, Sweden's second largest construction group, said yesterday that a SKr1.2bn capital gain from the sale of its 22.5 per cent stake in Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, had given a sharp boost to profits in the first nine months. The sale helped the group to compensate for the continuing recession in the Swedish construction market. It reported a SKr1.45bn (Dollars 194.2m) profit after financial items for the period, compared with a SKr546m surplus a year ago. If one-off items are excluded, income improved to SKr262m from SKr68m. NCC sold its holding in Avesta for SKr2.2bn in September. British Steel picked up a big portion of the shares, lifting its stake in Avesta to 49.9 per cent from 40 per cent. NCC said its main construction operations continued to be hit by difficult market conditions, which lowered group sales to SKr12.0m from SKr13.0bn. But Mr Jan Sjoqvist, group president, said there were 'clear signs that the market trend is reversing'. He said orders received by the group's Swedish construction businesses had been 30 per cent higher than last year at SKr9.7bn. Total orders rose to SKr11.0bn from SKr9.1bn. The group is predicting a full-year profit of between SKr900m and SKr1bn. This is after including write-downs of between SKr300m and SKr400m in the full-year accounts, primarily linked to properties held for future development outside Sweden. Last year, the group achieved a SKr175m profit. NCC's civil engineering, building and production units reported nine-month profits of SKr407m, down from SKr524m last year.</p>

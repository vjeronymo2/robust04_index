			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Mayhew defends N Ireland committee Sir Patrick Mayhew last night insisted that the establishment of a Northern Ireland select committee would have 'no adverse effect whatsoever' on the Ulster talks process. The Northern Ireland secretary made the assertion as MPs voted to set up such a committee by a majority of 103 (324-221). A Labour amendment to give the body more powers than those proposed by the government was defeated by 58 votes (298-240). The move will be widely seen as a reinforcement of the government's commitment to the province's unionist majority. Another cross-party committee of MPs will now deliberate on the detailed composition of the new body, which may start work soon after Easter. According to Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, ministers have recommended that 13 MPs should sit on it and that the government should be expected 'to be able to command a majority'. The Tory proposals are thought to call for six of the 13 members to be Conservatives, with the government's effective majority kept intact by the presence of Sir James Kilfedder, the usually loyal Ulster Popular Unionist MP for North Down. Sir Patrick was goaded into his one-sentence intervention in last night's debate by a Social Democratic and Labour party claim that government consent for the committee was a 'political act'. Mr Eddie McGrady, SDLP MP for South Down, urged MPs to reject the government's proposal and support political talks between Northern Ireland's main political parties and the peace process 'against which this proposal will impact'. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, accused the government of allowing short-term party interest to take priority over the peace process. The 'primary reason' that the government had conceded a select committee was the need to maintain the 'understanding' reached with the Ulster Unionist party in return for the support of its nine MPs in crucial Maastricht votes. Mr McNamara also complained bitterly about the government's proposals for Labour to have only two seats on the committee and the SDLP only one. Ministers were proposing to 'gerrymander the composition of the committee,' he said. Opposition concerns were partly echoed by Mr Peter Temple-Morris, the Tory MP for Leominster, who warned that the move would be perceived as 'integrationist'. Mr William McCrea, the hardline Democratic Unionist MP for Mid Ulster, said he was 'delighted' that MPs would now have the right to scrutinise Northern Ireland ministers. 'Direct rule is remote. Ministers have to be brought to book,' he said.</p>

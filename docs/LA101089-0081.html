			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LEADER OF FAILED PANAMA COUP IS BURIED  </P> <P> The army major who led the unsuccessful coup against Gen. Manuel A. Noriega was  buried Monday, and opposition leader Guillermo Endara ended a 19-day hunger  strike.  </P> <P> Several reports have said that an enraged Noriega personally shot Maj. Moises  Giroldi Vega to death minutes after the coup attempt against the Panamanian  leader ended a week ago.  </P> <P> Relatives of Giroldi, 38, said that he was shot once in the neck and twice in  the chest. His mother, Eloisa, cried "They murdered him!" and flung herself on  the coffin.  </P> <P> The major led an uprising Oct. 3 and captured Noriega, who commands the Panama  Defense Forces and controls the government, but gave up when loyalists  counterattacked while U.S. troops looked on from a few hundred yards away.  </P> <P> Defense Forces officials said that eight officers and two sergeants were  killed. They have not explained the circumstances or responded to reports that  some were slain after surrendering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Medical Bulletin  </P> <P> Endara ended his fast and entered a clinic to "normalize my body's system."  </P> <P> A medical bulletin said that his "conscious process was excellent and his  conversation coherent," but he was suffering "from progressive debilitation."  </P> <P> The opposition leader has urged Panamanians to delay paying taxes and utility  bills and to shun the government-operated lottery and casinos, on which the  regime has depended for much of its revenue during the past 18 months.  </P> <P> The United States has applied economic sanctions and other pressure against  Panama to try to topple Noriega since federal grand juries in Florida indicted  him early last year on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.  </P> <P> Noriega asserts that all efforts to oust him, including those undertaken by his  local opponents here, are part of a U.S. plot to renege on the 1977 treaties  that turned the Panama Canal over to this country in 1979. The continuing U.S.  roles in the operation and defense of the canal are scheduled to end for good  Dec. 31, 1999.  </P> <P> At a news conference, Endara said he felt his hunger strike was a success. He  said the opposition did not look with approval on Giroldi's attempted coup  because it represented "Noriega-ism without Noriega," not a movement toward  democracy.  </P> <P> Capt. Leon Tejada, another rebel, was buried at the same small red stone church  over the weekend. "He had one bullet wound in the right temple," said Tejada's  mother, Esther, who was at the church again for Giroldi's burial.  </P> <P> About 100 people attended the funeral Mass for Giroldi.  </P> <P> "They were good friends," Esther Tejada said. "My son had just come back from  (U.N. duty in) Namibia last Saturday. On Tuesday he told his wife he had to go  to headquarters and would return later to go see his baby girl.  </P> <P> "We did not hear anything until Wednesday when they said on television that he  was dead. We picked up the body."  </P> <P> Giroldi's widow and three children did not attend. They have been under U.S.  Army protection at Ft. Clayton here since the coup attempt.  </P> <P> Defense Forces officials say that the rebels surrendered after nearly five  hours of negotiations with Noriega, who was their hostage at Defense Forces  headquarters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Helms Blames Noriega  </P> <P> Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and several U.S. publications have said Noriega  personally shot Giroldi in the final moments of the doomed uprising.  </P> <P> Endara, the opposition's presidential candidate in May, took refuge in the  Vatican's embassy after soldiers beat him and threw him out of his office  Thursday. Shortly before the assault, Noriega claimed he had evidence that the  United States planned to install Endara as president.  </P> <P> Foreign observers and the Roman Catholic Church here said that Endara's ticket  won the May 7 election by a 3-1 margin, but Noriega had the results annulled  May 10. U.S. officials have said they consider Endara the legitimate president  of Panama.  </P></p>

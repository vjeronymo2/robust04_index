			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Last-minute talks to avert rail strike: US business likely to be hit severely if stoppage goes ahead THE threat of a national rail strike which could wreak havoc with freight traffic hung over corporate America yesterday as unions and carriers fought to settle a three-year contract dispute. Both sides warned that a stoppage was possible if agreement were not reached on a new labour contract by midnight yesterday. The United Transportation Union, largest of the 11 unions involved in the contract talks, said it had already sent out strike notices to members. If no progress were made they could be on strike from 7am today. It added, however, that it was joining the talks, due to restart in Washington yesterday, between labour and management and was still 'hopeful' that a stoppage could be averted. On the carriers' side, the Association of American Railroads was gloomier, suggesting that a strike was 'very likely' if negotiations proved fruitless. The dispute has been almost three years in the making, as the two sides attempted to hammer out a new contract. Under US legislation, labour agreements in the rail industry are initially kept in force while new contract negotiations take place. If no progress is made, the next step is for a presidential emergency board to study the situation and recommend a settlement. The board recommendation, delivered in mid-January, suggested wage increases averaging between 3 and 4 per cent a year over the next three years, but also called for the number of miles which train crews have to travel for a normal day's pay to be steadily increased. It also suggested that labour should shoulder some of the mounting health benefit expenses in the industry. The report was not greeted with enthusiasm by the union camp. Procedurally, however, its publication started a 'cooling-off period', which was extended because of the Gulf war. But by yesterday morning, with 12 hours to go before the final expiry of the grace period, only three of the 11 unions involved had reached tentative agreements with management. There seems little doubt the effects of a national strike on business would be dire. About a third of the total freight moved around the US goes by rail, and the coal, car, chemicals, grain and steel industries are among the heaviest users. Much of this could not be shipped any other way, and there have been suggestions that a reduction in coal operations could take place within hours. Chrysler warned yesterday that a rail strike 'of any length could result in massive closings' of its plants. Some rail companies, such as Burlington Northern, have made clear that they will not even attempt to operate if a national strike begins. The railroads association says this policy could become widespread among its members. National unemployment, it has been calculated, could surge by around half a million as the result of a national stoppage. However, the unions have not revealed their strike tactics, and more selective action is at least an option. How the rail companies would respond in these circumstances was not clear. Equally, politicians might take the matter into their own hands - as they have done in previous rail disputes. Mr Samuel Skinner, transportation secretary, pointed out yesterday that previous rail strikes had been swiftly ended by Congress and he hoped this one could be resolved in as little as a day. He said the administration was ready to work with Congress as quickly as Congress wanted to move.</p>

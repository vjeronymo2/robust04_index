			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Survey of Kyushu (2): Locals weather the storm - The city banks licking their wounds IF THE international banking community had reservations about the rapid spread of Japanese commercial banks' influence in the 1980s, Japan's smaller regional banks had real reason for concern about the tougher domestic competition that would flow from financial liberalisation. In the late 1980s, the regional banks could see that the commercial, or city banks as they are known in Japan, were courting their customers, bolstering networks outside Tokyo and preparing to take advantage of interest rate deregulation, due to be completed by 1994. But, in Kyushu, while the Tokyo and Osaka-based city banks are counting the costs of expansion during late 1980s and still calculating the problem loans arising from their exposure to the troubled property market, the regional banks are now more relaxed. Instead of taking Kyushu banks' customers, the city banks are selling loans to the regional banks in an attempt to trim assets. And Bank of Japan research shows that while city bank lending in Kyushu fell by 4.2 per cent in June and 3.9 per cent in July, compared to a year earlier, local bank lending rose by 5.4 per cent and 6.9 per cent during the same two months. Mr Tatsuta Goto, president of the Nishi-Nippon Bank, based in Fukuoka, smiled as he contemplated the waning potential threat from the big city heavyweights: 'We have no problems with the city banks here. There are too many banks in Fukuoka, but it is the city banks which are weaker.' Fukuoka prefecture has Japan's largest number of regional bank branches  - 442, almost 50 per cent more than the next largest collection in Shizuoka prefecture, near Tokyo, and double the number in most prefectures. As a result, the area's smaller banks are ripe for the mergers that the Ministry of Finance presumes will come with liberalisation, but city banks, too, have faced tougher than usual competition. With Fukuoka city rapidly becoming the Tokyo of Kyushu, smaller banks in other areas on the island have attempted to expand their operations in the city, adding to the forest of signs in the already overcrowded banking district. Like the city banks, some of those regional institutions have found that the ebbing financial tide of the early 1990s has exposed unwise expansion made during the 1980s. The newcomers, large and small, were also willing to lend to local companies that had exhausted their credit with the established banks. One side-effect of the increased lending is the 3,000 vacant apartments in Fukuoka city built by property developers who, along with the banks, got the market wrong. Mr Goto insists, apartments aside, that Fukuoka has avoided the extreme excesses seen in Tokyo and Osaka. He admits that some companies have been forced to restructure their loans but says that, for Nishi-Nippon, non-performing loans are not a particularly heavy burden. 'We have always looked at the quality of our assets. If we are evaluating a troubled company, we will look at the policies of the management and, for example, whether they have a good stock of land. If their long-term prospects are good, we will assist them,' Mr Goto said. The Nagasaki-based Eighteenth Bank also appears to have weathered the 1980s successfully by concentrating on its local banking network. It has 125 branches, 110 of them in Nagasaki prefecture and another 10 in Fukuoka prefecture, and new branches are planned for the northern Kyushu area. Mr Genji Nozaki, the bank's president, said that his institution had bought about 'six or seven loans' from city banks that were trimming their assets, although he sensed that, in the longer-term, these banks would pose a threat to the regional banks' profits. 'Real liberalisation has yet to come. If interest rates are actually liberalised, we really can't say what will happen. It would certainly be more difficult for the smaller banks to compete,' Mr Nozaki said. 'It is also true that the city banks are not as strong as they were three years ago,' he added. Both Mr Nozaki and Mr Goto at Nishi-Nippon are former finance ministry officials, a common background for regional bank heads. Both are determined to keep their banks above the 8 per cent capital-to-assets ratio that was established through the Bank for International Settlements. The BIS ratio at Nishi-Nippon was 8.18 at the end of March, compared to 8.66 a year earlier, while Eighteenth Bank was at around 9 per cent in March 1991 and 8.65 per cent last March. Mr Nozaki said that the best way to safeguard the bank's financial standing was to concentrate on the local community. With this in mind, it launched a corporate identity campaign with a three-pronged slogan - banking, together with the community, in the interests of the customer, and with sincerity. The slogan is somewhat snappier in the original Japanese. The Kyushu banking community need only turn to the Fukuoka stock exchange for a lesson on how large financial institutions can quickly consume the local competition. Mr Fubito Shimomura, president of the exchange, lamented that in 1949, there were 24 local brokers, of which only one remains. 'It's really a bit unfortunate. The brokers here these days are Nomura Securities and Yamaichi Securities and so on. The others no longer exist,' Mr Shimomura said. He said Fukuoka was really 'just one floor' in the one Japanese market, with 25 of 252 stocks listed only on his exchange and the others based in Tokyo or elsewhere. About 62 Kyushu companies are interested in listing, but the stock market weakness over the past two years has forced companies waiting for better times.  --------------------------------------------------------------                         BANK LENDING  --------------------------------------------------------------                       City banks           Regional banks                 % up on year earlier    % up on year earlier  -------------------------------------------------------------- 1989                     9.7                    10.6 1990                     2.6                     6.7 1991                    -1.6                     5.6 1992      May                -3.0                     8.0      June               -4.2                     5.4      July               -3.9                     6.9  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Federation Francaise des Societes d'Assurance  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

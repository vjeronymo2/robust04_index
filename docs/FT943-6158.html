			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Formula set for cost of transporting gas One of the main planks of the planned liberalisation of the domestic gas market was put in place yesterday with the announcement of a new pricing formula for British Gas's national pipeline system, the centrepiece of the company's operations. The price cap and rate of return announced by Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, is an important element of the government's plan to introduce competition into the domestic market beginning in 1996, because transportation costs account for about half of the final price of gas to consumers. The formula will govern the prices TransCo, the new name for British Gas's transport and gas storage business, can charge users of the national gas grid. These include the trading arm of British Gas and the growing number of independent gas marketers. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said future price increases by TransCo would be limited by a formula based on the retail price index minus 5 percentage points. It will take effect in October and run until 1997. The starting price level of 14.16p per therm will also take effect on October 1. Ms Spottiswoode said RPI-minus-5 was a 'demanding but fair target for British Gas'. Ofgas said British Gas should be able to achieve a real rate of return of 6.5-7.5 per cent on new investment and 4-4.5 per cent on existing assets. Both figures are in line with recommendations contained in last year's Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the gas industry. British Gas had wanted a higher rate of return on TransCo assets, but it said yesterday's announcement was expected. Some of its competitors had lobbied Ofgas for a much stricter formula. They had also asked for a root-and-branch revaluation of TransCo's assets, which they claim are overvalued. Mr John Astrop, commercial director of Kinetica Gas, a joint venture between PowerGen and Conoco, said yesterday's announcement was 'an acceptable interim solution'. But he said that Ofgas' decision not to focus on the asset valuation issue will 'give British Gas an easy ride' until 1997.</p>

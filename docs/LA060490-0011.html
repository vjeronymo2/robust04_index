			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: WHEN IT COMES TO INSULTS, ALL IS NOT FAIR AT THE FAIRE  </P> <P> Even in an age of assertiveness, Andrew the Ugly (that's what it says on his  business card) stands out.  </P> <P> For a dollar, he'll insult the victim of your choice.  </P> <P> And not just street-corner, in-your-face insults, but insults with a Monty  Python tang or an Olde English flair.  </P> <P> Scalding oaths such as, "Go away or I'll unclog my nose at you," or "Your  mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries."  </P> <P> Or, my favorite, "You're an anal-retentive son of an impotent boil-popper."  </P> <P> Andrew, a.k.a. Andrew Cameron, 23, a resident of Ocean Beach and student at  Mesa College, peddles his insouciant insolence at Renaissance/pleasure fairs  throughout the state, including the San Marcos Renaissance Faire each October.  </P> <P> A good insult, he says, "is pleasing to the ear and offensive to the soul."  </P> <P> The insult trade, of course, leans heavily on an excremental vision and concern  with bodily functions: "You festering heap of yak dung," "You shovelful of  sun-laden camel snot," etc.  </P> <P> On a good day, he can hurl 50 to 60 insults.  </P> <P> "I take frequent breaks," he said. "I have to think up new material, recompose  myself and let my voice rest."  </P> <P> He's never been punched, but he was ruled out of bounds by the  Renaissance-Pleasure Faire now under way at Glen Helen Regional Park in San  Bernardino. The faire fathers ruled that insults were not in keeping with the  period theme.  </P> <P> "Cow cookies," responds Andrew the Ugly. "The Elizabethans were a very bawdy  group."  </P> <P> He notes that the fair is also selling artichokes and churros (Mexican sweet  breads), delicacies unknown in Renaissance times.  </P> <P> Still, he's not letting his insult-ouster keep him away. He has merely shifted  to his secondary specialties:  </P> <P> Dung sales and creative passing-out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sorting Things Out  </P> <P> Voice of the people.  </P> <P> * The San Diego Libertarian Party plans a float in the North Park Toyland  Parade next December.  </P> <P> But the group is stumped for a politically appropriate entry.  </P> <P> Among the suggestions: A Bureaucratic Briefcase Brigade (talking gibberish, of  course), a Boston Tea Party tableau, or Anti-Tax Muppets.  </P> <P> * Lead from political story by San Diego bureau of United Press International:  </P> <P> "Political candidates who want to bag votes in California's second-largest city  need only utter four words -- 'I'm against The Merger.' "  </P> <P> * One of the initiatives that has not yet qualified for the statewide ballot is  the Starvation Initiative being circulated by Eleanor George of San Diego.  </P> <P> It calls for the state Legislature to urge Congress to buy breakfast for  everyone on earth once a year.  </P> <P> I wonder if McDonald's can handle takeout for 5.2 billion?  </P> <P> * Advice from political consultant and Cardiff resident Jack Orr: "Never say  anything good about your opponent, unless it's false."  </P> <P> </P> <P> On Top of Things  </P> <P> It's true, whether it happened or not.  </P> <P> * Whip those avocados.  </P> <P> Forget what you've heard about Fallbrook being a fuddy-duddy retirement  community.  </P> <P> Lambada lessons are being given at the local Community Center.  </P> <P> * There will not be a Mercedes-Benz television commercial shot atop Horton  Plaza. Too many hassles, says the Chamber of Commerce's Motion Picture and  Television Bureau.  </P> <P> * So many hydrants, so few firefighters.  </P> <P> The state fire marshal and the San Diego Fire Department today will introduce  Buggs and Sam, the first dogs to graduate from Accelerant Detection School.  </P> <P> The two Labrador retrievers will aid in arson investigations throughout the  state.  </P> <P> * I like that new subdivision sign at Interstate 15 and Via Rancho Parkway in  Escondido:  </P> <P> "Montclair," and beneath it, "Gated Country Estates."  </P> <P> Woodsy ambience and fortress security. The North County ideal.  </P></p>

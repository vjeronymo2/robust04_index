			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A BRIGHT start to the stock index futures was soon reversed by disappointing corporate results and volatile trading, write Christopher Price and Joel Kibazo. The March contract opened strongly at 2,564 on the back of a firm Wall Street overnight and improved performance by Tokyo; by 9am it had moved swiftly to its high point of the day of 2,572. However, figures from Shell Transport knocked March sharply, and it reached a low point for the day of 2,545 by 11am. Positive sentiment from the other European bourses began to rub off on the London market after midday and the FT-SE futures commenced a slow recovery. In spite of a lacklustre start, Wall Street picked up and March followed suit, ending the day at 2,564, up 14 on the previous session and some 11 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. Turnover reached 6,422 contracts. In the LTOM, traders reported a 'directionless' session with turnover coming to 23,112 contracts. The FT-SE Index option traded 6,624 lots. Glaxo was the busiest stock option on 4,330 contracts dealt, with the March 600 calls the most active series. This was followed by BTR with a day's total of 2,678 lots.</p>

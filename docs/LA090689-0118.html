			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> Six years after opening in a trailer in San Clemente, Mission Valley Bank  finally has managed to see construction of its headquarters begin next door in  what will become the Mission Valley Bank Plaza.  </P> <P> The bank will occupy 12,000 square feet of the 14,000-square-foot structure at  the corner of Avenida Palizada and El Camino Real. Construction is expected to  be completed next spring.  </P> <P> The plaza is a joint venture between Steve Samuelian of Emerald Development in  San Juan Capistrano and four bank directors -- Stewart S. Mortensen, Jack R.  Barnes, Fred Debs and John Gorny. Mortensen is the bank's chairman and Barnes  is president. Each group owns 50%.  </P> <P> The bank sold the land to the joint venture for $1.4 million, making a gain of  $500,000. The joint venture borrowed $2 million from competitor Mariner's Bank  for construction and will lease the structure back to Mission Valley Bank for a  long term at market value. The joint venture would not reveal the monthly lease  payment because it intends to rent the remaining space to other firms.  </P> <P> As of the end of August, Mission Valley Bank had earned $574,000 for the year,  more than the once-sleepy bank had made in any previous year. It has about $34  million in assets.  </P></p>

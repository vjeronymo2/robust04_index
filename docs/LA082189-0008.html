			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIM OF SOVIET OPPOSITION IS FINDING BEST WAYS TO FEED AND CLOTHE THE COUNTRY  </P> <P> When Boris N. Yeltsin made an official statement before the Supreme Soviet  about the creation of the Inter-Regional Caucus of People's Deputies, some  members questioned our timing and our patriotism.  </P> <P> The advocates of "monolithic unity" say that we are trying to split the  2,250-strong Congress of People's Deputies. We are against a split, but we are  for a democratic parliament in which deputies are not pawns in the Kremlin's  game. We are full-fledged political figures with the legitimate right to create  groups inside the parliament based on an array of political, economic and other  vital interests. Working together, it is easier to act the way the voters want  us to.  </P> <P> The inter-regional caucus includes farmers, workers, doctors, engineers,  writers and scientists. There are about 400 of us thus far -- deputies from all  of the Soviet republics except Turkmenia. The platform that united us was  explained in the first issue of the paper People's Deputy, which the group  issued for the opening of its conference:  </P> <P> "The level of life continues to decline catastrophically. How can we clothe and  feed the country? There are different ways. We need the shortest and the most  effective. The majority at the Congress (of People's Deputies) refused to  embark on this. The solution of crucial problems is being postponed  indefinitely. Hence the strikes and the aggravation of ethnic and social  tensions. The Inter-Regional Caucus of People's Deputies of the U.S.S.R. has  set forth the task of uniting all the healthy forces toward taking the country  out of the crisis."  </P> <P> Our caucus sees the way out in more radical perestroika reforms: transition of  all power to the people and the land and the means of production to the working  people. According to an opinion poll, 83% of caucus members stand for the  political and economic self-determination of the Soviet republics.  </P> <P> On the eve of the last day of the Congress of People's Deputies in June, we  worked well into the night writing the "manifesto" of our inter-regional  caucus. The manifesto was signed by more than 150 deputies. In the morning we  asked the Presidium to give us an opportunity to read the document at the  session. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev talked me into postponing the  announcement. His arguments were very persuasive: Houses were being set on fire  in Fergana, Uzbekistan, and clouds of ethnic tension were thickening in other  regions. We agreed and also postponed the conference that was to finalize the  creation of our caucus.  </P> <P> At last the conference was held at the end of July. It worked out a program of  action and a package of alternative draft laws to be submitted to the Supreme  Soviet for discussion.  </P> <P> Such a caucus is an unprecedented phenomenon on the Soviet political scene.  Probably this explains the apprehensive attitude of some members of the upper  echelon. Our opponents want to pit the country's leaders against us by alleging  that we are trying to knock together the core of a future opposition party or a  shadow Supreme Soviet, despite the fact that there are 90 members of the  present Supreme Soviet in our caucus and that Gorbachev recognizes its status.  </P> <P> Moscow's bureaucracy wants to present our conference as the attempt of Yeltsin,  the "troublemaker," to assert himself as the indisputable leader of the pack.  This is not true. On the eve of the conference, we, the members of its  organizing body, discussed in a room at the Hotel Moskva the question of  chairmanship. The majority named Yeltsin. But Yeltsin was the one who suggested  a co-chairmanship. We could not come to an agreement and decided to sleep on  it.  </P> <P> When the debates began at the conference the next morning, the chair on which  Yeltsin was sitting suddenly collapsed. I noticed because I was sitting next to  him and joked that this was a symbol of the collapse of totalitarian authority  in our country.  </P> <P> Anyway, we made a choice in favor of collective leadership. The conference  nominated a 25-person coordinating council of the caucus and elected its five  co-chairmen: Yeltsin, Yuri N. Afanasyev, Viktor Palm, Gavriil Popov and Andrei  D. Sakharov.  </P> <P> Now the session is over. The deputies have gone back to their constituents.  Time will show whether the voters believe in our ideas.  </P></p>

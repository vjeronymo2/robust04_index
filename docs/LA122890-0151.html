			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: CENTRAL EL TORO: CLIPBOARD  </P> <P> For many long-term residents of Orange County, a drive through central El Toro  brings back many fond memories of family outings and picnics in the nearby  Cleveland National Forest.  </P> <P> "It was the place we stopped for cold drinks and candy before heading up to  Modjeska Canyon on Sunday afternoons," said Sharon Rhodes, who recently moved  to El Toro from Garden Grove. "That was in the '50s."  </P> <P> The neighborhood was very rural then; not many people lived here. But that's  hardly the case now. In fact, this area has been the center of some of Orange  County's most ferocious growth during the last 10 years. Since 1980, there has  been a 166% increase in the population and an almost 200% growth in the number  of households. It's hard to believe that as recently as 1970, fewer than a  thousand people lived here.  </P> <P> Despite the growth and construction of several large housing and condominium  developments throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, the neighborhood has not  completely lost its country atmosphere. Greenbelts shaded by eucalyptus trees  wind throughout, providing pathways and trails between the houses. Many of the  residences look like mountain cabins and are bordered by wood and stone fences.  The area is rustic, with a touch of elegance.  </P> <P> El Toro High School is located here, along with Serrano Intermediate and two  elementary schools. In the mornings and afternoons, the streets and sidewalks  are crowded with cars and children walking, skating and cycling home from  school.  </P> <P> Barbara Smith, principal of Serrano Intermediate, said the wooded area  surrounding the school gives it a secluded, quiet atmosphere conducive to  learning. "The kids are very active, of course, but the surroundings here are  very pleasant."  </P> <P> Serrano Intermediate was recently awarded a $40,000 California Technology  Grant, which was used to install laser discs and computers in the science  classrooms. "We are participating in a statewide program designed to reduce the  dropout rate. So we decided to make our teaching methods more active, trying  new ways to engage the students instead of having them just sit and listen,"  she said. "We've even started on a robotics program."  </P> <P> Every year, the school receives more and more students of various ethnicities  who need help learning English. "We videotape the child speaking in his native  language, and later on we tape them speaking English. It's very encouraging for  new students to see how others have progressed," she said.  </P> <P> There are two parks in Central El Toro: Ranchwood Park, which has a playground  designed for toddlers, and Lake Forest Park, which includes a small wilderness  area.  </P> <P> El Toro is an unincorporated area that receives services from the county. But  efforts to incorporate are under way, and early next year this neighborhood  could become the center of Orange County's newest city.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1990 est.) 21,808  </P> <P> 1980-90 change: +166.4%  </P> <P> Median Age: 32.6  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 85%  </P> <P> Latino: 6%  </P> <P> Black: 1%  </P> <P> Other: 8%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 32.0 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 33.1 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $17,856  </P> <P> Median household: $52,081  </P> <P> Average household: $53,740  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 14%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 34%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 33%  </P> <P> $75,000-$99,999: 11%  </P> <P> $100,000 and more: 8%JANICE L.

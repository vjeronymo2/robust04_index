			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  THE STAR </H5>   Action Urged Against Drug-Trafficking -- In a somber  editorial the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 24 May on page  16 writes that "one of the darker consequencies of South  Africa's return to world respectability is the danger already  being posed by the import of hard drugs. Huge increases over  recent years in the confiscated amounts of LSD, heroin and  cocaine attest to this." The editorial further warns of some of  the social characteristics in South Africa that may encourage  those who peddle in the drug trade. "Our fragile new democracy,  with its vast numbers of unemployed on the streets and an  entrenched tradition of lawlessness, must look particularly  fruitful to them."  <H5>  BUSINESS DAY </H5>   KwaZulu Land Deal Viewed -- "The transfer of 1.2 million  hectares of land to a trust controlled by King Goodwill  Zwelithini does not appear to be, in itself, cause for concern,  which in some circles is reaching almost hysterical  proportions," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on  24 May in a page 14 editorial. "The affected rural areas of  KwaZulu/Natal are among the country's most overpopulated and  overfarmed and could hardly be redistributed to newcomers."  "What is disturbing, though, is the way the measure was  furtively pushed through, and the implications this has for  peace in KwaZulu/Natal." "The last thing the country needed on  the eve of the opening of the new Parliament was questions about  the good faith of De Klerk and Buthelezi, representing the  non-ANC sectors of the new government."  <H5>  SUNDAY NATION </H5>   SDU's Criticized -- "Self-Defence Units [SDU] have played a  sterling role in the protection of our communities in the past  three to four years," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in  English on 22 May in a page 6 editorial. "They succeeded where  the formal enforcement agencies failed." After commending the  SDU's, however, the editorial states that "what is amply  apparent is that the SDUs have, in some cases, decayed into  bands of criminals masquerading as defenders of our  communities." To remedy this situation, 2 courses of action  need to be followed: first, "the element of transperancy" in  community policing needs to be established; second, "we must  disarm the SDUs. Neither of this will be easy. There is still  a great deal of suspicion, and justifiably so." The editorial  thens floats the possibility of integrating the SDU's into the  police force: "Incorporating members of the SDUs into a new  police force must not be rejected out of hand."</p>

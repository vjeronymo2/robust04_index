			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS;  </P> <P> INDIVIDUAL TASKS  </P> <P> Congratulations for publishing "Restaurateurs Give a Second Opinion, and a  Third, Fourth" (June 25).  </P> <P> It was gratifying to see restaurant owners Robert Bigonnet, Gerald Ferry and  Jerry Bakalyan respond to the "power" of restaurant critic Ruth Reichl.  </P> <P> I have never had high regard for food critics and seldom read their articles,  simply because they typically use condemning phrases that "kill" an  establishment without adequately describing the problem.  </P> <P> A critic's taste and opinion is his, mine is mine, and taste defies  description. Can you describe the taste of an apple? Orange sorbet has an  orange taste, lemon sorbet has a lemon taste.  </P> <P> I would expect rose sorbet to taste like roses, or as Ruth Reichl says "iced  perfume," so why order it? If you like rose sorbet, rate it with rose sorbets  or roses. Hey! Maybe Chanel No. 5 has a new market outlet.  </P> <P> JAMES H. HOLLEY  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

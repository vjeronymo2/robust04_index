			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Hong Kong, the moral responsibility Sir, Your editorial, 'Hong Kong: the next stage' (December 17), suggested that if serious uncertainties about the future of Hong Kong were aroused, Britain would have to reconsider the issue of passports. The time has come to ask once again whether it is morally and politically justifiable for Britain to hand over 6m people to Chinese communist rule in 1997, given Peking's blatant disregard for the promise of 'a high degree of autonomy' enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration. Peking's refusal to permit democratic elections has been clearly demonstrated in the 17 rounds of fruitless Sino-British negotiations. Besides democracy, the colony's legal and judicial framework and the preservation of civil liberties are all in doubt. As Chris Patten, the governor, admitted to your newspaper: 'It would be failure if I wasn't able to persuade China that Hong Kong is mature, sophisticated, modest in its political ambitions and capable of doing a lot more to look after its own affairs. I would have failed if I hadn't been able to persuade China that politics in a free society is no threat.' It looks like Mr Patten has failed. If so, where does this leave Britain's moral and political responsibility for the way of life of the people of Hong Kong?

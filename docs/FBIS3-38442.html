			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed NI; JR: "Yasir 'Arafat Visits Switzerland; </F> First Official Meeting With Federal Council Members"; as  released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Bern, 27 Jan (ATSA) -- Yasir 'Arafat will meet with  Federal Council members Otto Stich and Flavio Cotti in Bern on  Monday [31 January]. In the view of the Federal Department of  Foreign Affairs [DFAE], this event culminates a 20-year discreet  but sustained dialogue with the PLO. It also demonstrates  Switzerland's desire to continue its contribution, "which is  real," to a peace process described in Bern as "irreversible."    Support for the Middle East peace process is one of  Switzerland's main foreign policy priorities, Ambassador  Heinrich Reimann, head of the DFAE Political Section II  (responsible mainly for the Middle East issue) explained on  Thursday. He said: "What is happening in that region also has  an effect on our country." In addition to Mr. 'Arafat, Flavio  Cotti will meet with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa in Bern  on Friday, and with Shim'on Peres, his Israeli counterpart, at  the Davos Forum. Mr. Peres and Mr. 'Arafat will hold talks in  Davos.  <H5>  PLO Office in Bern </H5>   Since Israel and the PLO signed the agreement on autonomy in  the occupied territories last September, Switzerland has tried  to step up its dialogue with the Palestinian representatives.  Two days after the signing of the PLO-Israel agreement, the  Federal Council accepted the principle of opening a PLO office  in Bern. This office, however, cannot represent the "Palestinian  state" proclaimed in 1988.    In accordance with international law, Bern only recognizes  states defined by the three criteria of international law.  These criteria, which must be recognized by the international  community, cover the notions of people, territory, and  government. "We have not reached that point," Ambassador  Reimann noted on Thursday.  <H5>  A 20-Year Dialogue </H5>   Switzerland has long recognized the PLO as an essential  political force within the peace process framework. He stressed  that a sustained dialogue has existed since the seventies, when  the PLO opened its mission at the United Nations in Geneva. It  was not until December 1992, however, that the DFAE named Nabil  Ramlawi, PLO UN representative, as its official interlocutor. In  1981, Federal Council member Pierre Aubert even had a meeting in  Bern with Faruq Qaddumi, PLO foreign affairs "minister." A  second meeting was held in Tunis in 1985.    Repeated contacts were also held during international  conferences. The PLO was not the only beneficiary: Meetings  also took place in the occupied territories with Palestinian  representatives who reject the peace process. This policy of  dialogue has often offended Israel in recent years. According to  Ambassador Reimann, however, it reflects a conviction held by  the Federal Council: Israel's right to existence within secure  borders is inseparable from the Palestinian people's right to  self-determination.    Switzerland, which has been more discreet than Norway, for  example, nonetheless has its "creative contribution to make,"  Mr. Reimann said. In particular, to enable the peace process to  be balanced, Switzerland believes it necessary to "support the  weakest partner." The 60 million francs Bern released between  1994 and 1998 to help the Palestinians illustrate this concern.</p>

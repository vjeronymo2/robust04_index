			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 4 (CNS) -- Inflation in China has now  reached the limit of urban residents' tolerance with market  prices tending to continue upwards, a market researcher with the  Ministry of Internal Trade, Mr. Xu Rongchang, said. He added  that the authorities should strengthen control on prices.    Mr. Xu Rongchang said that the marcoeconomic situation was  generally sound during the first quarter of this year but the  prices growth continued to climb based on a rather high figure  of last year. National retail prices rose by 20.1 percent  during the first quarter over the same period last year, a gain  exceeding the prices growth registered in 1988.    Mr. Xu said he was convinced that inflation had just about  reached the limits of endurance for a large number of residents.  In rural areas, gains in income earned by peasants was lower  than that by urban workers for the sixth consecutive year. The  endurance of peasants has become so fragile when taking into  consideration a total of 85 million people who have not yet  solved their food and clothing problems, in addition to peasants  in disaster areas. In urban areas, with the problems of  inflation and unfair distribution prevailing, an increasing  number of workers have seen their income cut and they have  tended to have a strong response to the price hikes.    The researcher called for an immediate strengthening of  macroeconomic regulation to prevent economic overheating. He  also appealed for the making use of a prime chance to push  forward price reform. The food package project should be  properly carried out while at the same time prices should be put  under control in order to keep prices growth at the set target  of not more than 10 percent.</p>

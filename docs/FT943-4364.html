			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Parker's alto sax sells for Pounds 93,500 The saxophone played by Charlie 'Bird' Parker at the 'Quintet of the Year' concert in Massey Hall, Toronto, in 1953 sold for Pounds 93,500 yesterday at Christie's, South Kensington. The alto sax, made of plastic by Grafton of London, tripled its estimate. It was bought by Mr Emanuel Cleaver, mayor of Kansas City, which is creating a jazz museum. Parker, who was born in Kansas City, died in 1955 at the age of 35 after long addiction to drink and drugs. It was the first time an auction house had offered a large collection of memorabilia linked to a jazz star, and the 83 lots, sent for sale by Parker's last partner, Chan, sold well above estimate for Pounds 206,657. Among the keenest buyers for mementos of the hard-living pioneer of bebop was Hard Rock Cafe which paid Pounds 4,400 for Parker's autograph arrangement of the song 'Summertime' and Pounds 2,420 for his driving licence. The auction totalled Pounds 408,852, a record for a Christie's pop memorabilia sale. A bass drumskin used by and inscribed by the Beatles sold for Pounds 11,500 while a black satin bustier worn by Madonna on her 'Who's That Girl' tour was comfortably on target, fetching Pounds 4,400. The Ivy League-style cardigan worn by Barbra Streisand in the movie 'The Way We Were' was right at the bottom of its estimate at Pounds 2,200.</p>

Background on the Oklahoma Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Oklahoma program. General background information on the Oklahoma program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval of the Oklahoma program can be found in the January 19, 1981,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (46 FR 4902). Subsequent actions concerning Oklahoma's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 936.15, 936.16, and 936.30. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated September 14, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. OK&hyph;964). Oklahoma submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative with the intention of revising the Oklahoma program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oklahoma proposed to revise the Oklahoma Coal Rules and Regulations at Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;3, eligibility for assistance; OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;6, program services and data requirements; and OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;7, applicant liability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the September 27, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 49225), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. OK&hyph;964.03). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting, none was held. The public comment period ended on October 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of Oklahoma's rules at OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;3(a)(2), percentage of ownership and control of the SOAP applicant; OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;6 (a) and (b), extension of SOAP funding to other program services and requirements for collection of specific kinds of data; and OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;7, liability periods. OSM notified Oklahoma of the concerns by letter dated November 22, 1994 (administrative record No. OK&hyph;964.09). Oklahoma responded in a letter dated December 20, 1994, by submitting a revised amendment and additional explanatory information (administrative record No. OK&hyph;964.11). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oklahoma proposes to revise OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;1, definitions, by adding the requirement that the qualified laboratory prepare the other services specified at OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;6; OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;3(a)(2), eligibility for assistance, by requiring that attributable production includes, among other things, production from operations in which the applicant owns more than a 10 percent interest and other operations of persons who own more than 10 percent of the applicant's operation; OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;6, program services and data requirements, by adding the requirement that the program administrator select and pay a qualified laboratory to, in addition to performing specific services, provide other services for eligible operators who request assistance, and by adding references to require the collection of specific data and results provided; and OAC 460:20&hyph;35&hyph;7, applicant liability, by requiring reimbursement for the cost of SOAP services (1) If the applicant's production exceeds the allowable tonnage amount during the 12-month period immediately following the issuance of the permit for which assistance is provided, or, (2) if the permit is sold, transferred, or assigned, the transferee's production exceeds the allowable tonnage amount during the 12-month period immediately following the issuance of the permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Comment Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Oklahoma program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional materials submitted. In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15.

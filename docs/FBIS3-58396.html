From Brussels, where the  meeting of NATO memebers broke up a short time ago, a fresh  warning was launched to the factions fighting in Bosnia. This  time it seems that the alliance is serious in its intention.  Francesco Mattioli reports from Brussels. [passage omitted]    [Mattioli] The Italians present at the meeting, [Prime  Minister] Ciampi and [Foreign Minister] Andreatta are in  agreement with the other countries.    [Begin Ciampi recording] I believe that the decisions made  by  the United Nations already leave open the possibility of air  strikes. [end recording]    [Begin Andreatta recording] It is unimaginable that the  secretary of the United Nations would not authorize actions in  defense of the troops. [end recording]</p>

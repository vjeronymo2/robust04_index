			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over stills of Ataturk and of Prime </F> Minister Ciller]    [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has called on everyone  who is sincerely loyal to Ataturk's principles and reforms to  come to a rally to be held at Taksim Square in Istanbul at 1200  on Monday, 28 February. She invited the president, the speaker  of the Turkish Grand National Assembly [TGNA], all the political  parties except for the Prosperity Party [PP] and the Democracy  Party [DEP], all the democratic establishments, and citizens to  come to the rally. She said: Together, let us oppose those who  are trying to destroy Ataturk's republic, the unity of our  country and nation, and the democratic and secular state order.    In a written statement she issued today, the prime minister  pointed out that the public is deeply concerned that a party  which claims will set up a just order is engaging -- in line  with certain dark intentions and calculations -- in ugly and  extremely dangerous activities aimed against Ataturk and the  secular Turkish state he symbolizes. She added: Regretfully,  it is being observed that some of the representatives of this  party in the TGNA have clearly established a front against our  republic and the secular order which we established with great  difficulty and are trying to uphold, and that they take their  daring and insolence so far as to insult our great leader  Ataturk. It has also been observed that certain deputies,  including a True Path Party [TPP] deputy -- who are all members  of the TGNA, the existence of which we owe to Ataturk himself --  share and support this dark, fanatic, and anachronistic view.  We have the honor of being loyal to Ataturk's principles and we  are proud of this virtue.    Ciller stressed that she will not allow anyone to insult the  great leader Ataturk -- who left an important mark on the 20th  century with his ideas and reforms -- his reforms, or the  secular order. She added: It is impossible for the enemies of  Ataturk to remain in our midst. The TPP has sent this deputy --  whose views we can never share -- to the disciplinary council to  be ousted from the party. It should be known that the action of  these deputies who have taken a stand against secularism, and  who have slandered and thus betrayed the founder of the Turkish  Republic, the great Ataturk, will not remain unanswered.  Whatever is necessary will be done.    Ciller pointed out that now is the time to protect Ataturk  and all his principles and reforms, mainly secularism. She  added: For this purpose, I call on our honorable president, the  speaker of the TGNA, all the political parties except for the PP  and DEP, our democratic establishments, and all our honorable  citizens: Together, let us oppose those who are trying to  destroy Ataturk's republic, the unity of our country and nation,  and the democratic and secular state order. From the president  to the simplest citizens, from deputies to civil servants and  workers, and from prosecutors to students, let us all meet at  the rally of respect to Ataturk we will hold at Taksim Square in  Istanbul at 1200 on Monday, 28 February. We are waiting for all  those who are sincerely loyal to Ataturk and to his principles  and reforms which we protect to come to the Istanbul rally with  Turkish flags in their hands.</p>

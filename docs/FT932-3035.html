			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Turn on to the bigger picture: Andrew Hill and Andrew Adonis examine moves towards the next generation of television hardware Tune in to the latest international debate about what sort of television the world will be watching in the 21st century and you might guess that a repeat is being broadcast. European Community ministers will today discuss an 'action plan' to promote wide-screen television services in Europe. It is the sixth time ministers have debated such a plan since the Commission put forward the idea in April 1992. The crucial issues in the debate remain unchanged. What steps should the EC take to encourage the next generation of television hardware? And how much should it spend on promoting advanced television for Europe? The international television industry now has to choose from a menu of options including wide-screen television, digital transmission technology and high-definition, cinema-quality pictures. The choice is a complex one because the options are not mutually exclusive. In Europe, the priority in the action plan is to promote a shift towards broadcasting normal definition TV on wider screens. The proposed EC plan would not tie the industry to any particular transmission technology. Britain is blocking agreement on the plan because it believes the proposed funding - down from the original Ecu850m to Ecu228m - is still too lavish. Meanwhile, in Japan, HDTV has arrived, using existing analogue technology. But the price of HDTV receiver sets has only just come down through the symbolic Y1m (Pounds 6,250) mark, and programming is both scarce and bland. Greater strides have been made in the US, where three rival consortia agreed three weeks ago to club together and work on a single technical standard for digital HDTV. But there are substantial technical difficulties to be overcome before a working system is in place, and US television stations fear they will not be able to afford the equipment necessary to satisfy the manufacturers' desire for a high-quality system. If mass-market, cinema-quality television still seems a long way off, manufacturers, broadcasters and governments appear to have learnt from both the mistakes and breakthroughs of the past decade and are working in far greater harmony than the surface turbulence would suggest. Moreover, after seven years spent focusing on the potential of higher-definition technology, they have begun to turn their attention to what consumers actually want from television services - better quality, greater choice, or a combination of the two - and how much they are prepared to pay for them. The trigger for the new debate is the arrival of digital technology, and its extension to television transmission. Digital compression techniques enhance quality and allow far more services to be provided on the same channel. Digital could, for example, permit broadcasters to stagger the start-times of the same film on a movie channel, giving viewers the choice of when to start watching. Digital HDTV has the further advantage that it can be broadcast terrestrially, as well as by cable and satellite, like existing TV. Moreover, the opportunities provided by digital appear to have united old rivals and put paid to Europe's efforts to gain a competitive advantage by setting exclusive HDTV standards - an outcome the European Commission has now accepted. In the US, for example, the Federal Communications Commission, which has to approve an HDTV standard, was originally considering proposals from US, Japanese and European companies. The Japanese analogue proposal was eventually eliminated in February when it became clear that the FCC wanted a digital standard. The 'grand alliance' formed last month includes both Philips and Thomson Consumer Electronics, the Dutch and French electronics groups which were supposed to be among the principal beneficiaries of the EC's original HDTV strategy. Meanwhile, the European Commission, EC governments and industry have given new impetus to the co-ordination of digital research and standardisation. A group set up by Germany's posts and telecommunications ministry is aiming to promote the acceptance of a draft digital standard for ordinary, non-HDTV broadcasts by the end of 1993 and for digital satellite and cable transmissions in Europe as early as 1995. The highly damaging failures of the EC's HDTV legislation in the 1980s are still fresh in the minds of the German organisers. The EC's first efforts to develop an analogue HDTV system were undermined when commercial broadcasters and satellite operators avoided the EC's compulsory transmission standards by transmitting from satellites not affected by the EC legislation. As a result, equipment manufacturers, which had invested heavily in the EC-backed technology, found there were no services for the sets they had developed. This time, the digital group is trying to encourage co-operation between satellite operators, commercial and public broadcasters, manufacturers and national administrations from the outset. In a recent press release the group stressed that it wanted to 'address the needs of European viewers and to proceed with a fully market-led approach'. 'We have to investigate the needs of the user, and learn from the experiences of Mac (the earlier EC HDTV standard),' says Mr Wolfgang Becker of the German telecoms ministry. 'What do the users want, and what are the broadcasters and (manufacturing) industry going to do about it?' Among EC companies, there is cautious optimism about the work of the digital group. Mr Yves Feltes of Societe Europeen des Satellites (SES), one of the pioneers of the standard-quality satellite broadcasts, says SES will be in the vanguard of digital transmission, although it is too early to say whether the co-ordinated approach will work. 'At least this time, the major players are talking to each other,' he points out. Consequently, work on digital technology should also dovetail with the EC's action plan - if it is ever adopted. It would fall to the European Commission to marry the two elements, when it comes up with a formal digital television strategy in the autumn. The aim of EC funding is to stimulate new wide-screen services, thus boosting a consumer electronics market which the Commission believes will eventually be interested in everything that digital HDTV has to offer. As far as the US challenge is concerned, the involvement of Philips and Thomson in the grand alliance, the efforts of the European digital working group and the development of wide-screen television sets in the EC indicate that efforts on both sides of the Atlantic should complement rather than conflict with one another. Philips, for one, says its experience with the US grand alliance will be of use in developing a European digital strategy through the working group. A digital HDTV standard developed by the US grand alliance is unlikely to become the global standard because of technical differences between European, US and Japanese broadcasting infrastructure. But, according to the European Commission and to the EC companies involved in the US effort, there are important elements that will be common to both. The question is whether consumers in the US, Europe and Japan will want to invest in wide-screen and digital broadcasting - with its promise of greater choice and such innovations as 'interactive' video. And, if they do buy the decoders necessary to receive the new channels, will they then be interested, as the European Commission believes they will, in upgrading to a higher-definition, cinema-quality picture sometime in the next century? According to a recent consumer survey in the UK, France and Germany by BIS Strategic Decisions, an information technology consultancy, wide-screen TV was preferred to conventional TV by a margin of 56 per cent to 40 per cent. About two-thirds are in favour in France and the UK, with a 60:36 ratio against in Germany. Those favouring wide-screen gave as their main reason that it was better for watching films. The size of the set and picture quality were the main reasons against. On price, although three-quarters of consumers favouring wide-screen format were willing to pay more for the new sets than for conventional sets, barely one in three - that is a fifth of all consumers - was prepared to pay more than a third more. However, says Mr David Mercer, an analyst at BIS: 'That still means there are millions of people across Europe prepared to pay more for wide-screen, even before en-hanced technology.' He believes that, once wide-screen has been launched and marketed as 'home cinema', prices will begin to fall and more people will want to buy it. The retailers see it that way, too. If the EC package goes through, Dixons, the UK retailer, hopes to have 'affordable' wide-screen sets in its shops by the autumn of 1994. It expects a 25-inch wide-screen format - the replacement for the 21-inch conventional screen most common in the UK today  -to retail for about Pounds 1,000, coming down to the equivalent of today's Pounds 650 within two or three years. 'The TV market is mature and needs new products,' says Mr Roger Salmons, Dixons' group planning director. 'Wide-screen is the next major product on the horizon. Once consumers have made the step up, and manufacturers have brought the price of wide-screen down, the introduction of HDTV ought to be commercially viable when it becomes available.' Manufacturers are equally confident of their ability to cut the cost. 'Prices will be quite high for the first generation but, once we have an agreed standard (for wide-screen transmission) and volumes rise, the only cost over and above the current technology should be the size of the larger screen,' says Mr Robert van Oostenbrugge, manager of Philips' broadcast media division. That leaves the broadcasters. Most of the EC's Ecu228m, plus an additional amount which the industry or national governments may be obliged to provide under any final agreement, is a sweetener to encourage them to produce programmes in a format compatible with wide-screen. The supposition that, without a hand-out, the broadcasters will not film and broadcast in wide-screen format is debatable. Mr Chris Daubney, chief engineer at Channel 4, the independent UK broadcaster, claims that there is 'no obvious revenue to be gained from going to wide-screen, but there are certain capital costs - studio equipment and so on - for which we would like compensation'. On the other hand, Mr Barry Cox, director of corporate affairs at London Weekend Television, says bluntly: 'We will need to go wide-screen anyway if the market is going that way. But if the Commission is putting up the money, of course we will apply.' In fact, the costs involved do not appear to be enormous: observers put the total charge to the UK broadcasting industry at less than Pounds 100m. There is also no question of broadcasters shifting all their production to wide-screen in one go. The impact on existing small-screen users, who will very likely have to make do with unattractive 'letter-box' reception of programmes shot for wide-screen, will initially keep it restricted, probably to films, sport and drama. The path ahead is still far from straightforward. Even if agreement is reached today on a funding package, the debate continues between proponents of two alternative means of proceeding to wide-screen at 'standard' definition. Some of those involved want to proceed as soon as possible with the so-called 'PAL-plus' system, which enhances the existing signal sufficiently to take wide-screen; others want to wait until digital is available. The industry could end up moving from one to the other. Finally, of course, comes the consumers' actual readiness to buy the new sets. Expect some cultural differences. According to the BIS survey, by far the largest objection to wide-screen in the UK was from respondents fearing that the screen was too large; by contrast, the French and Germans, given the same options, were mainly afraid that their living rooms were too small. Compelling subject for a documentary, perhaps.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         GERMANY   FRANCE    UK    TOTAL  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Respondents preferring wide-screen: premium prepared to pay  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Per-     Per-    Per-    Per-                                          cent      cent    cent    cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The same or less than conventional set    13        23      24      20 +12 per cent premium                       7        16       3       9 +13 per cent to +30 per cent premium      25        34      46      35 +31 per cent to +50 per cent premium      25         6      21      22 +51 per cent premium                      18        12       7      12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main reasons for preferring wide-screen  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Per-     Per-    Per-    Per-                                          cent      cent    cent    cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Better for watching films (more like a cinema)                      67        43      56      55 Better picture (quality and size)                        42        66      53      54 TV more attractive                        33        12       4      16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Potential drawbacks to wide-screen  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Per-     Per-    Per-    Per-                                          cent      cent    cent    cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Living room too small                     51        46      17      38 TV set too large                          14        29      49      30 Distorted picture                         16        17       5      13 Poor quality picture                      19         3       5       9 Price                                      8         3       5       5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: BIS Strategic Decisions  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

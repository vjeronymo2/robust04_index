			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: PPI fall boosts US Treasuries After rallying strongly following news of an unexpected decline in April producer prices, US Treasury prices fell back to stand only moderately higher yesterday In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  5/16 at 84 17/32 , yielding 7.564 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  3/32 at 98 27/32 , to yield 6.115 per cent. The market had been expecting a small rise in the April producer prices index, so when it was announced that the PPI had fallen 0.1 per cent last month, buyers quickly moved into the market, which was primed for some sort of rally after Wednesday's big auction-related losses. With dealer short-covering providing additional strength, prices at the long end of the maturity range rose by more than a point during the morning, pushing the yield below 7.5 per cent. Prices were also buoyed by a surprising 0.8 per cent decline in April retail sales, although this was tempered by March retail sales being revised upward from a 0.4 per cent gain to a 1.7 per cent gain. The market, however, was unable to hold on to its early gains. Dealers blamed the lack of a follow-through from retail buyers, and comments from Mr Robert Parry, president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, who hinted that short-term interest rates would have to go considerably higher. UK government bonds climbed during the course of the day, helped by better-than-expected UK trade data and the rally in US bonds. The trade data for February showed a reduced deficit. 'The monthly numbers are highly erratic, but the fall in imports, which had been strong for five months, is reassuring,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, suggesting that the pace of recovery in the UK could be easing. Volume in the cash and futures markets was low. The Liffe gilt futures contract, which closed at 103.22 on Wednesday, touched a low of 103.02 early yesterday, climbed to a high of 104.12, and traded at 104.05 by late afternoon. The gilt market expects the Bank of England to announce its next gilt auction today, although views are divided on which maturity it will choose. The market has been starved of long-dated issues since late 1993, and the yield spread for 25-year issues over 10-year gilts has narrowed from 20 basis points in mid-April to five basis points at present. 'The Bank is creating a severe distortion in the gilt market by not issuing long-dated stock,' complained one international fund manager. However, many dealers believe the Bank is unwilling to issue long-dated stock as this could be seen as condoning the 'abnormally' high yields which have resulted from the global bond market shake-out. Spanish government bonds edged higher, taking their cue mainly from the US in light trading. Yesterday saw the release of Spanish unemployment and GDP data, providing some evidence of economic recovery, according to Mr Steven Dulake, bond analyst at PaineWebber. The percentage of unemployed fell to 17.76 per cent in April from 17.92 per cent in March, while GDP rose at a year-on-year rate of about 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of 1994, the first such increase in five quarters. Given the Bundesbank's half-point cut in German interest rates on Wednesday, market participants are waiting to see whether the Bank of Spain follows suit. The French and German government bond markets were closed for a public holiday yesterday.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico extends fall Stock prices extended their slide after peasant rebels threatened a declaration of war in Chiapas. The IPC index closed 59.80 or 2.42 per cent lower at 2,407.99 - at the end of 1993 the IPC stood at 2,602.63. Turnover totalled a light 445m new pesos, on 30m shares traded. Technical analysts said that if the market broke the support level at 2,400, it could go into a freefall. The leader of the Zapatista rebels issued a communique last night warning of an 'imminent' return to war. Last week the rebels announced that they were breaking an 11-month ceasefire with the government which was signed shortly after they began their armed conflict last January. The move sparked a drop in the peso, which settled in Mexico City at an historic low versus the dollar. The latter rose to 3.4555 new pesos, from 3.4485 new pesos on Friday. The market was closed on Monday. The dollar's previous high was 3.4523 new pesos on November 18. Brazil The Sao Paulo bourse finished slightly higher after a last-minute scramble over options pushed prices above their opening levels. The Bovespa index was ahead 220 or 0.5 per cent at 48,351. A stockbroker said trading was 'very weak' yesterday in low volume, with shares down on the day until half an hour before closing, when one or two big players pushed prices up in options trading. Options expire next Monday. A speech by the president of Brazil's National Development Bank, who has been nominated as the next president of the central bank, was well received by the market.</p>

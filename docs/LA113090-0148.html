			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEEN TO STAND TRIAL FOR ATTACK THAT LEFT GIRL'S FACE SCARRED  </P> <P> An Orange County Municipal judge ordered a young Stanton man to stand trial on  felony assault charges Thursday for allegedly throwing a piece of glass that  slashed Amber Jefferson's face during a brawl last August.  </P> <P> After four days of pretrial testimony, Judge Michael Beecher ruled that there  was ample evidence to try Kurt David Wimberly, 18, on felony mayhem charges,  although no one saw him throw the glass.  </P> <P> Trial is set to begin Dec. 13.  </P> <P> The charge stems from Wimberly's involvement in an Aug. 6 fight outside his  home that left the 15-year-old Garden Grove girl with a disfiguring scar that  runs from her temple to her neck.  </P> <P> Two misdemeanor assault charges against Wimberly were dropped because one of  his alleged victims, a former friend of Amber's who has since accused her of  attempting to bribe him into changing his testimony, now says he was never  assaulted.  </P> <P> Wimberly, who remains in the Orange County Jail, is also charged with assault  with a deadly weapon, infliction of bodily harm and battery.  </P> <P> According to authorities, as many as 12 people on both sides, some armed with  bats and boards, took part in the fight that allegedly stemmed from an argument  between Wimberly's former and current girlfriends.  </P> <P> Prosecutors contend that during the confrontation, an angry Wimberly threw an  ash tray, knife and then a glass shard from his patio, striking Amber in the  face after one of her friends started breaking out the windows in his home.  Following the near-fatal injury that slashed Amber's face to the bone, she and  her family charged that the attack was racially motivated, causing civil rights  activists to rally around her.  </P> <P> Amber, the daughter of a black father and white mother, said her assailants had  used racial slurs during the attack.  </P> <P> But the district attorney soundly rejected that claim, saying that the  confrontation had nothing to do with race. During pretrial testimony, there was  little evidence presented to suggest that race was a motive.  </P> <P> In earlier testimony, 17-year-old Matt Stewart -- a friend of Amber's who was  with her the night of the incident -- alleged that Amber had told him they each  would receive $1,000 if they told authorities the attack was racially  motivated. Amber denied the charge.  </P> <P> Rudy Garcia, a sheriff's homicide investigator, testified Thursday that a  13-ounce piece of glass from a sliding glass window was probably the object  that cut Amber. Although blood samples taken from the glass matched Amber's  blood type, Garcia said that investigators did not find any fingerprints on the  shard to directly tie it to Wimberly.  </P> <P> Despite confusing and often conflicting testimony presented by the prosecution  witnesses, Assistant Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper said she remains convinced that  the district attorney has a strong case.  </P></p>

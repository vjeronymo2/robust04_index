			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Books: Why Gothic runs riot in Oxford NORTH OXFORD by Tania Hinchcliffe Yale Pounds 25, 261 pages IN ONE of the finest of Oxford novels, The Last Enchantments, Robert Liddell begins by describing the suburb which sprouted north of the city during Victoria's later decades: 'Here, on either side of boulevards planted with chestnuts, is some of the most remarkable domestic architecture in Europe. Towering yellow brick piles, embellished with purbeck shafts and freestone copings, house the theological colleges of 'modern churchmen'. In a quarter of an hour's walk the student can observe examples of almost every kind of Gothic window: Angevin, Venetian, Spanish and many more. Square and saddleback towers abound. Further up, there are redbrick mansions, several of which claim Ruskin as their architect, and show each some remarkable feature, such as a carved pediment to a porch, or a lavish display of dog-tooth ornament.' Appreciation for North Oxford was not universal at the time Liddell wrote, and the suburb has not yet wholly emerged from the welter of controversy; there will always be dislikers of Victorian Gothic who find it, in another critic's phrase, 'arid and gloomy'; but gradually the suburb's splendour and its importance as a complete achievement, a planned Victorian mixed development displaying a marvellous repertoire of style and decoration, have grown on the discernment and affections of the city and of architectural historians alike, with the happy result that only a few of the plans for redevelopment in recent years have been allowed to go through. In her fully-illustrated and detailed discussion of North Oxford, the first ever written, Tanis Hinchcliffe recounts the suburb's history and takes us almost house by house through its streets. The land it occupies belonged (much of it still does) to St John's College. Northwards beyond St John's gates, in the direction of Banbury, lay the College's 400 acres of fields, a territory whose fate the Fellows pondered for many decades before deciding, sometime about 1850, to venture into property development. A number of architects were involved as the decades passed, some of them local, and there was evolution both in the layout of sections of the estate and in styles of building. Yet an extraordinary unity binds the whole, reflecting the single guiding inspiration - a native sense of the Gothic - which prompted it. In tracing North Oxford's development Hinchcliffe shows that it was not simply a case - as myth has it - of dons, newly permitted to marry, seeking capacious residences within strolling distance of their Senior Common Rooms. It was in fact the non-academic middle class for whom the estate chiefly grew. But some of the most glorious examples were built for dons. My college room, where I write this, is in one of the Gothic houses illustrated in Hinchcliffe's book; and when I look across Banbury Road I see another, displaying its pointed arches and coloured bricks to the sun. Perhaps because they are so familiar, these lovely North Oxford buildings do not have the air of specimens in an architectural museum, in contrast to some of the older structures in the city's centre. But perhaps the celebrity which this book promises them will change that; which is a thought to give pause, for Oxford, except in winter, is already so clotted with tourists that one can barely move in the Broad and High, and members of the University, when dressed for business, find themselves transformed into exhibits by the throngs of camera-wielding visitors. Not long ago, after examining a doctoral thesis, a colleague and I, habited in academicals, walked back to college up the High, and were photographed at every step. Whereas most visitors restricted themselves to one picture, the cheerfully inquisitive Japanese tourists, whose motto seems to be 'photo ergo sum', filled whole spools. Now perhaps these cameras will obtrude up St Giles and along the Banbury and Woodstock Roads, poking into the Gothic windows and photographing tutorials in progress. Still, the treasures of North Oxford are a universal possession, and Hinchcliffe's careful and thorough account of them is to be welcomed accordingly, even if it means that the inhabitants of these glories among the cherry and chestnut trees will have to share them.</p>

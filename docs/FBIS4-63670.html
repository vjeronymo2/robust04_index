			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [N. Gavrileva report on news conference given by Sergey </F> Tsekov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea; place and date  not given: "We Are Working Without Fanfare"]    [Text] The corps of journalists of Crimea welcomes  the endeavor of Sergey Tsekov, the new chairman of the Supreme  Soviet of Crimea, to continue the former tradition of holding a  news conference following the completion of a stage of work of  the Supreme Soviet. Sergey Pavlovich held his first important  meeting with journalists during a lengthy break in the work of  the first session, when it had become possible to speak about  the fully formed leadership of the Crimean parliament.  <H5>  Work of Parliament </H5>   [Question] Please assess the three days of business of the  session.    [Tsekov] I believe that the Supreme Soviet spent them  entirely productively, the plan which had been mapped out by the  action committee was fulfilled, the leadership elected, and the  presidium formed--all without undue shouting and clamor, calmly,  and in balanced fashion. I evaluate the makeup of the  commissions positively also; the professional level of the  deputies is quite high, and they are ready for work.    [Question] When will the session continue?    [Tsekov] The plenary sitting will open on 20 May; work in  the  commissions is under way at this time.    [Question] What will be predominant in parliament's  work--party or factional discipline?    [Tsekov] I believe that factional discipline will prevail.    [Question] How do you plan to establish relations with the  kurultay faction following the well-known incident at the  session?    [Tsekov] They will be built as they were built before: on  the  basis of mutual respect. [Word illegible] misunderstanding of my  position as chairman. I would like the Crimean Tatar deputies to  understand that I was in a very difficult situation as regards  the candidates for chairman of the Commission for Nationality  Policy and the Affairs of Deported Citizens. It was this that  dictated the proposal that I made. And we made the right  decision in postponing the elections until 20 May--I hope that  the kurultay delegation will have returned from Kiev by that  time.    [Question] What do you think, which group or faction of  deputies has been the best prepared for work in parliament?    [Tsekov] As the experience of the three days of work has  shown--the Russia faction. And, of course, the kurultay faction  also is prepared for serious parliamentary work.    [Question] A record was set--one deputy went to the  microphone 51 times. What do you intend doing to ensure that  garrulous deputies not grab so much time for themselves?    [Tsekov] We are required to observe the standing orders, and  if they permit a deputy to take the floor either 50 or 100  times, this is a problem for the deputy, not the chairman of the  Supreme Soviet and not the Supreme Soviet as a whole. It is  possible that the Supreme Soviet will amend the standing orders  accordingly. But the situation should not be dramatized.  <H5>  Crimea and Ukraine </H5>   [Question] What advantages would treaty relations with  Ukraine convey, in what way would this be better than the Law on  the Delineation of Powers?    [Tsekov] The economic situation in Crimea is wholly  dependent  on Ukraine because we are located in a single economic field.  And mistakes that are made by the Ukrainian leadership are  manifested most directly in Crimea, in a worse version even  sometimes. Were a treaty to be signed, it would be easier for us  to implement the right economic transformations. I could outline  for you the first possibility of an improvement in the economic  situation: the demilitarization of Crimea. In addition, we would  remove the barriers between states, primarily with Russia....    [Question] Your future steps for filling the state  sovereignty of Crimea?    [Tsekov] These steps are clearly identified in the program  of  the Russia bloc: restoration of the constitution of 6 May 1992  and the formation of a delegation to Kiev in order to persuade  the leadership of Ukraine of the need to build relations with  Crimea on a treaty basis.    [Question] What is the attitude of the Supreme Soviet of  Crimea toward the impending elections of the president of  Ukraine? Will Crimeans take part?    [Tsekov] I was unable in these three days to ascertain the  Supreme Soviet's attitude toward this problem, it is not a  question to be discussed there, although I do not rule out this  possibility. The attitude of the majority of political parties,  however, is unequivocal: Crimeans should not take part in the  elections.    [Question] Do you consider it normal that the Supreme Soviet  of Crimea is without the representation of Ukrainian  organizations and Ukrainians in general?    [Tsekov] I cannot agree because the Russia bloc did not  promote candidates on a national basis. And seven  representatives of Ukrainian nationality were elected to the  Crimean parliament.    [Question] Numerous demonstrations demanding the annulment  of  Crimean autonomy are taking place in Kiev. What if this were  actually to happen--what might the steps of the Supreme Soviet  of Crimea be?    [Tsekov] I cannot even imagine this, to be honest. This is  practically impossible. Theoretically, yes, but we have in the  past four years amassed sufficient experience, and among  Ukrainian politicians there have come to be people who are  perfectly sober-minded and who understand the Crimea  situation--they understand what drastic action on the part of  the Ukrainian leadership could signify: It would mean not only  the complete detachment of Crimea from Ukraine but also the  breakup of Ukraine itself. Our actions? We would not agree with  such a decision, of course, and would take the appropriate  steps, together with the president, naturally.    [Question] The Ukrainian and Russian press believe that the  present composition of the Ukrainian parliament will adopt a  tougher position in respect to Crimea. Do you share this  viewpoint? How will you build your relations with the Ukrainian  parliament?    [Tsekov] I believe that the attitude toward Crimea from the  toughness viewpoint will change and that the situation will  ease. I was a people's deputy of Ukraine for four years and I  know how we were viewed by the national democrats initially:  unequivocal rejection of the statehood of Crimea and all that  was happening in Crimea. But two or three years have gone by,  and many of them have already begun to say that there is a  Crimea problem and that it needs to be resolved on the basis of  political dialogue and that Crimea should be given as much  authority as possible. The same will be the case with the  present Supreme Council of Ukraine also.  <H5>  Crimea-Russia-Ukraine </H5>   [Question] Your vision of relations with Russia and Ukraine?    [Tsekov] These are big questions, and we have answered them  repeatedly. Mutual relations should be built on a treaty  basis--with both Russia and Ukraine.    [Question] How do you conceive of a treaty with  Ukraine--what  should it include?    [Tsekov] Any treaty may be of three types--economic,  political, and military-political. I would want a treaty between  Ukraine and Crimea to be a treaty of equals. I do not rule out a  military- political treaty with Russia being concluded together  with Ukraine and I hope that Ukraine will ultimately, after a  certain length of time, arrive at an understanding of  integration.  <H5>  Sevastopol </H5>   [Question] There is talk to the effect that the question of  the transfer of the capital of Crimea to Sevastopol could be in  the offing....    [Tsekov] This is not our suggestion, it came, as far as I  know, from the Crimea Economic Revival Party. The reasoning is  that the question of Sevastopol's integration in Crimea could be  solved quite gently in this case. A paradoxical situation has  taken shape: Sevastopol is an inalienable part of Crimea, but  the organs of state power are not formed according to  legislation of Crimea, although, in accordance with all  legislative instruments, of Ukraine included, the authority is  ours. Were we to solve this question, there could, consequently,  be no question of a transfer. If not, transfer of the capital  could be assumed to be an option.    [Question] Do you consider the administrative association of  Sevastopol and Crimea essential, and if this is realistic, in  what kind of timeframe?    [Tsekov] Of course, Sevastopol is an inalienable part of  Crimea, they must be together. The timeframe is a difficult  matter. But work on this needs to be started at once.  <H5>  Military Matters </H5>   [Question] You are a supporter of a gradual demilitarization  of Crimea. How will this process take place? What is the size of  the forces?    [Tsekov] You know well enough the program of the Crimea  Republican Party and the Russia bloc--it speaks of the need for  military reform and says what is implied by this specifically:  phased demilitarization of Crimea with the retention of a  contingent of troops of reasonable sufficiency; territorial  defense of Crimea within the framework of CIS collective  security; the creation of a republican guard of Crimea for  defense of the constitutional system of the Republic of Crimea  and public safety.    Various figures for the size of the forces are  cited--60,000,  40,000, even 80,000--but I do not know the true size.    [Question] The Supreme Soviet has a Commission for Military  Matters, Security, and Servicemen's Protection, and  representatives of the Russia bloc constitute its majority.  There are servicemen of both Russia and Ukraine in Crimea. Which  servicemen's rights will this commission protect?    [Tsekov] I understand it to be a question of the rights of  all servicemen stationed on the territory of Crimea.  <H5>  Party and Speaker </H5>   [Question] Do you intend combining the offices of chairman  of  the Supreme Soviet and party chairman?    [Tsekov] I do not at this moment consider that I have to  quit  the post of party chairman--as you know, the law permits this.  If the congress considers otherwise, I am prepared to comply  with this decision. But just as I was a member of the Crimea  Republican Party, I would remain a Republican.    [Question] Who is today the ideologist of the Crimea  Republican Party after the previous ideologist has declared his  opposition?    [Tsekov] The Crimea Republican Party had several  ideologists-- one was the president of Crimea, a second  suspended his party membership, a third was to some extent  myself, a fourth--V.  Terekhov--is continuing his work.  <H5>  The Supreme Soviet and the Executive </H5>   [Question] Many edicts of the president of Crimea are not in  effect today. What will the steps of the Supreme Soviet be?    [Tsekov] I am inclined to believe that we should confirm  these edicts and thus help the president in their realization.    [Question] Will you be changing the structure of the  government in accordance with the structure of the Supreme  Soviet?    [Tsekov] Questions connected with the formation of the  government are within the competence of the Supreme Soviet. I  said at the session that it is necessary first and foremost to  consider questions of Crimea's economic position and the  structure and composition of the government. It is possible that  the deputies will agree, and if there are objections, this will  be ascertained at the session. The powers should, however, be  equal and should balance one another.    [Question] Your personal opinion of the work of the  government? How smooth will discussion of the composition of the  government at the Supreme Soviet be?    [Tsekov] I do not have a full impression of its work,  although it is positive, on the whole. And the discussion--have  you noticed that discussion of the composition has not been  smooth in a single CIS parliament?    [Question] How might you explain the president's aspiration  to put together a Crimean Government of newcomers--what, is  Crimea's intellectual potential exhausted?    [Tsekov] You had better ask Yu. Meshkov this. But I would  not  say that he is trying to form a government according to this  principle. It will consist 90-95 percent of Crimeans.    As far as representatives of Russia in our government are  concerned, this was necessary, and I fully approve and support  this step of the president. What will happen in the future?  Perhaps these people will become citizens of Crimea; it cannot  be ruled out that their positions will be taken by Crimeans. But  they have a sincere desire to help Crimea, I personally have no  doubt about this.  <H5>  S. Tsekov--Speaker </H5>   [Question] How do you feel in the role of speaker? Are you  coping with this role?    [Tsekov] I feel confident thus far. I do not know what the  future will bring, but the first two days went better than I had  expected.    [Question] How controllable is our parliament? Is it  submitting to the will of the speaker?    [Tsekov] I have the impression that the deputies understand  that it is necessary to hold plenary sittings efficiently and  have learned rapidly how to avail themselves of the Council, and  this was a problem--remember how they demanded that microphones  be installed in the hall? We have left them, but it seems to me  that they are availing themselves of them less and less often.    [Question] Have you met with N. Bagrov?    [Tsekov] I have spoken with Nikolay Vasilyevich by telephone  and intend to meet with him in the very near future. The  purpose? He is a chairman of the Supreme Soviet with great  experience, and I would like to familiarize myself with this  experience--but this does not mean that I will borrow it in full.    On the whole, I believe that we must switch to civilized  forms of intercourse. I criticized the chairman of the Supreme  Soviet before I was elected to this office, but I do not intend  doing so after I myself have become chairman of the Supreme  Soviet.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "CMI Television" newscast] </F>   [Text] CMI has discovered the presence of another U.S.  battalion in Colombia. It is in Puerto Lopez, Meta Department,  and is apparently building a base to help fight drug production.  Meanwhile, Marines arrived at Malaga Bay in Valle del Cauca.    Although it is rumored in certain sectors that the reason  for  their presence here is to pressure the Cali Cartel to surrender  and build a radar and communications center, today--in full view  of local residents and tourists--the North Americans began their  construction of a school and a road in Juanchaco, social  projects that they say will help the people. They brought all  types of vehicles, construction equipment, bulldozers, and  barges to produce electricity. If their instructions were to  hide why they are here, their behavior showed the opposite. The  environment today was normal, although they were prohibited from  talking to the media. Some local residents welcome the Marines  with open arms:    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] They are welcomed,  because if they come to Juanchaco to build projects for the good  of the community and we reject them, other locations will be  asking for them with open arms. [end recording]    Others question their presence here:    [Begin second unidentified speaker recording] We have not  heard the government, the mayor's office, or the governor's  office clearly tell us what they are going to do. [end  recording]    The presence of U.S. troops in Colombia is nothing new. Five  months ago CMI was with the U.S. Armed Forces in San Jose del  Guaviare, where they built an operations base for the river  force of the Colombian Navy in an area where there are many  guerrillas and drug traffickers.    As if this was not enough, the residents of Puerto Lopez,  Meta, have also reported the presence of U.S. soldiers. They  are apparently there to build--jointly with the Colombian  Navy--what might be an operations center in that area, where  drug-trafficking activity has been detected.    [Begin recording] [Puerto Lopez Mayor Hernan Saavedra] We  have learned that U.S. Navy personnel are building a naval base  for the Colombian Navy in the jurisdiction of Puerto Lopez.    [Unidentified reporter] Are they armed?    [Third unidentified speaker] Of course. Each one is armed  with at least their regulation weapon.    [Fourth unidentified speaker] They have been seen armed like  any officer with his pistol on the side.    [Fifth unidentified speaker] I at least disagree with the  government's decision to permit those gentlemen to come here to  our territory, because we do not know what their mission is.

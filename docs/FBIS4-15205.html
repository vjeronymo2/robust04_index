			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Undated letter from Candidate of Historical Sciences Ivan </F> Bondarev, followed by editorial office note, under the "Reader's  Response" rubric: "Is It Not Worth Our Generals' While Holding  Exercises in the State of Iowa?"]    [Excerpts] In the 20th century the United States has  repeatedly tried to get a foothold on Russian territory.  [passage omitted]    Why recall the past?, you may ask. Whoever recalls the  past.... Unfortunately, there are grounds for reminders. The  mass media are reporting on preparations for military exercises  in Orenburg Oblast for Russian troops with U.S. troops  participating. The preparations are in full swing. Brigadier  General Leonard Holder Jr., commander of the U.S. 3d Infantry  Division, has already visited Orenburg in the role of  quartermaster. Russian and U.S. Defense Ministers P. Grachev  and W. Perry have met in Moscow. It is not hard to guess what  was discussed.    Specialists are arguing over how many U.S. military  personnel  are coming to Russia and what hardware they are bringing with  them. Meanwhile it is quite clear that the generals will be  accompanied by an army of advisers, umpires, interpreters, and  support personnel.    First, there are many facilities in the South Urals and  Volga  Valley region where the gaze of outsiders is undesirable.  "Friendship is friendship, but it's every man for himself when  it comes to tobacco," according to the Russian proverb.  Furthermore, the Americans make no secret of the fact that  their foreign intelligence service is operating even in their  allies' states.    Second, Russians have to receive and accommodate the U.S.  generals with their vast retinue. Meanwhile we are experiencing  a shortage of everything. It is said that the Americans will  pay for everything. This is suspicious. They are so keen to  get into Russia that they are not counting the cost.    It has been announced that the purpose of the exercises is  to  rehearse collaboration between the two states' armies in the  event of an attack by a third force. But who is threatening us?  Where is this third force which the Russian Army would not be  able to oppose independently? There is something else at work  here.    Representatives of Russia's military department are  hurrying.  It is is not understood exactly why: Whether they are afraid to  be late in joining the world community's "Partnership for Peace"  or whether they cannot count on winning in the event of another  storming of the White House. The Pentagon's generals are also  hurrying. The interest is mutual. Which is why it would have  been advisable to hold the joint exercises in the United States,  where society is more stable and where there is a better supply  of food and petroleum oils and lubricants. But as far as is  known the question of holding the exercises on U.S. territory  has not been raised or discussed by anybody. Is this an  accident? I think not.    At one time the United States supplied Russia with canned  stewed meat and corn seeds and gave advice on how to develop  Russia, credits, and aid. Of course, it gave all this not for  nothing but on an interest basis, and bought up shares in the  most profitable sectors of the economy. In short, U.S.  ownership started to appear on Russian territory. The problem  of protecting this ownership arose. The Americans' desire to  stick their bayonets into and raise their flag in the most  vulnerable area of vast Russia cannot be explained any other way.    [Signed] Candidate of Historical Sciences Ivan Bondarev    Moscow Oblast, Ramenskiy Rayon, RAOS [expansion unknown]  Settlement    The article by Major General (Retired) V. Chudov entitled  "Our Strategists Are Too Unsophisticated" (PRAVDA, 16 March  1994) provoked an avalanche of letters to the editorial office.  The general impression is that the decision on joint  Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises is hasty and  ill-considered and dangerous for Russia's future.    Maj. Gen. Chudov's viewpoint is shared by the author of the  published letter, as well as by readers I. Batsik, P. Borisov,  V. Goryachev, A. Babenko, S. Kuznetsov, and others.</p>

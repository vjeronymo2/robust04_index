			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Austere budget for Kenya as debts rise Mr Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya's finance minister, yesterday announced an austere 1994/95 budget with little scope for investment in the country's dilapidated social services or transport infrastructure, against the backdrop of a stagnant economy and escalating debt servicing costs. Nevertheless, Mr Mudavadi forecast an economic turnaround this year and promised to reduce inflation to less than 10 per cent by the end of 1994 from about 40 per cent at present. A better harvest was expected to boost Kenya's economic growth rate to 3 per cent in 1994, he said, still barely ahead of population growth but better than the dismal 0.1 per cent registered in 1993 - the country's worst economic performance since independence 30 years ago. Few conjurers would envy the trick Mr Mudavadi must perform this year. Under the watchful gaze of the International Monetary Fund, he has been ordered to cut the budget deficit while servicing a growing public debt. Reducing from 7 per cent of GDP this year will be difficult in the face of the government's ballooning domestic debt - the product of financial profligacy in the run-up to the December 1992 elections and subsequent banking frauds that cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars. The KPounds 2.57bn (Pounds 31m) domestic debt servicing bill consumed almost half the government's revenue last year. 'It dominated the entire outcome of the budget,' Mr Mudavadi admitted. 'It blew the deficit beyond acceptable limits.' As a result, Mr Mudavadi was forced to curtail public investment sharply last year. Gross investment, he noted, fell by 16.4 per cent last year, with the government responsible for four-fifths of that drop. There will be no respite this year. Mr Mudavadi warned government ministries that they would be issued with monthly expenditure ceilings. Their cash balances will henceforth be monitored daily by the central bank via a recently set-up computer network. He is also planning to cut direct and indirect subsidies to the parastatal sector, which totalled 5.5 per cent of GDP last year. Legislation is planned to encourage private sector investment in the electricity sector, telecommunications, and port and railway services. On the revenue side, Mr Mudavadi has introduced private inspection companies inside customs to cut down on the evasion of import duties, an estimated one-third of which are never paid. Mr Mudavadi said foreign aid flows would cover 23 per cent of government expenditure next year, but deplored that fact that most aid was 'tied' to specific projects.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Sega profit hit as Sonic boom time comes to an end Sonic the Hedgehog has fallen on hard times. Sega Enterprises, the Japanese creator of the video games hero, announced a sharp fall in first-half profits yesterday after a decline in demand for video and computer games, one of the fastest-growing consumer markets of the early 1990s. Sega saw profits before tax and extraordinary items fall to Y16.32bn (Pounds 103.29m) in the first six months of 1994, from Y28.58bn in the same period last year, on sales down by 25 per cent to Y151bn. The company warned of a further fall in sales for the full year and a 35 per cent decline in profits before tax to Y27.6bn from Y42.5bn in 1993. The games market took off in the late 1980s when Sega and Nintendo, its chief competitor, announced the first wave of 16-bit cartridge console games  -such as the Sonic games. Worldwide sales soared from Pounds 4.6bn in 1989 to Pounds 13.34bn last year, according to Durlacher, the London securities house. The industry's difficulties began last Christmas when sales slowed in western Europe and the US. Demand for 16-bit hardware and software declined as consumers awaited the launch of the next wave of more sophisticated 32-bit consoles, using compact discs. These machines combine superior sound and images to create more exciting games than the old formats, such as Sega's Sonic and his arch-rivals, Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. Mr Frank Herman, deputy chairman of Sega Europe, said: 'For over a year, our customers have known that a new generation of hardware was coming on to the market and have regarded our current technology as outdated.' New 32-bit consoles, including Sega's Saturn and Sony's PlayStation, will be launched next week in Japan. Nintendo is pinning its hopes this Christmas on Donkey Kong Country, a 16-bit computer-generated game, until next autumn's launch of its new Ultra 64 games. Once the new machines come on stream, the games market is expected to return to growth. Mr David Tabizel, multimedia analyst at Durlacher, forecasts that the global market will rise from Pounds 13.7bn this year to Pounds 20bn by 1998.</p>

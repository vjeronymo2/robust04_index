			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] compiled a report on the extent economic agreements and  accords signed between Japan and the United States have been  implemented. While the United States strongly criticizes Japan  for "not abiding by almost all of the agreements," MITI cites 17  concrete cases, including beef, citrus fruit, and  supercomputers, to refute such a charge. MITI reports:  "Imports of beef increased by 90 percent between 1988 and 1992;  results have been achieved in many areas." Japan intends to use  this report as data to clear up U.S. "misunderstanding" at the  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks and similar bilateral  negotiations in the future.    There are around 30 agreements and accords signed between  the  two countries. The United States has serious doubts about  Japan's efforts to implement these agreements, as evidenced in  President Bill Clinton's remark during the recent Japan-U.S.  summit talks that "despite the 30-odd agreements signed, there  has been no change at all." MITI believes: "Such a perception  is behind the Japan-U.S. economic friction." It has, therefore,  engaged in an assessment of Japan's performance regarding the  agreements.    Aside from beef and citrus fruit, other examples cited  include: Agreements on medical equipment and pharmaceuticals,  forestry products, cigarettes, computers, satellites, Nippon  Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's (NTT) procurement, auto  parts, automobiles, paper, sheet glass, amorphous metal  transformer, textiles, steel, and machine tools, and the  Structural Impediments Initiative talks.    MITI emphasizes: "Japan abides by these agreements and  accords, and visible results have been achieved." For example,  in the case of beef and citrus fruit, as a result of abolishing  import quotas, and implementing the agreement on tariffication,  imports of beef grew by 90 percent, and imports of orange juice  by 330 percent between 1988 and 1992. Imports of forestry  products also increased by 250 percent between 1985 and 1992.  In the case of auto parts, one of the focal issues at the  framework talks, imports from the United States expanded from  $6.1 billion in fiscal 1990 to $13.6 billion in fiscal 1992.    MITI "wants to use this to refute the United States."  However, the report does not touch on semiconductors and car  phones, which have been the controversial issues in recent  weeks. This may give rise to criticism in the United States  that the document merely cites examples to suit Japan's purpose.</p>

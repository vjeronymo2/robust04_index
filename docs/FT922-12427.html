			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Planning for retirement - Reader Henry Edmunds explains how he built a portfolio ABOUT six years ago, and shortly before I retired, a radical change of investment policy seemed desirable. The new circumstances required: Safety of capital. A regular and fixed income of about 8 per cent gross. That any growth of capital should be regarded as a bonus. A simple system which my wife would understand thoroughly. (This condition arose from seeing the almost total lack of investment experience in several newly-widowed women I knew; I wanted her to avoid such a handicap). As it happened, we had two separate portfolios, a mixture of equities, gilts, building society deposits and a few savings certificates. It was a bit of a jumble; some sort of order was required. After a good deal of thought, we came to the conclusion that gilts and high-class industrial debentures should be the major part of the new system. They would cover the income side of the policy. Any surplus cash should go into saving certificates which, if kept for five years, would show a safe but modest capital appreciation. We made a start by listing the redemption dates of those gilts we had already, and the idea evolved that a 10-year cycle would suit our circumstances. Five years was too short for any worthwhile capital gains but 15 was looking too far ahead. So, we began running down our building society deposits, sold a few unpromising equities and used the cash to fill in the blank years. The programme is now completed; the latest stock to mature (on September 1) will be E. Surrey Water 7 per cent Deb. 90/92, which was bought in October 1982 at 77 1/2 , and yielding 8.9 per cent. Closely behind will be Bass 3 1/4 per cent Debenture 87/92, bought at 83 on in February 1988 but yielding only 4 per cent. With more gilts being issued this summer to cover the huge PSBR, re-investing this cash, by buying stock to be redeemed in 2002, is likely to be easier. In 1993, we have two lots of 6 per cent funding coming to redemption. They were bought at 77 and 74, costing Pounds 11,820 but in a year's time will be worth Pounds 15,000. Looking at the combined portfolios, the overall difference between cost price and maturity value works out at 19.3 per cent; it is also accompanied by an 8.2 per cent dividend yield. Occasionally, we had more than we wanted to invest in the appropriate gilt or debenture, and this is where savings certificates (ordinary and index-linked) came in handy. We are now beginning to reinvest those that are maturing. The capital profile of the two portfolios now stands as follows: 60 per cent gilts, debentures and loan stocks; 22 per cent savings certificates; 14 per cent bank and building society deposits; 4 per cent equities and investment trusts (Murray zero preference). I have a jaundiced view of equities. For many years, I have taken between Pounds 2,000-4,000 annually in capital gains on short-term trading from a modest capital base. In the present financial year, though, my choice of Guardian Royal and Premier Oil could hardly have been worse. Welsh Water is, however, performing fairly well, and so is the Murray zero. Nevertheless, I am quite pleased with the overall position, but future buying of fixed-interest stocks will be more difficult and probably less profitable. Gone are the sunny days of getting a discount of 20-30 per cent below par and still having an average dividend yield of 8.2 per cent. Fortunately, buying gilts and savings certificates through National Savings has been a low-cost operation and so have most investment trusts, via the occasional lump sum arrangements.</p>

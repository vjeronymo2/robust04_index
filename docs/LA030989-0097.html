			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM POSTS QUIT BY NORTON SIMON; WIFE SUCCEEDS HIM  </P> <P> Retired industrialist Norton Simon has resigned as president of the Norton  Simon Museum and was succeeded by his wife, actress Jennifer Jones Simon,  museum officials announced late Wednesday.  </P> <P> The 82-year-old Simon also resigned as a member and trustee of the museum. The  resignations were effective last Friday, a written statement released by the  Pasadena museum said.  </P> <P> The statement also said that Simon had been recently admitted to UCLA Medical  Center and was "presently hospitalized for undisclosed medical reasons."  However, Rich Elbaum, a medical center spokesman, said Wednesday night that  Simon was not currently a patient there.  </P> <P> "He is definitely not an in-patient at this time," Elbaum said, adding that he  could not determine if Simon had been admitted to the hospital recently.  </P> <P> A source close to the museum said that Simon is very ill and confined to a  wheelchair.  </P> <P> Jennifer Jones Simon, who won an Academy Award for best actress for her  performance in the 1943 film "Song of Bernadette," was elected to replace her  husband as president and will lead the museum's board of trustees as chairman,  president and chief executive officer, the museum statement said.  </P> <P> No representative of the museum could be reached for comment late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Simon's art collection, one of the most coveted in the world, has an estimated  value in excess of $750 million. It includes many works by old masters, such as  Raphael and Rembrandt, and a large number of works by modern masters.  </P> <P> Last June, Simon abandoned a widely publicized offer to donate the collection  to UCLA. There have been no further announcements about the future of the art  works, which presently are on long-term loan to the Pasadena museum.  </P> <P> Simon has claimed for years that his wealth is not sufficient to finance the  museum in perpetuity and so will be forced to make arrangements to house the  collection at another institution.  </P> <P> A native of Portland, Ore., Simon made his fortune in the 1920s and '30s in the  vegetable packing and canning industries. By the 1970s, he had built a  corporate conglomerate worth more than $1 billion.  </P> <P> The museum also announced Wednesday the addition of two trustees: Simon's  granddaughter, Pamela Simon, who is currently studying film making at the UCLA  Graduate School of Motion Picture and Television, and Professor Seymour Slive  of Harvard, formerly of Pomona College.  </P></p>

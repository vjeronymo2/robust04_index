			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Section 1.1275&hyph;6&blank;Integration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Many commentators suggested that the integration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payment debt instruments with associated hedges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides the best method of taxing contingent payment debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments that are hedged. The proposed regulations respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this suggestion by providing for the integration of contingent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variable rate debt instruments with certain financial instruments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;1.1275&hyph;6). The integration rules are issued under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority of section 1275(d), and until the proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 are finalized, the integration rules are not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permissible means of determining the character and timing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income, deductions, gains, and losses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rules in the proposed regulations are modeled after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integration rules of section 988(d) and &sect;1.988&hyph;5(a). The rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed regulations, however, have been modified to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the different policy concerns underlying the rules for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking currency gain or loss into account and for taking interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income or deductions into account. The IRS and Treasury intend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make conforming changes to &sect;1.988&hyph;5(a) and request comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent to which &sect;1.988&hyph;5(a) should be modified to conform to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The integration rules apply to qualifying debt instruments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are defined as contingent payment debt instruments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variable rate debt instruments, and the synthetic debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instruments that are the result of integration under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Thus, the integration rules do not apply to fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate debt instruments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a financial instrument to qualify as a hedge under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations (a &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge), the combined cash flows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the qualifying debt instrument and the financial instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must permit the calculation of a yield to maturity or must be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same as the cash flows on a variable rate debt instrument that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pays interest at a qualified floating rate or rates. Thus, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations generally require a perfect hedge. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.1275&hyph;6 hedges, however, are not limited to hedging transactions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as defined in &sect;1.1221&hyph;2(b). For example, a &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not reduce risk from all of the operations of a business. A debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument held by a taxpayer cannot be a &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument issued by the taxpayer and a debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issued by a taxpayer cannot be a &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge of a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument held by the taxpayer. Physical assets, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory, generally will not be treated as &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they do not provide the predictable cash flows necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to create a perfect hedge. A supply or sales contract, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may qualify as a &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge. Stock does not qualify as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To qualify as an integrated transaction, the taxpayer must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue or acquire a qualifying debt instrument, enter into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, and meet six requirements. First, the taxpayer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must satisfy the identification requirements of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, such as by entering a description of the qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument and the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge in its books and records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge must not be with a related party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (other than a member of the same consolidated group making the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate-entity election under &sect;1.1221&hyph;2(d)). Third, the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer must enter into the qualifying debt instrument and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge. Fourth, if the taxpayer is a foreign person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in a U.S. trade or business who issues or acquires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying debt instrument or enters into the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the trade or business, all items of income and expense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the debt instrument or hedge (other than interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense that is subject to &sect;1.882&hyph;5) must be effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connected with the U.S. trade or business. Fifth, the qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument, any other debt instrument that is part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same issue as the qualifying debt instrument, or the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hedge cannot have been part of an integrated transaction that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously legged out of by the taxpayer. Finally, the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hedge must be entered into by the taxpayer on or after the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the taxpayer issues or acquires the qualifying debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the taxpayer meets these requirements, the qualifying debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument and the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge are integrated and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting synthetic debt instrument is taxed accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commissioner may require integration if a qualifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument and a financial instrument have, in substance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same combined cash flows as a fixed or variable rate debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument. Therefore, even if the taxpayer fails one or more of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements for integration, the Commissioner may integrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a qualifying debt instrument and a financial instrument. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, if the taxpayer fails to meet the identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, or enters into a hedge with a related party, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commissioner may integrate the transaction. The Commissioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also may integrate a transaction even if the hedge is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perfect. Thus, taxpayers may not avoid integration by altering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hedge so that there is a small amount of basis risk or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments under the hedge do not fully match the payments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying debt instrument. The Commissioner will not integrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a debt instrument with an imperfect hedge, however, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer retains substantial risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide rules for legging into and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legging out of an integrated transaction. Legging into an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrated transaction generally means entering into the hedge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the qualifying debt instrument is issued or acquired by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taxpayer. If a taxpayer legs into an integrated transaction, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying debt instrument is subject to the separate transaction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules up to the leg-in date, except that the day before the leg- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in date is treated as the end of an accrual period for purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of computing OID and interest accruals on the qualifying debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the taxpayer legs in, the qualifying debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the &sect;1.1275&hyph;6 hedge are integrated. Built-in gain or loss on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the qualifying debt instrument is not treated as realized on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leg-in date (contrary to the rule for currency gain or loss in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1.988&hyph;5(a)(6)(i)). Because the built-in gain or loss will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected in the accruals on the synthetic debt instrument, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> built-in gain or loss on the leg-in date will be recognized over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the term of the synthetic debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

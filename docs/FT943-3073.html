			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers call for cut in set-aside The European farmers' organisation, Copa, yesterday called for a reduction in the amount of cereals and oilseed land set aside or left to lie fallow in the 1994-95 growing season under a European Union scheme. French and British farm unions have also called for substantial cuts in set-aside. The UK National Farmers' Union has called on European Union agriculture ministers to rethink the scheme at next week's council meeting in Brussels. Poor weather and current set-aside obligations are expected to cut this year's EU grain harvest to between 158m and 160m tonnes compared with 166m tonnes last year. The average harvest before the 1992 Common Agricultural Policy reforms was 185m tonnes. Copa said it urgently requested a reduction in the set-aside 'which will not affect the good functioning of the market'. Sir David Naish, president of the NFU, warned that if set-aside was maintained at its current level of 15 per cent, it could prove difficult for EU farmers to maintain their market. The European Commission says that 15 per cent was never meant to be a sacrosanct figure. 'It's a management tool - the figure can go up or down depending on the real outcome of the harvest,' an official said. EU cereals stocks have dropped from 33m tonnes to 16m tonnes in the past year. Farmers' leaders say this could mean European customers having to import unless the set-aside is reduced. Sir David is also urging ministers to take the matter up as quickly as possible to allow time for farmers to adjust planting patterns this autumn.</p>

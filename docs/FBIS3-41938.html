			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has said that  Ukraine was, to all intents and purposes, a nuclear state since  its parliament had virtually not ratified the strategic arms  reduction treaty (START-1).    In late 1993 the Ukrainian parliament ratified the Start-1  treaty, but with reservations which changed its essence.    Meeting in Moscow Wednesday well-known political leaders,  U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, the Russian Minister  said that presence of nuclear arms on the territory of Ukraine  would be discussed at the Moscow summit January 12 between  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his U.S. counterpart Bill  Clinton.    Grachev believes taking part in the summit will be Ukrainian  leader Leonid Kravchuk who will give a certain impetus to the  possible solution.    Nuclear weapons, believes the Minister, cannot be a subject  of bargaining. This is dangerous, said Grachev.    He said he has a hot line with U.S. Defense Secretary Les  Aspin [as received].    Grachev has said on Wednesday, at 16:00 he intends to  discuss  with his U.S. counterpart acute security problems.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY FEUD MAY BE BREWING IN MARCH FONG EU'S HOUSEHOLD  </P> <P> Things may be getting a little dicey in the household of Secretary of State  March Fong Eu.  </P> <P> Democrat Eu is not speaking to her son, Republican controller candidate Matt  Fong. In fact, Eu has been advised by her campaign staff "to avoid any contact"  with Fong, said Leo McElroy, the Sacramento consultant running Eu's reelection  campaign.  </P> <P> The problem: A 10-second television spot being aired by Fong that includes a  photograph of him and his mother -- an implied endorsement that Eu's campaign  claims the four-term incumbent never authorized.  </P> <P> Caught between party and family politics, Eu has maintained neutrality in the  contest between her son and fellow Democratic incumbent Gray Davis. Eu's  campaign hurriedly contacted Davis this week to assure him that Eu had nothing  to do with the ad.  </P> <P> "It is our view that she has to avoid any contact with (Fong) to avoid any  appearance of collusion," McElroy said Friday. "Everybody has to be aware that  there is no hanky-panky going on between the two campaigns."  </P> <P> Eu's campaign also notified the Fair Political Practices Commission of her role  -- or lack of one -- in putting together the ad, McElroy said.  </P> <P> Eu was described as "a little surprised" this week to see her photograph in the  ad. Fong's campaign asked Eu's campaign for a photograph about a month ago,  McElroy said, but the request was denied because "it would be inappropriate for  a Democratic candidate to assist a Republican candidate" -- even when they are  mother and son.  </P> <P> But Gretchen Stockdale, Fong's press secretary, said Fong had told his mother  about his plans and would not have used the photograph if she had objected. She  said the ad features a personal photograph Fong had of the two of them.  </P> <P> Stockdale acknowledged the spot is intended to capitalize on Fong's  relationship with his mother, but she said it does not violate Eu's pledge of  neutrality. It includes the voice-over, "A Tradition of Honesty, Competence and  Commitment," while the photograph is displayed.  </P> <P> "He is saying that he is carrying this tradition down from his mother, who has  been one of the most popular vote-getters in California history," Stockdale  said.  </P> <P> Stockdale said Eu and Fong "still maintain the same mother-and-son relationship  that they always have," and that she doubts Eu would cut off all contact with  her son.  </P> <P> "Blood is thicker than party," she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Q: During the past two years, I have put almost $500,000 into penny stocks  through a San Diego brokerage firm. I happened to speak with a broker from a  different firm, and he told me what some of my shares were worth. Then I talked  with the San Diego broker who sold me the shares, and he quoted me prices that  were higher. In fact, the first broker's prices are always higher. Why? -- San  Diego  </P> <P> A: The first thing you should do is contact the Los Angeles office of the  National Assn. of Securities Dealers and report what's going on. The next thing  you should do is make an appointment with a psychiatrist to find out why you  would invest $500,000 in penny stocks.  </P> <P> Your next call should be to the Securities and Exchange Commission office in  Los Angeles. The number is (213) 965-3998. You might also get help from  California securities regulators. And you might want to hire a lawyer.  </P> <P> I spoke with Joseph Goldstein, who heads the SEC's penny stock unit in  Washington, and he says it is not unusual for stock quotes from different  brokers to vary in thinly traded securities. "But quotes should be fairly  close," he said.  </P> <P> Goldstein thinks that you should alert authorities to see if any law is being  broken, and also so they can determine whether the practice you mention is  widespread.  </P> <P> Not all penny stocks, of course, are worthless. But a lot of them are.  </P> <P> Q: A broker suggested that I invest $25,000 in Nestle, the Swiss company,  because of its high earnings ratio and because it is one of the largest food  distributors in Europe.  </P> <P> With more and more countries getting freedom from communism, it is hoped that  their income will increase demands for products from which they had been  deprived. What's the opinion of Wall Street about this stock? -- Lakewood,  Colo.  </P> <P> A: That's an interesting thought: The Berlin Wall came down so that all the  deprived people in Eastern Europe could run out and buy chocolate candy.  </P> <P> Ronald Morrow, the Smith Barney &amp; Co. food and beverage analyst, calls  Nestle S. A. of Vevey, Switzerland, a "very well run, high-quality company."  </P> <P> He's been recommending purchase of the stock, even though he sees some  problems. Forget about Eastern Europe. Think about America, says Morrow,  because Nestle gets 40% of its income here.  </P> <P> With the U.S. economy slowing, the big question is: Will strapped Americans cut  back on their consumption of Nestle food products? Nestle's earnings could also  be hurt by the weak dollar. The numbers could look worse than they really are  when the company's sales in dollars are translated back into Swiss francs.  </P> <P> But Nestle's stock has already retreated some, so maybe investors are taking  the company's potential problems into account.  </P> <P> By the way, Morrow is one of the few analysts in the United States who follows  Nestle.  </P> <P> Q: Several years ago, I inherited 16,666 shares of Overthrust Resources Ltd.  stock. The company was supposed to merge with Polaris Resources. I have been  trying to locate Overthrust to see if the stock has any value. If it is  worthless, I would like to take a tax loss. Letters that I've written to the  company are returned, stamped "undeliverable." Can you help me find out if this  stock has any value? -- Denver  </P> <P> A: Overthrust Resources seems to still exist legally, but the company is  inactive. Robert Fisher of R. M. Smythe &amp; Co., a New York company, says  Overthrust last traded on Aug. 22, 1989, at 1 cent a share. There don't appear  to be any bids for the stock at this time, and shares are being offered at 2  cents.  </P> <P> The company is still listed in the Denver phone book, but its number, (303)  298-0430, isn't manned. A recording at that phone number refers you to (303)  592-7077, which is the office of Polaris Resources.  </P> <P> The woman who picked up the phone at Polaris, but who didn't give her name,  said Polaris doesn't own Overthrust. "Overthrust just works out of the same  office," she said.  </P> <P> The woman confirmed that Overthrust's stock isn't trading and that it isn't  worth "much more" than 2 cents a share. She also says Overthrust doesn't plan  any expansion and won't file for bankruptcy.  </P> <P> You'll have to consult a tax adviser on what to do about the stock in an  ongoing company that you are unable to sell. Even if you can claim a loss, the  stock's price at the time you came into possession of it might have been so low  as to make such a move unprofitable. JOHN CRUDELE  </P></p>

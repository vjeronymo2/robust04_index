			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Falling output predicted for south by bank SOUTHERN England will continue to suffer depressed economic conditions this year with output falling and unemployment rising sharply, National Westminster Bank warns. While Wales, the north of England and Scotland will lead a sluggish economic upturn, the bank expects the number of jobless in the south-west, the south-east and East Anglia to increase by 13 per cent, 16 per cent and 17 per cent respectively in the 12 months to March next year. Output in the three southern regions is expected to fall by between 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent this year, compared with economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the north of England, and 0.5 per cent in Wales. Mr David Kern, the bank's chief economist, says in a report that he expects the UK economy to start growing in the present quarter and to reach a 2 per cent annual growth rate by the end of the year. He forecasts 0.3 per cent growth for the economy as a whole this year, with the non-oil economy stagnating. He predicts that the economy 'will register a distinct improvement' next year, with relatively strong growth of between 2.4 per cent and 2.8 per cent in the south and Midlands and growth of 2.6 per cent in Scotland. Unemployment, he warns, will rise by about 250,000 to peak at 2.95m by the end of March next year, lifting the UK rate to 10.5 per cent from 9.6 per cent last month. Apart from Northern Ireland and East Anglia, where the bank forecasts unemployment rates of 14.6 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively in March this year, joblessness in the regions is not expected to deviate by more than 1 percentage point from the average. NatWest expects Scottish and Welsh unemployment to be clearly below the national average at 9.5 per cent by next spring while the west Midlands will have the highest mainland jobless rate of 11.5 per cent. The south-east will have a jobless rate at the national average of 10.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Yeltsin out to boost power of presidency RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin is seeking to place unfettered powers in the presidency with a series of constitutional amendments rendering the office invulnerable to challenge from a future parliament. A series of amendments to the new constitution, now being thrashed out by a constitutional assembly, point to a greatly strengthened presidency and an end to previous efforts to compromise with the growing power of the regions. A set of decrees issued by the president yesterday also point to the biggest push yet to bring Russia's rebellious regions under a renewed central command, with the president at its apex. Mr Yeltsin has demanded that all regions and republics immediately pay all taxes due to the central government - on pain of having all credits and centrally distributed supplies suspended from November 1. A number of republics and regions have withheld taxes, while arguing with the federal authorities over their respective rights to spend them; other regions have claimed republican status; and a group of regions in the Urals have proclaimed a new Urals Republic. Under the constitutional amendments, the president gains the right to appoint the prime minister, rather than just suggesting a candidate to be confirmed by the lower house of the new parliament. He can also sack the government without the parliament's agreement and ultimately disband it, if it consistently opposes his choice. The president can no longer be impeached for breaking the constitution - the issue on which the previous parliament sought to remove him. Treachery against the state or other serious crimes are now the only grounds for impeachment - which must itself be confirmed by a higher court, and the impeachment process be completed within three months. The president can suspend any executive body of power in Russia for breaking federal law, and the post of vice-president has been abolished, leaving the prime minister as the next in line in case of death or incapacity. Amendments to the previous draft also include a cancelling of separate citizenship rights and all foreign trade links must now be 'organised' by the centre, while the form of government adopted by regions and republics must be approved by the federal authorities. The draft, which must be completed within the next two weeks, will then go to a referendum before being adopted.</p>

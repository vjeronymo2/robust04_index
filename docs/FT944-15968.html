			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / City expresses anger over Eurotunnel revenue targets Eurotunnel, which is due to announce its results for the first half of 1994 on Monday, was yesterday accused of taking a 'flippant' approach to its investors only five months after making one of the largest rights issues in UK history. The casual way in which Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, revealed last week that it would not meet its forecasts of revenue prompted anger and unease in the City and led to a further fall in the company's share price. The shares fell 17p to 228p, down 20p on the week. The latest upset in Eurotunnel's frequently stormy relationship with the City resulted from a remark by Mr Graham Corbett, chief financial officer, that delays in the launch of tunnel rail services made it 'blindingly obvious' that the company could not make its forecast for 1994 revenues of Pounds 137m. 'The surprise is in the flippant way this has been released to the market,' said one analyst. 'It was not blindingly obvious in May when they produced a 120-page rights issue document which had been vetted by their lawyers and bankers.' But Eurotunnel insisted yesterday that earlier press comment had concluded that forecasts would not be met and that there was nothing new in Mr Corbett's remarks. Analysts estimated that the delays could reduce Eurotunnel's revenues by between Pounds 30m and Pounds 50m. This, combined with the decline in the company's share price may put the company in breach of its banking covenants. Eurotunnel calculated in May that it had a buffer of Pounds 419m in its funding arrangements, including an assumption it would raise Pounds 200m from the sale of its warrants. The more cautious estimates of its bankers gave it a funding margin of only Pounds 34m. Eurotunnel denied that there was any danger of it breaking its bank covenants. It was not due to start calling down its bank facilities until next spring or summer at the earliest, it said. The company's results statement will coincide with the announcement of the starting date and fares of Eurostar services connecting London, Paris and Brussels.</p>

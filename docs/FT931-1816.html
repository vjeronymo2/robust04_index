			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Business Law: Air crash verdict - Legal Briefs A jury in Rochester, New York, has awarded Dollars 107.3m, the largest verdict in aviation crash history, to the estate of a family of four who died in a crash in North Carolina in November 1986. A jury found the aircraft's engine manufacturer, Teledyne Continental Motors, negligent because it had known about problems with the engine from correspondence with the pilot. Unusually for a verdict of this size, none of the award was for punitive damages. The previous highest jury award for an air crash victim was Dollars 8m against Delta Airlines for the 1985 death of the head of IBM's personal computer division and his wife.</p>

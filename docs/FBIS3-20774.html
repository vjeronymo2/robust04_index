			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by S.M. Vankova: "The Successful Ones Will Break the </F> Ice"]    [Text] According to a Privatization Agency announcement,  the ice will finally be broken a month from now, when the  privatization of some 20 chosen companies begins in conformity  with the Law on Transformation of Companies With State Capital.  This signifies the realization of the so-called pilot program,  an important and valued agency activity in which the  transformation of the chosen companies will be conducted and  managed by its experts. In a number of companies foreign  technical aid from EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development] will be involved, with the inclusion of  international experts who will assist in a number of the  activities for the pilot transformations.    Using the positive experiences from pilot privatizations  carried out in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and  with guidance from the consultants "Coopers &amp; Lybrand," the  agency will use the pilot privatization in 20 companies with the  aim of testing the practical application of the law, and it will  draw up regulations and rules for a smoother implementation of  the transformations and simpler solutions to the practical  problems that arise. The basic intention, as a matter of fact,  in realizing this complex program, is to serve as a kind of  school for the companies, which are apparently cautious and  inhibited in starting this important process.  <H5>  Successful Companies </H5>   With the aim of completing the pilot programs as soon as  possible, that is, to privatize these 20 companies by the  beginning of the second half of this year, the agency will start  selecting the more successful companies. Those will primarily  be companies with positive results, not very dependent on the  current blockades in the Macedonian economy. Special attention  will also be paid to keeping, if possible, 50 percent of the  capital in the hands of the state; the companies should not have  problems in proving the ownership over the buildings and  equipment; they will have a defined position on the market, and  the developing programs will have particular influence on them.  In making the selection, a special effort will be made to choose  companies that are more likely to complete the transformation  successfully, bearing in mind their initial views on the  appropriate means of transformation. These criteria will be  tested in questionnaires in which the interested companies will  have to present a lot of information on all aspects of the  situation they are in, including those of interest to foreign  investors and for the protection of the environment.    According to the assistant manager of the Privatization  Agency Olga Mihajlovska Tikvarovska, pilot privatization will be  carried out in companies that are starting this process for the  first time, but also in some that began their transformation  according to the old regulations, in which the Social Accounting  Control finished its work. Small, medium, and large companies  will be included, to provide testing for different models of  transformation as defined by the law.  <H5>  Foreign Investors </H5>   The advantages to the companies included in the pilot  programs, to be announced two weeks from now, are great. They  will overcome all the difficulties on the way to privatization  less painfully, with the professional help of the agency and the  international experts. In some, the agency will enter into a  partial or full sale to foreign investors. Opportunities for  foreign capital entry are seen through the cooperation of those  who provide technical aid, which will help to promote the chosen  companies to the international economic and investing public.  It certainly signifies an improvement in their negotiating  position in discussions with foreign parties interested in  investing in definite cases of privatization.    The procedures throughout the phases of pilot privatization  will be continuously elaborated and presented to the public,  thus making the dilemmas and problems clarified in the  application of the legal solutions accessible to all companies  planning to start transformation. How much the pilot  privatizations will contribute to breaking the apparent  reputation among companies about this fatal process will be seen  only after the "landing of the pilots." Moreover, there are  problems that are much more complicated and not easily solved  that the companies will in the end have to face themselves.</p>

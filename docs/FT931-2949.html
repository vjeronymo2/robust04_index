			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Company News: Wolters Kluwer lifts dividend by 14% WOLTERS Kluwer, the Dutch legal, tax and education publisher, yesterday reported a 21 per cent increase in 1992 net profit and announced a 14 per cent rise in its annual dividend. Net profit rose to Fl 258m (Dollars 139m) from Fl 214m the year before, in spite of a slight decline in turnover to Fl 2.36bn from Fl 2.38bn. Operating profit was up nearly 12 per cent at Fl 404m. Wolters Kluwer, which attributed the gain to its low sensitivity to the business cycle and the geographic spread of its activities in the US and Europe, said it planned to raise its dividend to Fl 1.32 fro Fl 1.16 in 1991. However, the company also made unspecified provisions in its 1992 accounts for additional restructuring in the Netherlands and the UK. For 1993, Wolters Kluwer is forecasting further rises in sales and profits.</p>

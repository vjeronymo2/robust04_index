Moscow time Sunday.    Officials from the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations  told ITAR-TASS that the fire had caused explosions, while  unexploded shells had been scattered within the range of 10  kilometers from the ammunition depot.    A total of 200 out of 800 wagons containing ammunition had  been destroyed by the fire. Service rooms for the guards,  soldiers' barracks and other wooden constructions were reduced  to rubble and a railway track was partially damaged as well.  Windows were smashed out and roofs of buildings damaged in  nearby settlements. No casualties were reported.    Explosions stopped at 13:00 P.M. on May 14, but occasional  explosions of small-calibre shells were reported throughout the  night from May 14 to May 15. Around 14:00 P.M. Moscow time,  2,500 people had been evacuated from the dangerous zone by  el-trains [as received] and trucks to the towns of Partizansk  and Bolshoy Kamen.    Now that the fire has been extinguished and the situation  came back to normal, the Commission for Emergency Situations of  the Maritime region decided to return the evacuated people to  places of their permanent residence. The territory of the depot  and nearby areas are being inspected by air and ground emergency  teams.</p>

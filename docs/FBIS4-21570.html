Representatives from various regions of Russia where  arsenals  of chemical weapons are located have just paid a visit here.  They were acquainted with the fully automated production  process. Specialists believe that this method of processing  lethal substances is the best.    According to a statement by a Ministry of Defense spokesman,  the lesson provided by Chapayevsk has been learned. Henceforth  the construction of all facilities connected with the  destruction of chemical weapons will take place with the  participation of the local authorities.    It is obvious that this sort of facility is indispensable.  After all, maintaining numerous storage facilities containing  toxic substances is not just expensive, it is dangerous.

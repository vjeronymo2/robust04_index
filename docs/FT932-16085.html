			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / International Company News: Varity unit buys Danish stake MASSEY-FERGUSON, the farm equipment group owned by Varity of the US, has taken a one-third stake in a new company formed to acquire the assets of Dronningborg Maskinfabrik, the Danish combine harvester manufacturer. The deal secures supplies of all the Massey combine harvesters sold in Europe. Dronningborg has been making combines for Massey since 1984, but its future became uncertain when Dania Holding, its parent company, suspended payments to creditors in January.</p>

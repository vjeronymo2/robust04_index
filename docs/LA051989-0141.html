			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> TEPPER SWAPS WEIRDNESS FOR SONG-SERVING SIMPLICITY  </P> <P> After playing with two of the most determinedly individualistic musicians in  the history of pop -- Don Van Vliet, a.k.a. Captain Beefheart, and Tom Waits --  it's only fitting that Moris Tepper's music bears no relation to his work for  his former employers.  </P> <P> In place of the maddeningly complex, angular guitar work Tepper brought to such  Beefheart albums as "Ice Cream for Crow" and Waits' "Frank's Wild Years," his  performance at UC Irvine's well-hidden Zot Spot Cafe on Wednesday night focused  on his own stubbornly original folk-based songwriting.  </P> <P> Rather than the thorny thickets of sound he's known for (by a small number of  fans, granted, though at least one person in Wednesday's audience hummed  Beefheart bass lines between songs), Tepper applied a song-serving simplicity  to his acoustic guitar, banjo and mandolin awork. While not quite ready for the  "genius" label attached to his mentors' music, Tepper's faith in his songs was  well placed.  </P> <P> His music might be comparable to the folk forays of fellow L.A. musician Peter  Case, but only inasmuch as he is hewing his own path through a musical  wilderness. Tepper's songs used touches of Japanese koto music, skewed circus  tunes, jug band music, Irish balladry and even an adapted anthem from the Boer  War as a set-closer, but he pulled the disparate styles together into an  impassioned package.  </P> <P> That feat was abetted by an empathetic trio (which should have been a quartet,  but its bass player was presumed lost on the highway) composed of former Motels  drummer Brian Glascock, keyboardist Louis Durra and multi-instrumentalist Tom  Roach. With their assistance, Tepper found an emotional heart in arrangements  -- using jaw harps, concertinas, duck calls, slide whistles and sundry -- that  might have seemed errant novelties in other hands.  </P> <P> With a straining voice that bears some relation to the Waterboys' Mike Scott,  Tepper's vocal on "Man Overboard" detailed the plight of homelessness, but with  a wry eye for the things its narrator has lost: "I even had my own front lawn."  </P> <P> "When I Dream" placed the tale of a crumbled relationship into the sort of  jaunty, jangly arrangement little heard since Dylan's "Please Crawl Out Your  Window."  </P> <P> Tepper's most pointed song, "Dead Presidents," applied a Scottish flair to a  lyric on the way money can color one's feeling for living:  </P> <P> Life is always the same  </P> <P> You have to drive to the doctor in the pouring rain  </P> <P> Life never seems to make as much sense  </P> <P> As when you have a pocketful of dead presidents.  </P> <P> </P></p>

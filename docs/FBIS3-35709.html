			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 0700 GMT on 30 January carries the  "Test Range" program devoted to nuclear disarmament.    The first segment is a brief satirical look at problems in  the military. In particular, drug abuse in the Army is noted.  An increase from 3,000 addicts in 1991 to over 9,000 in 1992 is  noted.    The second segment of the show is of an undated interview  between Air Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov and military  commentator Aleksandr Zhilin. The interview covers the  situation in the Crimea. Zhilin suggests that the Crimea may  become a Karabakh between Russia and Ukraine. Shaposhnikov asks  if the whole Black Sea Fleet, however glorious and grand, is  worth creating a bloody situation between two great, fraternal  peoples, linked together by centuries. He then notes that there  will be no fighting between Russia and Ukraine. He says if  someone thinks there will be, then that person should be put  away somewhere safe, where he can rest with his Napoleonic  visions.    The third segment deals with implementing provisions of the  START treaties. Uragan transporters, fitted with specialized  equipment, are seen arriving at the site of one or more missile  shafts. Military personnel are seen putting on protective  clothing.    There is a brief interview with an engineer familiar with  the  deactivation process. The process is described as a closed  system, preventing any contact between fuel components in the  missile and the atmosphere; an operation that guarantees  ecological safety.    Footage from a helicopter over a testing range is shown  next.  Assorted debris from explosions or launchings is shown.    A narrator recalls that Russia is ill-equipped to either  scrap its missiles, let alone clean up the single testing range  of its strategic missile troops, which occupies an area of  175,000 hectares.    During a brief interview with a junior officer, it is stated  that 16,000 tonnes of detachable parts have accumulated from  falls over the range during 35 years of its existence. The  officer says four operations are now under way: 1) to reduce  the guaranteed residue in the fuel supplies in missile boosters  and to reduce the number of component fall areas; 2) to assess  ecological situation in fall areas; 3) to clear up the fall  areas; and 4) to keep the local population informed.    Dangers that Russia faces from aging nuclear weapons is  highlighted next: over 30 percent of Russian warheads on standby  will be in a dangerous condition in two years' time.    Footage of the (?Surovatikha) deactivation base is next  shown. The camera pans around parked missiles which appear to be  encased in tubular containers. An announcer notes that the  Pebonzhur and Surovatikha facilities are the first Russian bases  for liquidating intercontinental missiles.    The liquidation process is detailed next. Each SS-17 or  SS-18 missile is first cleaned of dangerous fuel components,  then painstakingly divided into separate fragments. The base  can liquidate over 40 heavy missiles a year, freeing up to 1,000  tonnes of expensive metals and alloys for industry.    Past methods of liquidation--via explosions--are noted. The  problem of funding for new more efficient bases is mentioned.    Russian intentions to create a missile based on the SS-25  are  next described. It is stated that this new missile will be more  vulnerable than the SS-18 as it will not be able to release up  to 1,000 false targets to fool enemy antimissile defenses.  Fiscal problems are again mentioned as an impediment in the  design process.    The 29-minute program ends with the narrator expressing his  hope for world nuclear disarmament.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Guenter Rinsche (CDU), chairman of the </F> German Union Caucus in the European Parliament, by Karl-Otto  Sattler; place and date not given: "Only Europe Can Manage It"]    [Text] Guenter Rinsche (63), chairman of the German  Union caucus in the European Parliament, classifies the  "unpleasant episode of the protest election" that took place in  Europe on 12 June as a problem--namely, when one has to take the  heat for domestic policy matters for which one is not  responsible. It is still too little known by the general public  that important decisions are made at the European level which  affect all citizens. Rinsche is running in the European  Parliament election in second position on the North  Rhine-Westphalian Land list of the CDU [Christian Democratic  Union]. Together with the east German observers, the Union  caucus in Strasbourg includes 41 members.    [Sattler] As early as 1989, the Union parties [CDU/CSU  (Christian Social Union)] fared rather poorly with 37.7 percent.  Now they are threatened with an even more miserable performance  as a result of domestic policy weaknesses. Isn't it frustrating  to be punished in European elections for things that have  nothing to do with European politics?    [Rinsche] In Germany, 37.7 percent for a large party is  indeed not the best possible result, whereas elsewhere this  result would be seen as great. Here in Germany, one had gotten  used to a system with few parties, and now more groupings have  the opportunity to enter the parliaments. But you are right, it  is a problem when one is made to pay the price for things for  which one is not responsible. Unfortunately, we will have these  problems as long as the German citizens do not recognize the  fact that decisions important for their own lives are being made  in Europe, and that the European Parliament is increasingly  gaining more rights. It is our job to make this clear, so that  this unpleasant episode of the protest election will disappear.    [Sattler] Also in a European politics sense, the Union  parties are making things difficult for themselves: Helmut Kohl  for, and Edmund Stoiber against, Europe. How are you going to  convey this curious split to the voters?    [Rinsche] During an intense discussion with the European  Parliament representatives of the Union, Stoiber clearly stated  that he favors the continuation, indeed even a certain  strengthening, of European unity. But in Stoiber's opinion,  everything that does not absolutely have to be solved on a  European scale is to be done by the nations and the Federal  laender. I think that the difference is not as great as it is  sometimes portrayed to be. And yet it cannot be denied that  there are differences here. The CDU accepts in absolute terms  the concept of Helmut Kohl. It cannot be ruled out that certain  questions being asked by Stoiber, concerning the funding of the  European Parliament, for example, will take on increasing  relevance in Germany as a whole.    [Sattler] There are differences, in other words. Who in the  Union will emerge victorious from the directional battle, the  pro-Europeans or the Euroskeptics? Fears are making the rounds  in many European Union [EU] countries that after Kohl there will  be no more true pro-Europeans.    [Rinsche] This notion is indeed being expressed repeatedly.  Nor can the fact be overlooked that it is Helmut Kohl who is the  paramount figure in German European politics. For this reason  the chancellor should be empowered to pursue these politics  further. I feel that there is a European flexibility in dealing  with hardships. I am deliberately formulating it this way. There  will be European hardships, here we should not kid ourselves, in  the economic, the social, and not least the security  sectors--one need only think of East and southeastern Europe. If  we want to cope with all these difficulties, we need European  unification and the capability to act by the EU. Stemming from  this necessity is an obligation to act which sooner or later  will become clear to everyone, also to those who now still  consider themselves Euroskeptics.    [Sattler] What will you focus on primarily during the  campaign?    [Rinsche] We will call attention to the fact that the  problems which are plaguing the citizen can only be solved with  Europe--and these include unemployment, the danger of a  declining standard of living, perceptible losses on the world  markets compared to the dynamic Asiatic economies, the threat of  mass migrations, the instability in East and southeastern  Europe, the murders and rapes in the former Yugoslavia. The EU  can offer solutions to problems if it shows itself to be capable  of action.    [Sattler] The Union has not come up with an especially large  number of prominent first-string politicians for the European  Parliament elections--could this be an indication that even  after Maastricht the European Parliament is still not taken  really seriously?    [Rinsche] The question is: How do you define prominent  politicians? That does not automatically mean that the dumb ones  are here and the smart ones over there, that the well-known  people are here and the less well-known people there. I feel  that the level of excellence of the representatives of the  European Parliament is very definitely comparable to the level  reached by the representatives of national and regional  parliaments. But it is true that there are no prominent persons  here in the sense that they are known throughout the world.  However, I think this will improve once the debates and  resolutions resulting from the aforementioned European needs  penetrate more into the public consciousness.    [Sattler] Egon Klepsch as president of the European  Parliament was not nominated again by the CDU for the 12 June  election. Why was the most prominent Union politician kicked out  in Strasbourg? Kohl is supposed to have been the driving force  behind it.    [Rinsche] I don't see it that way. Klepsch is surely the  most  outstanding figure in the European Parliament. We are grateful  for everything he has done, and is doing, for European unity.  The departure by Klepsch is a very complex question and has a  number of facets, particularly in Klepsch's CDU land  organization in the Rhineland-Palatinate. One of these aspects  is that there are young politicians who want to get ahead;  another that must be considered is the aspect of the regional  distribution of candidates, also within individual land  organizations. Klepsch himself will reflect on where his powers  will be most meaningfully utilized. I do not think that Helmut  Kohl triggered the action. Difficulties arose in the CDU  executive committee of the Rhineland-Palatinate. Kohl acted as  mediator at the request of the party in that land. A compromise  was found, one that did not have the approval of all those  involved.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Skukin: "Passions Over Privatization"] </F>   [Text] What will the second stage of privatization  actually be like? After 1 July will Anatoliy Chubays and his  team manage to channel this progress toward attracting  investments in industry and the development of production? The  disputes which flared up over this subject at the parliamentary  hearings showed once again how the deputies' political positions  differ and how firmly politics and the economy are still welded  together.    Summing up the ideologically close speeches of  representatives of several factions -- Adrian Puzanovskiy ("New  Regional Policy"), Vladimir Lisichkin (Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia), and Valentin Martemyanov (Russian Federation  Communist Party) -- one can draw the conclusion that  privatization did not have a human face to start with and will  not have in the future.    The opponents of A. Chubays' program believe that not one of  the set tasks has been fulfilled.    "We will not accept the idea of the suspension of  privatization," said Sergey Ivanenko, the "Yabloko" spokesman  and deputy chairman of the committee for property,  privatization, and economic activity. "Such a step will have no  political success." The bloc's concept for post-voucher  privatization is as follows: A program is needed for the  reorganization of enterprises which are now reminiscence of  collective farms. For this it is necessary, first, to create a  law on privatization and a system of voluntary bankruptcies.  Second, we must move from the mass process of privatization to  specific work with each enterprise. And the most important  element is that it is essential to expand the front of  privatization -- to begin to regulate privatization in other  spheres."    Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State Committee for the  Administration of State Property [Goskomimushchestvo], reacted  with understanding to the deputies' contradictory assessments of  his program -- this reflects the feelings of different groups of  the population. Some say that the process is dragging one and  that privatization must be carried out more rapidly. Others, on  the contrary, are speaking of a privatization blitzkrieg. But,  A. Chubays explained, the target for the pace of privatization  was not formulated by the Goskomimushchestvo and not by the  government but... by the former Russian Federation Supreme  Soviet. The "privatization program" it adopted states that the  Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo must complete the  transformation of small and medium enterprises into joint stock  companies by 1 October 1992. So that the privatizers did not  even keep to that deadline. "If the State Duma adopts any other  laws," A. Chubays stressed, "we shall act in accordance with  them."</p>

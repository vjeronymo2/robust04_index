			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Parliament 'subverted' in coal row THE CHAIRMAN of the Commons trade and industry committee has accused the government of subverting the authority of parliament in its handling of the coal crisis. Labour MP Mr Richard Caborn made the charge because of the way MPs were denied the opportunity to vote on his committee's report on the crisis. The government's coal white paper, published last month, largely passed over the select committee's detailed recommendations. Mr Caborn's charge is contained in a letter to Mr Terence Higgins, chairman of the Commons liaison committee, which oversees the select committee system. He says that, by ensuring the only way MPs could have voted on the report was on an opposition motion, the government 'undermined the credibility and independence of the select committee system'. He calls for reform, saying 'a more rational and transparent means of dealing with such matters' is needed.</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: CRH pays Fl 108m for Dutch companies CRH, the Dublin-based international construction materials group, has begun the new year as it finished the old - with a further round of acquisitions in the Netherlands. The company yesterday announced the cash purchase of Struyk Holding and Kleiwarenfabriek Wessem for a total of Fl 108m (Pounds 39m). CRH said the two companies, which had a combined trading profit of Fl 18.7m on turnover of Fl 137m in the year ended December 31, would provide additional paving materials and clay brick manufacturing capacity. Last November, CRH doubled its number of builders' merchants outlets in the Netherlands by acquiring Braks and Monster, as part of a broader IPounds 22m (Pounds 23.5m) international expansion also involving acquisitions in the UK and US. Mr Brian Hill, group director responsible for Europe, said yesterday 'In the course of 1992 we have strengthened our strategic position in the Netherlands by bolt-on additions in three of our core business areas . . . .The addition of Wessem to our clay brick group consolidates our leadership of the quality brick sector while the acquisition of Struyk significantly strengthens CRH's presence in concrete products on the European mainland'. According to BCP stockbrokers in Dublin, 21 per cent of operating profits in 1991 were derived from operations in the Netherlands. These profits are forecast to rise to IPounds 20m this year from IPounds 14m last year. CRH's latest purchases now give it a broad presence in the Dutch market for concrete, bricks and clay products and fencing, together with a strong distribution network of builders' merchants and DIY outlets.</p>

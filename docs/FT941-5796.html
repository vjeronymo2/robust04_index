			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Mercury trust is largest ever Mercury's European Privatisation investment trust was less than Pounds 4m oversubscribed, but has still become the largest investment trust ever launched. The trust's maximum size was set at Pounds 575m after Pounds 325m had been raised in a placing. The similar Kleinwort European privatisation trust was oversubscribed by Pounds 380m when it closed a month ago, after setting its limit at Pounds 500m. However, it had a part-paid structure, with the balance due in August. The Mercury trust is fully paid. Both will invest in existing and forthcoming privatisations. More than 43,000 individual applications, totalling Pounds 158.5m, were made in the public offer for the Mercury trust, with an additional Pounds 95.4m from an intermediaries offer. Only the largest applications in the public offer will be scaled back; those for less than Pounds 15,000 will be met in full. About Pounds 57m of the applications were for shares to be held in Mercury's own personal equity plan. Mr Lough Callahan, Mercury Asset Management's director of investment trusts said: 'It is astonishing to raise a sum of this magnitude when world equity markets have been under considerable downward pressure. 'We believe this volatility has deterred more speculative investors who might have considered stagging the offer.' Dealings in packages of five shares with one warrant attached are due to start on March 11. Separate trading in the shares and warrants will follow on April 25.</p>

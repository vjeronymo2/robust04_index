			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / International Company News: Norwegian shipowner's profits reduced by 46% LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's top three bourse-listed shipowners, disclosed a near 50 per cent fall in first-half net profits to NKr120m (Dollars 20.6m) from NKr224m a year earlier. This followed a plunge to second-quarter net losses of NKr15m from profits of NKr128m in the same period last year. The deterioration was mainly due to difficult market conditions for the combination carriers, as well as higher operating expenses and a lower average exchange rate between the dollar and the krone, the company said. Group operating profits in the first half fell to NKr161m from NKr229m. The company said that it considered the operating result to be a good one in view of the prevailing conditions of the shipping markets and the weakened dollar. First-half freight revenue slipped to NKr1.084bn from NKr1.142bn as operating expenses rose to NKr239m from NKr172m. The group took a charge of NKr41m for financial losses against a NKr6m gain last time. In the second quarter financial losses hit NKr86m - including foreign exchange losses of NKr79m - compared with losses of NKr4m a year before. Vard, the Norwegian cruise and ferry operator, has reported a fall in first-half pre-tax losses to NKr128.5m from NKr190.3m a year earlier. In the second quarter, Vard cut pre-tax losses to NKr86.8m from NKr138.6m for the same period in 1991. The group turned round to half-year operating profits of NKr210.21m from losses of NK38.05m. Vard said the outlook in 1992 and 1993 for its cruise operations appeared promising. Larvik Line, one of Vard's ferry operations, returned to half-year operating profits of NKr11.2m from losses of NKr2.9m.</p>

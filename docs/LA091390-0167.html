			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN STABBING CASE KNIFED AT COURT; VICTIM HELD;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: JUST BEFORE HIS TRIAL IS TO START IN PASADENA, THE DEFENDANT IS  ATTACKED IN AN ELEVATOR, ALLEGEDLY BY THE MAN HE IS ACCUSED OF KNIFING IN A  BARROOM BRAWL.  </P> <P> Just minutes before his trial was to start, a defendant accused of stabbing  another man during a barroom brawl was knifed himself Wednesday -- allegedly by  his victim -- as both men shared an elevator in the Pasadena Courthouse,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Allie Braverman, 40, was hospitalized in stable condition with at least five  serious puncture wounds in the back and torso following the bizarre 10:30 a.m.  confrontation, which started after he stepped into an elevator to ride the six  floors up to the courtroom.  </P> <P> The only other person on the elevator was Joseph Hernandez, according to  authorities.  </P> <P> It was Hernandez whom Braverman had allegedly stabbed half a dozen times a year  ago during a fight at a Rosemead bar, leading to Braverman's arrest on charges  of attempted murder. Opening statements in his trial had been set for Wednesday  morning.  </P> <P> It was unclear how the two men wound up on the elevator together. "That's the  amazing thing here," said one Pasadena police investigator who did not want to  be identified, "and we still don't have an answer to that one. We're trying to  find out."  </P> <P> What is known is that Braverman, bleeding profusely, staggered out of the  elevator on the courthouse's top floor and into a courtroom -- Department G --  about 20 yards away. His dramatic entrance interrupted a hearing.  </P> <P> "He just walked in and stood there and said he had been knifed," said William  Surray, a defendant in another case who had been waiting in the courtroom.  "When he first walked in, there was blood all over his shirt, and as he stood  there, the blood kept dripping from everywhere."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a large crowd of sheriff's deputies, Pasadena police and other law  enforcement officers who happened to be in the sixth-floor lobby watched in  amazement.  </P> <P> "The elevator door opens, and here you've got this crime scene," said Pasadena  Police Lt. Roger Kelley. "It sounds like some kind of retribution or  something."  </P> <P> Soon after Braverman lurched out of the elevator, Hernandez walked out, too,  and was quickly taken into custody by officers and booked in county jail on  suspicion of attempted murder, police said.  </P> <P> "He was blood-soaked," the Kelley said of Hernandez.  </P> <P> A district attorney's investigator reported having seen Hernandez emerge from  the elevator carrying what appeared to be a six-inch kitchen boning knife and  trying to hide it in an ashtray, Sheriff's Sgt. Jim Rankin said.  </P> <P> "There was a 1 1/2-inch blade left, and they found two pieces of the blade in  the elevator," Rankin said.  </P> <P> The scene's aftermath was witnessed by several jurors in the upcoming trial, as  they arrived at court to see Braverman being wheeled out and noticed the  bloodstains in the hallway.  </P> <P> As a result, Judge Charles Lee polled each of the jurors to determine whether  they could still hear the case without prejudice. Convinced they could not,  prosecutors quickly moved for a mistrial.  </P> <P> But defense attorney Thomas Nishi opposed the move, arguing that it would make  it difficult to get witnesses for a future trial because they would feel  intimidated by Hernandez. Lee is to rule on the mistrial motion today.  </P> <P> Ironically, Nishi said he had planned Wednesday to ask the judge to restrain  Hernandez because of an alleged history of violence. The attorney claimed that  Hernandez and some friends had beaten up people at the courtroom during an  earlier preliminary hearing in the case because they mistakenly thought them to  be Braverman's friends.  </P> <P> The Pasadena courthouse -- like all but the downtown Criminal Courts Building  and the Compton site in the county system -- does not have permanent metal  detectors.  </P> <P> A court security commission in the summer of 1988, spurred by incidents such as  the shooting that year of a Van Nuys bailiff by a disgruntled man, recommended  that all the criminal courts get the $54,000 detectors, but that proposal has  been slowed by staffing and funding problems, said John Steele, a court  consultant on security. Wednesday's stabbing could speed that process, and "add  an urgency" to the issue, he said.  </P></p>

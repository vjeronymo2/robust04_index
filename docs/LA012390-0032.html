			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The Dead to Play at Forum: The death of a fan who clashed with police at the  Forum in Inglewood during a Grateful Dead concert last December won't change  the group's plans to play there again in February. The Grateful Dead will  perform at the Forum Feb. 9, 10 and 11, a band spokesman said.  </P> <P> In December a three-night series of shows by the band ended with the death of a  fan who stopped breathing while handcuffed in the back of a police car. Patrick  Shanahan, 19, died after arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of  drugs. An autopsy later determined Shanahan died from compression of the neck  caused by a carotid neck hold and the death was ruled a homicide. The incident  is still under investigation by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's  Office. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

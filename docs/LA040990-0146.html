			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL '90 PREVIEW;  </P> <P> DOWNING REIGNS AS ANGELS' SELF-MADE SURVIVOR;  </P> <P> LONGEVITY: AFTER 12 UP-AND-DOWN SEASONS IN ANAHEIM, HE KEEPS PLAYING AND HOPING  FOR A CHANCE TO LESSEN THE PAIN WITH A CHAMPIONSHIP.  </P> <P> While many of his teammates were sleep-walking through the first intrasquad  game of the spring, Brian Downing was sliding into second and ripping a hole in  his pants.  </P> <P> Like Tina Turner, Downing never, ever, does anything nice and easy. He has  barreled headlong through 17 seasons in the major leagues, surviving with a  combination of savvy and brawn, often staggering but refusing to fall.  </P> <P> And Downing is the embodiment of the Angel experience, a player who in many  ways mirrors the franchise for which he has labored the past 12 seasons. He's a  bare-knuckles brawler in a finesse game and, like the Angels, has achieved his  greatest successes through brute offensive force.  </P> <P> At 39, he's the oldest player in the majors who has yet to make it to the World  Series; there are scars on his psyche from the near misses of 1979, '82 and  '86, which left the deepest wound. ("If I played 10 more years and we won it  all every year, it still wouldn't wash away that pain," Downing says).  </P> <P> Indeed, he's often intense to the point of brooding. His glare -- and on one  occasion his bat -- have chased away many a sportswriter. Even to some of his  teammates, Downing remains an enigma.  </P> <P> "Brian, well, he's just Brian," said one Angel, shrugging, "but if I ever have  a meaningful conversation with him, I'll let you know."  </P> <P> Still, you don't have to understand Downing to respect him.  </P> <P> "Certainly, there are people with more natural ability, but Brian Downing just  will not let himself fail," General Manager Mike Port said. "He's an example to  those with more capabilities that you have no excuse for not getting the best  out of yourself. To be compared to Brian, that would be the ultimate compliment  for a baseball player."  </P> <P> Downing's lunging swing might not be pretty and his stride on the basepaths  won't remind anyone of Carl Lewis. But if you're management, you've got to love  the guy's work ethic.  </P> <P> "Any time a player is pretty much self-made, you have to admire him greatly,"  Manager Doug Rader said. "Most of us cannot work at that level. Most of us are  lazy by nature. But he's done some fantastic things with his career and you  have to admire the work that goes into that.  </P> <P> "Brian is every inch a man."  </P> <P> Over the years, the man has been a barometer for the Angels. He has ridden this  roller coaster to breathtaking heights that were invariably followed by  nauseating nose dives. He has been with the Angels as they rose to the American  League Championship Series three times. And he has endured each of the three  following-season crashes, when they finished a total of 71 games out of first.  </P> <P> When he has been at his best, so have the Angels. In '79, when the franchise  won its first AL West title, Downing hit .326. In '82, he hit 28 home runs. In  '86, he drove in 95 runs.  </P> <P> Brian Downing is embarking on his 13th season with a halo on his hat. It's hard  to believe that almost-shoulder-length locks fell out of his first Angel cap.  Now, there's a trace of gray underneath.  </P> <P> Recently, the Angels' reigning patriarch reluctantly agreed to relive the past  and ponder the future. What follows is a most introspective view of the past  dozen years.  </P> <P> Buckle your seat belts, it's a bumpy ride.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE HEADY '70s  </P> <P> Downing recently had completed his fifth less-than-spectacular season with the  Chicago White Sox and was working out in a health club near his Yorba Linda  home on Dec. 5, 1977 when he heard the news.  </P> <P> He had been traded with pitchers Chris Knapp and Dave Frost to the Angels for  outfielders Bobby Bonds and Thad Bosley and pitcher Rich Dotson.  </P> <P> "All I could think about was that I was coming home to Anaheim," he said. "I  was working out when I heard about the deal and my strength went up enormously.  I was on Cloud 9.  </P> <P> "But the television newscasts were pretty critical of the trade and my joy  quickly turned when they started ripping me. After all, the Angels were giving  up Bobby Bonds and I thought Thad Bosley was a great prospect at the time.  </P> <P> "The pitchers were the focus of the trade for the Angels, I was just along for  the ride. But still, I was nervous. There was a lot of intimidation because of  the high quality people they gave up . . . and I really wasn't much of a  player."  </P> <P> Not everyone on the Angels welcomed Downing home with open arms. He began the  season platooning behind the plate with Terry Humphrey because Nolan Ryan and  Frank Tanana prefered throwing to Humphrey.  </P> <P> "Terry was catching Ryan and Tanana and I was catching the other three  starters," Downing said. "(Manager Jim) Fregosi (who replaced Dave Garcia after  46 games in '78) finally put me back there every day, but I could see where  Nolan and Frank were coming from. They were superstar pitchers who wanted to  throw to somebody they knew. And it was tough because it seemed like every time  you looked up in those days, the Angels had a new catcher.  </P> <P> "There's an intricate balance between a catcher and a pitcher and I was  basically just an offensive player playing catcher. My primary focus always has  been hitting. It's not that my heart wasn't in it, it's just that I was never  much of a finesse catcher. I was pretty aggressive. I liked to charge right  after the hitters, sort of a here-it-is-now-hit-it style."  </P> <P> The Angels finished 87-75 in 1978 and Downing admitted that he harbored great  expectations for the following year. However, 1979 turned out to be better than  he ever dared dream.  </P> <P> "The off-season after the '78 season was my first real year of free-weight  training," he said. "I accomplished some things in the weight room that changed  my life, really. I never had much self-confidence and I made some numerical  goals that year that gave me some real self-esteem. There are a lot of  parallels between the weight room and life.  </P> <P> "I made this one particular goal on the last workout before I left for spring  training. I remember thinking all day about how important it was to accomplish  what I set out to do and when I did it, I left for training camp on a natural  life high."  </P> <P> Downing, equipped with a new open stance that helped him pick up the ball  earlier as well as an upper body that made him look like a Bulgarian  weightlifter in double knits, was soon to reach new altitudes on the hit  parade. For a while, Downing and the Angels were No. 1 with a bullet.  </P> <P> "Everything just clicked," he said, smiling. "It just snowballed. Everyone did  great. The offense was spectacular and the pitching wasn't bad. But it was so  much fun because the game was never over. We were known for those magical  last-minute victories."  </P> <P> Downing's season reached an early peak about the time of the All-Star break. He  was hitting .352 and had been named to his first -- and only -- All-Star team.  And the Angels were playing a series with the Yankees.  </P> <P> "The first game was Nolan Ryan's famous near no-hitter (an eventual one-hitter  that the Angels won, 6-1). In the second game, Don Baylor homered in the eighth  off Goose Gossage and then hit a three-run homer off him in the ninth to tie  the game. (Downing scored the winning run in the 12th). In the third game,  Bobby Grich hit a two-run homer with two out in the ninth and we won, 5-4. Then  I left for the All-Star game in Seattle.  </P> <P> "It was something really special. That week was like the epitome for me."  </P> <P> The Angels won the division by three games and lost to Baltimore in the  then-best-of-five league championship series. The Orioles won the first two  games in Baltimore, 3-0, and 9-8.  </P> <P> "If we could have won one of those, I really would have liked our chances in  Game Five with Nolan Ryan pitching at 5 o'clock in Anaheim," Downing said. "But  that one didn't hurt so much. I think a lot of us felt like we had a good  season anyway . . . and that's probably why we lost."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ACHES OF THE '80s  </P> <P> "On my first at-bat in 1980, I hit a grand slam," Downing said. "I thought,  'This is going to be a great year.' Four days later, I got my ankle shattered  (during a collision at home plate with Oakland's Rickey Henderson) and missed  almost the whole year."  </P> <P> It was a lost year for the entire franchise. The Angels lost 95 games as their  players dropped onto the disabled list with a stunning succession of injuries.  </P> <P> "It happened so fast. Baylor, (Dan) Ford, myself all went down fast. I remember  one road trip where nine players stayed back for treatment. We just lost too  many pivotal players and we didn't have the people to come in and help out."  </P> <P> The Angels staggered through the strike-shortened '81 season, too, but their  famous ball-crushing offense peaked in 1982, Gene Mauch's first full year as  manager.  </P> <P> "I loved leading off for that team," said Downing, who has been a reluctant No.  1 hitter off and on for years. "Getting to play with all those future Hall of  Famers was a highlight of my life. I mean Baylor, Reggie (Jackson), (Rod)  Carew, (Fred) Lynn, Grich and (Doug) DeCinces all in the same lineup.  </P> <P> "The pitching was only so-so, but that was a great, great offensive team. If we  had that offense and the (pitching) staff we have now, nobody would ever stop  us."  </P> <P> The 1982 Angels were stopped, though, by an equally explosive offense when the  Brewers beat them in the league championship series. Bob McClure, now an Angel  reliever, picked up a 4-3 victory in the fifth and deciding game at Milwaukee.  </P> <P> The Angels wallowed in post-good-season depression and lost 92 games in 1983.  They managed to finish second in both of the next two seasons, however, falling  just one game short in 1985.  </P> <P> Now an outfielder, Downing began a stretch in 1984 when he would hit 20 or more  homers and drive in an average of 83 runs every season until last year. He set  a major league record for consecutive errorless games (244) in 1983 and then  went on another 229-game stretch that ended in 1985.  </P> <P> By 1986, Mauch was back for his second term as manager and the Angels were  poised for a third shot at the World Series, not to forget a third agonizing  shot into Brian Downing's heart.  </P> <P> The Angels and Red Sox split the first two games of the seven-game 1986  playoffs. The Angels took a 3-1 lead in games after sweeping the first two at  Anaheim Stadium before Boston rallied for a 7-6, 11-inning victory in Game No.  5.  </P> <P> "All the talk about (the late Donnie Moore's) one pitch (that Dave Henderson  hit for a game-tying home run) was ridiculous," Downing says. "To put that loss  in Donnie's lap is a joke. We came back to tie the game, didn't we? And we came  this close to blowing open Game 6 in the first inning back in Boston."  </P> <P> Then the Red Sox rolled to an 8-1 victory in the final game.  </P> <P> "I'll never forget those images," Downing said. "I didn't sleep well for a  long, long while. The nightmares kept coming. There's a permanent scar and I'll  never be able to come to grips with it."  </P> <P> Downing grieved as much for the long-tormented Mauch as he did for himself. The  former Angel manager was one of the few people who had been able to establish a  genuine rapport with Downing.  </P> <P> "He always knew exactly what was on my mind, exactly what I was trying to do  with a pitcher or the way I approached an at-bat," Downing said. "It was  uncanny really. We could communicate with facial signals. Mauch really  understood me.  </P> <P> "It really hurt that we couldn't win it for him. And we should have. That was  the best overall team we've ever had."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ON TO THE '90s  </P> <P> Brian Downing flexes his biceps and prepares to face a new decade.  </P> <P> And no one seems ready to give up on Downing until he's ready to give up on  himself. So who knows how long this saga might continue?  </P> <P> Stay tuned.  </P> <P> Downing credits his longevity to two factors: weight training and the trade to  the Angels.  </P> <P> "If it weren't for the trade to California, I would have been out of baseball  by 1980," he said. "There's no question about that. And if I hadn't started  weight training, I wouldn't have made it into the '80s. That's the '80s. Never  mind the '90s.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying weight training is for everyone. But my style is not predicated  on looking pretty. I've never been able to master the idea of body leverage and  without weight training, I couldn't hit the ball within 20 feet of the warning  track. And the mental aspect that has gone along with the weight training has  been just as vital.  </P> <P> "The rest is just a matter of identifying your capabilities and limitations and  adjusting accordingly."  </P> <P> It sounds simple enough, but remember, nothing is easy for Brian Downing. And  so it is with the question of retirement.  </P> <P> "Bobby (Grich) retired the day after the '86 season ended and I could  understand how he felt. I wanted to do the same thing myself. It was so tough  to play through that pain.  </P> <P> "It's crossed my mind every year since we lost in the playoffs, but every time  I talk about it, my friends -- and, believe or not I do have a few friends --  say, 'If you quit, this will be the year they win it.' "  </P> <P> So far, Downing has been unable to force himself to walk away from the game  that has given him so much joy and so much agony. "The first baseball game I  ever saw was the third game of the 1959 World Series between the Dodgers and  White Sox," he said. "There were 90-some thousand people there and I can  remember feeling the electricity in the air. I could feel it from the top of my  head down to my toes.  </P> <P> "That left an indelible impression on me. That got me going and I've never lost  it."  </P> <P> Certainly, he has never lost the desire to win, to win it all, a void in his  career that will haunt him until he can rub his thumb across the inside of his  finger and feel the reassuring lump of that championship ring.  </P> <P> "That ring is my sole motivation now," he said. "To be a champion in major  league baseball. I envision it as the exact opposite feeling as the one in '86.  </P> <P> "Just once, I'd like to go from the floor to the ceiling."  </P> <P> BRIAN DOWNING'S MAJOR LEAGUE CAREER  </P> <TABLE

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: WSP halved to 'satisfactory' Pounds 0.56m Profits before tax at WSP Holdings, the consulting engineer, halved from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 560,000 over the 12 months to December 31. However, Mr Geoffrey Williams, chairman, described the outcome as 'satisfactory' given current trading conditions in the construction industry. Turnover improved marginally to Pounds 10m (Pounds 9.64m) 'demonstrating our ability to increase our share of a decreasing market at reduced but profitable margins,' he added. Earnings per share dropped from 7.2p to 3.8p. The final dividend is halved to 0.9p - 'to retain working capital in the company' - reducing the total to 2p (2.9p).</p>

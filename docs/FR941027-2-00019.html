			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current demonstration programs with AmeriCorps Members may maintain or expand the number of Members (up to 25 percent, in general). In the second year application, programs proposing expansion will be required to justify the expansion in terms of need, organizational capacity, success in first-year implementation, and adequacy of plans for managing expansion. Part-time programs with AmeriCorps Members whose terms of service are longer than one year may propose a new class of AmeriCorps Members in the second year. Such a proposal constitutes an expansion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Policies and Guidelines for New Applicants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Corporation intends to streamline FY 1995 applicants into one of three categories that reflect major distinctions in program design and activities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Individual institution of higher education or partnership, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Consortium, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Demonstration program with AmeriCorps Members. Some proposal narrative guidelines and selection criteria will apply to all three categories. Other guidelines and criteria will apply specifically to one but not the others. Instead of listing specific criteria for public comment, the Corporation has decided to invite direct input on what criteria should apply to each category. In particular, the Corporation welcomes input on the development of criteria appropriate for consortium applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Overall, the selection criteria will build on those established in the FY 1994 application. The FY 1995 guidelines will reflect the following key points: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Corporation will reaffirm the Learn and Serve America program's emphasis on building capacity and strengthening infrastructure, in particular by setting clear narrative guidelines and selection criteria specifically for consortium applicants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Corporation will place added emphasis on the applicant's ability to articulate clear objectives with demonstrable outcomes and means of assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Corporation will encourage programs to focus on a single issue area or community need, instead of scattering activities among several areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The Corporation will give priority to applicants according to the following guidelines: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The issue areas to be targeted under AmeriCorps*USA also will apply to Learn and Serve America: Higher Education. These are community policing, victim assistance, neighborhood environment, early childhood development, and school success. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. In order to fund an array of institutions that reflects the diversity of American higher education, the Corporation will give priority to programs involving community colleges, HBCUs, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribally controlled colleges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Corporation may give priority to certain applicants in order to achieve geographic diversity among funded programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. The Corporation will continue to fund demonstration programs that involve AmeriCorps Members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. New demonstration programs must have both a strong focus on a national priority and an emphasis on building service-learning capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Corporation will give preference to programs that involve at least 20 AmeriCorps Members overall, that place Members in teams of two or more at each project site, that propose service activities at fewer rather than more sites, and that focus activities in a single issue area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Corporation will structure grants to new demonstration programs so that the length of the grant parallels the Members' terms of service. For example, if a program engages part-time Members in a two-year term, then the FY 1995 grant will include funds for two years, with release of funds in the second year contingent upon performance in the first year and availability of appropriations. Part-time terms spanning three years will be discouraged. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Catherine Milton, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Vice President, Corporation for National Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26588 Filed 10&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6050&hyph;28&hyph;P&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

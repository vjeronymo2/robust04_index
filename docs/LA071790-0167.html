			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CITICORP PROFITS TUMBLE 37% IN QUARTER  </P> <P> Citicorp said today its second-quarter profits tumbled 37%, reflecting problems  the nation's largest banking company is having with real estate loans and the  failure of Argentina and Brazil to pay loan interest.  </P> <P> The parent of the nation's biggest bank, Citibank, said it earned $248 million,  or 64 cents a share, for the three months ended June 30 compared with $395  million, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.  </P> <P> The company said its earnings were up 28% from consumer banking activities and  44% from international banking and finance activities.  </P> <P> But it said weakness in the real estate market, especially in the United  States, hurt its results.  </P> <P> Citicorp said its credit loss provision was $473 million for the quarter, up  $144 million from a year earlier. Its commercial loan loss reserve was boosted  by $58 million, bringing its reserve to $744 million.  </P> <P> "The continuing uncertain real estate environment may cause write-offs to  continue at relatively high levels until we see some stabilization in values,"  the company said in a statement.  </P> <P> In addition, the company reported an $82-million loss for the quarter on  cross-border loans due to non-payment of loan interest by Argentina and Brazil.  Citicorp reported a profit of $25 million from cross-border lending in the  second quarter last year.  </P> <P> For the first six months, Citicorp earned $479 million, or $1.24 a share, down  48% from $924 million, or $2.63 a share, a year earlier.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S VIEW OF KFAC  </P> <P> Bernheimer's article was an unusual farewell. The first half was oh so usual  Bernheimer -- a little wit, clever short sentences, everything intended to trap  us into a positive response. And the second half of the critique? He owns the  word pompous.  </P> <P> It would have been classy of him to have said good-by to KFAC with a bit of  sentiment and a kindlier attitude. I know critics must criticize, but after  all, there is a time for more understanding of a sad situation.  </P> <P> SELMA COMSKY  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Pound's fall gives industry scant aid THE devaluation of sterling has given only a slight boost to manufacturers, according to the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. It says the outlook for the sector remains gloomy. According to its monthly poll of purchasing managers in manufacturing, new orders last month showed little increase on September. The pessimistic tone is echoed in a broader assessment of the economy by Oxford Economic Forecasting, a consultancy, which says prospects for growth have worsened. Oxford Economic Forecasting said gross domestic product was likely to grow by only 0.8 per cent next year after a fall of 0.9 per cent this year. In the manufacturing sector, according to the institute's survey, sentiment remains depressed, even though an 'activity index' based on the results showed a slight rise. The index, built up from an average of variables in the poll including intentions about increasing output and hiring or sacking people, stood last month at 47.7, up from 45.1 in September. Consumers last month registered a rise in intentions to purchase goods and services over the next six months, according to Verdict Research, a consultancy specialising in retailing. It says the rise may be linked to seasonal changes ahead of Christmas. Kwik Save, the discount grocery chain, has become the third most popular food retailer after J. Sainsbury and Tesco, according to Audits of Great Britain, the research company. It was in fifth place 20 months ago.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carmen Castro] </F>   [Text] The Cuban Government currently is implementing very  deep economic and political changes. These changes are not well  understood abroad, but the government continues implementing  them because we are fully convinced that we will overcome the  current difficulties. The changes, which also have an important  influence on foreign relations and seek to meet the needs of the  new times, began in 1990. They are part of a reorganization  process aimed at making governmental actions meet the dynamic  international changes that have had a dramatic impact on the  lives of Cubans.    These comments were made by Luis Suarez, a Cuban expert on  international matters who heads the Cuban Center for Latin  American Studies. Suarez was specially invited for President  Frei's installation and has held several talks on the Cuban  situation with Chilean Government experts and Chilean Foreign  Ministry officials.    In Suarez' opinion, the current Cuban process cannot be  called a transition process because these changes began 35 years  ago. Considering the U.S. policy regarding Cuba, which is  translated into an economic blockade, he does not believe the  Cuban situation is critical:    [Begin Suarez recording] A country that is only 90 miles  away  from the United States, a country that has had its national  identity attacked by a power as huge as that of the United  States -- which lies hardly 90 miles from its borders -- finds  the task of building a national and popular democracy very hard,  complex, and arduous. Such a task cannot be achieved overnight.  Therefore, when people talk to me about a Cuban transition, I  tell them that the Cuban transition began 35 years ago when  Fulgencio Batista's brutal military dictatorship was ousted and  Cuba began to build this superior sort of democracy that all  peoples in the world should yearn to have. [end recording]    Suarez' option for the type of government being enforced in  his country did not prevent him from seeing the difficulties  faced by the Cuban Government. He said the economic blockade is  a powerful obstacle to any sort of change and has a dramatic  impact on the people. Paradoxically, he admitted that if the  blockade were suspended, it would have a conflictive impact on  his country. Suarez believes that a society that is blocked and  besieged develops a culture appropriate to that type of  harassment.    In his opinion, however, it is important to count on active  and concrete international solidarity. He pointed out that this  solidarity was translated into $50 million last year and it has  prevented the island from being ideologically isolated.</p>

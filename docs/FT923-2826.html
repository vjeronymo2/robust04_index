			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / US doctors' group backs care reform ONE of the largest groups representing US physicians has endorsed health care reforms similar to those proposed by Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate. The American College of Physicians, which represents 77,000 specialists, has called for a national cap on health-care spending and tough limits on fees that doctors and hospitals can charge for services. The college said it had been working on its reform plans for five years and was not attempting to take sides in the presidential campaign, where health care has emerged as one of the central issues. The Clinton campaign, however, hailed the announcement as a breakthrough, arguing that it proved that informed opinion was swinging in favour of more government intervention to manage runaway health-care costs. Like Mr Clinton, the physicians' group believes employers should be required either to provide health insurance for workers or pay a levy to help finance an expanded public-sector scheme. President George Bush has flatly rejected an overall cap on health spending and specific limits on doctors' fees, arguing that such policies are socialist and would result in queues for care. Opinion within the medical profession is split. Meanwhile Mr Bush sought yesterday to revive the issue of Mr Clinton's avoidance of the Vietnam war draft, which has dogged the Democratic candidate since the early days of his campaign. After first defending Vice-President Dan Quayle, who avoided serving in Vietnam by opting for the National Guard, Mr Bush worked himself up to fever pitch as he explained why he felt Mr Clinton's draft history was relevant to the election campaign. 'We can never forget that we ask our presidents to lead the military, to bear the awful authority of deciding to send your sons and daughters in harm's way,' Mr Bush told the National Guard Association in Utah. Mr Clinton, who also addressed the association, did not respond. Instead he discussed defence budgets and economic policy, but stuck to his earlier promise to say not a word more about the draft.</p>

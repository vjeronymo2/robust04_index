			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / A charge that's set to shock: Most UK bank customers may soon have to pay fees on their personal accounts Ms Theresa Bergne went into her bank last week to express her annoyance at the charges it makes if she goes into overdraft. The prospect of being charged even if she stays in credit is worse. 'I would be absolutely furious. They have my money, and they earn interest on it. I shouldn't have to pay for every little piece of administration,' she says. The high street banks are hardly popular at the moment, partly because of criticism of lending policies to small business. But an end to 'free' banking for personal customers threatens a nadir in their reputation. 'I think they are going to be in the firing line,' says Mr Alistair Darling, the Labour party's City of London spokesman, 'They will expose themselves to the accusation of extracting money to pay for their past mistakes.' Fears of criticism have delayed charges. But they may not be far off. The first move was made last week by Save &amp; Prosper, the small bank owned by Robert Fleming. It said that from April it would charge 15,000 holders of its Classic current account if their balance falls below Pounds 1,000. It now appears only a matter of time before big banks start imposing charges on a large proportion of their 49m personal accounts. The banks all publicly insist that they have no plans to start charging. But privately, several fear a rival might break ranks during the season of full-year results announcements, which starts on Friday with Lloyds. Pressure has been raised by the fall in base rates to 6 per cent. This has undermined the shaky economics of free banking by cutting the amount that banks earn from balances in current accounts. The returns on both money market and corporate lending have fallen along with base rates. One bank estimates that it now loses money on 80 per cent of its current accounts. The same bank argues that it would be impossible to hold back on charging if base rates fall much further. Banks now estimate that they need an average balance of between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 1,500 in each account to generate enough interest income to pay for the annual cost of Pounds 60 to Pounds 90 of running each account. The timing of a move to impose charges is a delicate calculation. If one bank acted, the others would be likely to follow. This is because the first might otherwise shift its least profitable customers to the others. One banker estimates that there are 1m customers whose business no bank really wants without charges because their balances are too low. Yet while they would probably follow a leader, most banks are reluctant to lead themselves. This is partly because of fear of public criticism. But it is also because each bank says it needs time to calculate a pricing strategy. By just introducing a blanket charge, the first bank to charge risks repelling its good customers along with its bad ones. While they ponder this problem, banks have raised charges for personal customers who slip into overdraft. In effect, they are now overcharging them to pay for unprofitable accounts kept in small surplus. 'There is a strong argument that those who borrow money are now subsidising those who play carefully by the rules,' says one bank chief executive. Free banking for customers in credit among the big banks was started by Midland in 1984 in response to the challenge from building societies which started to offer cheque-clearing accounts. The other high street banks followed in 1985. The cost of offering customers clearing services free was not such a strain because base rates were around 13 per cent. But the innovation had two damaging effects for banks. The first was that the banks encouraged the public perception that they did not provide a worthwhile service. 'We have given banking away free, so people have not regarded it as a commodity,' says a bank chief executive. 'We have made ourselves the only developed nation in the world which does not require payment for core banking.' The second damaging effect of free banking was that it raised the costs of administering accounts by fragmenting the customer base. Because accounts were free, more people opened two. The number of personal accounts at banks, which rose only slightly from 24.5m to 26m between 1981 and 1984, started growing rapidly to today's 49m. Not only did fewer accounts become profitable as average balances fell, but the costs of processing cheques and card transactions rose. The banks' Association for Payment and Clearing Services has just estimated that it now costs the banks a total of Pounds 4.5bn a year to run the clearing system, about half of which is the cost of distributing cash. Mr Ian Lindsey, banking director of Save &amp; Prosper, admits that it started charging partly because it feared the average balance in its Classic account would be cut from the current Pounds 5,000. 'We were already getting accounts that we did not want under the old tariff, and we feared the trickle would become a flood if another bank started charging,' he says. Banks are considering four main strategies which could stop their most profitable personal customers leaving if charges are reintroduced: Not charging customers who retain high balances: this is likely for customers with balances above Pounds 1,500 because the interest earned on their balances is greater than the cost of operating their accounts. The fine calculation is in deciding which other customers should get free services. Mr Lindsey believes the high street banks may set the limit as low as Pounds 500 in order to keep customers whose overall business is valuable. Offering different amounts of service for different levels of fee: an obvious example would be to offer 24-hour telephone banking only to those who pay extra. But it is hard to segment existing services because they are offered through branches which are open to all customers. Giving new forms of service in return for fees will only add to overall costs. Linking 'free' banking to the total value of a customers' business with the bank: this would be a logical strategy to encourage sales of products such as mortgages, loans and insurance. The question is whether banks will be able to preserve their claim to offer independent advice if such incentives are introduced. Maintaining 'free' banking for young customers. Youth accounts lose money because they usually have low balances. But the loss is worth incurring if it establishes loyalty from a customer who becomes more profitable with age. Young people with earnings potential such as students may continue not to be charged, or may be charged less. Because banks are likely to choose different combinations of these strategies, the effect on the industry is uncertain. Banks might persuade customers to close second accounts to maintain higher balances in their primary one. But they will be vulnerable to lower-cost competitors such as building societies or telephone banks which can retain 'free' banking longer. Banks look hopefully at the experience of the Barclaycard credit card subsidiary of Barclays when it introduced an annual fee in 1990. It lost 485,000 active accounts and a further 1m dormant ones from a total of 10m within a year. But the number of transactions remained virtually the same, as the same business was conducted on fewer cards. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclaycard, says the introduction of charges was not too damaging because it was carefully planned. By offering new services at the same time as it introduced a fee, Barclaycard created a sense that it was worth paying for. That is the best the banks can expect. The worst is that there will be a flight of the customers to whom they were hoping to sell more products. When the move finally comes, a lot will turn on the reaction of Ms Bergne and the rest of the growing band of dissatisfied bank customers.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DELAYS TRIAL ON REDISTRICTING LAWSUIT  </P> <P> With a possible settlement in the offing, a federal judge Wednesday  indefinitely put off the start of a trial on a lawsuit accusing Los Angeles  County supervisors of drawing their districts in such a way as to preclude the  election of a Latino to the county board.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon delayed the trial after a private meeting  with attorneys in the case. The move follows Tuesday's vote by supervisors to  consider a settlement of the suit filed by the U.S. Justice Department and two  civil rights groups.  </P> <P> None of the parties would comment on the possible settlement, which reportedly  calls for consolidating portions of Supervisors Ed Edelman and Pete Schabarum's  districts to create a predominantly Latino district east and southeast of  downtown Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Calmer waters after the mutiny: A UK merchant bank that almost foundered when it diversified in the 1980s At the start of the last century, the Baltimore linen trader and merchant banker Alexander Brown wrote a letter of warning against diversification to his son William in England. 'If we look around here, we find that those persons who have steadily kept to one pursuit are far the richest men, and those who are interested with one another in different pursuits, no matter how profitable they may be, or may appear to be at first, are always ruined sooner or later,' he wrote. William took the advice, and abandoned plans to diversify the family business in Liverpool into insurance and land speculation. He concentrated on Brown Shipley, the family bank that came to rival Barings and Rothschilds in strength. For more than a century after Alexander Brown's letter, Brown Shipley remained a small, conservative merchant bank. But 190 years later, Alexander Brown's warning came catastrophically true. Like one of the ships for which it used to accept bills of credit, it was wrecked in storms after losing its course, and finally suffering a fateful mutiny. The collection of disparate businesses that Brown Shipley had become was dismembered three months ago when its stockbroking business and holding company were sold. A year before, the merchant bank that produced two Bank of England governors and was once the workplace of former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, was bought for a token Pounds 1 by the Belgian bank Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise. The story of Brown Shipley is not unusual. It is one of a thousand businesses that strayed into unknown risks in the 1980s. But there is a wider resonance for the City of London. Brown Shipley was a hallowed City name that prospered when the old merchant banks were more firmly regulated by the Bank. But it could not survive outside such shelter. 'With hindsight, the fundamental mistake was to diversify into so many scattered things, rather than building on its traditional merchant bank,' says Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, who became the bank's chairman after the sale to Kredietbank. 'I think Brown Shipley just sort of fell asleep really,' says a former director. The original business was based on Alexander Brown's cotton and linen exports to the Lancashire mills. His sons settled in New York, Philadelphia and Liverpool to handle the financing of trade. William founded an 'accepting house,' or merchant bank, that lent its name - and creditworthiness - to trade bills drawn by importers ordering from abroad. This business remained profitable for nearly two centuries, but by the 1960s was fading as other forms of trade finance emerged. Other merchant banks moved into fee-earning business such as corporate finance and asset management. Brown Shipley chose a different course; it formed a holding company in 1960 to buy other lending operations, including leasing and consumer credit. The bank's culture was by this time more staid than evenAlexander Brown might have wished. This was epitomised by the football team. One player, Mr Geoffrey Bell, left the bank in 1963 and spent 18 years away before returning in 1981 to head the bank's treasury, and eventually become joint managing director. He found nine of the team's 11 members still there. 'It was as if I had walked out of the office on the Friday, and just returned after a long weekend,' he recalls. He came back just as the old accepting houses were dealt a heavy blow. The Bank of England started to accept the bills of many banks authorised under the 1979 Banking Act on similar terms to the accepting houses. 'If you were a small accepting house, you suddenly found yourself with no future, nothing,' says Mr Bill Dacombe, who was brought in to try to save Brown Shipley a decade later as chief executive. The holding company responded by diversifying further. It bought four small firms of regional stockbrokers in the mid-1980s. It remained in profit, but returns were poor, and capital was stretched. Kredietbank had by now emerged as the largest single shareholder, and was questioning the merchant bank's direction. Meanwhile, a group of the bank's directors was becoming discontented. They believed it should move more into fee-earning corporate finance. The differences over strategy culminated in May 1988 with what one director calls a 'palace coup'. Mr John van Kuffeler, the bank's head of corporate finance, became chief executive. Lord Farnham, the executive chairman, agreed to give Mr van Kuffeler a free rein. Mr Bell was pushed aside into the bank's treasury. The company by now had 32 businesses, and capital of only Pounds 50m, Pounds 14m of which was the value of the headquarters building, Founders Court. Mr van Kuffeler tried to slim the group by selling the consumer credit arm. But the bank's leasing arm was growing in the small company boom of the late 1980s, providing office equipment such as fax machines to companies in the south-east. It was also trying to raise returns by expanding some higher margin - and so risky - lending. The loan portfolio grew by 16 per cent in the year to March 1990, and it made a record Pounds 7.5m profit. The bank seemed to be strengthening, but it was running into two problems: the onset of recession, and growing tension between Mr van Kuffeler and Kredietbank. Former directors say that Mr van Kuffeler wanted to sell the leasing arm, but was opposed by Kredietbank. The risky loans were turning bad and stockbroking trade was down, leading to a Pounds 3.34m loss in 1991. The night before the July annual meeting, Mr van Kuffeler was told that Kredietbank intended to cast its 29 per cent vote against his re-election as a director. He resigned, and is now chief executive of the consumer credit company Provident Financial. By November, Mr Dacombe had been brought in. After a look at the books, he made a simple choice. 'At my second board meeting, I told them we were heading for the shore as fast as we could paddle because there was a real risk that we were going down,' he recalls. The first problem was its assets: both loans and leasing were deteriorating fast. The second problem was liquidity. After the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International in July 1991, institutions withdrew funds from small banks. Mr Bell anticipated difficulty in May, and put 54 per cent of the bank's assets in liquid instruments such as certificates of deposit. That figure had fallen to 23 per cent by last July as the bank sold assets to match the Pounds 192m cash outflow. When it was finally sold, Bank of England supervisors invited its treasurers to lunch to celebrate the bank's survival. The bank lost Pounds 27.1m in 1992, quartering its equity to Pounds 10.4m. Mr Dacombe had little choice but to sell up. He disposed of the leasing arm for Pounds 5.9m. Kredietbank paid Pounds 1 to inherit Pounds 14.7m of provisions, and Pounds 60m of problem loans. The sale of the bank broke Brown Shipley in two, and the holding company with its investment and broking arms was finally bought by Guinness Peat Group for Pounds 5.6m last March. Alexander Brown's warning had come to pass. Today, Mr Bell is back in the managing director's office at Founders Court. Under his direction, Brown Shipley is returning to its roots in trade finance, accepting credit risk for commodity trade. 'They call us the metal bank, the wool bank, the timber bank,' he says. All loans over Pounds 2m now have to be approved by Kredietbank. Brown Shipley is expanding its private banking business, offering clients the prestige of cheque books bearing a gilded City name. Mr Dacombe remains chairman of the Brown Shipley holding group. A portrait of Alexander Brown and his sons hangs by his desk. 'I wonder what those old boys would have done,' he muses, 'They might have said: 'There's no money in being a small merchant bank any more. We've had a good run and we'll give up now'.' But the warning in Alexander's letter had been forgotten by the time it encountered storms.</p>

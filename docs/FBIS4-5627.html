			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT]  will press ahead with the expansion of the optical fiber cable  communications network across the country from 1994. The MOPT  plans to raise the current ceiling of low-interest loans by the  Japan Development Bank to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation (NTT) and other telephone companies by about 3.3  times after obtaining an agreement on raising the current  ceiling from the Finance Ministry late last week. The U.S.  Government has announced plans to build an information highway  network, and in response, the MOPT has concluded that the  government's aggressive assistance to the promotion of upgrading  the existing communications infrastructure is indispensable.    The telephone companies that will benefit from the  government's assistance are NTT, DDI [Daini Denden Company],  Japan Telecom, and Japan Highspeed Communications. The MOPT  Intends to set the raised ceiling of low-interest loans at a  total of 52.5 billion yen after examining their business  programs. The MOPT wants to lower interest rates on the  low-interest loans to three-fourths the current annual interest  rate of 4.4 percent applied to loans for financial investment,  with a grace period maximum of 15 years. The current interest  rate on the low-interest loans to telephone companies is running  at 3.3 percent per annum.    Compared with the road network, the optical fiber cable  communications network is in a situation where the construction  of a highway network is completed, but trunk roads [kansendoro]  have yet to be constructed. This situation has resulted from the  hesitance of telephone companies to expand their telephone  service in areas where they cannot expect profits. The MOPT  hopes that the financial assistance will inspire telephone  companies to accelerate the expansion of their telephone service  in those areas.    The Japan Development Bank has thus far used proceeds from  sales of government-held NTT stocks as financial resources to  extend low-interest loans for the project of building the  optical fiber cable communications network, but the network  requires relay facilities and the low-interest loans have fallen  short of meeting the financial requirement for construction of  the optical fiber cable communications network.</p>

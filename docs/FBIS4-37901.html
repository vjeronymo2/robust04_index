			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 25 Jun (MENA)--The procedural session of  the National Dialogue General Congress opened at the  Consultative Council this evening under the chairmanship of the  Congress' general moderator, Dr. Mustafa Khalil, and in the  presence of the General Congress members.    At the beginning of the session member Ahmad Taha raised the  issue of the absence of the New Wafd and the Nasirite Arab  Democratic parties. He asked the Congress to reissue calls to  party members to participate in the Congress and to other  nationalist forces to work for the complete success of the  Congress.    Dr. Nabih al-'Alqami answered Taha saying: We have an agenda  devised by the Preparatory Committee including various views.  He asked the Congress' general moderator to approve the agenda  in order to begin the Congress' works. [passage omitted]    Lutfi al-Khuli spoke again about existing political parties,  so that (?we) can confront everyone with their responsibility,  whether or not we agree with a certain party. He added that we  must learn about each party's ideology, which should be put  forth for discussion. He was referring to the Muslim  Brotherhood, the communists, and those who have no legitimate  representation. He explained the importance of inviting all  trends to the Congress so that they can interact with us to  build the future Egypt and stand up against all current trends  of violence.    Dr. Mustafa Khalil said he welcomes all political parties,  noting his consent to opening the door for the return of the  Wafd and Nasirite parties to participate in the conference.    On the representation of the communists and Muslim Brothers,  he said the Congress had taken the representation of various  intellectual trends into consideration. He noted that the  Muslim Brothers have not yet formed a political party and that  its members represent all the existing political trends and  legitimate parties. [passage omitted]</p>

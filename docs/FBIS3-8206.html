			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Danko Peric from Knin] </F>   [Text] The press center of the general staff of the Serbian  army of Krajina issued a communique on the situation on the  battlefields in the last 24 hours stating that the Croatian  forces, which temporarily captured the Lisac elevation in Lika  yesterday, have been pushed out. The Lisac elevation had been  under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control until yesterday.  In contrast to the Croatian fighters, who tried to carry out  yet another attack in the zone under the UN protection -- which  was thwarted -- the members of the Serbian army of Krajina did  not suffer any casualties in the counterattack.    The violation of the cease-fire agreement by the Croatian  Army is again taking place in Lika, mainly around Teslingrad and  Plasko, where they used infantry weapons.    Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina,  sent greetings to the wounded on 5 March, the day of the wounded  of the latest war. Our care for the wounded is permanent. No  one should forget you, the Krajina president said. The meeting  with the wounded was organized by the people working for the  Captain Dragan Fund.</p>

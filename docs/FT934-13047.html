			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Man in the News: The reluctant diplomat - John Cahill For the staff of the Hilton Hotel in Taipei, the tall, slightly stooping figure of Mr John Cahill is becoming a familiar spectacle. His present stay there is his eighth this year. The company he chairs, British Aerospace, is involved in a highly public struggle to tie down a deal with Taiwan on making regional jets. The jobs of 3,000 workers at BAe's regional jet plant at Woodford in the UK may hang on his success. His qualifications for the task are a little uncertain. The talks in Taiwan are deeply political, and Mr Cahill is not a political man. Until he took over at BAe 18 months ago, at the age of 62, he had spent his working life as a manufacturer with the conglomerate BTR. At the time, he freely confessed his political inexperience. That side of things, he said, would be handled by his chief executive, Mr Dick Evans. He now knows better. His first trip to Taiwan six years ago involved nothing more controversial than buying a plastics factory. But where he used to deal with small businessmen, he now talks to national leaders. His ninth-floor executive meeting room is guarded by black-suited Chinese women, who zealously shoo away the local press corps and camera crews. He is accompanied by an ever-changing cast of merchant bankers in chalk-striped, double-breasted suits, discreet civil servants from the UK Department of Trade and Industry and elusive corporate lawyers with their fax machines. The experience has been salutary. A few months ago, Mr Cahill employed the blunt impatience learnt in his BTR days. Now he is a model of restraint, almost ambassadorial as he peers over rimless reading glasses perched on the end of his nose. The change has not been accomplished without pain. One very senior figure in the Taiwanese establishment said of Mr Cahill's style this week that, 'given that the deal is still under negotiation, if I were too frank it could have a negative effect'. One example of the more aggressive approach came over the summer. The deal, jointly to manufacture a short-haul passenger jet, had suffered one of its periodic setbacks, with both the bankers to the project and the Taiwanese partners apparently getting cold feet. Mr Cahill fired off letters to minister Mr Chiang Pin-kung, whose economic affairs department is responsible for aerospace policy, with copies to Taiwan's president, premier, central bank governor and other local luminaries. One letter accused the Taiwanese partner, Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC), and the state-run bank heading the lending consortium of 'not proceeding in good faith'. Another came close to threatening BAe's withdrawal. 'That's not the way you do business here,' says one western consultant well versed in negotiations with Taiwan's aerospace industry. 'This is not Japan. You do not write to the top man. You deal with the small companies.' The letters were leaked to the local press and seized upon by Taiwan's opposition politicians, who suspect that the deal is uncommercial and over-ambitious. The row has kept government ministers on the defensive since then and still threatens to damage the ruling party, the Kuomintang, in next month's regional elections. As a result of yet another trip to Taipei at the end of August, Mr Cahill managed to win the banks round. Pinning down TAC was another matter. Mr Cahill had the jarring experience of seeing Mr Denny Ko, president of TAC and the man with whom he had signed the original deal, excluded from the most important meetings. By September, Mr Ko was no longer president, and TAC's other top man, chairman Mr Earle Hou, also said he would step down. Exasperated by the turmoil, BAe broke off talks in London last month. To be fair to Mr Cahill, there are some in Taiwan who believe that he has taken more than his share of the blame for the deal's tortuous progress. 'The problem is our problem, not Mr Cahill's problem,' said one official yesterday. 'Civil aviation is new to us here. It needs co-ordination from different departments.' Another official, asked what he would do differently if the relationship with BAe could be started afresh, said with a wry smile: 'We would be more organised.' Whatever his political shortcomings, Mr Cahill is a shrewd enough businessman not to have all his eggs in one basket. BAe disclosed this week it had started talks with Indonesia over possible collaboration in regional aircraft. The company has also told London financial analysts that it could keep its regional jet operation going in the UK for at least a year while it looked for an alternative joint-venture partner. Meanwhile, politicians on both sides have been anxious to distance themselves from the affair. This month Mr Yang Shih-chien, the deputy economics minister and effective sponsor of the venture, said he would quit the TAC board. The Taiwan government said it would take no further direct part in the talks. The UK government repeated that all the decisions would be taken by BAe and TAC. And yet this week Taiwanese ministers including Mr Yang met both Mr Cahill and the visiting UK trade minister, Mr Richard Needham. The joint venture was high on the agenda. The explanation, said one Taiwanese government insider yesterday, is, once more, the political nature of the deal. Between now and polling day on November 29, ruling party politicians want to steer clear of any potentially embarrassing developments. 'The government is still active but wants no publicity,' the insider said. 'Its motto is 'just do it, don't talk about it in public.' ' The politicians may have declared their intention to leave the business decisions to BAe and TAC. But the reality is that aircraft manufacture is a far more political business than running a plastics factory. For Mr Cahill, the days of being a simple manufacturer are over for good.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] While Milosevic is still demanding a state for the  Serbs in Croatia, he does not even want to know about Croats in  Serbia. This is corroborated by news from Sombor [northern  Vojvodina province] where a debate was held yesterday evening on  the subject of the position and rights of national minorities in  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. Also attending was FRY  Human and Minority Rights Minister Margit Savovic.    Asked by Mate Mataric, president of the Sombor branch of the  Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Croats [DSHV], about the status  of Croats in Yugoslavia, she replied that Croats cannot even be  a national minority in the Serbian-Montenegrin state. According  to her, this is because the FRY does not recognize Croatia; and  as international law prescribes that the national minority  status can only be accorded to peoples with a parent country,  Croats in the FRY cannot even be a national minority.    Commenting on the existence of a threat to the Croats in  Vojvodina, she said that this is not the case and that all  Croats who moved from Yugoslavia did so voluntarily. We would  like to add that more than 35,000 Croats were expelled over the  past three years from Vojvodina alone, and that the ethnic  cleansing of Srem, Banat, and Backa [areas in Vojvodina]  continues.</p>

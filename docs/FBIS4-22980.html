I. Litvin; UDC 681.32.06] </F>   [Abstract] The possibility is examined for using orthogonal  Walsh and Fourier matrices for circular testing in linear  discrete devices and in multiprocessor computer systems of the  SIMD type. In order check that the logical and arithmetic  operations are properly carried out, the task of mutual testing  in a multiprocessor computer system with a distributed floating  kernel is resolved. It was found that the use of orthogonal  discrete Fourier and Walsh transforms made it simple and  efficient to properly control the way logical and arithmetic  operations are carried out in computers. 4 figures and 8  references.</p>

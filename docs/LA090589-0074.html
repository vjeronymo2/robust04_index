			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> British police officers said they have recovered the bodies of all 51 victims  of a collision between a pleasure boat and a barge on the Thames last month.  Authorities have identified the final victim as Antonio de Vasconcellos, the  man who chartered the pleasure craft to celebrate his 26th birthday. His  brother, Domingo, also died when the Bowbelle, a 1,475-ton sand dredger, hit  the 90-ton Marchioness on Aug. 20 as it cruised down the river in central  London. Eighty-three people on the Marchioness survived the collision; there  were no fatalities aboard the sand dredger.  </P></p>

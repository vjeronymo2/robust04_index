			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Service provides pension updates Company finance directors are being offered a service which provides immediate information on the assets and liabilities of their company pension schemes. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm which has developed the service, says much of the information on the state of a company's pension scheme is out-of-date, sometimes by as much as three years, because it is based on the triennial valuations of the fund's consulting actuary. As a result a company may not be aware of looming deficiencies in its pension fund which will eventually have an impact on the company's profit and loss account. Coopers &amp; Lybrand has developed a system which will give information on pension funds on a monthly basis - or within hours if necessary - and provide projections of its future performance. It can also give up-to-date information on each employee's accrued pension and its transfer value. The accountancy firm's service is partly a response to the recent tightening of pension regulations in the wake of the Robert Maxwell scandal, in which Pounds 440m worth of pensioners' funds disappeared, and to new regulations in the government's pension bill, published last week. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said surpluses on many pension funds were being eroded because of the lack of dividend growth on investments in the recession. Mr Ralph Brereton, an actuary and pensions partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Edinburgh who devised the system, said: 'Companies should treat their corporate pension funds with the same attention as they would give to a major subsidiary. Yet often they haven't a clue because their most recent information is the triennial report of the consulting actuary.' Mr Brereton said a number of companies recently discovered that their pension funds were heading towards deficiency because they had continued a holiday from contributing to the fund when this was no longer justified. He said: 'Their forward cash planning for the rest of their business has been screwed up because they are having to resume making contributions.' Companies have to record pension contributions in their profit and loss account, but these are based on the most recent actuarial valuation. A statutory instrument in 1992 required companies to treat a deficit on their pension fund as a debt to the employer. This followed the pension scandal which broke after Robert Maxwell's death in 1991. The pensions bill contains provisions requiring companies to spread their pension costs over the working life of an employee, and to check annually that the scheme would be solvent if it had to be wound up. It will forbid them to overfund their schemes. Coopers &amp; Lybrand pioneered its system, which it says is the only one of its kind, in 1992, and started marketing it widely this autumn. It is studying ways of providing the software to companies which manage their own schemes. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

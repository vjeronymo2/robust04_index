			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Warburg chairman's salary leaps SIR DAVID Scholey, chairman of SG Warburg, the City merchant bank, received a 134 per cent salary increase in the year to March 1992, according to Warburg's annual report. The increase is bound to raise eyebrows in the City as it comes at a time when Sir David is being widely tipped to succeed Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton as the next Governor of the Bank of England. Most of the increase came from a Pounds 687,000 payment from a long-term performance-related pay scheme, linked to the Warburg share price. The scheme is operated by a committee of non-executive directors. If Sir David does move to the Bank of England he will take a sharp cut in salary. Last month it was disclosed that Mr Leigh-Pemberton received a 28 per cent rise to Pounds 198,446 in 1991-92, but decided to waive all but 6 per cent of the increase. A 17 per cent pay increase to Pounds 155,019 for the Governor in 1990 aroused controversy. Warburg's annual report shows that three other directors waived emoluments of Pounds 134,000.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Arts: Magic realism in 'The House of the Spirits' - Theatre Latin America has a pace of its own. The stage premier of Isabel Allende's The House of The Spirits runs for eight hours, about as long as it takes to read the original book she wrote in 1982. The play, Allende's own adaptation, is now at the Shaw Theatre. It makes an absorbing, exhausting spectacle. The style is magic realism, a blend of the real and the imaginary which evolves naturally from a multi-cultural Latin America. The European exponents are Gunter Grass and Milan Kundera. But the Colombian writer Garcia Marquez was the first populist in the genre with Cien Anos de Solidad (1967). What makes the style inimical to theatre, a sequential art form, is that it conflates past, present and future. To read Allende, Marquez or the lesser known magical realists Miguel Asturias or Alejo Carpentier for plot would be to miss the point. In Allende, everything happens all the time, it is a form of life. The dynastic story of The House of The Spirits starts in Chile, 1910 and finishes after the September 1973 coup, the assassination of President Allende (Isabel's uncle) and the establishment of the Pinochet regime. There are autobiographical details from Allende's time as a journalist in Chile and then Venezuela, as well as family memoirs and folklore brought to bear on current events. The play charts the fortunes of Clara and Esteban, the one a luminous clairvoyant and the other - like most of the men here - a feckless, violent and troubled soul. They live in Santiago and on a hacienda in the Andes, where the campesinos emerge from serfdom to political power in the 1970s. As each aspect of family lore fashions itself, memories harden into facts, whims into obsessions and visions into realities. 'Life is long,' says Clara, 'and full of unexpected turns.' But the plot is not entirely at the mercy of serendipity. The laws of causation and prediction become the life of the family. Out on the hacienda, advice takes root and grows into the future: 'Land is something one should never sell, it's what is left when everything else is gone' says Esteban, 'But land is a romantic notion' replies his mother. She is right, he loses it. As the story rolls down the generations, finishing with Alba, the granddaughter of Clara and Esteban, it gathers momentum and amplitude; what seemed a distraction in the first part of the play emerges as a significant detail in the second: a mothy animal skin, a severed head, a caddy of hoarded cash. For each generation, love is a visceral shudder and death a whispered secret. Every family rite involves extensive nudity on stage. The family's powers of imagination and intuition pass through the women, 'the stoical practical women of our country', a sorority of tough-minded individuals who control the men. Conrad was right, god for men and religion for women. There are wonderful comic moments: the whore looking to modernise her brothel, 'we ought to bring in civil servants who have nothing to do during the day' or the maid trying to scare the young Clara - silent for ten years  -into speech. Director Michael Batz amalgamates the action well, with haunting songs (by the Chilenos Violetta Parra and the murdered Victor Jara) beautifully sung by Claudia Figueroa and Mauricio Venegas. The cast of 18, from eleven different countries, speaks a mixture of English and robust South American Spanish without the old-world sibilants. The principals, Josephine Welcome (Clara), Alkis Kritikos (Esteban), Carmen Gomez (Ferula, Esteban's sister) and Christina Clark (Alba) keep the passion high and the life intense. Try to see both parts in one day (Saturday or Sunday). Characters reappear like old friends. If the second half of the first part and the middle of the second are still slack dramatically, perhaps the answer is simply a different view of what theatre does. 'It may be true' says one character, 'that everything happens simultaneously.' The Shaw Theatre until 23 May: Thursdays, part I; Fridays, part II; Saturdays and Sundays, parts I &amp; II.

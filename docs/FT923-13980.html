			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / How blues help greens The environment was not an issue in the last British general election. The Conservatives believe that it may be one in the next. It depends on the economic cycle. When people feel affluent or comfortable they attend to the purity of the air and the cleanliness of water. When there is a downturn voters worry about jobs, prices and taxes. That is what is happening in the US. The economy is flat. The greens are in retreat. When the recession is over they will be back in force, on both sides of the Atlantic. There is a perverse logic here. You could argue that the British government is proving this very day that it is a true friend of the earth. It has produced a long, debilitating recession. This is wonderful for the environment, if not for those who campaign on green issues. Fewer cars are sold. Less electricity is consumed. Less coal is burned. Houses remain unbuilt. The rate of emission of greenhouse gases is thus depressed. Even better, the government has no strategy for bringing the recession to an end. Mr Norman Lamont is to be congratulated. As chancellor, he has consistently fended off the resurgence that the Treasury consistently forecasts. He may go down in history as the greenest chancellor of them all. Mr Michael Howard is basing his political strategy on a more orthodox set of assumptions. The environment secretary believes that the next election will be fought during a boom. Mr John Major, the prime minister, concurs. That is why the pair of them made such an effort to establish their green credentials at the recent Rio earth summit. The government's aim is to capture what it calls the moral high ground, by which is meant that it proposes to stay one jump ahead of Labour. Mr Howard knows how he will go about it. He has read the aspirational report  -'This Common Inheritance' - produced by Mr Christopher Patten in 1990 and the progress report produced by Mr Michael Heseltine last year. Neither added up to a row of beans. What we greens demand is action. There is promise of action, of a sort, in what the government likes to call Mr Major's eight-point plan for following up on Rio, as adopted by the European Community. Conventions will be ratified. National plans will be published. Leads will be taken. There is some money in there, but most of it reads like flim-flam to me. Nevertheless, Mr Howard will peddle the plan during the British presidency of the EC. His sales patter may be marred by his proclamation, spoken out of the other side of his mouth, that EC environmental laws should be dismantled in the name of subsidiarity. Mr Howard does not, however, rely solely on Mr Major's eight points. His pursuit of competitive advantage over a revitalised Labour party of the future will be more soundly based than that. He knows that there must be government action. But what? He accepts that some substances, such as chlorflourocarbons, have to be prohibited. Regulation is also unavoidable. His preferred method of protecting the environment is the use of economic instruments. The lower tax on lead-free petrol, which has worked a treat, is one example. The use of tradeable permits, is another. Mr Howard hopes to visit the US soon to see if marketable documents permitting a certain quantity of pollution actually reduce it. Such musings might ordinarily be ascribed to the dizzying effect on any politician of discovering that he is, for the first time, head of a really large department. Other environment secretaries have espoused economic instruments; Mr Nicholas Ridley was temperamentally in favour of them. Lead-free petrol apart, they got nowhere. But Mr Howard may benefit from fortunate timing. If the Conservatives are to reduce direct taxation before the next election they will doubtless have to increase indirect taxes to pay for it. They may even have to raise indirect taxation merely to keep the government in business next year. What better than an EC-inspired carbon tax, offset by reduced corporation tax, or an extension of road use charges, offset, perhaps, by a reduction in income tax? Such a happy blending of economic and political instruments could prove irresistible. The fly in the ointment is the nature of Mr Howard's department. It is a great mess of distractions. The new minister has said that it must move away from its present building in Westminster, probably to London's Docklands. This has unsettled all its staff; many of them can hardly think about anything else. Mr Howard's own immediate preoccupation is the settling-in of the new council tax, which replaces the poll tax. A few years back all his considerable skills of advocacy were used to argue that the latter tax was flawless in conception, immaculate in practice, and a thing of beauty for any philosopher to behold. No tax could match it. It was the pinnacle of human ingenuity. Now he has to sweep up its leavings. At least that will leave the political environment better than Mr Howard found it.</p>

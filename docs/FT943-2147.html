			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Biological weapons under scrutiny Officials from 80 countries are meeting in Geneva to discuss how to strengthen the 1972 treaty banning biological weapons, with measures to guard against cheating. The treaty currently has no provisions to check compliance. The two-week conference, which ends on September 30, will examine a report produced last year which concluded that verification measures would be both feasible and useful. The report lists 21 types of procedure, ranging from data exchange to on-site inspections, although it concedes that no foolproof method exists. According to US intelligence, China, Iran, Syria and Russia possess biological arms; and Eygpt, Taiwan and Libya may have them. Iraq's programme has been terminated by the United Nations. Verification of biological weapons poses technical and political problems, which were thought insuperable when the 131-member Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention was negotiated in the 1960s. Biological weapons are harder to detect than nuclear or chemical arms; they can be easily produced and stored in tiny quantities; and the agents and equipment often have peaceful as well as belligerent uses, for instance vaccines. This has raised fears that checking for biological weapons would involve snooping around unrelated military facilities. Western countries, notably the US, are also concerned to protect the commercial secrets of private biotechnology companies. Mr Tibor Toth of Hungary, conference chairman, said he did not expect anti-cheating measures to be approved this time. The likely outcome is a decision to launch negotiations on verification procedures, which could be endorsed at the next conference in 1996.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM], on 3 March received  Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitur Ikonomov, who paid a  brief working visit to Skopje. Our correspondent in Skopje  Kostadin Filipov reports.    [Begin Filipov recording] Dimitur Ikonomov conveyed to Mr.  Gligorov a message from Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, which  was in response to a letter that the Macedonian head of state  sent to Dr. Zhelev a week ago.    In his message to the Macedonian president, Dr. Zhelyu  Zhelev  expressed Bulgaria's willingness to further develop its friendly  and goodneighborly relations with the Republic of Macedonia in  all spheres -- economy, trade, culture, and so on -- on a  constructive and principled basis.    Against the background of the complex political situation in  this part of the Balkan peninsula, this is an expression of  Bulgaria's willingness to help the Republic of Macedonia  overcome the difficulties related to the tense relations between  Macedonia and Greece.    The specific issues will apparently be specified at a later  date by the appropriate organs and institutions of the two  neighboring states.    This should by no means be interpreted as Bulgaria  relinquishing its principled position of refusing to upset the  balance of its relations with all states in the Balkan political  space and supporting every step aimed at strengthening regional  peace and stability.

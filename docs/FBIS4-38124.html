			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>   [Text] Baghdad--Iraq has emphasized its rejection of any  terms or amendments to the Iraqi-Turkish agreement on operating  the Iraqi oil pipeline crossing Turkish territory under any  pretext.    Iraqi Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad said that  maintaining  this pipeline should be done directly by the two sides. He  asserted that Turkey should begin implementation of this  agreement without consultation with the UN Security Council.  The minister pointed out that the Iraqi-Turkish agreement on  cleaning and maintaining the pipeline is not based on commercial  considerations, asserting that the agreement was signed within a  purely technical framework in order to maintain the pipeline  which is liable to erosion and damage due to the Iraqi oil  retained in it since early August 1990.    The Iraqi minister said that Iraq and Turkey agreed to use  part of the revenues of the oil contained in the pipeline to  repay some debts which Iraq owes Turkey and to use the other  part of the revenues to purchase food commodities, baby milk,  and medical and pharmaceutical supplies from Turkish sources.  The international resolutions do not ban Iraq from importing  these items. In practice, however, they obstruct their  importation because the Iraqi assets abroad are still frozen and  Iraq is prevented from exporting its oil freely.</p>

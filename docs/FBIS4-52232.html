			<p>BFN     [Text] Two more suspects are wanted in connection with a  spate of bombing attacks in the South and Thailand is seeking  their extradition as they have been hiding in a foreign country,  Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset said yesterday. Mr.  Chamni did not name the suspects or the country.    He said Southern Border Provinces Administration Centre  director Wisut Singkachonworakun told Interior Minister Chawalit  Yongchaiyut yesterday that police were gathering evidence  against the two in order to seek their extradition. However, a  source in the South named them as Domae or Romae Bron and Mada-o  or Ro-seng Krongpinang and said they had been hiding in Malaysia.    Four Islamic teachers in Songkhla's Chana District were  arrested on Wednesday and charged with taking part in eight  different bomb attacks from May 1991 to March 1994, rebellion  and premeditated murder.    Gen. Chawalit said yesterday he had ordered police handling  the case against the four and the Songkhla governor to ensure  fair treatment of the suspects. A number of southern New  Aspiration Party MPs met him yesterday and expressed concern  over the case he said.    Gen. Chawalit said he told the MPs that the four would be  regarded as innocent and subject to proper treatment. It would  not be right for authorities not to allow their relatives to  visit them or have them handcuffed. The case must be dealt with  as quickly as possible to prevent further problems.    The minister believes there will be no protests over the  arrest. The chairman of the Association of Islamic Schools  yesterday warned authorities concerned to be careful in their  handling of the case against the four teachers.    Nidir Waba said if the charges against the suspects were  proved groundless, problems would follow. He said the arrest of  the four had affected the image of Ponoh schools -- private  schools teaching Islam -- in the South.    Dr. Ismael Ali, director of the Islamic College of the  Prince  of Songkla University, said the arrest of the four was intended  to discredit private schools teaching Islam and their teachers.  He said he knew the four well because they were his juniors  while he was studying in Saudi Arabia.    "All of them are good men. I doubt the possibility of their  having committed such serious crimes," he said. The four  suspects are Sa-ali or Ali or Sali Hamanapden, Mut or Hamase or  Mut Loman, Suroma or Daman Leduwi and Ya or Kaya or Sakariya  Hamanapden. Muk Sulaiman, a New Aspiration Party MP for  Pattani, said Gen Chawalit was not happy about the arrest.    He said he personally believed that incidents in the South  were a result of dissatisfaction with Police Chief Gen. Pratin  Santipraphop. The arrest of the four might lead to a protest,  Mr. Muk said. He would be a defence lawyer for the four.    Ahseed Phithakkhumphon, chairman of the Islamic Committee of  Songkhla, yesterday went to meet Songkhla Governor Yuwat  Wuthimethi and asked to know the facts behind the arrests. Mr.  Ahseed said people of Chana District felt hurt by what happened  to the four and were about to protest when they first heard  about it but he asked them to stay calm. He said Islamic  leaders were still shocked by the arrest which was quite  unexpected. He said: "I can speak on behalf of fellow Muslim  people that we would not protect wrongdoers. Wrongdoers must be  dealt with according to the law. But what just happened was  unexpected."</p>

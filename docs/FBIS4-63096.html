			<p>BFN     [Text] Sergey Yushenkov (Russia's Choice faction), chairman  of the Duma Defense Committee, said at a press conference that  participants of closed parliamentary hearings on defense  expenditure for 1994 have decided to insist on increasing  spending from the planned 37 to 55 trillion rubles when  discussing the second reading of the federal budget.    According to Yushenkov, cutbacks in defense spending at the  moment were passing the point after which a breakdown would  begin.    Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Piskunov said that President  Yeltsin supported increasing defense spending.    First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin said that over  60 percent of the defense budget went on social expenditure  linked to the unprecedented withdrawal of troops from foreign  countries, including from former Soviet republics and the  construction of housing for officers.    Answering an Interfax question on where additional  expenditure would come from, Yushenkov said that the income part  of the budget could be reconsidered.    He said that merely by cancelling privileges in foreign  economic activity, income could be increased by five trillion  rubles. Certain individual parts of budget could also be  reconsidered, he said, such as expenditure on maintaining the  state apparatus.</p>

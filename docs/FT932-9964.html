			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei regains 21,000 level on late futures activity LATE short-covering in the futures markets triggered program buying that erased the entire session's losses and lifted the Nikkei average above the 21,000 level for the first time since last year, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The 225-issue average ended 243.35, or 1.2 per cent, higher at 21,054.71, after moving between 20,668.31 and 21,062.64. The last time that the index settled above 21,000 was on March 4, 1992. The Topix index of all first section issues rose 18.28 to 1,639,05, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.41 to 1,279.12. Volume was estimated at 500m shares, compared with Friday's final 587m. Advancing issues overwhelmed declines by 839 to 228, with 127 issues unchanged. The day's advance will provide a boost to investors in the short term, but the question facing equity trading is whether the Nikkei will maintain current levels. Mr Masanori Hoshina, a manager of futures trading at Cosmo Securities, described the gains made in the final minutes of trading yesterday as a 'mirage' which had minimal connection to fundamentals. Other brokers said the market was still considered expensive and that institutional investors pressed for revenue may sell into any subsequent advance above 21,000. The pharmaceutical sector was targeted aggressively. Green Cross rose Y80 to Y1,440 on a weekend report that the company will conduct gene therapy for people infected with the HIV virus which causes Aids. Shionogi, a leading pharmaceutical maker, gained Y83 at Y970, while Ono Pharmaceutical advanced Y200 to Y5,900. Foreign investors purchased shipbuilding issues. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the day's most active stock, rose Y10 to Y7,011, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Y8 to Y477 and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Y6 to Y535. But profit-taking pressured Canon after the company cut its consolidated pre-tax profits forecast on Friday by about 37 per cent for this calender year due to the appreciation of the yen against the dollar. The shares lost Y50 to Y1,480. Other issues in the export-related sectors also lost ground: Sony slipped Y40 to Y4,850, TDK Y20 to Y3,980 and Pioneer Electronic Y20 to Y2,580. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 230.99 higher at 22,953.57 in volume of 29.4m shares. Roundup MANY OF the region's markets were weaker yesterday. HONG KONG met downward pressure from a slide in HSBC Holdings. The Hang Seng index declined 62.42 to 6,739.23 in turnover that contracted to HKDollars 4bn from last Friday's HKDollars 4.7bn. HSBC receded HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 68 and its Hang Seng Bank unit lost HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 55.50. HSBC is plagued by suggestions that it has been linked to the Indian stock market scandal. It has 23 offices in India. Cheung Kong dipped 30 cents to HKDollars 26.60, while Hutchison was unchanged at HKDollars 20.40. AUSTRALIA was unsettled by a lower earnings forecast from Brambles Industries, the transport group. The All Ordinaries index closed 13.3 lower at 1672.0. Brambles weakened 94 cents to ADollars 13, its lowest since November 1990. Elsewhere, BHP lost 14 cents to ADollars 13.90 and CRA slipped 22 cents to ADollars 12.98. Trade was subdued, with 256.9m shares worth ADollars 282.3m changing hands. Falls outpaced rises by three-to-two. Brokers said that the market remained nervous, waiting for leads from overseas or for more promising profits results from the banks over the next two weeks. BANGKOK closed slightly softer, although banks and finance and brokerage firms recovered some early losses. The SET index fell to a low of 836.20 in mid-afternoon trade before regaining ground to finish a net 3.55 off at 841.84. Turnover was thin at Bt1.9bn. Bangkok Bank finished Bt1 ahead at Bt125 and Thai Farmers Bank was down Bt4 at Bt864. MANILA was depressed by poor first-quarter earnings from Philippine Long Distance Telephone, and the composite index declined 11.29 to 1,642.62. Turnover amounted to 454.3m pesos, compared with Friday's 447.3m pesos. PLDT retreated 10 pesos to 990 pesos and Manila Electric dipped 2.50 pesos to 315 pesos. SINGAPORE closed mixed, although sentiment remained firm, with Malaysian speculative OTC shares taking centre stage. The Straits Times Industrial index was down a slight 2.80 at 1,772.02. Malaysia's Khong Guan Flour advanced SDollars 26 to SDollars 326 on rumours that the company would be used as a back door listing vehicle for a key Malaysian government-linked firm. KUALA LUMPUR was steady, with activity focusing on speculative and plantation stocks, although profit-taking was widespread in the afternoon, dragging down most shares from their day's highs. The composite index ended 3.59 up at 716.54. BOMBAY saw a sharp early rally but prices came back from their highs as public sector mutual funds took profits. The BSE index closed 11 higher at 2,230.75. NEW ZEALAND slipped on weakness in the forestry sector, Fletcher Challenge losing 8 cents to NZDollars 2.56 and Carter Holt Harvey 4 cents to NZDollars 2.92. The NZSE-40 index fell 21.30 to 1,557.04 in turnover of NZDollars 19m.</p>

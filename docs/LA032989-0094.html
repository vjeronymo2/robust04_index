			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> WITH CONCEPCION'S RELEASE, HOFFMAN FINDS JOB NEAR HOME  </P> <P> The last time Glenn Hoffman played in the major leagues was 1987, and he was  wearing a Dodger uniform. The Dodgers released him that year and he spent the  1988 season in Pawtucket, the triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox.  </P> <P> Hoffman hit .240 with three home runs and 33 runs batted in at Pawtucket, then  was released again. At 30, the outlook for his professional baseball career  wasn't exactly bullish.  </P> <P> His stock is definitely on the rise these days, however.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Angels announced that they had released 40-year-old Davey  Concepcion from his minor league contract. Although no one will say that  Hoffman has been assured a spot on the 24-player roster as the utility  infielder, Manager Doug Rader did admit that "it certainly does look good for  the lad."  </P> <P> So it appears that Hoffman, who lives in Orange, will return home as a big  leaguer after having to call the Angels and ask for an invitation to spring  training.  </P> <P> "Hoffman has been doing an excellent job," Rader said. "I believe he should  make this club. He certainly has earned a spot on this ballclub."  </P> <P> Hoffman is hitting .393 and has three RBIs. He has made just one error in 16  games. Concepcion, a veteran of 19 major league seasons, was hitting .125, with  no RBIs and two errors in 13 games.  </P> <P> "I've been on the other side of spring training, when you're a regular and just  getting ready for the season," said Hoffman, who was the starting shortstop for  the Red Sox in the mid-'80s. "This has been a whole different kind of spring.  When you come in as a non-roster player, you have to go out there and try to  win a job every day.  </P> <P> "I had to show what I can do. I came in as a very long shot, but I guess it  looks a lot better for me now."  </P> <P> Hoffman's performance was good enough to convince even Concepcion, who Tuesday  asked Angel management to release him if he wasn't going to make the team.  </P> <P> "Davey saw how Hoffman was playing and evidently he was aware of some inquiries  from other clubs," Rader said. "He's a good man. I hope he can hook on  somewhere."  </P> <P> Hoffman, of course, is happy to be hooking on with any major league club,  especially one that plays its home games a few minutes down the freeway from  his house.  </P> <P> The Angel brass still has a few decisions to make and there are some options,  but it appears the roster will break down like this:  </P> <P>  -- Pitchers: Jim Abbott, Bert Blyleven, Chuck Finley, Willie Fraser, Bryan  Harvey, Vance Lovelace, Kirk McCaskill, Bob McClure, Greg Minton, Dan Petry and  Mike Witt. Either Abbott or Lovelace or both will make the team (if the Angels  decide to go with an 11-man staff).  </P> <P>  -- Position players: Tony Armas, Dante Bichette, Chili Davis, Brian Downing,  Jim Eppard, Glenn Hoffman, Jack Howell, Wally Joyner, Mark McLemore, Lance  Parrish, Johnny Ray, Dick Schofield, Bill Schroeder, Claudell Washington and  Devon White. Bichette and McLemore appear to be on the bubble. If the Angels  keep 11 pitchers, both could start the season in the minors. Eppard and Armas  seem to be on a somewhat sturdier bubble.  </P> <P> A batting order of Brian Downing, Johnny Ray, Devon White, Wally Joyner, Chili  Davis, Lance Parrish, Claudell Washington, Jack Howell and Dick Schofield  should produce some runs this season, but it's beginning to look as if the  Angels might lose more than a few of those 9-8-type decisions.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, they lost to the San Diego Padres, 9-1, in front of 4,169 at Angels  Stadium. Starter McCaskill yielded eight runs and eight hits in 5 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Lovelace did not do much to help his cause, either. He replaced McCaskill with  two on and two out in the sixth, walked John Kruk and gave up a two-run double  to Tony Gwynn.  </P> <P> Darrell Miller, who was placed on waivers Monday, has mixed emotions about his  parting with the Angels.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy about the way things have gone," Miller said from his home in  Yorba Linda, "but they didn't do me any favors with the timing. They waited  until most of the (major league) rosters were set."  </P> <P> If the Angels had released Miller today, they would have had to pay him his  full $157,000 salary. As it is, they only have to come up with one-sixth of  that figure ($26,167).  </P> <P> Miller, who will clear waivers at noon on Thursday, said he asked the Angels  twice this spring to either try and to trade him or release him if he was not  in their plans.  </P> <P> "I went to them once early during the trip to Yuma (March 3-5) and again about  three days after we got to Palm Springs," he said. "I asked for a chance to  play, to show someone I can play, so they could trade me. They said, 'We know  what you can do. That's why we're not playing you.' "  </P> <P> Miller said that he was encouraged by the interest shown by other teams, but  said he could not get be specific until he passes waivers.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Players Assn., spoke to  both the Angels and Padres for almost three hours Tuesday morning. He said the  meeting was held to update the players on contract negotiations and the  possibility of a lockout by the owners. . . . The scheduled pitching matchups  for the Freeway Series, which begins Thursday at Dodger Stadium: The Angels'  Mike Witt vs. the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser and Tim Belcher Thursday; Chuck  Finley vs. Tim Leary Friday night, and Bert Blyleven vs. undecided Saturday  night.  </P></p>

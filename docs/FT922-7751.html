			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Unilever It was the composition of Unilever's first quarter results rather than the headline figure which unsettled the market yesterday and sent the shares 17p lower to 932p. Some slowdown in Europe had certainly been expected, but a hefty 15 per cent drop in the region's contribution to operating profits underlined just how far the Anglo-Saxon recession has spread elsewhere. Lower volume was particularly marked in Germany, though higher advertising and marketing expenditure on new products was also to blame. The good news was the performance of the rest of the world - notably south east Asia and Brazil - and the growing strength of the balance sheet. Average borrowings were Pounds 500m lower than in the equivalent period a year ago, thanks to a combination of disposals and tighter working capital controls. Lower interest rates are also working in Unilever's favour and will underpin 1992 profits advance regardless of whether faint flickerings of hope in the group's main markets translate into a genuine recovery. But having shown their defensive strength last year, the shares are likely to stay out of the spotlight as more cyclical stocks swing back into fashion.</p>

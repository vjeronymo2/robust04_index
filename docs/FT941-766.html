			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Lilley applauds pensions boost Pensioners are now receiving far greater sums from private sources of income than they did when the Conservatives first came to power in 1979, social security ministers told MPs yesterday. In a series of answers to Commons questions, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said pensioners were considerably better off as a result of private-pension schemes and other forms of income. Mr Lilley said the average pensioner's income from savings and occupational pensions had risen some 125 per cent in real terms between 1979 and 1991 to Pounds 63.20. Mr William Hague, a junior minister at the department, said facilities owned by pensioners had improved sharply in recent years. Mr Hague claimed that 90 per cent of pensioners had a television set, that the number of pensioners with cars had doubled since 1979 and that the percentage with the lowest 10 per cent of incomes had dropped from 31 per cent to 11 per cent since 1979. Both ministers were marshalling the argument about improved living standards for pensioners ahead of an opposition-led debate on the pensions industry later this week. Labour MPs will argue that many pensioners' incomes have been blighted because they have been sold private pension schemes unsuitable for them.</p>

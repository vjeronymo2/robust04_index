			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Nippon Mortgage Corporation files for liquidation Nippon Mortgage Corporation, a medium-sized non-bank financial institution burdened with substantial non-performing loans, yesterday filed for liquidation. An extraordinary meeting of shareholders approved the action, first signalled by the company's directors in July. At March 31, Nippon Mortgage had liabilities of Y518.4bn (Dollars 5.24bn) and assets of just Y454.7bn. Principal creditors - which include Sumitomo Trust and Banking Corporation - considered this gap too large to be plugged by fresh injections of capital. The folding of Nippon Mortgage is the third largest corporate collapse in Japan since the second world war. The company was established in 1982 by Sumitomo Trust and other companies to specialise in property-related lending. In 1991, at the height of the 'bubble economy', a period of rapid asset price inflation, Nippon Mortgage had a loan book with a paper worth of Y540.5bn. By the start of this year, however, an estimated 97 per cent of its total loans had become non-performing following the bursting of the bubble. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drugs manufacturer, has revised upwards its non-consolidated earnings forecast for the first half and the full year to March 1995 due to cost-cutting efforts and a rise in demand for its antibiotics, writes Emiko Terazono. The company, which initially expected a 3 per cent fall in interim sales to Y113bn and a 23 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y9bn, now sees the pre-tax figure rising 3.1 per cent to Y12bn on a 1.3 per cent increase in sales to Y118bn for the six months to September. The company also attributed the rise in sales to buying by hospitals and physicians who had waited for a cut in national health insurance drug prices last April to purchase their drug supplies. However, the company said the move by SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group to which Fujisawa provided its sales channel, to set up its own distribution company next January would still depress annual sales. The impact of the cut in the NHI official drug prices will also affect earnings. For the full year, Fujisawa now expects unconsolidated pre-tax earnings to rise 5.3 per cent to Y21bn on a 1.2 per cent fall in sales to Y232bn, and a 40 per cent decline in after-tax profits to Y6bn.</p>

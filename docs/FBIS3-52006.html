			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Edwin Miranda V.; first paragraph is editorial </F> introduction]    [Text] La Paz 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--The Clinton  administration has promised to provide $180 million in 1994 for  programs for the fight against narcotics trafficking in Bolivia.    Bolivia will be the only South American country which will  not have significant reductions in the aid which it receives in  the form of financial cooperation with the United States  Government in the struggle against narcotics trafficking. This  was officially announced by Minister of Government German  Quiroga Gomez.    In the course of the exclusive interview he granted to the  editors of LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz Quiroga stated that in the  framework of "uninterrupted North American aid" Bolivia expects  to receive about $180 million in 1994. These will be new  resources earmarked for providing support for the struggle  against drug trafficking, as well as for undertaking alternative  development strategies through an effective program of  substituting other crops for coca leaf production by peasant  farmers. This assistance will be based on "promises made by the  administration of President Bill Clinton to Bolivia during the  visit by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to New York on 28  September, during the most recent meeting of the United Nations  General Assembly."  <H5>  Growing External Aid </H5>   According to the explanation provided, North American aid in  the field of fighting against illicit drug trafficking is  directed at the interdiction of the traffic, alternative  development, crop eradication, and the implementation of  integral development projects in the Chapare and Yungas areas,  where coca leaves have been traditionally produced.    Quiroga said: "Bolivia has signed financial and technical  cooperation agreements with the United States since 1990." At  the same time he pointed out that North American financial  cooperation is closely related to the help which it provides to  the Bolivian balance of payments. He added: "For this purpose it  has been spending between $40 and $60 million annually."  However, at the same time he made clear that this significant  amount of help has been conditioned on the eradication of a  certain number of hectares of fields in the Chapare and Yungas  areas which were planted to coca leaves.    On this point he emphasized that it is possible that in 1994  the total amount of aid for this purpose "will decline because  of the fact that Bolivia, as of this date, has not eradicated  the number of hectares planted to coca leaves which it promised  to complete by December 1993."    The second type of United States cooperation is related to  the Ibta-Chapare Project, which essentially is aimed at the  industrialization of a large part of the tropical area of the  Department of Cochabamba. Quiroga explained that this technical  aid is aimed at promoting alternatives, in terms of products and  crops, in areas producing coca leaves.  <H5>  New Projects </H5>   During the meeting of the Consultative Group of the World  Bank which took place a short time ago in Washington, Bolivia  proposed to the international financial community the  possibility of approving "greater economic support and better  programs for the promotion of products other than coca leaves."  Alternative development plans of this kind are presently being  carried out in areas where coca leaves have traditionally been  planted.    According to the minister of government, the Bolivian  committee which visited Washington and was led by the minister  of finance and economic development presented for the  consideration of the international financial community a new  proposal for alternative development for the areas which have  traditionally produced coca leaves.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pinar del Rio Province has held a Communist Party of  Cuba [PCC] plenum which, among other issues, focused on the  region's economic prospects. A member of the PCC provincial  committee presented a detailed analysis of the current situation  and prospects for the province during the two-day plenum.    The plenum stressed the economic results of the first part  of  1994, a period during which the province registered modest  increases in mercantile production. This reflects the beginning  of the recovery process and how much still needs to be done to  meet the population's needs. The sugarcane harvest's goal was a  50-percent increase in 1994, and although more sugar was  produced than in the previous harvest, and several mills are  still grinding, this goal will not be reached. Slight increases  were registered in potato, tomato, and egg production, as well  as in the harvests of tobacco, pine resin, and self-sufficiency  crops.    The plenum called for increased efforts to quickly reach the  production level of previous years and insisted on the need for  more efficiency in collection, especially in the farming sector.  The fight against crime, and defense issues were also discussed.    Fidel Ramos Pereda, member of the Central Committee and  first  secretary of the PCC in Pinar del Rio Province, praised the  frankness with which the issues were discussed, acknowledging  the modest progress made and the awareness that it is not  enough, and that the results rest on the efforts of every  revolutionary.</p>

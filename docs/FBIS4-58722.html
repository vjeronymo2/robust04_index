			<p>BFN     [Text] A source at the General People's Committee for Unity  has made the following statement:    Faced with the serious escalation of events in sister Yemen  and the crisis between brothers, which has claimed many victims  and has led to bloodshed and the start of a spiral of violence,  we are aware of our pan-Arab responsibility to preserve Yemeni  unity which is a gain for the Arab nation and which should not  be given up. This unity should be preserved and reinforced, and  an end should be put to the in-fighting. Such is the goal which  the brother leader of the 1 September Revolution [Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi] has endeavored to achieve with his continuous  efforts to bring about reconciliation and protect unionist  gains, particularly under the current circumstances in the Arab  region and the world and in view of the challenges facing our  Arab nation.    Therefore, the duty is to spare the Yemeni Arab people the  tragedies resulting from an armed conflict, to resort to reason,  and to choose the path of dialogue in order to implement the  Pledge and Accord document and also to respond to the will of  the Yemeni Arab people to preserve unity and reject in-fighting  and the collapse of this unity, which benefits only the enemies  of unity and the enemies of the Arab nation.    The unionists and pan-Arabists today have the historical  responsibility to preserve the Yemeni unity, which we regard as  a prelude to the unity of the Arab nation, to protect its  existence and safeguard its independence.    The General People's Committee for Unity in the Great  Jamahiriyah calls on the Yemeni leaderships, who have achieved  unity, to make efforts to preserve that unity for this is an  historical responsibility which they should assume.</p>

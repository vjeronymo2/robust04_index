			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A high-ranking Chongwadae [presidential office]  official today revealed there is no change in the government's  existing position that the National Security Law cannot be  abolished, as there was no significant change in the situation.    This official said that some people hold that the Security  Law should be abolished and the pertinent articles be absorbed  into criminal law. However, the criminal law stipulates that the  act of espionage must be committed between nations. Therefore,  the article in the Security Law that defines North Korea as an  antistate organization, not as a state, cannot be absorbed into  the criminal law.</p>

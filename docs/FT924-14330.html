			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Government urges US to approve BA deal BRITAIN called on the US yesterday to approve British Airways' Dollars 750m (Pounds 441m) investment in a 44 per cent stake in USAir as a step towards total liberalisation of air services between the two countries. The Department of Transport said the UK had put forward 'serious and detailed proposals' to open up UK/US air services during negotiations in Washington this week. The proposals contained 'a substantial range of liberalising measures which can be taken in the short term'. The UK said it was waiting for a 'serious response' and warned that progress on liberalisation would hinge on the US approach to the BA-USAir deal. 'US approval will signal a liberal attitude and facilitate liberalisation: rejection or delay will be an illiberal signal and will inhibit the time-table,' the government said. The UK proposals are understood to involve three stages: first, opening up routes to regional UK airports from any US gateway followed by greater access to London airports and finally the lifting of all controls on capacity, access and designation. In return, the UK is asking for a procedure to prevent dumping by US carriers on the UK market and a procedure to settle eventual disputes. The UK is also seeking the easing of rules on foreign ownership of US airlines. First, foreign carriers should be allowed to acquire 49 per cent of the voting rights of US carriers instead of the present 25 per cent limit. The UK would eventually like to see all US limits on foreign ownership lifted. However, by making any future liberalisation of transatlantic air services contingent on US approval of the BA-USAir deal, the government has thrown the ball back into the US camp. Negotiations between the two sides are due to resume on October 20. The US authorities have come under intense pressure from the three biggest US carriers - American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - to block the BA-USAir deal unless they can first secure greater access into the UK and continental European markets. United Airlines said yesterday that the UK position was 'neither a detailed nor serious liberalisation proposal'. It claimed the proposals embodied 'a unique concept of further regulating a market that is by today's standards already restrictive and protectionist'. The carrier added that if the UK was 'really serious about its proposal, it should release it publicly and be publicly addressed'. However, UK officials rebuffed the airline's criticisms, arguing that the package was 'a genuinely liberal agreement and not just a political ploy'. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, said this week that his airline would fight vigorously 'for our right to make a legitimate investment in USAir'. BA is still hoping to secure US approval before the December 24 'walk away' deadline for its transaction with USAir.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bandar Lampung, Sunday. -- Two prostitutes,  occupants of a brothel in Bandar Lampung, and a youth, who is  currently detained at Lampung's Welfare Rehabilitation Center  for a criminal offense, were found to be positively affected by  the HIV virus.    Umar Hassan, chief of the team for prevention of AIDS in  Lampung, stated to newsmen in Bandar Lampung on 9 April that the  three persons were found to be positively affected with AIDS  through a joint survey conducted with the District Health  Department in March 1994.    Umar Hassan, who is also the third assistant of district  social welfare office said, "We are still looking for the two  prostitutes who are infected with AIDS. We will officially  detain them when we find them."    Governor Pujono hoped that Lampung's team for the prevention  of AIDS, which was established several months ago, would work to  suppress the spread of the dangerous virus.    Pujono said, "Lampung is a transit point with a potential  for  the transmission of AIDS. Due to this, it is important that we  undertake early preventive measures."    According to the data of the Regional Health Department, the  two prostitutes Od (20) and Yn (28), who are affected with AIDS,  were occupants of the service complexes at "Pemandangan" and  "Pantai Harapan" in Panjang, Bandar Lampung, while Ys (28) was  residing at Kalianda Welfare Board in south Lampung.    According to several colleagues of Od and Yn, the two had  returned to their respective villages. They said," They had  left for Java several days before the 1994 Id 'al-Fitr holidays  began." They also said,"Od and Yn had been staying in the  Panjang service complexes for the last two years. They came from  Java together with S and R."    Officials of the Lampung provincial authority have directed  that the two AIDS affected prostitutes be sought and be detained  as an effort to prevent the spread of the disease.    The exposure of the HIV cases in Lampung was due to the  survey and tests conducted from 1,119 blood samples taken  jointly by the Regional Health Department in Lampung and  Lampung's team for the prevention of AIDS.    Blood samples were taken from 142 prostitutes in  "Pemandangan", 134 others at "Pantai Harapan", 75 persons from  Pantai Pijat, 59 SMEA YPP students, 509 persons from Napi  Tanjungkarang, 103 persons from Napi Kalianda, 90 SMAN Kalianda  students and seven tourist guides, including pimps, lesbians and  homosexuals.    The blood samples were taken from the high-risk and HIV  prone  groups and tests were conducted. The outcome of the result was  that three persons were tested positive for HIV.    In compliance with the Regional Health Department's report  to  the governor on 17 March 1994, blood tests were conducted to  detect the spread of the HIV virus, social diseases and syphilis.    According to the head of the Lampung team for the prevention  of AIDS, Drs. Umar Hassan, the AIDS problem needs to be  perpetually pursued. He said," We truly hope that Lampung will  be free of prostitutes."</p>

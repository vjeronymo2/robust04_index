			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROOPS BATTLE MOBS IN SOVIET ASIAN REPUBLIC  </P> <P> Soviet security forces battled throughout Wednesday against rioting mobs in the  Central Asian city of Dushanbe in an effort to restore order there and end the  country's latest, and some of its fiercest, anti-government violence.  </P> <P> Despite the deployment of more troops to Dushanbe, the capital of Soviet  republic of Tadzhikistan, and tougher measures to enforce the state of  emergency there, the situation continued to deteriorate throughout the day, the  official Soviet news agency Tass reported, and government forces had not yet  regained full control of the city.  </P> <P> Armed with firebombs and bottles of acid, the rioters for the third day  attacked the headquarters of the Tadzhikistan Communist Party, demanding the  resignation of the regional party leadership, Tass said, suggesting that an  attempt to seize power was under way.  </P> <P> The rioters also began assaulting Russians and other non-Tadzhiks on the  streets and in their homes, according to Tass and other Soviet news media  reports. Various ethnic groups reportedly began forming "self-defense  detachments," largely composed of veterans of the Afghan war, to protect their  communities.  </P> <P> In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, harshly criticizing the rioters,  called for stricter enforcement of the law.  </P> <P> "The nation's destiny and the safety of our citizens is at stake," Gorbachev  told the Supreme Soviet, the country's Parliament. "We must do everything to  put out the fire.  </P> <P> "We should crack down on those who, under the slogans of ethnic revival, draw  people into a fight for their ambitions and selfish goals. This is a kind of  chain reaction accompanied by an orgy of ethnic revival that draws people into  it."  </P> <P> Gorbachev called in his speech for new laws to curb the ethnic violence that  has plagued his reform effort over the past two years.  </P> <P> "The events in Dushanbe, where the flame has spilled over from Baku, speak of  the great danger of inter-ethnic violence," he said, referring to the attacks  last month by Azerbaijanis on Armenians in Baku and the subsequent efforts of  the government to restore order.  </P> <P> Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the first vice president, said the new Supreme Soviet  session will consider draft laws against instigating ethnic violence as well as  other legislation on the introduction of states of emergency and the use of  troops in civil disturbances.  </P> <P> The lawmakers will also consider new legislation that makes the Soviet Union a  more federal system, giving every major ethnic group a great deal of autonomy  as the relationship between the central government and the constituent  republics is defined.  </P> <P> Armored vehicles, including tanks, were patrolling the streets under the state  of emergency and the 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew, and the firing of automatic  weapons could be heard over the telephone during calls to several government  departments and newspaper offices in the city.  </P> <P> The troops reportedly opened fire several times on groups of rioters and  looters, killing as many as eight people Wednesday, according to reports from  opposition groups in Dushanbe. Correspondents for state radio and television  said they had seen the bodies, still lying in the street, of some of those  killed.  </P> <P> But the report of more fatalities was rejected by Communist Party and  government officials, who put the total deaths over three days of clashes at 11  or 12.  </P> <P> They also denied as "totally unfounded" reports on Soviet television and Radio  Moscow that 37 people had been killed in the first two days of clashes.  </P> <P> The troops began regrouping late Wednesday, pulling back from many of their  positions on the major thoroughfares of Dushanbe and positioning themselves  around major government buildings. Commanding officers told Soviet journalists  that the maneuver was "normal" in such situations, but it was welcomed by  opposition activists who saw it as a conciliatory gesture before the funerals  of those killed in the earlier clashes.  </P> <P> There were also contradictory reports on the political situation, reflecting  not only the confusion in the streets but the uncertainty about the ability of  the Tadzhikistan Communist Party there to reassert its control.  </P> <P> Tass and Soviet television reported that the Tadzhikistan party's Central  Committee held an emergency meeting Wednesday to debate the situation and ended  by confirming its support for the present leadership, including the party's  first secretary, Kahkar Makhkamov, who had earlier offered his resignation.  </P> <P> But journalists in Dushanbe said that Makhkamov had quit, along with  Tadzhikistan President Gaibnazar Pallayev, and the republic's premier, Izatullo  Khayeyev, and through their resignations managed to ease the confrontation  between the rioters and security forces.  </P> <P> The reported resignations brought cheers from the crowd outside the party's  Central Committee building.  </P> <P> Tass earlier Wednesday described the battle between the protesters and troops  in Dushanbe.  </P> <P> "Militants have been making attempts to reach the Tadzhik party headquarters  since this morning,," the agency reported. "Crowds threw gasoline bombs,  bottles with sulfuric acid and stones at the troops blocking the building's  entrances."  </P> <P> The rioting was touched off by rumors that Armenian refugees fleeing  strife-torn Baku, Azerbaijan, would get preferential treatment and be assigned  scarce new housing.  </P> <P> Even when this proved to be false, the idea lingered on that Tadzhiks are not  masters in their own land and that the government is a Russian or Soviet  creation.  </P> <P> Dushanbe residents said that the problems there have deeper roots -- high  unemployment and an upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism among young people.  </P> <P> "If you cannot run the republic," ran one of the anti-government slogans,  "leave it to the clergy."  </P></p>

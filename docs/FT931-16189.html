			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / More BR sell-off details expected MORE DETAILS of the government's plans to privatise British Rail are expected to emerge in the next few weeks. The aim is to restore the momentum of moves towards sell-off, which critics have described as unworkable and stalled. The series of announcements planned includes publication of the rail bill on January 20. Ministers will launch a publicity offensive to win support for their privatisation plans, which have run into opposition from senior Conservatives, as well as Labour and the rail lobby. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, will soon name the new regulator who is to oversee rail privatisa-tion. Details of the rules for charging train operators for using the track are also due to be published. The first half-dozen or so of the expected 30 to 40 passenger-service franchises will also be announced. Mr MacGregor will use the Department of Transport's question slot in the Commons on Monday to reply to his critics. Later that day he will be appearing before the transport committee. Although he is due to give evidence on the transport implications of the Autumn Statement, he is likely to be questioned on the implications of BR's tighter funding over the next three years on the privatisation plans. He will also defend the government's plans in the Commons on Tuesday in a debate on BR privatisation launched by Labour. The first franchises will be based on five to eight new profit centres, formed from BR's 19 existing operating divisions. These will operate as 'ghost' franchises under BR management until the first round of franchising next year, offering the private sector an idea of what sort of business opportunities are likely to be available. Likely candidates include the London, Tilbury and Southend Line and Chiltern Line services from London Marylebone.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Indian-Israeli trade grows in new climate A HIGH-LEVEL Israeli business delegation on a visit to Bombay and New Delhi has identified half a dozen possible joint ventures in India with Israeli technology and, probably, equity. Business relations between the two countries have blossomed since the opening of full diplomatic relations last year after four decades of cold, if not hostile, relations. Mr Itzak Gerberg, Israeli consul-general in Bombay, expects two-way trade to double to Dollars 500m (Pounds 317m) this year. The two countries see joint production openings in textiles, clothes and chemicals for export from Israel to Europe and the US duty-free and quota-free. Israel has agreements with the US and EC to allow free access for goods with a minimum 35 per cent Israeli content (Indian content could make up the rest). A similar agreement was reached with the European Free Trade Association last year. Israel considers this a way to boost its exports, worth Dollars 13.2bn last year. Israel companies also plan to collaborate with their Indian counterparts in bidding for computer software contracts.</p>

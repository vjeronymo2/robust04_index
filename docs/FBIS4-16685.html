			<p>BFN     [Text] "Russia must stop any conversations with Bosnian  Serbs. The time for conversations is over. Bosnian Serbs must  realize that Russia embodies a great power and not a banana  republic," the Russian president's Special Envoy, Deputy Russian  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told journalists today at the  airport on his return from a nine-day visit to former Yugoslavia.    Churkin considered the situation in Bosnia as still complex.  "If things do not improve, there will be no way to discuss  lifting of international sanctions against Serbia," Churkin  stressed.    He said the Russian policy in ex-Yugoslavia was a "policy of  a great power." "Relations with the Serbs can be expressed in a  simple formula: when Serbs were stating that the whole world  was against them we agreed under the condition that they would  follow our instructions. Instead of this, Bosnian Serbs use  Russian policy as a shield," Churkin emphasized.    In his opinion, during the recent crisis in Gorazde the  Serbs  should have stopped their offensive on the city. "There were  possibilities to prevent the aggravation of the situation.  Originally, Serbs offered to send a group of UN observers to  their positions near Gorazde. When the Russian side got in  touch with UN officials and agreed on the issue, the offer had  already been rejected. As a result, the grave crisis in Bosnia  aggravated even further," Churkin said.    He said that the Bosnian Serbs repeatedly gave assurances  about the end of fighting near Gorazde. "Unfortunately, the  meetings between the Serbs and the UN representatives mediated  by Russia turned out to be fruitless. The Serbs did not show  any readiness or sincere willingness to agree. They were just  wasting time," Churkin said.    Churkin expressed confidence that "if the Bosnian Serbs  continue their offensive on Gorazde and fire at least one round  towards the city, there will be a huge crisis which will bring  the Serb people into the catastrophe."    In Churkin's opinion, "a small group of Bosnian Serbs have  become mad on war."    "Russia should decide whether it should allow a group of  extremists to use the policy of Russia for achieving their  goals. Our response is simple -- never. If somebody tries to  play with Russia's policy, Russia will respond as can be  expected from a great power," Churkin said.</p>

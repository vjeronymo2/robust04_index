			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Rancho Seco nuclear power plant began producing electricity 11 days after a  shutdown that prompted federal officials to summon the utility district's board  members to Washington. The troubled plant 25 miles southeast of Sacramento was  brought to 35% power and will be kept at that level for several days for tests.  It will then be brought to 60% for more tests and finally to its normal  operating level of 92%. Meantime, the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District  invited the public to tour the plant over the weekend as part of a "spring open  house" designed to improve the plant's public relations in advance of a June  election to determine its fate. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission summoned  district board members and staff to Washington to talk about the shutdown and a  nuclear industry organization's critique of the plant and the district.  </P></p>

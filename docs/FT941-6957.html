			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A red hot deal - Appetisers You should just catch two silly February deals from two of the UK's most traditional merchants. Peatlings, of East Anglia (0284-755948), is offering 20 per cent off all table wines costing more than Pounds 10 a bottle. Its claret and burgundy selections alone make this an offer worth investigating. Laytons, of London NW1, (071-388-5081) has 20 trouvailles from classic French regions of which the surprise snip is the red bordeaux Ch des Gondats 1984 at Pounds 4.70. No wine enthusiast worth his salt would even consider buying a wine so suspiciously cheap from the 1984 vintage but this, effectively the second wine of third-growth Margaux Ch Marquis de Terme, has none of the skeletal nature of most 1984s and is even charming. * * * Both Sainsbury's and Oddbins are interested increasingly in buying small parcels of wine and selling them through a limited number of stores - good news for the consumer, although it makes life difficult for the wine writer trying to give stockist details. Some 95 (of 350) branches of Sainsbury's stock Hamilton Russell 1992 Chardonnay, which is worth seeking out. It is made from some of South Africa's most southerly fruit and, at Pounds 6.95, can offer a surprising amount of subtlety and a suitably savoury burgundian character. Good Sauvignon has long been easier to find in South Africa than exciting Chardonnay but Les Enfants Sauvignon 1993 (from Vergelegen) is well worth Pounds 3.95 at 100 Sainsbury stores. * * * One of the best meals during my last trip to Manhattan was at JoJo's, home to Alsace-born chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. He has since opened a second restaurant, Vong, where French technique meets Thai influences such as lemon grass and coconut milk. From Monday, March 7, Vongerichten will be in London for a week cooking alongside Jean-Christophe Novelli, chef at the Four Seasons restaurant in west London (071-499-0888). Menus from Pounds 25. * * * The fifth floor at Harvey Nichols' store in west London houses not only a restaurant, bar, cafe and food hall, but also an exceptionally catholic wine shop where 750 different lines are on sale - at Knightsbridge (but not Silly Knightsbridge) prices. On Mondays in March, diners in the restaurant can drink at wine shop prices, uninflated by the usual restaurant mark-up. * * * Four years ago John and Sally McKenna formed their own publishing house, Estragon Press. They have just published the third edition of The Bridgestone Irish Food Guide (Pounds 11.99), which now stretches to more than 300 pages of essential information for any traveller to Ireland. * * * Another publishing success has been the Logis of Great Britain hotel guide (Pounds 6.50, 290pp), launched by Jenny and David Horsley in 1991 from their home in Putney, south-west London. It adapts the successful formula and strict conditions of entry from Logis de France. The 1994 guide has information on 515 independently-owned hotels in the UK and Ireland, ranging from traditional coaching inns to small country house hotels. The new, user-friendly, central reservations system is on 0865-875888.</p>

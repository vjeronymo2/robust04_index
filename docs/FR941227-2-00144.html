On or about December 19, 1985, Drexel and Mr. Trotman consented to the entry of a final judgment and order of permanent injunction (the ``Injunction'') in an action commenced by the SEC. Civil Action No. 85&hyph;9855 (United States District Court for the Southern District of New York). The activities forming the basis for the Injunction took place from approximately November 1981 to June 14, 1982, during which time Drexel acted as co-lead manager for two public offerings of securities issued by Flight Transportation Corporation (``Flight''). The SEC's complaint alleged that Drexel and Mr. Trotman violated sections 17(a) (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with Drexel's due diligence investigation for the underwriting of approximately $25.6 million of securities issued by Flight in June 1982. The complaint alleged that the registration statement Flight filed with the SEC for these securities contained materially false and misleading statements relating to the group charter business, including among other things, the statement that Flight's $23 million group charter business comprised approximately one-third of Flight's revenues, when, in fact, the group charter business did not and never had existed. The complaint alleged that Drexel and Mr. Trotman placed undue reliance on the statements of Flight's management and failed to verify independently the existence of Flight's group charger business by not contacting the customers or suppliers of the group charter business. The terms of the Injunction required Mr. Trotman to submit his due diligence work for review by Drexel's underwriting assistance committee for a period of four months and for Drexel to submit its written due diligence procedures for review by outside counsel for an opinion as to the adequacy of the procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. On December 20, 1985, the SEC issued a temporary order under section 9(c) of the Act which exempted Drexel from section 9(a) with respect to the Injunction. On February 24, 1986, the SEC granted Drexel a permanent order under section 9(c) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Drexel Burnham Lambert Incorporated, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Investment Company Act Release Nos. 14862 (Dec. 20, 1985) (notice and temporary order) and 14954 (Feb. 24, 1986) (permanent order). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7.

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Knight-Ridder expects charge KNIGHT-RIDDER, the Miami-based media group, said it expected new labour agreements at the Detroit newspapers operation it owns jointly with Gannett to result in a second-quarter pre-tax charge of about Dollars 12m, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The 11 cents-a-share charge is for severance payments over the expected axing of up to 400 jobs, but the company said earnings in the quarter would be higher than the 82 cents a share, or Dollars 41.6m, last year.</p>

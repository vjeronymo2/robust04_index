			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Prince William Sound, the Assessment estimates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the incremental escort cost is $94,500 per tanker transit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Hinchinbrook Entrance to Whittier (via Bligh Reef pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> station) and return, using two escort vessels dispatched  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Port Valdez. This cost-per-transit is relatively high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the tanker must pay for the total round-trip  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispatch time of the escort vessels. Because these tankers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are operated or chartered by the Navy, the escort costs will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimately be borne by the U.S. Government (Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Defense).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Puget Sound, the Assessment assumes that there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient inbound or outbound tanker traffic such that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanker will only be paying for one-way dispatch time of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escort vessels. However, unlike Prince William Sound, there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are several possible destination terminals in Puget Sound;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordingly, escorted transit times range from 1 to 7 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the average cost-per-transit is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $6,750 (5 hrs at approximately $1,350 per hour) for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tankers, in 1994 dollars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Assessment estimates that the first-year cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the regulations (1995) will be $11.4 million, and the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discounted program cost (1995 to 2015) will be $57.7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million, in 1990 dollars. The tanker industry can reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these costs by switching to double-hulled tankers earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than assumed in the Assessment, or it can increase these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs by continuing to use double-sided or double-bottomed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tankers after 2010.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The original preliminary Regulatory Evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempted to statistically estimate the benefits of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The Coast Guard has subsequently determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there is no statistical basis for such estimations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without making extreme assumptions of debatable validity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is because the occurrence of a steering or propulsion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure is not related to the size of the tanker or its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cargo capacity. Further, such failures do not necessarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in a collision or grounding, nor do collisions or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groundings necessarily result in rupture of cargo tank(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> And even if a tank were ruptured, there is no predicting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual amount of outflow that would occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the final Assessment makes a presumption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness by assuming that the regulations would avert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least one collision or grounding that would otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spill 300,000 barrels of oil (This is derived from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximate capacity of two cargo tanks on a midsize oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanker of 80,000 DWT.). This averted oil spill could occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at any time during the 15-year period from 1995 (the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full year that the regulations will be in effect) to 2010  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (when the last single hull oil tanker is phased out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The monetary benefits of these regulations include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoided cleanup costs, third-party compensation (lost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earnings to fishermen, etc.) and natural resource damages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, these costs have varied enormously from spill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to spill because of the great range of factors affecting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of oil spills, such as type of product, environment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time of year, location, and weather conditions. Accordingly, it is not possible to establish a definitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monetized (dollar) benefit value for unspilled oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Assessment does not perform benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations using dollar amounts. Instead, it uses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unspilled oil quantity, discounted at 7 percent back to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 barrels. If the averted 300,000 barrel spill were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumed to occur in 1995, the discounted quantity would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 213,896 barrels. If it were assumed to occur in 2010, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discounted quantity would be 77,526 barrels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the final Assessment has determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost of these regulations ranges from $270 to $744 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discounted barrel of unspilled oil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has evaluated the impact of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking on small entities in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small entity impact analysis is incorporated into the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment for this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the NPRM and public hearings, only six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments have been received to date concerning the impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> escort regulations on small businesses. The comments stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the regulations would have detrimental economic impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on small businesses in the Puget Sound region if tallow and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vegetable oil cargoes were included. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations do not include non-petroleum oil cargoes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard has determined that most of the tankers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are affected by the regulation in Prince William Sound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Puget Sound are owned either by oil companies or large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipping corporations. Since few small entities will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule contains no collection-of-information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The original NPRM contained collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information requirements in the form of written information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that had to be prepared by escort vessel operators and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to the local Coast Guard Captain of the Port  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (COTP). As discussed elsewhere, the requirement has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule establishes standards and requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the escort of single hull tankers over 5,000 GT in Prince  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> William Sound, Alaska and Puget Sound (and certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated waters around Puget Sound), Washington. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to regulate such traffic is delegated to the Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guard by the Secretary of Transportation whose authority is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed by statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While these regulations establish minimal requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for escort of certain tanker traffic through these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated areas, the Coast Guard does not intend to preempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the states from issuing more stringent requirements provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are not in direct conflict with Federal law or this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rulemaking and concluded that the preparation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Impact statement is not necessary.

The only other impact will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a minor increase in vessel traffic (escort vessels)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moving through Puget and Prince William Sounds: the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated 1,276 additional escort vessel transits per year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent an average of 3 to 4 additional vessels per day;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this will decrease as single hull tankers are phased out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Peres positive on peace plan Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said after more than two hours of talks yesterday in Cairo with Mr Amr Moussa, his Egyptian counterpart, that the US draft document could 'serve as a basis for continuation' of the stalled Middle East peace talks, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. However, he offered nothing on the inclusion of the issue of Jerusalem in talks aiming towards interim Palestinian self-rule. 'Israel has a position on Jerusalem that is clear and known and decided,' he said. 'I don't think we're going to depart from this.' Mr Moussa also added his backing to the US draft, calling it a 'good basis' but repeating Egypt's position that Jerusalem should be part of the talks.</p>

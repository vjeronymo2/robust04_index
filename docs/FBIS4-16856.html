			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report Vladimir Berezovskiy: "General Chechulin: Jihad </F> Declared Against Border Guards"]    [Text] Tashkent -- The situation on the Tajik-Afghan  border is not calm. As has already been reported, an armored  transporter was blown up by an antitank mine in the Pyandzh  [name as transliterated] detachment's sector. Lieutenant  Aleksey Vladimirov was killed and four servicemen were injured.  The mine was laid by subversives from the Afghan side, who had  made a hole in the fence beforehand.    Days earlier, this detachment's checkpoint had been shelled  by four rockets fired from the direction of the village of  Vandari Sherkhan [name as transliterated], which is controlled  by units of the Afghan 54th Division. The border guards did not  open fire in retaliation, so as to avoid casualties among the  civilian population.    The Tajik Government has pinned the blame for this  provocation on the armed opposition, which, in official  Dushanbe's opinion, wants thereby to wreck the talks under way  in Moscow. General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the Russian  Border Guards Group, put it even more sharply. He is convinced  that this action was planned. And it would have played into the  hands of both the opposition and the Afghans if Tajik refugees  had suffered from the retribution.    Incidentally, the leadership of Konduz Province recently  proposed that Tajik refugees not be prevented from returning  home in exchange for deliveries of electricity from Khotlon  Oblast. In other words, the refugees have turned into a  bargaining chip. The general noted that there is a limit to the  border guards' patience. And they will provide a proper rebuff,  even despite the fact that, as he put it, Khodzhi Akbar  Turadzhonzod [name as transliterated], one of the opposition  leaders, recently called for a jihad against the border guards.    The former official head of the Tajik Muslims, who refused  to  go to the talks in Moscow, stated in Tehran that the opposition  is indeed insisting on the withdrawal of Russian border guards  from Tajikistan. Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzod explained his  absence from the talks by the fact that Emomali Rakhmonov, the  current head of the republic, had not gone to Moscow, nor had  other major figures representing Kulyab, which played a decisive  role in routing the opposition's combat detachments.</p>

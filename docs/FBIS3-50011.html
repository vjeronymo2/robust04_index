"I am satisfied that your visit is taking place so soon  after  the Prague summit. Europe is now seeking a new vision of its  future. It is our task to add our concepts to this vision.  Partnership is real only when we ourselves can settle its  conditions. The world paid attention to our statements and  arguments presented before the NATO summit in Brussels and the  meeting in Prague. Without this pressure on Western public  opinion we would get much less," the president said.    Geza Jeszenszky stressed that it was mainly the Polish  president who contributed to the positive results of this  campaign.    At the end of the meeting, Walesa said: "After `the Prague  lesson' we must always remember that we cannot lose influence on  developments in Eastern and Central Europe. No one will help us  if we do not do this ourselves. That is why further cooperation  within the Visegrad group is so significant. We are speaking  the same language and we have common interests. If we build  planes for better cooperation, others will join us. In this way  we will enlarge the area of stability in our region. If we do  not make use of the chance provided by the "Partnership for  Peace" we will lose it. "We have to stay on the backs of the  rich of the world," to present our arguments to them for only  then facts will change into real security safeguards," the  president said.</p>

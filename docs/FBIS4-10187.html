			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Yesterday, Chile became the second country of  the Americas, after the United States, to export fruit to China.  The Agricultural and Livestock Service (SAG) signed a plant  health agreement with the PRC Agriculture Ministry National  Animal and Plant Quarantine Service which opens the Chinese  market to Chilean fruit. Exports will include apples and kiwi  fruit grown in the sixth and ninth region where the fruit fly  has never been reported.    The signing ceremony was attended by the PRC ambassador to  Chile and Agriculture Under Secretary Alejandro Gutierrez. The  agreement was described as a major step toward opening the  market to Chilean fruit. A PRC agricultural technical mission  has been in Chile since 14 March and the agreement was concluded  after two weeks of talks. [passage omitted]    Gutierrez said "Sino-Chilean trade has grown to $400  million.  This is proof of the purchasing power of the Chinese market,  which consists of 1.2 billion people whose income is rapidly  increasing." He added that the agreement stems from the  fruitful relations existing between the two countries and from a  trade agreement signed by the two countries in 1990 during the  visit of then President Patricio Aylwin.

This time their criminal hands  moved with the evil intention of attempting the assassination of  the nation's loved one and the peerless companion of the leader,  the popular president, in the sanctuary of the sacred tomb of  the beloved Imam. Since the revolution and its move are  divinely supported and guaranteed by the Imam of the Age, may  God expedite his advent, by God's grace and power, once again  the efforts of the conspirators were ineffective, and shouts of  greetings to Hashemi and death to the hypocrites were the  nation's crushing reply to that incident.    The Muslim nation of Iran will hold prayer services in all  the mosques after tomorrow night's evening prayers as  thanksgiving for the wellbeing of their beloved president, as  well as to ask for a long life for the exalted leader of the  Islamic revolution.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Cubans flee via open south coast More Cubans appear to be leaving the unsupervised south coast of their country for neighbouring islands in the Caribbean, as Cuban police continue to patrol sections of Cuba's north coast to deter boat people from heading for the US. Government officials in the Cayman Islands and Jamaica said yesterday they feared the Cuban move to restrict those fleeing the north coast on rafts, following the agreement last week by the Cuban and US government to curb illegal migration, would lead to a southward rush of refugees. More than 200 refugees arrived in the Cayman Islands over the weekend, despite an announcement last week by the government of the UK dependency that all 'economic migrants' would be repatriated. This brings to 620 the number of Cubans refugees on the Caymans, whose administration said it had no more money to take care of Cubans. Cuba's government said at the weekend that, until midday today, it would try to persuade would-be refugees not to depart in home-made rafts and boats. The government said that, after the deadline, the authorities would use force if necessary to stop rafters from leaving, especially if they resisted violently. After the accord with the US, a flotilla of rafts carrying refugees rushed to leave beaches near Havana before the authorities moved to stop them. Britain is in the final stages of negotiating an investment promotion and protection agreement with Cuba, in an effort to raise its trade and investment profile there. 'I hope we will be able to reach an agreement. We are in the final stages of discussions,' Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, said late on Sunday at the start of a three-day visit to Cuba by a business and official delegation. Mr Taylor said the UK government saw good prospects for increased trade and investment. He said he was concerned Britain was lagging behind Europe and Nafta nations in developing economic links with the island.</p>

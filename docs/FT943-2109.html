			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Lib-Lab pact talks may start next year Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, has begun to sketch out his terms for a future partnership with Labour, believing the parties could combine to defeat the Tories at the next election. Mr Ashdown has been unwilling to publicly discuss relations with other parties at this week's conference. But he is understood to believe that Mr Tony Blair's election as Labour leader has created an opportunity to transform the landscape of British politics. Amid clear divisions within his own party and serious doubts over Labour's response, the Liberal Democrat leader is determined not to rush into the arms of Mr Blair. But he has set out a series of conditions which Labour must meet before he would consider serious co-operation. They include unequivocal backing for proportional representation, a stance the Labour leader has so far refused to adopt. There is acknowledgement too among senior party figures that the extent of any rapprochement will depend on the attitude which Labour adopts towards the Liberal Democrats. They demand that Labour local councillors must co-operate with their Liberal Democrat counterparts, abandoning the alliances they have made with Tory candidates in some town halls. There is also an insistence that Labour must make clear its commitment to political 'pluralism' and the principle that it will back the policies of other parties. If there is movement on these issues, Mr Ashdown does not rule out the possibility that the parties could begin informal contacts on tactics and policies next summer. One possibility might be for the Liberal Democrats to indicate support for particular items of legislation put down by a Labour government. To this end, Mr Ashdown is understood to have asked Mr Charles Kennedy, outgoing Liberal Democrat president, to examine whether the parties could join forces in areas including constitutional reform and the promotion of social justice legislation. But Mr Ashdown is also understood to believe that there is scope to create a more formal pact with Labour in the longer term, which could involve joint selection of parliamentary candidates. In the event of a hung parliament Liberal Democrat MPs could be included in a Labour cabinet. In a speech to the party conference yesterday, Mr Kennedy also hinted that the party leadership was developing a strategy of wooing Labour while setting out clear conditions for co-operation. He said that within the Liberal Democrat party 'there is the capacity to be complimentary over other leaders'. He said: 'Pluralism in politics is a good goal,' but 'you can only guarantee that goal by proportional representation'. Labour leaders have refused to entertain any idea of co-operation with Mr Ashdown.</p>

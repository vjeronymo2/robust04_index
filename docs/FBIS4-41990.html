			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 29 TASS -- On the eve of a meeting with  Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh  scheduled for July 4, head of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FCS] of Russia Sergey Stepashin informed that this  would be the first personal contact between chiefs of  counterintelligence of the two countries.    Sergey Stepashin was today a guest of the club of  editors-in-  chief of Russian news media at the ITAR-TASS news agency in  Moscow.    The director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service  elaborated that one of the aims of Louis Freeh's visit to Russia  would be the opening of a FBI office in Moscow.    Sergey Stepashin also said that the FBI director was  concerned about an access of Russian mafia to nuclear technology.    Incidentally, the director of the Federal  Counterintelligence  Service of Russia himself rules out such a possibility. He  intends to ask his American counterpart to present documents or  information confirming the danger of nuclear terrorism in  Russia, otherwise FBI's interest in this problem may be  interpreted by the Russian opposition as an aspiration of the  United States to establish control over nuclear objects on the  territory of the Russian Federation.    It is noteworthy that the American side does not offer the  Federal Counterintelligence Service of Russia to open its office  in the United States. According to Sergey Stepashin, such an  agreement was reached only with Germany, France, Czech Republic  and Poland.    In addition to meetings with the director of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service of Russia, chief of the U.S. Federal  Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh also intends to meet with  Yuriy Baturin, assistant to the Russian president on national  security, and Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin.</p>

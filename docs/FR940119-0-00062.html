Vessel owners making such a request will be placed in the appropriate category, for the entire year, if they agree to comply with the following restrictions, in addition to and notwithstanding other restrictions of this part, when fishing under the DAS program described in &sect;650.24, or are in possession of more than 400 lbs (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The vessel must fish exclusively with one dredge no more than 10.5 feet (3.2 m) in width;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The vessel is prohibited from having more than one dredge on board or in use; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The vessel may have no more than five people, including the operator, on board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;650.22  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Possession restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Owners or operators of vessels with a limited access scallop permit that have declared out of the DAS program as specified in &sect;650.26, or have used up their DAS allocations and vessels possessing a general scallop permit, unless exempted under the DAS exemption program described under &sect;650.27, are prohibited from possessing or landing per trip, more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops, or 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops, with not more than one scallop trip allowable in any calendar day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Owners or operators of vessels without a Federal sea scallop permit, except vessels fishing for scallops exclusively in state waters, are prohibited from possessing or landing per trip, more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) of shucked sea scallops, or 5 U.S. bushels (176.2 l) of in-shell sea scallops.

Scallop DAS for this purpose is defined as the total days at sea on trips with landings of more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The following formulas apply to all vessels qualifying for limited access scallop permits, with the exception of vessels that qualify under paragraph &sect;650.4(a)(1)(i)(C). The DAS formula applicable to that group of vessels is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Vessel owners may choose their 1990 history under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or a calculation based on the 1985&hyph;1990 history, as applicable, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. DAS are calculated from the formulas below and the result is applied to the DAS categories described in paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1990 fishing history.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For any vessel that fished for scallops in 1990, the number of scallop DAS may be determined by calculating the total number of DAS on scallop trips ending in 1990; or,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1985&hyph;1990 fishing history.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For vessels with history in the scallop fishery between 1985 and 1990, inclusive, the number of years history is determined as follows. With the exception of the adjustments specified under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section, vessels whose calculated scallop history is based on a formula below must use their entire history in the scallop fishery and may not elect to use a formula based on fewer years history in the fishery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

So says Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, who yesterday was on Capitol Hill defending the subsidies limitations agreed in the Uruguay Round. 'The greatest growth of those subsidies came under the Reagan and Bush administrations, working with private industry,' he said. He added the US had agreed in the Round to raise the percentage allowable for government subsidies for basic or applied research to protect US programmes 'critical to our competitive success'.</p>

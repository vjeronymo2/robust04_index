			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Brighter prospects for RTZ in Papua New Guinea RTZ's attempts to develop the Lihir gold mine in Papua New Guinea have taken a positive turn, with the newly installed government of Sir Julius Chan promising to speed up talks over a special mining licence. It is estimated that Lihir will produce 589,000 ounces of gold a year for the first eight years, with sufficient reserves for 37 years of production. RTZ currently owns 80 per cent of the mine, with Niu Guinea Mining owning the remainder. However, the project's equity structure remains under negotiation. RTZ also announced yesterday the sale of its Ridgeway Gold mine to Toronto-based Kinross Gold for Dollars 47m (Pounds 29.7m). Ridgeway is expected to produce 125,000 ounces of gold this.</p>

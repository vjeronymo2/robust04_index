			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Research centres may be sold off MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is considering a sale of his department's five laboratories, which generate business worth more than Pounds 100m a year. In a Commons written reply he said the government was reviewing the future of the National Physical Laboratory, the National Weights and Measures Laboratory and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, all at Teddington, Middlesex; the National Engineering Laboratory in East Kilbride, Strathclyde; and the Warren Spring Laboratory in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Mr Heseltine said that since becoming executive agencies three years ago, the laboratories, which employ more than 2,000 staff, had 'made much progress towards becoming more commercial and customer-focused and more cost-conscious organisations'. The review, involving independent consultants, will consider options including privatisation or franchising.</p>

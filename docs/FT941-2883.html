			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: OGC beats expectations OGC, the oil services group of which 40 per cent was floated last year by Fairhaven International, reported a better-than-expected 7 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 11.2m on sales 4.2 per cent lower at Pounds 217.1m, against Pounds 226.6m. The Bermuda-registered parent, owned by Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipping magnate, also announced a sharp jump in profits from Dollars 18.1m to Dollars 38.6m (Pounds 26.4m). That was largely due to the Pounds 30m proceeds of floating OGC. Sales were 12 per cent down at Dollars 461.9m (Dollars 524.4m). Since the flotation Fairhaven has become largely an investment vehicle Investors, who took up OGC's shares at 130p in June, were rewarded with a proposed final dividend of 3.5p, for a total of 5.25p. This compares with a notional net pay-out of 4.4p, and is more than twice covered by earnings of 11.9p (10.9p). The shares closed yesterday 6p higher at 155p. Mr Richard Wilson, the chairman, said that while sales had been expected to decline, the year had remained 'particularly busy'. Most of the profits were due to the Aberdeen-based AOC, which provides services to North Sea projects. Several contracts came to an end during the year, allowing OGC to recognise the full profits. Fairhaven enjoyed a less successful year, however, showing a 9 per cent decline in profits before exceptional items. The Pounds 30.2m exceptional gain from the flotation of OGC was offset by an Pounds 8m charge arising from litigation in the US. Mr James Davidson, chairman, said significant amounts due to Fairhaven were the subject of litigation in the US. 'While we believe that these matters will be resolved in our favour, hopefully in 1994, this is not certain.' The litigation had been expected to be resolved last year. On a brighter note, Mr Davidson said margins and sales had been better than expected and in line with those of 1992. However, the company was hit by adverse exchange rates, following the devaluation of sterling. The main contributor to profits was the holding in OGC. Belmont Constructors performed below expectations while the partnership with Nishika returned a loss. The final dividend of 1.3 cents (0.6 cents) is proposed for a total of 1.8 cents (0.8 cents). Earnings per share rose from 4.39 cents to 12.75 cents.</p>

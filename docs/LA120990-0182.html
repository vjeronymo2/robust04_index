			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKAKO DOI;  </P> <P> BUILDING AN OPPOSITION IN JAPAN'S ONE-PARTY STATE  </P> <P> "The reason I became a politician lies in Hollywood," Takako Doi, the  charismatic chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, said during a break in a  two-day meeting of U.S. and Japanese opinion-makers.  </P> <P> "I saw a movie. Its title was 'Young Mr. Lincoln.' I didn't go because of the  title but rather because I am a great fan of Henry Fonda," she said. "I was  deeply moved. So I wanted to become a lawyer. I entered the law school at  university and ultimately became a politician."  </P> <P> Her inspiration, she explained, was Lincoln's "defense of a black person.  Despite the fact that (Lincoln) was subjected to all kinds of accusations, he  still continued. I was very moved."  </P> <P> Today, Doi, 62, has herself become an inspiration, both to women in Japan and  to any voter who wants Japan, which has been governed continuously by the  Liberal Democratic Party and its conservative predecessors since 1948, to  develop a two-party system.  </P> <P> The first woman to lead a major party in Japan, Doi has resuscitated her fading  one-time Marxist ideologues into a party that scored major gains in the last  two national elections after two decades of decline.  </P> <P> But critics say her charisma alone won't be enough to carry the Socialists to  power. Doi herself remains reserved in predictions of the future. The  Socialists' first chance to come close to winning an election in the House of  Representatives, which elects the prime minister, won't come until the second  election from now, or another six years or so, she said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Doi has been trying to pull the Socialists into the mainstream of  Japanese politics by uprooting the last vestiges of the party's old Marxist  policies. She plays down the party's advocacy of abolishing the U.S.-Japan  Security Treaty -- indeed, she tries to avoid answering questions about it. She  also has moved to improve her party's contacts with the United States, which  once were all but nonexistent.  </P> <P> Doi, a constitutional lawyer, is dedicated to upholding Japan's postwar  constitution that bans the use of force in settling international disputes. But  she has supported overseas dispatch of non-military personnel to assist U.N.  peacekeeping activities.  </P> <P> Relaxed and gracious in person, Doi exudes an aura of self-confidence and  conviction -- even when she is forced by divisions in her party's political  philosophy to speak with less than full candor. She displays a playful sense of  humor, occasionally breaking into infectious laughter. Unlike many Japanese  politicians, the self-proclaimed devotee of pachinko (upright slot machines)  playing and karaoke (singing to music recorded without words), affects no airs  of self-importance.  </P> <P> Question: Concerning a possible dispatch of Japanese people for the gulf  effort, what personnel might help?  </P> <P> Answer: . . . Non-military personnel . . . who would be helpful to civilians .  . . . The important condition is that (the dispatch) be based on a United  Nations decision and be carried out at the request of the United Nations.  Unless this requirement is met, it would be difficult to obtain the consensus  of our people.  </P> <P> Q: What if the U.S. effort is a failure -- and Saddam Hussein stays in Kuwait?  Is Japan content to make its own arrangements and live with Hussein in Kuwait?  </P> <P> A: Didn't the first U.N. resolution that was passed after the Aug. 2 invasion  call for the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait? Saddam Hussein used his military  forces and invaded another country and occupied it, claiming that that country  was his own territory . . . a violation of international law (that) flouts  international opinion . . . . The U.N. resolution makes clear what should be  done. We (Socialists) support that.  </P> <P> Q: Do you support a continuation of the economic sanctions against Iraq  indefinitely if Hussein does not leave Kuwait?  </P> <P> A: Yes. The fact that economic sanctions do not quickly produce results raises  difficulties. One must brace oneself for a passage of time before the effects  emerge.  </P> <P> Q: So, you see the Americans as too impatient?  </P> <P> A: I'm quite short-tempered myself. But even for as short-tempered a person as  I, . . . once you start firing . . . and get entwined in warfare, the situation  will become irretrievable . . . . Whatever happens, that absolutely must be  avoided.  </P> <P> Q: You said the United States should be patient. In exchange for American  patience, is Japan willing to contribute more money for the maintenance of U.S.  troops in Saudi Arabia?  </P> <P> A: That would pose many problems . . . . The Japanese people strongly feel that  if war occurs in the gulf, we will cross a bridge of no return . . . .  </P> <P> The United States has decided to add still more troops (but) the more troops  and the stronger the weapons deployed, the greater the danger grows.  </P> <P> As we see it, a solution should not be sought by force or by military power but  rather by peaceful means through diplomacy. That is the strong public opinion  of Japan . . . . Just because the United States has made a request, the people  find it hard to accept providing assistance for maintenance of American troops  in the gulf. And if money is to be paid for the maintenance of military forces,  Japan and the United States should have some kind of formal agreement. We don't  have such an agreement now.  </P> <P> Therefore, the people don't understand us providing, first, $1 billion, and  then $4 billion. There are many Japanese people who believe that (Prime  Minister Toshiki) Kaifu decided on $1 billion and then added another $3 billion  just because he received requests from the United States.  </P> <P> Any assistance in whatever form to military forces deployed in the gulf by the  United States should be avoided. In addition, this is a case of America  applying pressure.  </P> <P> I think Japan-U.S. relations are important. That we feel we have been pressured  and finally provided the money is a minus to Japan-U.S. relations.  </P> <P> Q: Although you called yourself short-tempered, many women -- around the world  and in Japan -- regard you as a heroine. Is that a difficult burden at times?  </P> <P> A: It's always a burden.  </P> <P> Q: How do you cope? How do your try to live up to their high expectations?  </P> <P> A: I am an easy-going person and I don't consciously take notice of their  expectations. I have made up my mind to do whatever I can . . . . Things that  can be done, I do forcefully . . . . If there are things which I cannot do, I  simply say I cannot do it . . . and explain why . . . . But when I have  promised to do something, I feel I must uphold that promise.  </P> <P> . . . . You have flattered me excessively. But if people were to embrace an  exaggerated belief that I was a heroine or had power, it would lead to them  thinking I was almighty and there was nothing I could not do. Superman exists  in movies but not in real life.  </P> <P> Q. The Socialist Party was on the verge of death when you took over as  chairwoman. The opposition won the election for the upper house of Parliament  in July, 1989, but lost the lower house election of February, 1990. However,  there was one element in both elections: tremendous gains by your party and  losses by the other opposition parties. To what do you attribute that?  </P> <P> A: There is a difference between a statesman and a politician. This is an era  in which the people are looking for statesmen . . . . Perhaps, I had a "color"  or an image that is different from the stereotyped image of politicians.  </P> <P> The more the people distrust politics, the more the old color and the old image  politicians have, the more impossible it becomes to dispel distrust. People  came to believe they could have no expectations of old-type politicians . . . .  </P> <P> Q: Does the plan by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) for  the upcoming decade say interesting things for you? What would be the "Takako  Doi Plan" for the next 10 years?  </P> <P> A: MITI's plan . . . was based on the kind of thinking that goes into  government "white papers," not on real, everyday life. It doesn't strike a true  note with the people. Recently, I have come to the conclusion that I would like  to draw up a 10-year plan.  </P> <P> In the Structural Impediments Initiative talks with the United States, Japan  committed itself to spending 430 trillion yen ($3.3 trillion) on public works.  That is a 10-year plan . . . .  </P> <P> Public works must not be carried out in the way we have done it in the past . .  . . At least 70% should be used for social welfare. In the next 10 years, the  population will grow considerably older.  </P> <P> In Japan, when you speak of public works . . . waterworks, sewage, roads . . .  become the focus. The software side gets pushed aside. It is important we not  forget human care . . . .  </P> <P> It is said that Japan is strong in economics and weak in welfare. Japan doesn't  have a consciousness of human rights proportionate to its economic power. That  criticism hurts. But it is true.  </P> <P> We must raise the level of social welfare throughout the nation . . . . A  "Basic Social Welfare Law" is absolutely necessary . . . . That should be a  10-year program.  </P> <P> In the next 10 years, internationally, we must clarify the standards for  providing official development assistance (economic aid). In a word, our ODA .  . . lacks any consideration of human rights.  </P> <P> . . . . We (also) fail to carry out follow-up investigations of the use of our  aid . . . .  </P> <P> In the past, the Filipino people came to regard Japanese ODA as having been  used to sustain the government of (the late President Ferdinand) Marcos . . . .  We (Socialists) advocated that aid should have been frozen . . . .  </P> <P> In general, I believe that economic aid should not be given to military  governments, . . . to countries involved in international disputes, to  countries whose regimes were established through military coups or to countries  where undemocratic politics are being conducted . . . . A democratic society is  important. We think economic cooperation must contribute to the people's  livelihood . . . .  </P> <P> Q: On politics at home, how soon do you think it will be before you become  prime minister? And what do you think would be the three most critical issues  you would face?  </P> <P> A: . . . We must win an election for the House of Representatives to obtain a  majority. It is difficult to foresee the possibility of that happening right  now . . . .  </P> <P> The three problems?  </P> <P> Land is a very difficult problem, along with housing . . . . Also, fiscal  problems . . . . We should rectify tax inequities . . . .  </P> <P> The most basic is political reform. With the exposure of corruption as the  trigger, the issue of "elections that don't cost money" has come to the  forefront. But it is impossible to conduct an election that doesn't cost money.  </P> <P> What we must do is create an election system in which it is impossible to use  huge sums of money . . . and that will accurately reflect the sentiments of the  voters, . . . a system that can be understood and trusted by the people . . . .  </P> <P> Internationally, since we are a member of Asia, I want to press for the  adoption of specific confidence-building measures . . . including disarmament .  . . in the Asia-Pacific region . . . .  </P> <P> Q: And vis-a-vis the United States?  </P> <P> A: Until now . . . both sides have focused on only a narrow view of just the  bilateral relationship itself. In the future, we must make more importance of  Japan-U.S. relations in the (context of the) world.  </P> <P> We must have more frank exchanges of opinions. We may have points of  insufficient understanding and misperceptions about the United States. But  among the views we hear coming from the United States, there are one-sided  opinions that don't match the conditions that exist.  </P> <P> For example, on the gulf problem, Americans say they understand our  constititution (which bans the use of force to settle international disputes).  And they go on and say they would welcome the dispatch of Japanese troops.  </P> <P> You get to the point where you want to ask, . . . "Which is it?" . . . .  </P> <P> Viewed from the United States, Japan's efforts may be insufficient. But viewed  from Japan, when the United States asks for help, we want to say, "Do you hear  our voice?"  </P> <P> Q: Do you think the government is expressing that voice so that Americans can  hear it?  </P> <P> A: That is the problem.  </P> <P> Q: If you became prime minister, wouldn't you have trouble dealing with the  U.S.-Japan Security Treaty (that the Socialist Party advocates abolishing)?  </P> <P> A: The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has changed -- because of the change in the  environment. Until now, the premise has been that the Soviet Union is the  threat and the issue was how to deal with that threat. That assumption has  disappeared.  </P> <P> The U.S.-Japan Security treaty itself must not become a threat. Strengthening  the military aspect of the treaty or dealing with threats on the premise of  confrontation should be abandoned. Japan-U.S. relations that are not founded  upon a threat but rather based on cooperation between the two countries should  be considered.  </P> <P> Military power should not get priority in our relations . . . the focus should  be on how we can ensure security and peace.  </P> <P> Q: Do you still believe that a Socialist government must get rid of the treaty?  </P> <P> A: We could not quickly cut off the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty that has been  maintained by Liberal Democratic Party governments. Change must come within the  continuity of foreign policy. Mutual agreement is important. We do not intend  to change it unilaterally.  </P> <P> Q: You are using the word, "change," not "abolish."  </P> <P> A: If it could be instantaneously abolished, that would be fine. If we tried to  abolish it suddenly, we could not achieve a consensus between us. Achieving a  mutual consensus is important. Bringing conditions to that point is vital . . .  .  </P> <P> Q. Some voices in America feel that Japanese companies carry out unfair trade  practices -- like predatory pricing. Do you think that Japanese business  practices are guiltless and that Americans are just whining and complaining?  </P> <P> A: . . . . We have no feeling that everything we are doing is perfect. We  should check and verify complaints . . . . (But) I don't think it is  constructive at all . . . for both sides to wind up dealing with problems  emotionally.  </P> <P> Q: When do you think Japan will surpass the United States in gross national  product?  </P> <P> A: I don't know. That is difficult to foretell.  </P> <P> Q: You do think it is going to happen?  </P> <P> A: If things go as they have been going (pause).  </P> <P> Fifteen years ago or 10 years ago, no one in Japan thought that the United  States would become a debtor nation and that Japan would become a creditor  nation. In the same way, when you ask about (Japan surpassing the United States  in) GNP, perhaps you can say, "maybe."  </P> <P> . . . . I am a person who experienced the immediate postwar period in Japan --  from my late teens into the early 20s, when one is most alert and sensitive.  </P> <P> America was a blindingly dazzling existence in those days. In every home, there  was a car. All Americans had homes. Roads were all over the country. There were  uncountable attractions. It was an extraordinarily dazzling sight -- especially  because, for us, building an economy was a topic for the future then. We did  not have enough food. If anyone had tried to think of today at that time -- no  way!  </P> <P> Therefore, when you ask if Japan will surpass the United States in GNP, that's  a very difficult question.  </P></p>

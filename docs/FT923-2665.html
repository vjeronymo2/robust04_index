			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (12): Farmers are worried - Fierce debate within agricultural community MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, visited Wales earlier this month and spent some time on a hill farm discussing the state of the agricultural industry. Far from winning praise for his initiative, however, Mr Major was accused by some Welsh farmers of avoiding hearing about the near-bankrupt state of the industry by visiting an unrepresentative model farm of more than 600 acres, and not a more typical Welsh hill farm of 40 to 150 acres. This sour reaction is a measure of the extent to which Welsh farmers these days feel under siege. It is not only because of the recession, though that is bad enough. Farm incomes last year, while marginally higher than 1990 were still 25 per cent down on 1989 levels. In some sectors, most notably hill farming, which accounts for some 80 per cent of Wales's land area, average incomes fell by 60 per cent to Pounds 144 a week, 56 per cent of the average industrial wage. But Welsh farmers are also becoming deeply concerned about their longer-term future. Put crudely, do they have one in a Europe now more than self-sufficient in food and determined to dismantle the marketing structures which have supported agriculture for half-a century and more? The consequences of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package, agreed by EC Farm Ministers earlier this year, are still not clear, but from Welsh agriculture's point of view, the signs are not encouraging. The long-standing threat of a Uruguay Round GATT agreement being concluded at the expense of agricultural areas, such as Wales, remains, as does the planned winding up of the statutory Milk Marketing Board (MMB), and its replacement by a voluntary co-operative. It will bring to an end a statutory marketing scheme which has been the financial backbone of many Welsh farms for over half a century. If this were not enough, many west Wales farmers are suddenly faced with losses from a totally unexpected direction - the collapse into bankruptcy of King Thomas, Lloyd Jones, a leading firm of livestock auctioneers in south west Wales. The potential impact of CAP reform has been the subject of fierce debate within Wales's agricultural community. This is because the Farmers' Union of Wales supported the principles for reform originally adopted by Mr Raymond MacSharry, the EC Commissioner for Agriculture, whereas the National Farmers' Union supported the Government's campaign of opposition. The FUW argued that MacSharry's fundamental aim of targeting EC support to those who need it most, allied with a more effective environmental support programme and more liberal social support measures, was the right approach. It could give the majority of farmers in Wales stability and a new sense of direction,' said Mr Bob Parry, the FUW President. The National Farmers' Union, on the other hand went along with Mr John Selwyn Gummer, the Minister of Agriculture's argument that the EC Commissioner's proposals would simply subsidise inefficient small producers, many of them in southern Europe, at the expense of the more productive and efficient farming enterprises in Britain. In the event, the re-election of a Conservative Government to Westminster, and the return of Mr Gummer to Brussels, meant the shape of the reform package finally agreed was more to Mr Gummer's liking than Mr MacSharry's. Even so, the dilution of the MacSharry proposals at Britain's behest is already giving rise to suggestions the reform package will neither curb surpluses, nor the cost of the CAP, and that it could soon be back to square one. East Anglia's cereal growers, for example, are due to suffer a 30 per cent cut in their guaranteed prices over the next three years, but they will be shielded from its full impact by generous compensation. WELSH farming is primarily dependent upon livestock products - sheepmeat, beef and milk - and the MacSharry proposals for discouraging output of these were also diluted during the course of the negotiations. Combine this with cheaper feeding-stuff costs - resulting from the substantial cut in cereals prices - and it is easy to foresee a return to bigger food mountains and a fresh EC crisis over the cost of agricultural support which could be potentially even more damaging to Welsh farming prospects. On the other hand, next time round, Welsh farmers battling to make a living on marginal land in what the EC euphemistically calls less-favoured areas, may have more friends and allies within the EC. The government is keen to press ahead with enlargement of the Community. This would bring within the CAP's ambit the farmers of Norway and Finland, who have a strategic and social as well as food producing role in Europe's northern extremities. The proposed winding up of the MMB is less a cause for concern than might have been the case a few years ago. Having suffered creamery closures and a number of other economic blows in recent years, Welsh dairy producers have already learned the traditional paternalism of the MMB can longer be taken for granted. Indeed, there is widespread recognition within the farming industry in Wales that it must take more responsibility for its own marketing. With active support from organisations like the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales, hardly a month seems to pass without some new Welsh food initiative, be it the development of a new cheese, a lamb product or organic foods. Another positive development is that Welsh farmers are becoming increasingly willing to accept the role of custodian of the countryside, as well as that of food producer. This has not always been the case - not many years ago, plans for creating a Cambrian Mountains National Park were dropped after they ran into strong opposition from local farmers. The Government went back to the drawing board and decided instead on a different approach, creating what were designated Environmentally Sensitive Areas in which farmers would be encouraged - and assisted financially - to maintain traditional landscapes. A few weeks ago, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary of state announced that another four areas of Wales are to be designated as ESAs within the next 12 months - the island of Anglesey, the district of Radnor in Powys, Preseli which covers a large part of Pembrokeshire, and the Clwydian hills in north Wales. With a section of Cambrian mountains and the Lleyn peninsula already designated, it means that some 24 per cent the land area of Wales is now being given ESA designation. More than 800 conservation management agreements covering a total of some 64,000 hectares have already been signed by farmers in the existing two Welsh ESAs, and the Welsh Office plans to spend Pounds 6.1m on ESA conservation agreements in 1993-94 rising to Pounds 7.8m in 1995-96. In addition, the new Countryside Council for Wales (an amalgamation of the Countryside Commission and the Nature Conservancy Council) is proposing to give the districts of Merionnydd and Dinefwr, and a large part of West Glamorgan Tir Cymen designation.</p>

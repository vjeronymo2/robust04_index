			<p>BFN     [Text] The foreign ministers of the Arab League member  states held a session in Cairo on March 26th.    The participants in the Cairo session are discussing the  cancellation of the indirect economic embargo against the  Zionist regime. The embargo includes that group of companies  and institutions which have economic and commercial deals with  the Israeli regime. The Arab states imposed the economic  sanctions since the early 1950's in the wake of recurrence of  the first war between Arabs and the Israelis. Based on the  Zionist regime officials, within this period of time Israel has  sustained over $50 billion in loss.    With the start of the Arab-Israeli peace process and the  Arab-Zionist mutual talks paving of grounds for lifting of  economic sanctions against that regime by the United States have  been further revealed. This took a more serious form with the  conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement by the Zionist regime  and the PLO. Since last September -- that is, the time when the  agreement was signed -- the U.S. pressures on Arabs for easing  the economic sanctions against Israel have been stepped up.  These pressures as well as spread of reports on some  agreements reached between some Arab states and the Zionist  regime over economic plans caused the Arab League general  secretary, 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, to declare late last year that  the Arab League will hold a session in March to discuss the  lifting of the indirect economic embargo against Israel.    In the past six months reports regarding the possibility of  cancellation of economic embargo of Israel by Arabs have  entailed various reactions among the Arab countries. Despite  the silence maintained by Arab countries, Syria, Sudan, and  Libya have shown protesting reactions towards such a  possibility. The Syrian Prime Minister Faruq al-Shar' upon  arrival in Cairo on Friday said the issue of lifting of the  Israeli sanctions by the Arabs will not be dealt with as long as  the Israeli forces have not evacuated the occupied lands and a  Palestinian country is not established.    Political observers assess these comments which in fact  indicate serious posturing toward the Arab League session in  Cairo today as a kind of taking of position by that group of  Arab states which are not satisfied with the Arab-Israeli peace  process. However, in line of their current regional situation  it is not easy to predict whether this might leave an impact on  decision-making of the Cairo session or not.</p>

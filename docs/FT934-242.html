			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Two charged over NY bombings An estranged husband was charged yesterday with carrying out a mail bomb campaign against his wife's family - killing her mother, sister, stepfather and two others with bombs sent to six different places, Reuter reports from Rochester. The wife, who was questioned by police, did not receive a bomb in the blitz for which a second man was also charged. News of the arrests and that the targets were all from the same family calmed nerves over a wide area of northern New York state where residents had earlier reported dozens of suspicious packages. Prosecutors announced the arrests 24 hours after the six parcel bombs were sent out to members of the Fowler family in the Buffalo and Rochester areas early on Tuesday evening. Police sources said one of the men arrested was the estranged husband of a member of the family and that the second man was his friend. Beside the five deaths two people were injured in the attacks. Two packages were disarmed before they could explode.</p>

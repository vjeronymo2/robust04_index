			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Washington, May 24 KYODO -- President Bill  Clinton hailed the breakthrough announced Tuesday [24 May] in  bilateral trade talks with Japan as "very good news" and a "big  plus" to bilateral ties.    Clinton described the relationship between the United States  and Japan as "an important part of our long-term strategy for  peace and stability and democracy in Asia."    "I think the break there with the negotiations was a big  plus," Clinton told reporters at a photo session with Latvian  President Guntis Ulmanis.    The trade accord, hammered out during a post-midnight  session  Tuesday after four days of intense negotiations, commits the two  countries to resume "framework" talks on widening access of  foreign goods to the Japanese market.    The trade talks, held under the so-called "framework" accord  the two countries concluded in July last year, have been stalled  since they collapsed in February.    Clinton said he was "very encouraged" after talking with  Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on the telephone Tuesday  morning.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Clinton and  Hata  agreed, during the 14-minute phone conversation, the new  agreement to restart the framework talks "shows that they can  resolve issues and strengthen the relationship between the two  countries."

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Strong advance at Anglo American Shrewd gold hedging and improved cost control enabled Anglo American's gold mines to lift after-tax profit to R582.2m (Dollars 171.2m) in the three months to December, from R498.6m the previous quarter. In the December 1992 quarter, the mines reported after-tax profit of R482.1m. Quarterly gold output edged forward to 66,115kg from 65,773kg. The average gold price received improved to R39,793 a kg from R39,320 a kg, although it remained below the average spot price of R40,200. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman, said the outlook for gold was particularly uncertain, with the price likely to range from Dollars 360 to Dollars 430 an ounce in 1994. He said the belief that a collapse in share prices would be good for gold no longer held true, because it was high price-to-earnings ratios on Wall Street which had tempted fund managers to invest in gold in 1993. Any retreat in equities might trigger a fall in gold prices, as stock markets became more attractive for investors. The mines' average working costs rose only 1 per cent to R29,358 after they deteriorated by 7 per cent in the previous quarter. Seasonal fluctuations contributed to a sharp rise in capital spending, to R314.9m from R233.6m. Mines in the Transvaal declared final dividends for the year to December 31, which demonstrated the extent to which shareholders gained from last year's rally in bullion prices. Vaal Reefs, the group's most profitable mine, declared a 23 per cent improved total dividend of R13.70 a share against R11.10 in 1992, while Western Deep Levels' total payout surged more than 80 per cent, to R5.60. Vaal Reefs' south division hit 'abnormally' good patches of ground which, with a tax rebate, was partly behind the jump in after-tax income, to R217.5m from R174.9m. Western Deep Level achieved its highest gold output since 1980, producing 11,210kg of gold. Freegold turned in a flat performance, but re-organising underground operations at Elandsrand knocked productivity and pushed up costs. Northam Platinum, the struggling young platinum producer owned by Gold Fields of South Africa, reported a R58m operating loss in the half-year to December 31, against a loss of R50.7m in year to June 30.</p>

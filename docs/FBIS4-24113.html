			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 23 (AFP) -- Hundreds of youths chanting  anti-government slogans and calling for the immediate release of  Chief Moshood Abiola late Thursday [23 June] held a peaceful  march along major streets in the commercial nerve-centre of  Lagos.    They carried placards reading "release Abiola our president  now," "Abacha must go," and "away with military regime."    The police did not disrupt the march, which was the first  physical reaction to the arrest of Chief Abiola in the morning  hours of Thursday.</p>

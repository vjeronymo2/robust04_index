In an economic booklet entitled "Quite Frankly," Ciller has  outlined her economic work and said that the Public Economic  Enterprises deficit totaled 60 trillion Turkish lira in 1993.  According to Ciller, the Social Insurance Organization incurred  a deficit of 25 trillion and the Social Security Association for  Tradesmen, Artisans, and Independent Workers a deficit of 6  trillion in 1993. While the annual loss incurred by the  Agricultural Unions totaled 30 trillion, the Zonguldak Coal  Mines Establishment incurred a loss of 22 trillion. Some 8  trillion was lost because of a reduction in operations and 14  trillion due to the payment of wages.    Ciller's booklet said the credits that were given to the AU  were used for employment, capital spending for operational  purposes, and other expenses. But the unions failed to pay  their debts. The booklet recalled that the local  administrations can allocate only 30 percent of their budgets to  personnel and said that several local administrations have been  unable to meet their personnel's needs even by using all their  budget funds. It said: "That negative condition will be  removed through the reforms that will be effected in the local  administrations."    Ciller recalled that the budget deficit was 33 trillion  Turkish lira in 1990 and stressed that the deficit was expected  to rise to 192 trillion in 1994. She asserted: "The budget  deficit has increased because of the gradually increasing  interest payments since 1986, payment of high wages and salaries  since 1989, failure to solve the structural problems in the PEE  and social insurance organizations, and inefficiency in  privatization."</p>

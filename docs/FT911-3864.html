			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Observer: Top of the bill Forget the opening of Miss Saigon on Broadway. It will be thoroughly upstaged by this year's biggest first night on October 12, bringing the first performance of John Godber's comedy Happy Families at the Caxton Theatre in Grimsby . . . the Questor's in Ealing . . . the Progress, Reading . . . not to mention 47 more. The whole lot are building their autumn season of amateur theatricals around the play, thanks to what used to be called British Telecom which has extended its arts sponsorship into the cut-throat world of amateur dramatics. Sponsors usually avoid amateurs like the plague. But when consultant James Cook proposed the commissioning of a new play for simultaneous performances by the 64-strong Little Theatre Guild, BT saw the PR possibilities. The idea has been taken up by 50 members of the guild, which represents the top league of Britain's 12,000 theatrical groups. In July all the directors involved will gather at the BT Training Centre to be guided by Godber, who has written Happy Families with amateurs in mind - a cast of a dozen, heavily weighted towards women. The event will cost BT around Pounds 50,000, and be repeated in two years time, perhaps with Alan Ayckbourn as the playwright in charge. The sponsor will use the first nights for entertaining customers. You have been warned.</p>

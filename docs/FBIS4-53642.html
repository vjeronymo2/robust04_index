			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Surveillance Violating Human Rights" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  puppets' intelligence and surveillance against the dissidents  come under fire in NODONG SINMUN today.    It was exposed in Pusan a few days ago that the puppet  police  had blacklisted and kept under surveillance several dozen  persons of dissident origin who were detained by the puppet  authorities on "charges" of involvement in the Kwangju popular  uprising and other movements for democracy under the former  military dictatorial regimes and are hired at work sites after  their release.    This proves that the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique continues  resorting to the vicious intelligence and surveillance which  were employed by the preceding military dictators as a means of  maintaining their military fascist regimes, abandoning the  "commitments" to "respect of human rights" and "stop to  intelligence and surveillance", which he made when he was taking  office.    This also shows that although the traitor Kim Yong-sam  declared he reassessed the Kwangju popular uprising as "a  movement for democracy", he still brands participants in the  uprising as "mobs" and continuously suppresses them overtly and  covertly.    The analyst points out:    The South Korean students and people are now calling for the  overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique and an immediate  dismantling of the "Security Planning Board", "secret affairs  command", and the puppet police, legacies of the military  dictatorial regimes, and other fascist repressive machines.    Human rights violation by the "civilian regime" must be  discontinued at once and all the repressive tools be dismantled  unconditionally as demanded by the South Korean people. If the  Kim Yong-sam clique persists in treacheries, ignoring the  demands of the popular masses, it will precipitate its own  destruction.</p>

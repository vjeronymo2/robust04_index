			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Swedish opposition in pledge to stabilise debt Sweden's opposition Social Democratic party last night pledged to stabilise the country's mounting state debt during the next four-year government term, outlining for the first time a detailed programme of tax increases and spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit. 'The goal is unambiguous,' said Mr Ingvar Carlsson, party leader. 'The budget deficit will be reduced and the state debt stabilised during the mandate period. We will not accept cutting the deficit or the debt through increased inflation.' The Social Democrats hold a clear lead in the opinion polls ahead of next month's general election and had been under strong pressure from the financial markets to publish a credible fiscal plan. Earlier this week, the Swedish krona fell to record lows against the D-Mark and long-term interest rates surged over 12 per cent when the party suggested it would not produce a detailed programme before the poll. Mr Goran Persson, shadow finance minister, responded by presenting proposals to strengthen the budget by SKr61bn (Pounds 5.06bn) during the new government's term. The election manifesto had been delayed until after the markets closed yesterday for fear of sparking further turbulence. The plan is more detailed but less ambitious than the programme of SKr101bn savings by 1999 proposed by Prime Minister Carl Bildt's centre-right coalition to tackle a deficit which in the last budget year reached more than SKr200bn, 13 per cent of gross national product. It also emphasises tax increases more than the government. Mr Persson said the Social Democrats would take tougher measures if a fall in unemployment, currently around 14 per cent, and higher growth did not materialise to help slim the deficit. The Social Democratic plan includes an increase in revenues of SKr27.4bn from higher taxes. Most would come from higher health insurance contributions by ordinary taxpayers, producing extra revenues of SKr15bn. The rest is made up of higher marginal taxes for high earners, increased wealth and capital taxes and the restoration of taxes on dividends, a measure which was scrapped by Mr Bildt's government. The party plans savings in public spending - which at present accounts for 70 per cent of GNP - of SKr33.6bn through trimming welfare provisions such as some childcare benefits. SKr19bn of these savings is projected to come through lower indexation and interest costs. The Social Democrats, trying to balance the demands of their big constituency in the public sector and the urgent need to stem a public debt soon to account for more than 100 per cent of GNP, will be hoping their proposals will calm the markets on Monday. But last night both Mr Bildt and the Federation of Swedish Industries said the plan contained too many tax increases and too few spending cuts.</p>

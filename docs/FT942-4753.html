			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Anglian Water It is staggering that nearly five years after privatisation Anglian Water can cut one-in-five jobs from its utility business. Studies conducted by Ofwat, the industry regulator, do not show Anglian to be especially inefficient. Yesterday's Pounds 60m restructuring charge therefore hints at what might be achieved elsewhere. The promised Pounds 20m annual saving amounts to around 7 per cent of Anglian's operating costs in water and sewerage. On that basis, it looks well placed to beat all but the most onerous efficiency targets set by the regulator for the second half of the decade. Still, it is curious that Anglian should show its hand before Ofwat has finalised its targets for 1995-2000. The company must have reasoned that Ofwat is far enough down the road not to indulge in last minute tinkering. To do so would rob management of the incentive to cut costs, which is precisely what the system of price cap regulation is supposed to deliver. If Ofwat does keep its side of the regulatory bargain, though, the outlook for dividend growth may be better than the equity market has assumed. The savings promised by Anglian are significant in relation to the Pounds 67m annual cost of its dividend. Until Ofwat announces price limits and efficiency targets on July 28, it would be unwise to get carried away. Neither is it clear that all water companies have the management determination to push through similarly deep cuts. If the regulator allows a reasonable proportion of such savings to flow through to shareholders, though, the sector may have been oversold.</p>

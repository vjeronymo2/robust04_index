			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpts] Nairobi, May 15 (AFP) -- Fighting between  Rwandan rebels and government forces intensified Sunday [15 May]  in several districts of Kigali and in towns across the country,  a UN spokesman in the capital said. Abdul Kabia, contacted by  telephone from Nairobi, reported heavy clashes between the  Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and government troops in the  eastern and southeastern suburbs of Remera and Kicukiro. Mortar  shells also fell in the centre of the capital, he said.    Fighting between the Tutsi-led RPF and the Hutu-majority  government side was also raging in Ruhengeri, a northwest town  still held by the regular army, and at Nkumba further to the  north, Kabia said. Clashes were also reported at Bugesera,  south of Kigali.    The RPF claimed on Friday it had seized control of half the  country. [passage omitted]    Although the capital's streets are no longer littered with  corpses, observers say that civilians trapped there now face a  war of attrition where weapons, rather than political dialogue,  will have the ultimate say.    General Romeo Dallaire, head of the UN assistance mission in  Rwanda, said the RPF, made up of soldiers trained in guerrilla  warfare, realizes it stands to lose too much in an all-out  assault on Kigali and has thus adopted a tactic of "isolation,  harassment and infiltration." He said that by progressively  wearing down their enemies, the rebels, who control large chunks  of the northern and eastern parts of the country, hope to be  able to tighten their stranglehold around Kigali by gaining  ground from the southeast before launching a final assault.    The RPF has been ransacking military bases, fighting for  control of the road leading to the capital's airport, and  lobbing mortars on the city centre where officials building are  located. But some of the mortars, either accidentally or  intentionally, have fallen on city streets or refugee centres,  terrorising civilians already struggling to survive on little  water and food.    Meanwhile Dallaire is trying to broker a ceasefire among the  warring parties while the UN Security Council is to vote next  week on sending UN reinforcements to the war-ravaged country.    The UN High Commissioner for Human Right, Jose Ayala Lasso,  who visited Kigali last week, made an impassioned plea Friday  for the world to end the "unimaginable human tragedy" in Rwanda.  "The world must do something to halt this violence," Ayala said.</p>

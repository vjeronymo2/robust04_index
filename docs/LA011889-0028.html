			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOUD OVER MEESE  </P> <P> President Reagan's loyalty to an old friend has blinded him to the ethical  failings of his former attorney general, Edwin Meese III, and to the shame that  Meese brought on the Justice Department. Instead of commending the department's  Office of Professional Responsibility for its thorough investigation of the man  who once was the nation's highest law-enforcement officer, Reagan denounced the  report as "unnecessary and unwarranted," the work of Meese's "political  enemies."  </P> <P> Oh? In fact, the report is the work of Michael E. Shaheen Jr., a career Justice  Department lawyer who has headed the Office of Professional Responsibility  since its inception in 1975. He is the expert on the department's own ethical  guidelines as well as the 1965 executive order that commands all federal  employees to refrain from activities that would shake Americans' confidence in  government integrity. So Shaheen speaks with some authority when he says that  Meese engaged in "conduct which should not be tolerated of any government  employee, especially not the attorney general."  </P> <P> The Office of Professional Responsibility is the third investigative body to  criticize the former attorney general -- more proof, if any were needed, of the  gravity of Meese's offenses. Its report contains no bombshells, simply more  details about how Meese used his influence to boost the business concerns of E.  Robert Wallach, failed to report income to the Internal Revenue Service and  made decisions about telecommunications while owning telephone stock -- all in  violation of established ethical standards. Meese claimed total vindicaton last  summer when independent counsel James C. McKay concluded that he had broken  conflict-of-interest and tax laws but decided not to indict him. Shaheen's  report, however, points out what should have been evident to Meese -- that  escaping indictment is not the same as vindication. "The American public is  entitled to both the appearance and the reality of impartial, honest  government," the report said. Thus it dispatched "the claims by Mr. Meese that  the appropriate standard for official behavior is whether an independent  counsel seeks an official's indictment."  </P> <P> None of this apparently matters to Meese, now happily working for a foundation,  or to the President, dreaming of his retirement, just two days away, in  California. On ethical questions, neither seems educable. But the report of the  Office of Professional Responsibility should stand as a reminder to future  Administrations that official sleaziness will be exposed and that no one, not  even the President's old friends, is above the law.  </P></p>

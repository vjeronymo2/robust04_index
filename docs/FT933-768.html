			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Fujimori gets in way of his reform message: The authoritarian style of Peru's president PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori of Peru is on the campaign trail. Three years into his five-year term, Mr Fujimori has been criss-crossing the country seeking support for a new constitution to be put to a national referendum on October 31. A recent visit to Juliaca, a town high in the Andes near Lake Titicaca, is typical of his campaigning style. He opened a road, gave away computers to a school, donated incubators to the hospital. He and his aides frantically distributed hundreds of calendars carrying his picture. The new constitution is seeking to legitimise Mr Fujimori's usurping of the 1979 constitution in April last year, when he dissolved congress. In an interview in Lima, he described its aim as a 'fundamental reform, without which we would continue to suffer political instability'. It was 'seeking a more efficient congress and a judiciary less dependent on political party interests, less subject to manipulation and corruption'. Furthermore, his government's economic reforms - in particular, its radical privatisation programme now apparently moving ahead in earnest - would be legitimised by the referendum. It also includes controversial proposals for the re-introduction of the death penalty - and to allow the election of a president for a second consecutive term. Mr Fujimori denies that he is much concerned with re-election: 'I've no ambition at all to follow this with another period in office. I don't have this obsession. What interests me is to put in place the steps for development and to consolidate all the reforms that have been made. This consolidation will take place in the period until 1995.' Many Peruvians are sceptical. His speeches to his Andean Indian audience in Juliaca echoed his successful 1990 presidential campaign, which allowed him to come from nowhere to victory in little over three weeks. Mr Fujimori, whose parents emigrated from Japan, contrasted himself to 'traditional politicians' who spent their time 'drinking little whiskies at little cocktail parties in Lima'. Mr Fujimori defies easy pigeon-holing. He is defined more by what he is not  -a member of the narrow Spanish-descended elite in the capital - than by what he is. He has pushed through aspects of an orthodox economic policy and is backing privatisation, but he is no liberal: the way he distributes gifts in places such as Juliaca preserves the illusion of the the state as the ultimate source of wealth in the country. Mr Fujimori's apparent personal austerity and his solitary image stand in contrast to the despised traditional politicians with their reputations for high living and corruption. His popularity is based on the fact that he is credited with taming, for now at least, Peru's two main sources of instability during the 1980s - terrorism and hyperinflation. Yet, some in Lima believe Mr Fujimori is less of a break with the past than he makes out. Mr Hernando de Soto, the Lima-based economist and entrepreneur, says the president is right to criticise Peru's political party leadership for being out of touch with ordinary Peruvians. Yet he adds: 'Despite his critical rhetoric of the traditional parties, Fujimori is essentially a continuation of the past.' The worry he and others have is centred on the authoritarian style of Mr Fujimori's government. Mr Fujimori has centralised power since he took office, so that even the previous rudimentary checks on executive power have been reduced. His suspension of the constitution on April 5 1992 underlined a lack of interest in the rule of law. The president does not deny that he wields power in a highly personalised way: 'I think most people want a strong executive power which exercises its mandate to the full, that uses all its faculties to achieve important objectives. Here there is a chairman of the board or a general manager who controls, supervises, prosecutes and tries to ensure things go well.' Mr Fujimori has also given the impression that he is not too keen on competition: those who are in danger of becoming too prominent or popular are moved aside. The economy minister for 23 months, Mr Carlos Bolona, was sacked at the start of the year. Mr Ketin Vidal, the man who captured Abimael Guzman - who as the head of the Maoist guerrilla group, Shining Path, was Peru's most wanted man  - and is the nearest thing Peru has to a national hero, has been kicked upstairs to a less prominent position. Mr Fujimori, who is due to address the UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, emphasises the 'pragmatism' of his government, which worries those who believe his commitment to economic reform will remain only as long as he is popular. But he denies that his pragmatism means he only seeks short-term solutions. Mr Bolona says: 'Fujimori, like most politicians, likes to appropriate the windfalls - such as the capture of Guzman and the improvement in the economy  -for himself. Having said that we must acknowledge that he has had the will to make and carry through on decisions.' Most opinion polls - often not very reliable in Peru - predict a majority will favour the proposed constitution; Mr Fujimori will be severely weakened if it does not. But what the president really needs is a ringing endorsement. A narrow majority will do little to help him and may unsettle foreign investors, who generally favour most of the proposed constitution's economic provisions. Without a big majority, the risk is that the new charter would be seen as the Fujimori constitution, with a shelf life only as long as his term of office.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Dumping Gatt The US has consistently told its partners in the Uruguay Round that it would rather reach no agreement at all than reach a bad agreement. Yet as the negotiations reach their climax in Geneva, it is beginning to look as if a bad agreement is exactly what is in prospect - thanks, ironically, to a barrage of last-minute demands by the American administration. For all the progress made by the US and European Union in settling their differences in recent days, it is a stiff enough challenge to produce a universally acceptable agreement by the deadline of December 15. Now the task looks like being further complicated by controversy over Washington's insistence on a significant weakening of multilateral restraints on its ability to impose anti-dumping duties. More than that: if the other Gatt parties bow to the US demands, they might vitiate many of the gains that the Uruguay Round was supposed to yield. Anti-dumping actions - against imports alleged to be sold at below cost - are a poison eating away at the liberal trading system, and the US has long been the principal, though by no means the only, culprit. The calculations by which goods are found to have been dumped are often highly questionable, and dumping actions are less often a just redress than a particularly insidious form of protectionism. One of the more laudable features of the Gatt text now being finalised - the so-called Dunkel draft - was its attempt to tighten the rules regulating how anti-dumping actions could be brought. What the US seems intent on is a wholesale reversal of that effort. Not only has it demanded the abandonment or dilution of all the Dunkel restrictions; it has made further proposals that would actually make it easier for aggrieved parties - including trade unions - to bring anti-dumping actions. To avoid the perceived danger of circumvention, it wants the power to impose duties on 'like goods' from third countries without further investigation. It wants to be able to impose duties indefinitely, rather than having to prove dumping afresh after five years. It rejects rules allowing exporters to charge below-cost prices for a limited start-up period. It objects to Gatt panels re-evaluating evidence in anti-dumping cases. Small wonder that many exporting nations who feel victimised by existing US rules are up in arms. If its proposals were implemented to the letter, the already easy task of 'proving' dumping would be rendered almost automatic, thus producing the mercantile equivalent of a witch hunt. And where the US led, others - especially the EU, under pressure from France to stiffen its own anti-dumping regime - would follow. Rather than undermining the potential achievements of the Round, the US should be taking the lead in curbing anti-dumping. If it presses its current demands, it risks being held responsible either for failure or for an agreement that would be a lot less worthwhile.</p>

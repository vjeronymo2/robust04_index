			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE BRIDGE TOLL  </P> <P> On Dec. 31, you carried a commentary written by the mayor of Coronado, Mary  Herron, which dealt with the problems of the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge. I  want you to know that the message by Mary Herron does not speak for all the  residents of Coronado.  </P> <P> The mayor talks of reducing the traffic in Coronado by the use of any mode of  transportation except the single-occupancy auto. She also speaks of the tourist  industry preference for discounting the present toll. What was not said was  that, for several months, there has been a "car pool" lane on the bridge that  allows cars with two or more persons, buses and motorcycles to cross the bridge  without paying any toll. Therefore, most tourist traffic can use this benefit.  </P> <P> Many of the Coronado residents must still make their way to the San Diego side  in order to make their daily wage. In many cases, this involves the use of  single-occupancy cars because car-pooling is difficult, if not impossible, to  arrange.  </P> <P> It should be noted that these residents are for the most part traveling in the  opposite direction of the heaviest traffic. Yet we must pay the toll each and  every day. It seems that the mayor is most interested in ensuring that the toll  continue to provide bridge maintenance and for the ever-illusive alternative  transportation system.  </P> <P> I submit that the car-pool lane is an excellent means of moving the vast number  of cars through the toll plaza, but is a poor way to reduce the number of cars  on Coronado's streets. Therefore, I would propose that the car-pool lane be  limited to the high-traffic periods (for the most part, early morning) and all  vehicles pay a reduced toll at other times. In this manner, the monies  necessary for bridge maintenance could be generated by all travelers, not just  the people who cannot find another person to transport.  </P> <P> I would also hope that some of the revenue generated would provide some measure  of control of the traffic along the few streets that carry such a high  percentage of the commuter traffic. During much of the day, it is difficult and  dangerous to cross such streets as 3rd and 4th. I would also hope that the  mayor would instruct the Police Department to enforce the speed limit on all  vehicles. This would include buses and trucks. Mayor Herron observe the speed  that some of these vehicles use on these streets. It is frightening.  </P> <P> The headline, "Coronado Is Still Willing to Pay the Toll" is misleading. It  leaves the impression that Coronado wants the toll the way it is. The toll  needs to be rethought and the residents of Coronado allowed to fully express  themselves on the way it is applied, or, I should say, misapplied.  </P> <P> JACK A.

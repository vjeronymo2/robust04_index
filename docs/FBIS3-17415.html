He told a meeting  at the Moscow Institute of International Relations that behind  those rumors was the wish to present the president and his  people as a nest of vipers and make room for the arrival of new  people.    Shakhray believes that current political life is defined by  a  clash between the economic and political elites, above all  between the Moscow, regional and industrial elites. Moreover,  the regional and industrial elites seem to have united in the  struggle against the Moscow elite which, he said, has  concentrated 702000070040f Russia's capital in Moscow banks.    Also, there are clashes between so-called speculative  bourgeoisie which exports Russian raw materials, and national  bourgeoisie which concentrates on Russian industry. Both of  these elites are opposed to one another, which is extremely  dangerous, too, said Shakhray.    He stated that the Party of Russian Unity and Concord was  among the initiators of the State Duma's resolution on political  amnesty.    He believes that the amnesty prevented a strong clash  between  the elites in April and May. Society has been given a breather  at least until next autumn, said Shakhray.    Speaking about the next presidential elections, Shakhray  said  that he would not run for presidency.</p>

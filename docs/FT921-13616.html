			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Councils may face challenge over sick-pay schemes LOCAL government employers will almost certainly have to introduce sick-pay schemes for the large number of mainly female, part-time workers earning less than Pounds 52 a week, as a result of European Community equal pay legislation. Mr Stephen Bubb, assistant secretary of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said yesterday that the AMA is concerned that it may not be treating part-time workers fairly and that it may also be falling foul of EC legislation. Almost 70 per cent of the 800,000 local government manual workers are part-timers and a large number of them fall below Pounds 52 a week. Having to provide sick-pay for several hundred thousand workers who were previously excluded could significantly increase pay bills. Mr Bubb said it was difficult to quantify how many workers would be affected by an extension of sick-pay schemes but the equality audit being conducted by employers and unions would probably provide an answer. The exclusion of part-time workers from sick-pay and other benefits is likely to be a main theme of this year's local government manual worker negotiations. A local government employers' consultation paper, to be distributed this week, says that the manual workers' interest is likely to shift to equality issues in this year's negotiations. 'They can be expected in particular to pursue the position of part-timers' conditions of service,' says the paper. It continues: 'Already there are indications of concerted union efforts, through industrial tribunal references, to have the national agreement's effective exclusion from occupational sick-pay of part-time manual workers earning less than Pounds 52 a week declared illegal'. Underlining that point the National Union of Public Employees yesterday launched a test case at Leeds Industrial Tribunal on behalf of 1,000 school meals staff employed by North Yorkshire County Council. Nupe said that following competitive tendering of the school meals service the council dismissed all its staff and offered them back their jobs on lower rates of pay, reduced holidays and little or no sick-pay. Nupe is challenging the action under British and European equal pay laws. The unions said that the women had been treated differently from groups of male workers, such as Highways Maintenance, who were also subject to competitive tendering laws. Union leaders at Ford New Holland, the tractor maker owned by Ford and Fiat, will meet this morning to consider whether to order industrial action after the company said it would not increase a three-year pay deal including a 4 per cent rise in the first year from last November. It warned management yesterday of the possibility of one or two-day strikes.</p>

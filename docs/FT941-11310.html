			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Rubbermaid rises 15% in fourth quarter Rubbermaid, the US household goods company named America's 'most admired company' by Fortune magazine last month, yesterday reported a 15 per cent increase in net profits to Dollars 50.8m for the fourth quarter. The company also reported a 15 per cent increase in earnings for the full year, taking net income to Dollars 211.4m and maintaining the company's long-standing record of delivering annual earnings growth of around that level. Earnings per share were 14 per cent ahead for the quarter at 32 cents and 15 per cent ahead for the year at Dollars 1.32, excluding a charge in the previous year for accounting changes. On Wall Street, Rubbermaid shares closed up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 31 5/8 . Rubbermaid won its 'most admired company' accolade in a Fortune survey of 10,000 senior executives, outside directors and financial analysts. The magazine cited Rubbermaid's record of innovation in the manufacture of otherwise mundane goods like dustpans, dish drainers and plastic storage crates. Mr Wolfgang Schmitt, chairman and chief executive, said record introductions of innovative products were one of the main factors behind a 9 per cent growth in turnover to Dollars 472.9m for the quarter and to Dollars 1.96bn for the year. All the increase in turnover had resulted from volume growth, Mr Schmitt said, because productivity gains and stable resin costs had produced cost savings that allowed the company to keep prices flat. Mr Schmitt said sales growth had been helped by strong performances from the home products division and the Little Tikes toys division. Specialty products and commercial products had also shown improvements and the office products division had continued its recovery. He said he looked forward to another record performance in 1994 in spite of the slow pace of growth in the world economy.</p>

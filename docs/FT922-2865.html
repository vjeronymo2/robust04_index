			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Letter: Example not to follow Sir, Is the debate on corporate governance, and the need for non-executive directors, in danger of becoming too theoretical and failing to observe reality? The companies that have over the years had the greatest number of non-executive directors have been the banks and the insurance companies. It would not seem that this is an example necessarily to be followed. Peter O M Roger, 36 Bonfield Street, Glasgow G2 1NA</p>

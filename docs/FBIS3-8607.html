			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We want this to become the beginning of our  relations between Russia and Poland, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], said  about his visit to Poland.    [Andrzej Kruszynski] Speaking at the deliberations of the  Self-Defense National Front, at whose leader's, Janusz  Bryczkowski's, invitation Zhirinovskiy came to Poland, the  Russian politician sent a message to Polish politicians saying  that Poland can have in Russia a real help in the implementation  of its national interests. Denying all interference in the  internal affairs of our country, the main body of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's address was aimed at convincing the Poles about  the benefits ensuing from close economic and political ties of  the whole Slavonic commonwealth, not excluding a military  treaty. Such a commonwealth can become the greatest power in  the world, the Russian politician added.    There were also anti-Western accents in his address. In  Zhirinovskiy's opinion, the West would be happy to see enmity  amongst the Slavs. This is Andrzej Kruszynski speaking for the  First Program of Polish Radio.</p>

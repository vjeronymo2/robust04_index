			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Extra tests plan worries teachers TEACHERS and educationalists yesterday were critical of the suggestion by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, that five-year-olds should be tested in schools. Mr Patten said on the Sky News Target programme on Tuesday: 'If teachers are worried that children are coming in at rising five at different levels, different backgrounds and the rest of it - and it is therefore very difficult to judge their progress at seven - what we need is something very simple to measure what their standards are when they enter school.' Under the national curriculum in England and Wales children must be tested at the ages of seven, 11, 14 and 16, but boycotts by teachers meant very few children took the tests this year. Mrs Pat Partington, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: 'If the tests were anything like the tests we now have for seven-year-olds they would be even more inappropriate for five-year-olds. I just can't imagine for the majority of children that standardised tests would be appropriate.' Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said: 'If children are tested at five years old there's a real danger that they will be labelled for life, and with a wholly inappropriate label.' The Conservative-controlled London borough of Wandsworth said it supported the idea, and had set tests for five-year-olds for the last two years. The government is speeding up the process of devolving budgets from local education authorities to schools in England. Mr Eric Forth, schools minister, said authorities would be obliged to devolve at least 90 per cent of potential school budgets to schools by April 1 1995 - one year later for inner London boroughs. He said this would result in 'at least another Pounds 300m' being transferred from education authorities to schools. Potential school budgets will be redefined, so that they do not include school meals, transport to school, premature retirement compensation costs, and psychology and welfare services. A new 'definitive' framework for the local management of schools is expected in the autumn. The Association of County Councils said the new deadlines could be met without difficulty.</p>

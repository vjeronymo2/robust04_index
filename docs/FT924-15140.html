			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Tea A good demand prevailed reports the Tea Broker's Association. Bright liquoring and Coloury Assams were often 5p to 10p dearer, with dusts a better feature. Plainest types, however, tended easier and Bangladesh teas saw limited enquiry. Best East Africans were irregular with quality while mediums ruled fully firm with selected lines dearer and dusts much stronger than of late. Plainest sorts moved lower. Offshore teas were about steady. The highest price realised this week was 221p for an Assam. Price indications for the week: Quality 155p nom, good medium 135p, medium 126p, low medium 83p,</p>

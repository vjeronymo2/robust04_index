			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, the Iranian deputy foreign  minister for Asia and Pacific affairs who travelled to Turkey in  order to convey the Iranian president Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani's  verbal message to the Turkish president, Mr. Suleyman Demirel,  returned to Tehran at the end of his one day mission on Tuesday.    During the Iranian political envoy's meeting with the  Turkish  president, the two sides exchanged views on issues related to  northern Iraq, bilateral, politico-economic ties and Mr.  Demirel's forthcoming visit to Tehran in mid-summer.    During his brief stay in Ankara, the Iranian deputy foreign  minister for Asia and Pacific affairs also called on the Turkish  foreign minister and the two sides focused their discussion on  bilateral issues.    Iran and Turkey have been exchanging views through the  visits  of their diplomatic delegations to the two countries during the  past year and the level of the delegations ranged from deputy  minister to first vice president level according to the  significance of the issues under discussion.    The Turkish president's forthcoming visit, if it  materializes, can be considered as the climax of such  counselling since the new world conditions, such as the White  House evolved new world order and the U.S. President's efforts  aimed at spreading the same and imposing the wrong model on the  rest of the world, as well as the emergence of the Central Asian  republics and Iran's strategic geopolitical role in the region,  have made ever greater understanding and closeness between Iran  and Turkey inevitable.    This is significant when the critical situation in northern  Iraq, which apparently claims to have a kind of independence,  can actually be a bitter and critical beginning or a political  test for the division of countries in the region. In view of  the significance of the issue and not withstanding the two  countries' efforts for establishing peace and security on the  joint border, events related to northern Iraq have always been  on the agenda of Iran-Turkey talks. This is so because the  continuation of the situation not only means greater instability  in northern Iraq but it can also create crises for Iraq's  neighbors: Iran, Turkey, and Syria.    There is no doubt that the ongoing crisis in northern Iraq  is  largely the outcome of the strategic blunders committed by the  officials of that country during the early nineties.    But the vigilant and farsighted manner in which Iraq's  neighbors deal with the current situation in that country can  level the way for the return of durable peace to the region and  discard domination seeking powers' justification for the  presence of alien troops in this geographical boundary.</p>

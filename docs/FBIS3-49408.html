			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "Powerful Son of a Powerful </F> Father"]    [Excerpt] After the reconstruction of the Croatian  security and intelligence services in November this year [1993],  foreigners residing in Croatia for very particular  (surveillance) purposes noted the following questions in their  operational diaries: Considering the size of Croatia, does it  need so many intelligence services, which creates unnecessary  duplication in civilian and military structures? Is this  organization of services, which is actually inert and bulky, a  reflection of the democratic face of the Croatian authorities,  or is this nevertheless the seamy side of a regime that displays  all the hallmarks of a police state?  <H5>  The Number of Services Is Not Too High </H5>   Although it would be interesting to see what the foreign  intelligence officers wrote in their reports in reply to the  questions they asked, their opinion, for the time being, is not  available for public scrutiny, not even in countries from which  they originate. We will, therefore, attempt to supply some  answers on our own and dispel at least some of the mystification  about the regrouping of the Croatian intelligence and security  apparatus.    In the past three years, Croatia as a sovereign country, in  addition to the army, has also created its own police force, as  well as the security services without which no independent  country in the world can function. Considering that Croatia is  still involved in a very complex conflict with Serbia and local  rebel Serbs, and is significantly involved in the war still  raging in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the number of Croatian  intelligence services is not too high.    However, something else is more important in this matter. In  countries with a developed intelligence and security apparatus  and parliamentary democracy, it is very important who controls  the entire system, whether it has 500 or 20,000 intelligence  officers and security clerks. Specialized parliamentary  commissions and committees can definitely not do this. They  only serve as a kind of occasional democratic inspection.  Consequently, within an intelligence system, there is always an  internal watch dog, taken from that walk of life and appointed  as main supervisor, that is, the controller of all the  intelligence and security agencies. In Croatia, after Manolic's  official era, the HIS [Croatian Information Service] had that  function, and not Sarinic's UNS [Office for National Security]  (an advisory body to the Croatian president).    What disturbs the world is that Miroslav Tudjman, the son of  Franjo Tudjman, has been appointed head of the HIS. That is  usually seen in undemocratic political systems, Arabian  sheikdoms, or in openly autocratic dictatorial regimes. In  Syria, President Assad appointed his brother controller of all  the civilian and military intelligence and counterintelligence  services and he has held that position for decades. In Rumania,  Nicu Ceausescu, the omnipotent son of his father -- the dictator  -- was the same. In North Korea, Kim Il Sung trusts only his  own son Kim Il Yong, who maintains strict discipline and party  rule in the huge apparatus of the state security (115,000  people).  <H5>  The West Is Sensitive to That </H5>   The West is really sensitive to this. In Great Britain,  there would be a crisis in the cabinet if the queen asked the  prime minister to appoint her brother or her son as the main  controller of the board of directors that supervises British  intelligence services MI5, MI6, DIS, and GCHQ. In Israel, in  that case there would be a quarrel in the Knesset and new  elections. In Germany, something like that would be taken as a  good joke, and in France, Sweden, and Italy, as a dangerous  political move and precedent.    In our case, the unpleasantness of such a comparison may be  alleviated by the knowledge of the balance of political forces  not only in the state but also in the ruling HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community]. Of several candidates, Miroslav Tudjman  is presently the best choice for the head of HIS. In addition  to having successfully, and in a scientific manner, studied the  principles of information society [previous two words printed in  bold type], Miroslav Tudjman's elitist humanist education gives  him the following advantage in relation to his competition (of  course, all of whom were members of the HDZ): He has modern  thoughts and is not inferior to those he commands (and controls)  and, more important for this job, he never publicly asserts his  personal views. No Gojko Susak [minister of defense] will be  able to afford to ignore (as during the era of coordinator  Manolic) the opinion of the new head of the HIS, who also has  high formal authority in the field of national security.    For that function, Miroslav Tudjman is a better solution  than Hrvoje Sarinic, who is, on the other hand, ideal for the  job of principal adviser in the president's cabinet, and not for  the keeper of the key who can put into motion or halt such an  expensive and sensitive organization as the national  intelligence system. The UNS will now function exactly as was  originally planned -- as an national security advisory office of  the head of state (something that exists in most Western  democratic systems), and not as an independent intelligence  agency superior to everyone.    We also have to consider something else. Miroslav Tudjman is  an intellectual who has been developing a social-democratic  profile for years. That means that the head of the HIS will not  be an inexperienced, but aggressive hawk that will kill everyone  in the hen house to take but one hen as its prey. In other  words: He will assert his authority through his knowledge and  fierce professional debate (which is a common practice in  intelligence methodology), and not by intolerance and  bureaucratic court games; he will stimulate mutual cooperation  and not rivalry in the Croatian intelligence community. Those  who pretend to his position and advocate the so called hard line  in the HDZ, whose philosophy of life naturally contains nepotism  and connections, will carefully consider whether it pays  directly or indirectly to attack someone who is, after all, the  son of the president (both of the party and of the state).    And there is another thing, which commentaries in the  Croatian and international press have neglected to point out, on  the occasion of Miroslav Tudjman's appointment to the position  of the head of HIS: The military and civilian security and  intelligence system in Croatia will, in future, act within its  legal province. The SIS [Security and Information Service],  conceived as a military [last word printed in bold type]  counterintelligence service, will remain firmly in the domain of  the army and army barracks (it cannot go beyond that area),  while the VOS [Military Intelligence Service] will continue to  do his job: procuring and analyzing intelligence data of  military and strategic importance.  <H5>  Double-Faced Coat </H5>   The head of the HIS is to see to that this limit is not  exceeded, that authorizations and information are not  intertwined, and that rivalry is reduced to the minimum. The  reconstruction of the Croatian intelligence security apparatus  also shows that the intelligence capability of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs will definitely have to improve, while a good  part of the remaining field in the Croatian intelligence  community will be plowed exclusively by the SZUP -- the  (civilian) Service for Protecting the Constitutional System. If  there are any doubts as to why the SIS exists at all, there  should be no doubts as to the purpose of the SZUP. That service  could even change its name (a common practice in, for example,  Germany for similar agencies), but one should nevertheless admit  that this is a security organization that is, technologically  and professionally speaking, the strongest and the most  professional in Croatia, because of one small advantage: In  addition to continued counterintelligence and anti-terrorist  operational activities, it can also serve as an intelligence  organization against its opponents. The SZUP is, therefore,  like a reversible coat -- on one side it has a standard  (civilian) color, and on the other camouflage.    Still, do we really need so many security services? Bearing  in mind several external and internal factors, the question is  equal to the dilemma of the Croatian citizen earning 10 million  Croatian dinars a month asking: "Must I pay tax?"

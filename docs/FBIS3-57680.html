The communique  states that Lebed has called the Dniester leaders "alcoholics  and mafiosi who sold and lost in booze-ups the Moldovan Dniester  Republic." He said that "the direct presidential governing is  now introduced in Dniester and the Soviets will be dissolved; as  a consequence the Moldovan Dniester republic disappears until  February 28th. Russia has its problems and no one will be  concerned about Dniester as long as the present leadership is at  power." According to the communique, Lebed also stated that  Dniester did not need its own army and that the Dniester  Ministry of Defence required too much armament from the 14th  Army.</p>

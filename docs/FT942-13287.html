			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Condemned to print in 'Scabland': Staff in Bristol, still picketing after a year, talk to Roland Adburgham A placard outside the gates at printing company JW Arrowsmith reads: 'You don't have to visit Scabland.' The family-owned Bristol business has been picketed since the 121 workers were sacked for taking industrial action over a national pay claim a year ago today. At the same time, the company derecognised the GPMU printing union. A rally marking the anniversary will be held on Saturday. Mr Geoff Collard, branch secretary of the GPMU, said: 'I believe it is the longest running industrial dispute in the history of Bristol. We are hoping to make the rally the biggest show of solidarity of trade unionists this city has ever seen.' Labour politicians such as Mr Ian White, MEP for Bristol, see the case as highlighting the weakness of UK employment law for workers. The company argues that it acted fairly. Mr Tony Burke, GPMU deputy general secretary, praises the 'remarkable' solidarity of the union's members at Arrowsmith and at two smaller long-running disputes - Revell &amp; George in Manchester and Harvest Printers in Macclesfield, Cheshire. He believes the disputes have been significant in persuading other printing firms to return to a national pay agreement. Mr Burke said union members had voted last week to accept a 2.8 per cent national pay offer for 1994 and the British Printing Industry Federation had agreed to use its 'good offices' to try to resolve the three disputes. Arrowsmith, with a national reputation for technical typesetting, had a long-serving and non-militant workforce. Now there is acrimony. 'I know there is no chance of getting my job back,' Mr Dave Rose, who had been with Arrowsmith for 15 years, remarked as he warmed himself beside a brazier. 'But if they get away with this, other employers will do the same. It is a fight for union rights.' Mr Paul Samphier, dismissed after 26 years, said he was living on Pounds 60 a week dispute benefit from the union and Pounds 40 unemployment pay. 'I had been earning just over Pounds 300 a week.' Eighty-two staff are still out of work, according to the unon, although it will not disclose how much the dispute is costing it. Arrowsmith has suffered as well. The dispute began when losses of Pounds 210,000 in 1992 caused it to resist last year's pay claim of an extra Pounds 6.50 a week. Printers started an unofficial overtime ban and, after they voted for a strike, the company dismissed them for breach of contract. It offered to take people back at the old pay rates and without recognition of the union. Only six returned. Union members lost a subsequent claim for unfair dismissal. Arrowsmith's workforce has been more than halved to 65 and losses last year escalated to Pounds 670,000. The union accuses Miss Victoria Arrowsmith-Brown, the company's head, of having intended to reduce the workforce and of using the industrial action as a means to avoid redundancy payments. Mr Collard said: 'We are still seeking to reach a sensible negotiated settlement - but she's turned her back on every overture.' Miss Arrowsmith-Brown has argued that the company was damaged by the overtime disruption, and that its reduction in size was not a preconceived strategy. Mr James Arrowsmith-Brown, her brother and the company's finance director, said: 'The dispute is completely dead as far as we're concerned. 'There is no question of recognition - we made that decision after the people were dismissed. Everything we have seen since has pushed us further and further away from recognition.' Arrowsmith has had to cut back on typesetting but Mr Arrowsmith-Brown is confident it will survive. He has budgeted for a nominal profit this year. The company wants to sell its 3.2-acre freehold site, move to smaller premises and buy a new printing press. He describes the past year as 'a complete disaster - no one would ever want to see it again. One can argue about the rights and wrongs for years to come, but we believe we were right. But one is never proud of any participation in 120 people being put out of work.'</p>

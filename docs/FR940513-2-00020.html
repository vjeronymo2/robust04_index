The review committee forwards its recommendation concerning a Federal agency's proposed degree-granting authority to the Secretary, who then forwards the committee's recommendation and the Secretary's recommendation to the Office of Management and Budget for review and transmittal to the Congress. The Secretary uses the Advisory Committee as the review committee required for this purpose. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee will review the following at this meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Master's Degree-Granting Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Because of the requirements of the new law, a number of agencies currently recognized by the Secretary are no longer eligible for recognition. At this meeting, the Advisory Committee will consider the withdrawal of recognition of the following agencies, based upon the Department staff's determination that they are no longer eligible for recognition by the Secretary because they do not meet this new requirement: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Concern at Europol HQ row THE establishment of a permanent headquarters for Europol, the planned European criminal intelligence agency, is facing potentially a long-term delay because of differences between EC member states, police officials said yesterday, write Jimmy Burns in London and Andrew Hill in Brussels. Detective Superintendent Ian Morrison, the UK delegate at Europol's pilot offices in Strasbourg, said that in the unlikely event that agreement is reached at the Edinburgh summit, it could take at least six months before Europol can become functional. 'There appears to be general agreement on the terms of reference of Europol but the issue of location is undecided and without it Europol cannot start,' Mr Morrison said. Sharp differences over the location of Europol, which was due to start a drugs unit on January 1 surfaced last week during a meeting of EC interior ministers in London. Political passions are such that Dutch officials publicly alleged last week that France was attempting to discredit The Hague's candidacy for the institution by accusing the Dutch government of failing to curb the sale of soft drugs. It is thought likely that the dispute may only be resolved when there is a wider trade-off over other future permanent locations of key EC institutions.</p>

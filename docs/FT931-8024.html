			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Shell faces heavy losses on Japanese currency dealings ROYAL DUTCH/Shell stands to lose up to several hundred million pounds as a result of unauthorised foreign exchange contracts entered into by a Japanese associate company. Showa Shell Sekiyu, Japan's leading oil refiner and distributor which is 50 per cent owned by Shell Petroleum, has announced charges for the year to December 31 1992 of Dollars 1.05bn (Pounds 730m) on a series of speculative forward contracts entered into since 1989. That will result in a charge of Pounds 131m against profits to Royal Dutch/Shell in its results for the 1992 financial year. The company estimates that the total potential losses to Showa, which is quoted on the Tokyo stock exchange, could ultimately be as high as Dollars 1.35bn. Although these are material sums compared with Shell's profits last year of Pounds 2.9bn, the group was planning to wait until its results were announced on Thursday before revealing the losses. The speculative contracts totalled Dollars 6.4bn and were entered into at an exchange rate of Y145 per dollar. The dollar has since fallen and stood at Y119 to the dollar last Friday. Shell made a statement yesterday after details of the unauthorised contracts became public in Tokyo on Saturday. It said the contracts were reported to the management of Showa in late December last year and that a full investigation was under way. It said its internal auditing procedures and controls had been tightened. It added that some disciplinary action was already taking place and further such action could be taken in the future. The group - in common with most international traders - has substantial hedging contracts to protect it from foreign exchange fluctuations. But an official said its practice - which extends to associate companies - is not to permit speculative dealings. 'The directors view this matter with concern,' he said. 'They support actions of Showa's management to ensure that it will not happen again.' Shell said that the future charges to be taken had not yet been fully quantified but it had taken steps to limit its exposure. Separately, it said that there had been a change in accounting policy for 1992, which would provide a one-off credit of Pounds 149m. Showa had net assets of Pounds 700m in 1991, Pounds 8bn in revenues and Pounds 100m in income. Its workforce was 2,360. Shell has a Pounds 228m share of its net book value. Mr Takeshi Henmi, Showa Shell president, told a news conference on Saturday that his finance section had ignored company rules and independently speculated with huge dollar futures contracts. Reports in Japanese newspapers said Mr Henmi pledged that the company would make up the shortfall by selling assets, including stocks and property, once it had confirmed the extent of the loss. Royal Dutch/Shell will report its preliminary year-end results on Thursday, when a small increase in profits is expected pushing the figure up to Pounds 3bn compared with Pounds 2.89bn for 1991. The company is likely to raise its dividend in line with inflation to about 22p from 20.9p last time.</p>

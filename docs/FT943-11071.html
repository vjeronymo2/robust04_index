			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Altman 'will not resign' over Whitewater briefing Mr Roger Altman, deputy secretary of the Treasury, denied yesterday he was thinking of resigning over briefings he gave the White House on the status of regulatory investigations into the bankrupt savings and loan company implicated in the Whitewater affair. Asked in a morning television interview if he might be made the 'fall guy,' he replied: 'I know a lot of people think I am going to be, but I don't think so.' Mr Altman is due to appear today before the Senate banking committee holding hearings on the Whitewater affair, which has its origins in the Clinton family's financial and land dealings in Arkansas in the 1970s and 1980s. Senator Al D'Amato, the New York Republican, said on Friday he had information that Mr Altman's briefings on the possibility of criminal charges in the case of the Madison Guaranty savings and loan went into detail beyond that previously disclosed. But Mr Altman countered yesterday that he had been cleared twice of any criminal and ethical wrongdoing by Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel on Whitewater, and, on Sunday, by the office of government ethics, a non-partisan federal agency. The office did say that some contacts between treasury and the White House, while not unethical, were 'troubling'. Mr Altman conceded yesterday, as other administration officials had last week, that 'poor judgments' were made. Mr Altman also denied he had misled Congress last February, as Mr D'Amato has alleged. He had corrected the record of his testimony because he did not know at the time of two meetings last autumn. 'I've always thought that amending the record was something constructive to do, not a bad thing to do,' he said. The banking committee was also due later yesterday to hear from Ms Jean Hanson, the Treasury's legal counsel, whose recollections of various meetings she attended appear to be at odds with those of Mr Altman and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary. In the morning, officials from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency established to handle the savings and loan bankruptcies of the 1980s, testified that no one in the Clinton administration had tried to influence their investigations into Madison Guaranty. This was owned by Mr James McDougal, partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land investment.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With this rulemaking, the FHWA is modifying part 350 to allow partial funding of States notwithstanding intrastate incompatibility. States that have not achieved full intrastate compatibility will receive 50 percent of their basic formula allocation. The formula funds which are withheld from those States which do not have compatible intrastate regulations will be made available to States with compatible comprehensive programs to conduct certain high priority projects that are innovative, successful, cost-effective and cost-efficient. This change is consistent with the legislative direction in the ISTEA to develop an improved distribution formula that both promotes innovative programs and provides incentives to States that increase compatibility, section 4002(k), Public Law 102&hyph;240. It rewards those States that have fully compatible interstate and intrastate safety regulations, encourages comprehensive programs, and provides funds for high priority areas. The amendment will also enable the FHWA to maintain a basic commercial motor vehicle inspection program uniformly and universally applied by the States through the continued availability of Federal funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA emphasizes that States must continue to meet the requirement for interstate compatibility, and this interim final rule change will not affect that requirement. The FHWA believes that fully compatible safety and hazardous materials regulations are an essential element of MCSAP. Through the MCSAP, the FHWA, the States, and the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) have developed a coordinated, nationwide program of uniform inspections, enforcement, and data collection. This avoids duplication of efforts by the States and promotes compliance by the industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The modification made by this interim final rule continues the progress made through MCSAP by permitting States with only intrastate variances to continue to participate in the basic program while providing a strong incentive for them to adopt and enforce compatible intrastate regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Compatible Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A major goal of the MCSAP is to achieve nationwide uniform regulations, laws, and practices. The FHWA has determined that forty-nine States, the District of Columbia, and three territories have adopted compatible rules applicable to interstate commerce. Thirty-six States and territories have adopted compatible intrastate rules. This is indicative of the significant progress that the States and the FHWA have made largely through the MCSAP toward reaching the goal of national uniform commercial motor vehicle safety regulations and enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ideally, State commercial motor vehicle laws would exactly mirror Federal regulations. Indeed, the States are encouraged to adopt regulations applicable to both interstate and intrastate commerce which are identical to the Federal regulations. Moreover, the FHWA strongly encourages States to implement a system which allows them to automatically adopt any new Federal regulation, which would preclude any question of future incompatibility and reduce the chance of an interruption in the States' MCSAP funding. The FHWA recognizes, however, that circumstances may exist which make complete adoption by the States difficult. The FHWA has therefore provided the States with limited flexibility, through the Tolerance Guidelines, to address these local issues. In accordance with the ISTEA mandate to issue these guidelines in formal regulations, they were included in the FMCSRs as appendix C to part 350 (57 FR 174, September 8, 1992). The Tolerance Guidelines define the extent to which intrastate regulations can differ from the FMCSRs, yet still be considered to be compatible. Additional differences and industry exemptions are strongly discouraged. In order to gain FHWA's approval of additional differences, a State must carry a heavy burden of demonstrating that the difference would have little impact on commercial vehicle safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without this modification to part 350, 13 of the States who are currently participating in MCSAP may not qualify for any MCSAP formula grants in fiscal year (FY) 1995. These States (Alaska, Arizona, California, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wisconsin) are allocated a combined total of $16.7 million in Federal funds. These States conducted a combined total of 530,886 of the 1.6 million driver/vehicle inspections done in FY 1992. If the current part 350 requirements are not changed as provided in this rule, these States will no longer receive any MCSAP funding, which provides a significant portion of the resources for them to conduct roadside commercial vehicle and driver inspections, safety and compliance reviews, uniform accident and safety data collection, drug and alcohol abatement programs and other similar activities which have contributed to the significant reduction of commercial vehicle accidents on our nation's highways since MCSAP began in FY 1984. Thus, the FHWA has concluded that total loss of MCSAP funds for these States with some remaining intrastate incompatible rules and regulations would have an adverse impact on commercial motor vehicle safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

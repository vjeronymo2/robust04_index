			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Shaping a new market from bank debt - Investing in Latin American Brady bonds is not for the faint hearted TOMORROW will mark the latest stage in the development of a high-yield sovereign bond market as Argentina moves another important step closer to transforming its Dollars 31bn of foreign bank debt into bonds. By the end of this year, if their optimistic targets are met, both Argentina and Brazil will have succeeded in securitising their combined Dollars 75bn of bank debts. The new 'Brady bonds' that result - named after the US treasury secretary whose debt-reduction proposals have provided a model for successive developing countries - will create one of the biggest opportunities so far for international investors to take part in the highly-volatile Latin American debt markets. So far, some Dollars 60bn of Brady bonds have been issued, mostly by Mexico (Dollars 33bn) and Venezuela (Dollars 19.3bn), but also by Costa Rica, Nigeria, Philippines and Uruguay. Successful conclusions to the Argentine and Brazilian plans would more than double the amount of outstanding bonds. One effect of this massive increase in supply could be to depress prices. For instance, there are currently only around Dollars 10bn of floating rate notes (FRNs) issued by developing countries: by the end of the year, the amount will have jumped to Dollars 27.2bn, estimates Mr Paul Luke, an analyst at Morgan Grenfell in London. That will put pressure on prices - though, with no immediate need for banks to sell the new bonds, it should not cause a mass sell-off. Instead, said Mr Luke, there is likely to be considerable switching between new and existing FRNs as holders reassess the relative value of different instruments. The same is likely to be true of the bulk of fixed rate bonds created by the Brady deals. The 'stripped' yields on Mexican and Venezuelan Brady bonds (that is, the yield based on pure country risk, after stripping out the effect of the collateral backing the bonds) have virtually halved in the past two years, as the graph shows. The implied yields on the new Argentine and Brazilian bonds are far higher, with Argentina at around 18.5 per cent and Brazil at over 30 per cent. Holders who have made substantial paper profits on Mexico and Venezuela may take the chance to try to repeat the success by switching into the new Argentine and Brazilian bonds. The market's long-term future, though, depends on whether new investors can be drawn into these high-yielding securities. Most institutional investors have been excluded from the secondary market that sprang up during the 1980s in the bank debt of lesser developed countries. Some countries' central banks have restricted the holding of debt to banks, while many institutions are limited by their internal rules to investing in bonds, excluding them from the market in traded bank debt. Even for those allowed to invest, the drawbacks have been extensive. Settling trades in the secondary market in bank debt is expensive and time-consuming. The experience of Mexico and Venezuela, which issued Brady bonds during 1990, shows that a vigorous market could quickly develop in the new instruments. Both countries' bonds are among the most heavily traded in the international markets: according to figures compiled by Euroclear, the largest international bond settlement house, over Dollars 4bn of Venezuela's step-up bonds due 2007 were traded during June, making these the most actively traded of any USDollars security in Euroclear. The process of creating a new bond market out of Argentine and Brazilian bank debt is already well advanced. By tomorrow, Argentina's bank creditors will have to elect what type of bonds they want to receive in return for their debt, signalling the new bond market. This deadline has already effectively killed off the market in Argentine bank debt, known as GRA. Trading began to peter out around three weeks ago as banks moved to settle all their outstanding trades before the August 7 cut-off point. In its place, a market in the yet-to-be issued bonds has already opened  - as it has with Brazilian debt. Trading in the so-called 'when, as and if issued' bonds does not involve any cash changing hands at the time of the trade: only when the bonds are finally issued will traders settle up for their losses or profits. That makes it attractive for investors wanting to play the market but not wanting to have to fund their positions. The fast-growing high-yield bond markets that have emerged from the LDC debt crisis are likely to attract only the most adventurous fund managers, however. For a start, they betray all the signs of immature markets. Prices across Latin America, for instance, move together in reaction to dramatic (particularly bad) news in any one country, even if the news has no bearing on other countries in the region. 'The region is not properly researched yet. It over-reacts to events - that's part of the risk,' said Mr Marc Wenhammar, a fund manager at Latin American Securities, a specialist investor in the region. Also, a Wild West spirit has pervaded the market: big profits and light or non-existent regulation have given rise to fears about market practices and concerns that banks have traded on inside information gained from their negotiations with borrower governments. With the Federal Reserve in the US and the Bank of England in the UK breathing down their necks, traders have belatedly got together to form the Emerging Markets Association, to try to develop rules for, and confidence in, the markets. However, it is uncertainty about the economic prospects for the region that will keep most investors away. Ample demonstration of this came from Brazil yesterday: the country's debt, which had been trading at over 33 per cent of face value, tumbled sharply to under 30 as renewed fears took hold over the future of President Fernando Collor, fighting for his political life in the face of corruption allegations. With volatility like that, the Latin American debt markets are likely to remain outside the scope of most investors.</p>

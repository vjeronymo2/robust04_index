			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: A resistible rise ALTHOUGH the US dollar's slide against the D-Mark appeared to be bottoming out at the end of last week, traders are still looking for positive signs of a US economic recovery before they invest further in the currency, writes James Blitz. The Federal Reserve's decision not to signal a cut in interest rates last Wednesday gave the dollar a new surge of strength on the foreign exchange markets, up to around DM1.6135 in light trading yesterday. The dollar could rise further if the conference board's consumer confidence index, which is due out today, proves as good as the market expects. The April figure was sharply up to 64.8, and the market is predicting another increase for May, up to 66.0. Tomorrow's figure for April's durable goods orders will also affect the currency, with the market expecting a 0.5 per cent rise. The revision of first quarter GDP is due out on Friday. Germany's economic numbers will be scrutinised no less carefully, as the markets seek confirmation that another rise in the emergency Lombard rate is out of the question. Last Friday's better-than-expected figure for April money supply, which came in at 8.8 per cent, dashed expectations of another rate rise. The provisional cost of living figures for May, which should be out tomorrow, will give some indication of whether inflation is fully under control. The market expects to see a 0.3 per cent monthly rise. Sterling investors will focus carefully on today's figure for the UK trade balance in April, which analysts expect to be in the red to the tune of Pounds 0.9bn. UK analysts fear that the trade balance may widen as Britain's economy grows, and that this may hinder the pound's strength in the long term.</p>

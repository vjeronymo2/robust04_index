			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Intercare interim results hit by changes in Dutch legislation Dutch legislative changes have hit interim profits of Intercare, the USM-traded supplier of healthcare products, prompting an 8p fall to 89p in the share price yesterday. At the pre-tax level, profits declined by 20 per cent to Pounds 1.34m in the half year to end April, reflecting a 41 per cent drop in the mobility division contribution to Pounds 430,000. Mr Robert Shepherd, non-executive chairman, said that the legislation changes had led to a downturn in scooter business and trading was likely to continue to be affected in the second half. For the group as a whole, he believed the first half pattern of trading was likely to continue for the rest of the current year. In 1992-93 group profit was Pounds 4.31m. Group turnover rose from Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 20.5m, while earnings per share came out at 3.25p (4.1p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 0.7p.</p>

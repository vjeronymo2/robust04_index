			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (6): Delhi rules with carrot and stick - Across the subcontinent, regional conflicts strain the republic's integrity THE tenuous nationalism which binds the multi-cultural Republic of India is constantly threatened by regional strife. Since it became independent 45 years ago, it has faced all-out separatist insurgencies in the north-eastern state of Assam (since 1979), Punjab (since the early 1980s), and in Kashmir (since December 1989). Though militancy has been crushed in Punjab and peace has returned to the state after a bloody decade, the unrest in Kashmir shows no signs of subsiding, and Assam threatens to flare up again. 'India, with all its plurality and diversity, has been most successful in dealing with regional conflicts,' says Mr BG Verghese, an eminent journalist and research professor at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. 'Historically, traditionally and constitutionally, India's approach has been one of accommodation, not liquidity.' The ruling Congress (I) party, which has had an almost uninterrupted monopoly of power in New Delhi since Independence, has in effect become the Centre. Critics of the Congress claim that most regional conflicts, including Kashmir, Punjab and Assam, are the Congress's own creations, which, like the proverbial chickens, are coming home to roost. 'Kashmir, Punjab, Assam each have their own peculiarities, but what typifies them is that they are all the results of the Congress (I)'s wrong policies,' admits a senior party MP. 'The centre has repeatedly been tempted to play the all-powerful boss of the states, and has not hesitated to be ruthless when it has found it necessary to crush regional aspirations, especially political ones.' The Congress believes that it governs with a light hand and only uses force to defend internal security and national sovereignty. However, force has been used all too frequently to quell insurgencies. 'A lot of the trouble is a product of our own follies and political failures,' admits Mr Verghese. 'But part of the Indian genius has been to reconcile so many social, cultural, ethnic and religious identities.' India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, unlike his daughter Indira, and his grandson Rajiv Gandhi, did not live to see any serious regional tensions erupt in the country. Those who framed the Indian constitution allowed for dissension within specified limits. The trauma of partition between India and Moslem Pakistan was still too fresh, the states were in the process of being constituted, and it was too early to gauge how Centre-state relations would evolve. Though there have been periodic separatist uprisings in the north-east and Kashmir since 1947, India's first regional conflict was in the early 1960s, when the Dravida movement, an anti-upper caste social reform campaign in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, demanded a separate Dravida state. But Nehru initiated a compromise by 1962, and the party entered the electoral mainstream to wrest power in 1967. The first real jolt to independent India's integrity came in the 1970s, with a full-fledged insurgency erupting in the north-eastern states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Nagaland. These states, carved out of the old Assam province between 1963 and 1986, were politically integrated with the rest of the country, but were geographically, culturally and emotionally remote. In 1979, Assamese nationalists formed the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA). Backed by Naga and Kachin guerrillas it opted for a full-scale armed insurgency, which has fluctuated wildly, and has still not subsided. Punjab has witnessed one of the bloodiest revolts. Here, the origins of the conflict are not economic, but stem from a power struggle between local politicians of the state's majority Sikh community and politicians at the centre, who are eager to control the resources of one of India's richest states. A political movement for more autonomy started by Sikh leaders in the early 1980s turned violent when it failed to achieve its goal by peaceful means. Mrs Gandhi's government responded with a series of blunders. The worst was Operation Bluestar in June 1984, in which the Indian army stormed the holiest Sikh shrine, the Golden Temple at Amritsar, which militants had turned into a fortress. Thousands died in the ensuing violence and the militants' demand for Khalistan, a separate Sikh state, intensified. Mrs Gandhi paid heavily for her attempts to establish political supremacy over the Punjab militancy. She was killed by her Sikh bodyguards on October 30 1984. A fragile peace has returned to Punjab, but experts fear the crisis could erupt again. In Kashmir, a Punjab-style solution to an armed insurgency which has the support of the entire local population has failed to restore peace. It has only alienated the people further. Mr Rajesh Pilot, Minister of State for Home Affairs in charge of internal security, is trying - so far with little success - to initiate a political process in Kashmir. He says that the government does not believe in using force unless it is absolutely necessary. 'What we try to do is face the reality, provide opportunities for economic and social development, and help militants or aggrieved people to enter the political mainstream.' India's characteristic response to secessionist uprisings has been to throw in the army and the paramilitary, ordering full-scale crackdowns which often involve the repression and torture. The people of Assam lived with an occupying army for more than 20 years, and thousands of villages experienced search-and-arrest operations and human rights infringements. The Assamese were relieved when the Centre imposed President's rule on November 27, 1990, under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution. Assam was now under the direct control of New Delhi, and military operations were called off on April 20 1991. But the army was redeployed on September 14 that year, under the code name 'Operation Rhino'. Assam was policed by about 200,000 troops and paramilitaries until January 1992 when a negotiated settlement with the ULFA was reached. But some Assam militants remain unhappy, and sporadic violence continues. In Kashmir, the worst is not yet over. The government plans to send Mr KPS Gill, the police chief who crushed militancy in Punjab, to tackle the Kashmir militants. But experts fear that a Punjab-style show of force will not reap results and excesses by the armed forces have completely alienated the Kashmiri people. The Indian government uses both the stick and the carrot. The low-level war raging in the Vale of Kashmir has not prevented it from offering employment to those willing to eschew violence, helping traders to sell their goods through the rest of the country, and ensuring that food and other essential supplies continue to reach the Kashmiris. 'Our main approach has been to ensure that the common man is not hit by our operations to flush out militants, ' says Mr Pilot. But the government has been unable to control parts of its 250,000-strong security forces and the violence has so far claimed more than 10,000 lives. Mrs Gandhi used to blame 'the foreign hand' for all India's troubles. Pakistan across the border has been India's favourite whipping boy and not without reason. But, as Mr George Fernandes, MP, puts it: 'Pakistan may be fishing in the troubled waters of Punjab and Kashmir, but it is India who has created those troubled waters.'</p>

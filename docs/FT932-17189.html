			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (23): A leap from farm to finance - A day in the life of a young professional JOSEPH TAYANWA arose from his bed at 5am and did what many Nigerians are now accustomed to do: he switched on CNN. The Lagos press has complained that CNN, which is broadcast free of charge during weekday mornings, represents the insidious face of 'cultural imperialism'. But to Joseph Tayanwa it was merely a way of keeping in touch. As CNN burbled, Joseph, a Lagos bank clerk, shuffled around his tiny room. Against one wall was jammed a shelving unit - home to a television set, video and stereo, as well as books, knick-knacks and pots and pans. A few paces away, a bed was pushed up against the wall. Between the two, which marked the extent of Joseph's home, was a coffee table and two chairs. The room was neat, but an exceptionally humble place for a young professional to live in. It was also pervaded by an unmistakable stench from the open gutters which lined the streets outside. Joseph, now 30, has done well for himself. Thanks to the generosity of his uncle, who supported him through secondary school, he made the transition from village to city and from his father's life as a peasant farmer to his own as a bank clerk with managerial aspirations. His leap from farm to finance, from traditional to modern, typifies the mobility of Nigerian society which fosters an American-like desire for personal success. But Joseph's life, conducted against the backdrop of a city with poor housing, inadequate sanitation and chronic transport problems, also highlights the difficulty urban Nigeria has in meeting the needs of its evolving population. Joseph opened the door and fumbled his way along the dank passageway to the back of the compound. In a stall, he washed himself with a bucket of water filled from a standpipe in the courtyard. Passing the room next to his own - home to a family of four - he bought a small white loaf from a woman who had set up shop on his doorstep. Back in his room, he ate thick slices of bread smeared with margarine, and drank sweet tea. After breakfast he pulled on a jacket and tie and ran a brush over his shoes to remove the red dust of Lagos. It was important, he said, to look smart for the office. Joseph works at Chartered Bank as an assistant supervisor. Above him in the hierarchy are supervisors, officers, assistant managers and the manager. He earns nearly N4,000 a month, a little above Pounds 100 at current exchange rates. He pays N500 for his lodging, which includes use of a parlour at the back of the compound. He could probably afford a nicer place, but accommodation is hard to find and he has other financial commitments. Since his father died, Joseph - the eldest son - sends N500 a month to his mother. His six siblings also need support. Whatever is left over, Joseph saves. He plans to marry a girl he met in Kaduna, but cannot afford to do so until the end of next year. At 6.30am Joseph left the compound and made his way through the dusty streets. His journey to the office, on Chartered Bank's staff bus, takes no more than 40 minutes. He is lucky. It is not unusual for Lagosians to spend three or four hours battling their way to work. The bus crossed swiftly from the mainland to Ikoyi, an island at the smarter end of town. It pulled up in front of the bank in Awolowo road and Joseph made his way to the accounts and reconciliation department. The neat, air-conditioned offices contrasted with the grime, dust and oppressive heat outside. Joseph sat quietly, going over yesterday's transactions. When the power went off, as it frequently does in Lagos, the generator kicked into action. After taking his lunch break - though he ate no lunch - Joseph poured over the accounts once more. He said he enjoyed the discipline of balancing credits and debits. He left the office at 6.45pm, a little earlier than usual, in order to attend the service at the Deeper Life Bible Church. Much of the ordered manner with which Joseph conducts his life derives from his Christian faith. Because the staff bus had already left, Joseph hailed a little mini-van crammed with passengers. He passed a single naira to the conductor - a skinny boy leaning precariously out of the door, chanting the bus route to passers-by. As the van trundled along, the roads became more rutted and the vehicle zigzagged to avoid potholes. Each change of gear was accompanied by a sound like the yelp of a puppy. The sun had set, but the air remained chokingly hot, thick with petrol and perspiration. After briefly breaking down, the van resumed its journey, threading its way through the late evening traffic. At busy periods, Lagos roads grind to a complete standstill, notwithstanding the fact that only half the city's vehicles are allowed on the streets at any given time - odd number licence plates one day, even numbers the next. At Obalende, Joseph struggled off the van and picked his way past the press of hawkers. Kerosene bush lamps flickered in the darkness. The next leg of his journey was by molue, yellow buses so poorly maintained that they have been dubbed 'moving coffins.' (In February a packed molue caught fire on the Third Mainland bridge, leaving 25 people burnt beyond recognition.) The molue lurched to a start, stopping every few seconds to pick up passengers who crowded on to the narrow wooden seats. On the expressway it picked up speed, causing the engine to rattle like a food processor. The smell of burnt rubber floated through the dark interior. At Oyigbo Joseph caught a van, much like the first, which dropped him off in his neighbourhood, Ebute Metta. The hour's journey, on three vehicles, had cost him N5 and a deal of perspiration. There were no street lights, and crossing the gutters over narrow wooden planks required some skill. The church service he had travelled to, held in a tin-roofed barn, had already begun. Hundreds of people sat on benches listening to a sermon delivered over a tinny microphone. After a while Joseph joined the congregation in prayer, asking that barren women be blessed with children. Many people went into a trance, clicking their fingers and rolling their eyes. The service ended at 9pm. Joseph, who had not eaten since early morning, made his way home. Outside his compound a marquee had been set up; a crowd had gathered for the funeral wake of a local resident. Women were singing, their voices mingling with the evening hubbub of the crowded streets. Joseph bought a piece of cold chicken from a roadside stall. Most nights he buys pounded yam, or eba, a doughy substance made from cassava. Reaching home, he ate the chicken and watched the evening news. At 11pm, Joseph hung his clothes on a rack at the foot of his bed. It had been a long day, but no longer than most. As he fell asleep, the sound of singing and drumming drifted through the window. In six hours it would be time to start again.</p>

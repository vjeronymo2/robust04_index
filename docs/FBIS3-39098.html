			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister tonight set out to reassure  Moscow that Russia and NATO shared the same aims on Bosnia.  John Major, who leaves Britain for Russia on Monday [14  February] for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, said:  "Emphatically what NATO is doing is not taking sides in the  conflict."    His remarks, in an interview for Russian television, came  after Russia called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security  Council to discuss the crisis in Bosnia following NATO's  ultimatum to Serb forces around Sarajevo to withdraw their  artillery within 10 days.    Mr Major said: "The objectives that the Russian government  have are the same objectives that we have in the West. We would  like to see the fighting stop, we would like to see a political  settlement.    "Emphatically what NATO is doing is not taking sides in the  conflict. That is not what we are doing. What we are concerned  about is to stop the fighting around Sarajevo and the needless  and ceaseless deaths that occur there. That is the purpose of  what we are seeking to do. But the objective I believe is one  that Russia shares -- and that is to find a negotiated  settlement to this conflict.    "There is no other satisfactory ending."    Mr Major made his remarks shortly after he held brief talks  at Downing Street with Russia's ambassador to London, Boris  Pankin.    Earlier today, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy  Karasin, in a mildly-worded statement, called for a negotiated  end of the siege in the Bosnian capital. He told a briefing in  Moscow that the Russian Federation proposed the convening of an  immediate Security Council session to examine practical ways of  demilitarising Sarajevo and introducing direct rule by the UN.  His comments contrasted sharply with those earlier of Russian  deputy foreign minister Anatoliy Adamishin.    Interfax quoted Adamishin as denouncing outright NATO's  ultimatum to Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw artillery from  Sarajevo in 10 days or face possible air strikes.    "Why should NATO make decisions on a (Bosnian) settlement,  especially by way of ultimatums and threats to use force? This  is not NATO's business. It is the job of the UN."    A UN Security Council session would bring what is for Russia  a highly sensitive issue under the direct auspices of a body in  which it enjoys a trump card -- a powerful veto right.    Karasin avoided any comments on Moscow's possible line at a  Security Council meeting, should it be called.</p>

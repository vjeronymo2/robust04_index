			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERATORS DAMAGE KEY ARMS REACTOR  </P> <P> Operators at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina mishandled a routine  pressure test last weekend and damaged pipes and valves on a critical  nuclear-weapons reactor that the Energy Department had hoped to restart this  year.  </P> <P> Officials said the accident Sunday damaged a backup cooling system for the K  Reactor, one of three Savannah River reactors that have been shut down for  safety reasons since April. The reactors are the nation's only source of  tritium, a perishable component of nuclear weapons. And the K Reactor was  expected to be restarted first.  </P> <P> Energy Department officials said the accident posed no health or safety problem  and that it is too early to know whether the damage will delay the restart of  the reactor.  </P> <P> But the accident raised new questions about operating procedures at the aging  weapons complex, and the department said it has halted testing and maintenance  work there until after the incident has been investigated.  </P></p>

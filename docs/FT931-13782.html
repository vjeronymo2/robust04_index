			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures rise THERE was a more bullish tone to sterling futures yesterday after a poorer-than-expected set of retail sales figures for December raised new hopes of a cut in UK base rates, writes James Blitz. The UK's retail sales figure fell by 0.7 per cent after the market had been expecting sales to rise by 0.5 per cent on the month. Although the Chancellor has hinted that there will be no near-term cuts in UK base rates, the market believes that there is a strong chance of at least 50 basis points being taken off rates at the time of the March budget, which happens to fall one day before the maturity of the March short sterling contract. The contract therefore rallied 10 basis points on the day, to close at 93.52, on hopes that anew stimulus to the economy will be needed. At this level, it assumes that 3-month money in the spring will be at 6.48 per cent. One dealer assumed that a  1/2 percentage point cut in base rates would bring 3-month money down to 6 5/8 per cent, making this compatible with the price of the March contract. Conditions in the sterling cash market were a good deal stickier, partly due to another large shortage forecast by the Bank of England, this time to the tune of Pounds 1.1bn. Dealers again appeared to be short of bills to offer the Bank, and there was late assistance of Pounds 380m. Three month money closed a touch firmer at around 6 15/16 per cent. The bullishness in sterling markets was the exact opposite of sentiment in Europe. Three month French francs again firmed to 11 15/16 per cent from a previous close of 11 3/4 per cent. The March French franc contract also suffered another big setback, with the March contract falling 15 basis points to close at 90.14. The March Euromark contract was also off some 4 basis points to close at 92.07 at the end of the day. The duller sentiment mystified some dealers, partly because the prospect for near-term official rate cuts in Germany seems much stronger than it was a week ago. The Bundesbank may have dampened sentiment yesterday by its neutral intervention in the German money market, offering funds at a barely unchanged rate of 8.59 per cent and draining a small DM400m from the market. Only a minority of dealers expects a policy ease at today's Bundesbank council meeting.</p>

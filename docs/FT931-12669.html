			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Investor interest low at Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction THE GOVERNMENT could face difficulty in funding its heavy public sector borrowing requirement next year following a poor response to yesterday's big auction of gilt-edged stock. Investor interest in the Bank of England's Pounds 2.5bn gilts auction was the lowest for five years and there were signs that the central bank accepted bids at a discount to the market price to be sure of selling the full amount on offer. However, the Bank said it was satisfied with the outcome of the auction of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2007, and later issued three further tranches of existing gilts worth Pounds 550m. The low interest could partly be explained by muted demand from marketmakers in the gilt-edged market, who were still smarting from Tuesday's unexpected cut in the base rate. Many, who had gone short of stock in anticipation of the auction, had to buy back stock at higher prices after the one point cut in the base rate prompted a sharp rise in gilts prices. Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg, said yesterday's response to the auction implied that the government may have created difficulties for itself as a result of the timing of the base rate cut. 'The timing reduced the gilt-edged marketmakers' confidence in the whole process of auctions, which have been the backbone of the funding system recently,' he said. The cover, or the amount by which demand exceeds supply, on the auction was 1.18 times, the lowest cover since the Bank of England resumed its auctions in April 1991, but above the lowest-ever 1.07 times recorded in January 1988. Another indication that the auction had not been a resounding success was a much longer 'tail' - the difference between the average accepted price and the lowest accepted price - of   7/32 . This compares with tails of just 1/32 or  1/16 in previous auctions. 'If you are allowing some investors to take the stock at such a discount, then you are really very keen to get the stock away,' said Mr Michael Burke, an economist at Yamaichi. Economists believe the government is about fully-funded for the current fiscal year following yesterday's auction, and that any surplus will be put towards the 1993-94 requirement which they estimate at Pounds 55bn.

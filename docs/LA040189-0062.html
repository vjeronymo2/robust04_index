			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ET CETERA: BYU-SDSU FOOTBALL GAME IS MOVED TO NOV. 25  </P> <P> The move of the season-ending Brigham Young game from Dec. 2 to Nov. 25 is the  most significant change in the tentative 1989 San Diego State football schedule  released Friday.  </P> <P> The Aztecs are scheduled to play their first game under new Coach Al Luginbill  at Air Force Sept. 2. Two weeks later, on Sept. 16, they are to play UCLA in a  7 p.m. game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Other home games would be Cal State Fullerton (Sept. 23), Long Beach State  (Oct. 14), Pacific (Oct. 21), New Mexico (Nov. 4), Wyoming (Nov. 11) and BYU.  </P> <P> Road games would include Utah (Sept. 30), Hawaii (Oct. 7), Texas El Paso (Oct.  28) and Miami, Fla. (Nov. 18).  </P> <P> The schedule is subject to change for television.  </P> <P> HOCKEY  </P> <P> The San Diego Surf defeated the Burbank Jets, 11-4, in the first game of the  Pacific Southwest Hockey League playoffs before 700 at the San Diego Ice Arena.  </P> <P> Playing on the same line, Jerry Azato (two goals, three assists), Jack Grone  (two goals, three assists) and Jim Malwitz (one goal, four assists) combined  for five goals and 15 points to lead the Surf (21-0-1).  </P> <P> San Diego led, 2-0, after the first period and increased that to 8-0 after 40  minutes.

The 5-foot-11  outside hitter was offered a full scholarship to SDSU despite having only  played club volleyball for one season.  </P> <P> "It's a tribute to her athletic ability," said Dick Templeman, SDVC's director.  "It's highly unlikely for someone to get a scholarship with only one year of  club."  </P> <P> Lester also plays basketball and softball for Madison. She is an All-American  and three-time co-player of the year in the City Eastern League in softball.  </P> <P> Lester is the 11th member of SDVC to receive a scholarship this year.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Pepperdine defeated University of San Diego, 8-5, in a West Coast Athletic  Conference game at Cunningham Stadium.

Dave Monastero (2-1) was the loser.  </P> <P> Behind the pitching of Darryll Rupnow, Wisconsin Whitewater's two-run second  inning was enough to defeat UC San Diego, 2-1, in a nonconference game at  LaVerne.  </P> <P> Rupnow (2-1) allowed nine hits, struck out nine and walked one. The Tritons'  Mike Morgan (eight strikeouts, one walk) took the loss and is 3-5.  </P> <P> In the NCAA Division III college baseball poll UCSD (14-10) is ranked ninth,  Wisconsin Whitewater (7-5) 10th.

Seagram's Coolers Open Friday in  Edmond, Okla.  </P> <P> Stayrook, who led for four of the first six rounds, will bowl the winner of the  opening match in today's stepladder finals.  </P> <P> Jim Pencak led all qualifiers and is guaranteed a berth in the championship  game and a shot at the $100,000 first prize.

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Treasury Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury sold $9.2 billion of three-month bills  at an average discount rate of 7.18%, down from 7.32% last week.  </P> <P> Another $9.2 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount  rate of 7.21%, down from 7.33% last week. The rates were the lowest since  three-month bills sold for 7.17% on Sept. 19, 1988, and six-month bills  averaged 7.19% on Aug. 6, 1990. The new discount rates understate the actual  return to investors -- 7.41% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling  for $9,818.50, and 7.59% for a six-month bill selling for $9,635.50. The  discount rate reflects the price discount received when government securities  are purchased at less than face value.  </P></p>

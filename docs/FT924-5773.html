			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Arts: Elisabeth II - Theatre The Gate Theatre in Notting Hill has achieved the distinction of being heavily oversubscribed on a wet Monday night even for such an unpromising play as Thomas Bernhard's Elisabeth II. The first half consists of a seemingly endless monologue in the style of an ageing Austrian Jimmy Porter without the jokes, but it is necessary to sit through it in order to appreciate the second. What Austria in general and Vienna in particular did to Bernhard to deserve such spleen is never clear. He was born, the illegitimate son of an Austrian mother, in Holland in 1931. Most of his education took place in Austria. He died in 1989, having written about 20 plays, but is scarcely known in Britain. This is psychological guesswork, but I suspect that the underlying theme of Elisabeth II is a lament that Austria is not what it used to be. Bernhard would have preferred the old imperial splendour and the intellectual life that sometimes went with it. The Elisabeth in question is not Elisabeth of Austria but the Queen of England paying a state visit to Vienna in the late 1950s. All Viennese society turns out to see her. The Queen does not appear. Instead we have the rich, disabled Herr Herrenstein whose apartment is being used to view the Queen from the balcony. He is a cantankerous old man who lost his lower legs in a driving accident. In the first act he rants about the decline of Austria and the old civilisation. From his references to Schopenauer, Hegel and Kant, he is very well-educated. He is also intolerably rude to his servants and professes near-total misanthropy. The part is played with immense self-confidence by Julian Curry, yet the monologue is heavy going by any standards. Then suddenly it turns out that the old man has life, even affection, in him after all. He is concerned that his long-standing manservant Richard (Ian Gelder) is about to desert him. Although he is on stage throughout, Richard has barely a dozen lines: Gelder's performance, showing his white gloves and the occasional movement of the eyebrows, is a gem. There is also a philosopher friend called Guggenheim, played by Barry Wallman, who has spent his most creative years in Oxford. In his presence Herrenstein becomes a different man, capable of kindness and friendship. It looks remarkably like hero worship of the civilising influence of an English university. As the Queen's approach nears, the stage fills up with a cocktail party to see her. Here is the Austrian society which Herrenstein despises, though again there is an exception in Countess Gudenus (Eileen Page) who is not only beautiful, but appreciates Guggenheim's writing. The end is startling, yet ambiguous. The balcony collapses with nearly all the people on it. a Herrenstein might have plotted this all along, or equally Richard might have finally push his master over the edge. At any rate the last half hour or so has been worth waiting for. The direction and designs are by David Fielding and the translation by Meredith Oakes. About half of act one should be cut. Gate Theatre, London W11 until December 12 (071) 229 0706</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (36): West End still the favourite location - Rhys David scrutinises the addresses of corporate Britain and discovers that London remains the business capital, with Birmingham the runner-up and Reading edging out Edinburgh and Leeds for third place / UK500 Corporate Headquarters Business bosses may complain about the congestion on the roads and troubles on the trains but the West End of London is still the place most favoured by British companies for their headquarters. See map on page 24.) The area which takes in Oxford Street and Mayfair and extends through Kensington towards London Airport, boasts 57 corporate headquarters, five more than the City of London with 52, and 15 ahead of south-west London, the area incorporating Knightsbridge and Chelsea, and extending south into Wimbledon. London's dominant position overall as the business capital of the UK emerges from an analysis of the addresses of the top 500 (to be published next month in an expanded reprint of the FT500). In spite of the relocations that have taken place over recent years to towns around the M25 orbital motorway, and in some cases to other parts of the country, the London postal districts combined still account for 198 or roughly 40 per cent of all UK500 company headquarters. There are, nevertheless, some surprises in the location list, which uses UK post code areas - in effect Britain's city regions - as its geographical basis. Birmingham, with 21 headquarters justifies its claim to be Britain's second business centre. Somewhat more unexpectedly, Reading, a beneficiary of some out-of-London moves,is the next most popular provincial location, and home to 13 companies. Edinburgh and Leeds with 12 each - a score also equalled by Slough - are ahead of their usually higher-profile rivals, Glasgow and Manchester, and unfashionable Bradford also scores well with nine company headquarters. A number of big cities such as Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry and Sheffield fare relatively badly with only two apiece, while Aberdeen, in spite of its position as Britain's oil capital, boasts only one, as also do Portsmouth, Southampton, and Croydon. Former new towns Hemel Hempstead, Milton Keynes, and Peterborough, (six each), all figure more strongly, with Liverpool and Derby on the same total, ahead of Huddersfield, Nottingham, Warrington and Redhill on five. Regionally, Yorkshire with the headquarters of 40 quoted companies, the West Midlands (38), the Thames Valley (35) and the North West (34) are Britain's most significant regions outside London, followed by Scotland (33). Outside these areas company headquarters are thinly spread, with Wales, the West of England, East Anglia, Northern Ireland and the North East, home to only a few companies with strong local roots. In the European list (see chart on page 35) the UK, with Europe's big stock market, is dominant with 187 out of the total of 500 top companies or roughly 37 per cent of the total. The UK share of the list's total market capitalisation is similar at 37 per cent - Dollars 828.5bn out of Dollars 2,213.8bn. France has the second highest number of companies in the list (77) but at Dollars 310.2bn, their market capitalisation lags slightly behind that of Germany whose 67 companies were valued at Dollars 315.2bn. Netherlands has 17 companies with a market capitalisation of Dollars 187.5bn. Italy, in spite of the size of its economy, manages only 25 companies in the list, valued at Dollars 84.7bn, slightly ahead of much smaller Sweden, which has 22 companies valued at Dollars 83.4bn. Spain has only two fewer companies in the list than Italy but their combined capitalisation, Dollars 85.2bn, is marginally greater. By contrast, its Iberian neighbour at the bottom of the list, Portugal, has only one representative, three fewer than Ireland, Luxembourg and Austria.</p>

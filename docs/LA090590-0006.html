			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE GULF CRISIS;  </P> <P> . . . AND KEEP THE POLITICAL ENDS IN MIND;  </P> <P> TO DESTROY KUWAIT IN ORDER TO SAVE IT IS THE WORST THING WE COULD DO. INSTEAD,  GO AFTER IRAQ'S ARMY IN THE DESERT.  </P> <P> If it does become necessary for the United States and allied forces to launch a  military offensive against Iraq, we must hope that the plans being laid by  military commanders are more sensible than some of the dubious schemes being  bandied about in the press. War and politics are inseparable, and it would be  pointless to win this war in a manner that would doom the following peace.  </P> <P> The first faulty notion is the idea of a "strategic air offensive" against Iraq  -- wide-ranging bombing that broadly targets Iraqi industry, destroys chemical  weapons facilities and violently upsets the lives of Baghdad's civilians. Some  commentators advocate achieving the same ends with more precisely targeted  commando raids or "surgical air strikes," although such strikes are much more  often imagined than achieved.  </P> <P> The fact is, Iraq has only one industry worth mentioning, and that is oil.  Should we find ourselves in a shooting war, one key purpose of which is to  ensure the flow of petroleum to the world's economy, it is senseless to destroy  that industry. As an economic factor in Iraq's defense, it has already been  shut down by the embargo. As a military factor, the oil fields are irrelevant.  Their destruction would have no impact on Iraqi military fuel supplies during  the short -- though undoubtedly bloody -- conflict.  </P> <P> Bombing chemical plants is even less sensible. There would be no effect on  Iraq's immediately available stocks of chemical munitions, but it would poison  large areas of land (which we would later have to clean up) and horribly kill  hundreds or thousands of Iraqi civilians. (That it might kill Western hostages  as well must not be a factor in our thinking; the responsibility for their  deaths would be Hussein's.)  </P> <P> Bombing Baghdad is a similarly bad idea. We know from long experience that  bombing populations merely makes them identify their own fortunes with those of  the regime under attack. Far more demoralizing would be empty store shelves and  a steady flow of telegrams announcing the deaths of soldier sons and husbands  in nameless losing battles in the desert.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most absurd idea is that of invading Kuwait and "liberating" it  without a "provocative" invasion of Iraq itself. It seems that the old concept  of burning the village in order to save it is still with us. Any pitched battle  in Kuwait City will leave it a pile of corpse-strewn rubble. This will win us  few friends among the survivors.  </P> <P> The most disturbing thing about this speculation on our military plans is that  it may not be wrong. In Vietnam, we tried to bomb a country that was hardly out  of the Bronze Age back to the Stone Age. That policy bore no positive fruit  because, as with Iraq today, the Vietnamese economy was not the source of the  enemy's weaponry.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the military might that we are pouring into the Persian Gulf with  such truly impressive speed can still be put to practical offensive use. Saddam  Hussein's regime does have one vital organ that provides a politically and  militarily ideal target: the million-strong Iraqi army.  </P> <P> With one 1 of 17 Iraqis now in uniform, merely supplying the military is a  crushing burden. It is a conventional, armor-heavy force that must concentrate  to be effective, thus offering an ideal target for Western air- and  ground-based firepower. It will be deprived of air support within a few days of  the outbreak of war. The Iraqi army is, in fact, exactly the kind of target  American military planners must have dreamed about for years: the Soviet army  without the Bomb (yet), without air cover, without a massive population and  industrial base to back it up.  </P> <P> If we are going to wage war, we need to keep our political and economic ends in  view. We must not destroy the oil industry that is our object to preserve, nor  alienate the moderate Arab states while destroying a radical one. We cannot  afford to provide Saddam Hussein with nightly news footage of little Arab girls  running down the road with their backs on fire -- especially not little Kuwaiti  girls.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the deaths of thousands of Iraqi men in uniform will prove  entirely acceptable to world opinion. If we beat Hussein's field army in the  desert, his garrison in Kuwait will wither on the vine.  </P> <P> Our greatest strategic advantage in this struggle is the moral high ground.  Let's keep it.  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Size is strength as customers suffer - NatWest's ability to beat record bad debt charges NATIONAL Westminster Bank demonstrated yesterday when publishing its 1991 results that it is both one of Britain's strongest businesses and one of its weakest. Pre-tax profits fell 78 per cent from Pounds 504m to Pounds 110m due to a bad debt charge of Pounds 1.99bn, which included the biggest losses ever incurred by a UK bank on its domestic lending. However, the group was able to remain in profit because of a sharp increase in income, excluding bad debt charges. The trading surplus rose 20 per cent to Pounds 2bn, in large part because of a 28 per cent rise in commission income. The strength and the weakness are to some extent two sides of the same coin, stemming from the sheer size of the organisation. NatWest has for years been the leading lender to small and medium size businesses, which have been hit particularly hard by the recession. As a result, it could never hope to escape from the loan losses afflicting all banks. But the losses were exacerbated by weak management, as Lord Alexander, chairman, admitted when saying that there had been 'departures from the principles of sound lending'. The bank lent too much to too many insubstantial businesses. Mr Tom Frost, chief executive, highlighted growth in the loan book at the end of 1988, when seven years of UK economic growth were drawing to a close, as a particular mistake. Improvements in the management of most UK banks lagged behind modernisation of other industries because banks had been protected from competition till a decade ago. Even today, their ostensibly special role within the UK economy means that the Bank of England still gives them protection from the market disciplines of being vulnerable to a hostile takeover bid or bankruptcy. However, NatWest's disproportionate economic power, or oligopolistic position, was also its salvation last year. Most UK companies, open to intense competition, found it difficult to increase revenues during the recessionary conditions of the past year. But Lord Alexander said that NatWest put in place higher tariff levels and, with the help of new technology, made sure that an increased number of eligible customers paid their charges. As a result, UK branch customers, not including the biggest corporate customers, paid commissions of Pounds 1.33bn last year, 24 per cent higher than in the previous year. The underlying strength of the business was what persuaded the board to maintain its full-year dividend at 17.5p, even though earnings per share were significantly lower at 3p, against 13p. The group is having to withdraw Pounds 220m from reserves to meet the Pounds 285m cost of the dividend. The balance sheet remains strong compared with many of its international competitors. The ratio of capital to assets, measured on the new international basis, known as the Basle convergence ratio, is 9.6 per cent, well above the 8 per cent minimum set by regulators. The ratio rose during the year, largely because the bank raised Pounds 466m of new capital through issues of non-cumulative preference shares and subordinated debt. There was also a fall in risk-weighted assets, or assets revalued to take account of their inherent riskiness. This drop in loans and other assets was no accident, according to Mr Derek Wanless, a director. He said that all executives had been under instructions to cut the bank's exposure to low yielding assets. This emphasis on profitability is symptomatic of Lord Alexander's attempts to enforce a sweeping cultural change, which has involved a series of senior personnel changes and a reorganisation of the divisional structure. 'We need to become a business, not a (philanthropic) institution,' he said. NatWest's shareholders will applaud him. Customers paying higher charges may not.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Hong Kong China stocks are likely to provide the main focus of trading in Hong Kong next week, with final results due from Maanshan Iron and Steel today and Luoyang Glass tomorrow, writes Louise Lucas. Maanshan Iron and Steel has the biggest capitalisation of the so called H share companies, and Luoyang Glass is a float glass company which listed last month. The H share sector has been rising for the past month and a half, partially stimulated by the launch of a new H share index, which tracks the performance of the Hong Kong listed China shares, and latterly by some strong corporate results. Trading is otherwise expected to be lacklustre, after a mixed corporate interim results season, although traders will seek arbitrage opportunities ahead of the expiry of the Hang Seng futures on Tuesday. The market is closed today for a public holiday. Investor activity will also be depressed by the public holiday on Monday.</p>

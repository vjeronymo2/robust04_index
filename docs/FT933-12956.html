			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters gains A strong recommendation for Reuters from Lehman Brothers ensured that the shares remained in positive territory, adding 8 at 1392p, in a poor day in the market. Mr Alastair Smellie at the US investment bank believes that Reuters' 'unrivalled market penetration, its quality and visibility of earnings, enormous financial strength and accelerating growth prospects more than justify its current premium rating'. He predicted that the stock would rise to 1600p within the next year. The company reports interim figures next week. Chemicals manufacturer BOC Group rose 6 to 655p as Hoare Govett recommended the stock. The broker said the shares have underperformed by 20 per cent this year and look good value. At the same time, Hoare downgraded Laporte from Pounds 114m to Pounds 110m for this year, citing tough trading conditions. The shares fell 17 to 578p. Results from SmithKline Beecham came in at the top end of market forecasts, helping the shares put on 3 at 419p. Pre-tax profits grew 15 per cent to Pounds 601m from Pounds 521m. Mr Robert Bauman, the chief executive, said the group's performance was satisfactory, but he warned of an increasing degree of uncertainty in the drugs sector due to economic and regulatory pressures. Meanwhile, selected drugs stocks bounced from their recent weakness as investors looked for bargains. Wellcome advanced 17 to 621p and Glaxo 8 to 531p. Calm came to the second day's trading in the new BT partly-paid shares and they closed a halfpenny ahead at 168 1/2 p. Turnover was 41m, against Monday's 187m, as the profit-takers faded and the stock settled into a narrow trading range. BT ordinary were unchanged at 413 1/2 p. Second line hotel issues, battered in recent sessions following the suspension of Resort Hotels, staged a modest rally, although confidence in the UK economic recovery remained uncertain. Stakis, helped by reinforced positive stances from Hoare Govett and Smith New Court, firmed 3 to 55p in volume of 1.2m. Friendly Hotels moved up 4 to 202p. British Aerospace retreated 18 to 400p amid talk of an oversupply of defence equipment on the market and further concern about the financing of BAe's planned Pounds 250m regional jets joint venture with Taiwan. However, the company's chairman said he was confident that the financing problems would be solved shortly. Among motor issues, GKN added 8 at 461p and T&amp;N improved 4 to 194p, with agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite said to have been the day's big shoppers with a view that next month's UK new car registrations should benefit both component suppliers. Profit-taking left Siebe 5 lighter at 492p. Strong demand for Vosper Thornycroft following a recent visit from institutions saw the shares rise 16 to 629p. A stock shortage continued in VSEL, which climbed 15 to 863p. A squeeze also drove Hunting 9 ahead to 236p. Bargain hunters for Meggitt helped to reverse the recent decline in the stock. The shares hardened 3 to 105p. The first day of dealings in engineering group Quadramatic cheered the market. Having made its debut at 123p, the stock ended 5 higher at 128p. In the transport sector, US selling continued in Tiphook, sending the stock further into retreat following last week's figures which revealed a loss. The shares closed 17 lower at 213p, but after having been lifted off the bottom by bargain hunters. An announcement from Ocean Group that it had won a multi-million-pound six-year contract from Procter and Gamble for the distribution of P&amp;G's detergents in Spain coincided with news that it is to invest Pounds 18m in constructing an automated distribution centre in that country. The shares gained 4 at 292p. A technical boost buoyed Campari, the sporting clothes company. Some demand and a dearth of sellers pushed it up 5 to 138p. Reports that National Westminster Bank had collected details of customers' political affiliations overhung the banking sector. NatWest dropped 15 to 491p, with talk that it may soon call on investors for cash also doing the rounds. Lloyds receded 9 to 579p, while Barclays gave up 14 to 478p.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei shows mild recovery amid bargain hunting INDEX futures sales were outweighed by bargain hunting, government buy orders and short-covering, and the Nikkei average closed at its intraday high in light trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei ended 151.40 firmer at 20,380.79, after a session low of 20,128.70. The Topix index of all first section stocks appreciated 8.68 to 1,597.96. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.56 to 1,229.16. Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 380m shares, barely changed from the previous day. Advances outnumbered declines by 595 to 423, with 167 issues unchanged. Brokers said investors had been waiting for a possible retreat below the 20,000 level. But once the 225-issue average maintained its ground, buyers entered the market at the lower end of its range. An analyst at a Japanese brokerage said domestic institutional investors dominated the day's activity, with international investors taking light profits. Equity prices, he added, are expected to trade within a narrow range until market participants have digested recent company results and forecasts. Investors focused on issues with good earnings for the financial year to March 1993. JGC, the engineering company, rose Y100 to Y2,330 following its better than expected results. Takuma, the boilermaker, advanced Y70 to Y1,400 as market participants speculated that its earnings will reach peak levels. The non-ferrous metals sector rose in tandem with gold prices in overnight trading in New York. Sumitomo Metal Mining, the day's most active issue, climbed Y50 to Y1,160, Mitsubishi Mining and Smelting Y13 to Y558 and Mitsubishi Material Y3 to Y525. Some real estate issues advanced after the Japan High Rise Condominiums Association estimated that condominium sales would increase by more than 50 per cent this current fiscal year. Daikyo put on Y40 at Y1,320 and Nichimo Y2 at Y557. However, Honda, which announced a 32 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, retreated Y50 to Y1,380. Suzuki declined Y14 to Y966. Profit-taking pushed some shipbuilding issues down following Tuesday's advance. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries slipped Y4 to Y517, while Hitachi Zosen relinquished Y8 to Y575. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 72.11 higher at 22,625.09 in volume of 21.2m shares. Roundup PROFIT-TAKING was much in evidence yesterday. HONG KONG slipped back following record highs earlier this week. The Hang Seng index eased 55.42 to 7,093.88. Turnover fell to HKDollars 5.2bn from Tuesday's HKDollars 8.3bn. Some analysts commented that the market was likely to consolidate after its recent rallies, while switching among major stocks and to second and third liners was also noted. HSBC Holdings and Cheung Kong were sold, down a respective 50 cents and 10 cents to HKDollars 71.50 and HKDollars 27.10. However, Jardine Matheson went against the trend, rising HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 58.50. SINGAPORE was also easier, although the Straits Times Industrial index recovered from an intraday low of 1,866 to finish only a net 1.40 off at 1,876.61. Volume was estimated at 403.2m shares. Fraser &amp; Neave and Sembawang Shipyard receded 40 cents apiece to SDollars 12.60 and SDollars 12.40 respectively. SEOUL, however, went higher for the third consecutive session, with securities houses giving good performances. Daewoo Securities moved forward Won300 to Won23,200 and Lucky Securities Won300 to Won20,200. The composite stock index closed 2.15 firmer at 724.76 in turnover of Won759.6bn. TAIWAN fell back as turnover shrank from TDollars 23bn to TDollars 18.5bn, its lowest level since February. The weighted index lost 48.85 at 4,446.54. Activity was dampened by concern over investigations into alleged trading irregularities which are being investigated by the authorities. MANILA lost ground for the second day running on a combination of disappointing economic data and a severe power shortage. The composite index declined 21.78 to 1,574.36 in turnover of 408.6m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR was firmer, with activity concentrated in blue chips. The composite index rose 3.97 to 729.43 in turnover of MDollars 1.7bn. Sime Darby, however, fell 22 cents to MDollars 4.88 in volume of 2.35m shares. AUSTRALIA rose in line with an improvement in the gold price. The All Ordinaries index put on 4.7 at 1,682.6, with the gold shares index advancing 82.0 to 1,798.3, its highest level since March 1990. Turnover came to ADollars 351m. NEW ZEALAND was driven higher by Telecom, up 16 cents at NZDollars 2.95, as investors responded to Tuesday's annual results, which included an increase in the dividend. The NZSE-40 index gained 27.57 at 1,615.91 in turnover of NZDollars 67m.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / S Africa cautious on scrapping currency controls Liberalisation of South Africa's exchange control regulations will not be possible until the country gets an international credit rating, Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said yesterday. Delivering his annual report in Pretoria, Mr Stals said it was clear the existing system would have to be scrapped to ensure sustainable, long-term growth for the country. 'In the long run and in the interest of future economic growth, South Africa must liberalise its foreign exchange market and revert to a system of unitary floating exchange rates,' he said. However, Mr Stals noted that in other countries exchange controls were abolished only as part of a macro-economic restructuring programme, often with the help of international institutions, and that at the very least South Africa must wait until it had full access to international capital markets. South Africa's two-tier currency comprises the commercial rand, used for all regular balance of payments transactions, and the financial rand, used by foreigners as a discounted investment currency. Exchange restrictions have been in place since the 1960s. 'The abolition of exchange controls in isolation without any supportive measures may cause serious disruptions in the initial phase of the transition and force the reintroduction of old controls, or even the application of other new direct controls over markets, all of which may be more damaging to the economy,' he said. South Africa has appointed Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, to help it get an international credit rating from the main agencies, a process expected to be completed by October. In addition, Mr Stals reiterated his previously stated preconditions for the scrapping of the financial rand, including a narrowing of the differential between the two exchange rates and a rise in foreign reserves, currently able to cover only five weeks' imports. In recent months, continued speculation over demise of the investment currency has led to severe gyrations in its exchange rate, while fears over the inflationary pressures such a move might unleash have contributed to soaring government bond rates. Responding to the recent upturn in the inflation rate, which rose in June to 7.5 per cent from a 21-year low of 7.1 per cent in April, Mr Stals signalled that the Reserve Bank would probably have to tighten monetary policy to help lower inflationary expectations and cautioned the new government against trying to increase spending. 'Many of us have a desire to force-feed the economy beyond its actual potential and to exert pressure on the monetary system to accommodate these desires by simply creating more money,' he warned. Mr Stals also said that while he was confident the country's capital account would continue to improve, it would be 'naive' to believe that huge amounts of capital would flow into the country even if exchange controls were lifted. Social and political stability, economic viability, sound fiscal and monetary policies and productivity improvements were of even greater importance for most foreign investors.</p>

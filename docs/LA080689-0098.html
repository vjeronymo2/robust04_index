			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIVING SOME LOVING MEMORIES OF PARENTS  </P> <P> This is to thank Dave Larsen for the timeless article about grown-ups' sorrow  on the loss of their parents ("The Sorrow of a Grown-Up Goodby," July 30).  </P> <P> My father passed away when I was 3 and my mother in 1974, just one year after I  had graduated from USC Engineering School. Yet, just a few days ago I had a  wonderful dream that my mother was helping me get through college.  </P> <P> I'm sure I would not have gone through engineering school without my mother's  moral support, especially since I was the only female in my class.  </P> <P> Every time I do a good job or complete a big or difficult project, I dream my  mother is still alive; sometimes I dream about my father also.  </P> <P> Who would want to forget such wonderful parents?  </P> <P> EREMITA MIRANDA  </P> <P> La Canada Flintridge  </P></p>

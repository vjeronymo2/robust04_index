			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Whitbread close to meeting pub target after sale WHITBREAD, the brewing and retailing group, is close to meeting its target for the number of public houses it can control under the government's beer orders which come into effect on November 1. This follows the sale, agreed yesterday, of 223 pubs to Discovery Inns, a new company headed by Mr Paul Smith, formerly managing director of Devenish, the west country pubs group. Some of the other managers also came from Devenish. The sale price was not disclosed but analysts speculated it was in the Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m range. Whitbread is receiving cash for the pubs. A seven-year supply arrangement between Whitbread and Discovery Inns has been agreed. Mr Smith, who left Devenish in July 1991 when he bought its brewery in Redruth, Cornwall, for Pounds 700,000, said that the pubs were mainly 'third division' outlets all with tenants. He reckoned they could be developed as traditional community pubs known for 'good ale and the hospitality of their landlords'. The Redruth brewery would remain separate from Discovery Inns. After the sale Whitbread will have about 100 pubs more than the 4,300 or so it is allowed under the beer orders, which were introduced after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the industry in 1989 found there was a complex monopoly. Whitbread has cut its estate from about 6,600 in November 1989 by selling 1,300 pubs, raising Pounds 200m, and leasing 900 pubs free from the 'tie' to the brewer. The remaining 100 pubs will either be sold or leased on short term leases by November 1. Discovery Inns is financed about half and half by equity and debt and has a longer term aim of coming to the stock market. Equity backing was arranged by Kleinwort Benson Development Capital and loan capital by NM Rothschild.</p>

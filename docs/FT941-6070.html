			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Observer: Portillo protests What did Michael Portillo say at Eton? The chief secretary to the Treasury still seems to be having trouble shaking off his unfortunate 'corrupt foreigners' gaffe, made over a month ago. Efforts to wipe the slate clean by apologising were spoilt by the revelation that he had made the same remarks not once but twice, at Eton and then more publicly later at Southampton. Hence, when challenged by a Dutch journalist at the Foreign Press Association yesterday, he was quick to set the record straight. Portillo noted that an Eton master had written to the Evening Standard to confirm his version of the events. But when Observer contacted the Standard last night, no one could find the letter. Typical.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Letter: Many in US fear the prospect of trade 'free riders' Sir, Your recent coverage of US initiatives in the Gatt services negotiations has left many of us here in America wondering aloud whether our years of vocal support for liberalised trade have been heard. The US service sector remains a steadfast supporter of the Uruguay Round negotiations, and has never waivered from its goal of a strong multilateral agreement that assures markets will be open for service providers to compete on a fair and equitable basis. Under the structure of the services agreement contained in the so-called draft 'Final Act', the degree to which it assures open markets depends on the commitments inscribed in the contracting parties' schedules. The services agreement, unlike the Gatt itself, does not assure national treatment or end quantitative restrictions, and does not even presume that foreign providers have a right to compete in other markets. Market access commitments offered by individual countries are the only means of securing these and other trade liberalising results. Compared with the markets of many other countries, the US is largely open for business. Commitments to match our openness in services have not been forthcoming, and we are faced with the prospect of what is referred to here as a 'free rider' problem. Free riders are countries which would enjoy the benefits of an open US market, but make little or no commitment to open their own markets. Under these conditions, unless the US removes some sectors from the unconditional Most Favoured Nation obligation that forms the basis of trading relationships under the Gatt, the final General Agreement on Trade in Services, or Gats, will perpetuate that inequity. The US list of MFN exemptions has proved too tempting a target for other country negotiators who would seek to shift the blame for stalling the talks to the US. In fact, the US exemption list is a surprise to no one, and represents only our government's response should no commitments be forthcoming. The US private service sector will continue to push for market access commitments from our trading partners. We want liberalised trade, and we would welcome market access negotiations to reduce the list of exemptions. But we cannot and will not support a Gats agreement that fails to achieve real market access. It would serve neither the interests of the global trading system, nor those of US business.

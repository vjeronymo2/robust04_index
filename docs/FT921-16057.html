			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Arts: Patronage should be appreciated - Christie's and Sotheby's January exhibitions Each January in what is the close season in the salerooms, Sotheby's and Christie's make over their empty galleries to a worthy cause. This time the beneficiary at Christie's (King Street, St James's SW1, until January 24) is the National Art Collections Fund which, since the beginning of the century, has been raising money entirely by private subscription to help our national collections acquire those objects and works of art that are their raison d'etre. Since the passage of such things supplies the host's own raison d'etre, such help treads the nicest line between disinterest and natural sympathy. But it cannot be emphasised too strongly that the NACF, in these straitened and philistine times, needs all the help it can get. Yet with The New Patrons, (sponsored by Nuclear Electric, with help in kind from Momart and Lowndes Lambert Cargo), rather than blow its own trumpet, the NACF has chosen to make the further point: that true patronage is never the preserve of the public body. The best support the artist can be offered is the most direct: the commission or purchase of his work, not out of any sense of public duty but rather for immediate pleasure and appreciation it affords. Patronage and self-interest indeed march easily together. The New Patrons of the title are those companies and corporations that have bought contemporary works or art for offices and boardrooms, for the enhancement, as the jargon has it, of the working environment. Not that the workers always appreciate this, but then a remark of the late David Donald, responsible for the development of the collection of Scottish art at Robert Fleming Holdings, the best such in private hands, should be remembered. He said that complaints were usual at first but it was best to ignore them, for they would be fiercer when the time came for a rehang and the work's removal. My own experience here at the Financial Times, bears out the truth of it. The fact is that it is both a joy and a privilege to live and work, not with the shadow and reproduction of a work of art, but with the thing itself. But privilege has its duties, and works of art require time and attention if they are to give up their secrets. That attention need not be direct, indeed is likely to be the deeper for being subconscious. I doubt that any of the companies represented in this exhibition, or those many more that would willingly have taken part had there been room, once committed to a collection has had the least reservation or regret. Each collection has its own reason, its founding purpose, its rationale. Many were born of the plausible excuse, argued significantly often by a single enthusiastic chairman or director - Lord Croft at De Beers', Lord Drogheda at the FT, Cob Stenham at Unilever, Mr Donald at Flemings - of a new building to furnish and decorate. Some grew out of personal and family interests - Baring Brothers; some were put together almost at once with the professional advice of the Contemporary Art Society - Unilever, De Beer's; some grew slowly and are now largely static - the FT; some continue spectacularly to grow - Flemings; some are barely begun - InterCity. There is no pattern, nor should there be. The show itself is a wonderfully heterodox compendium of 20th century British art, as various in its taste and interests as the companies concerned. In the particular it offers works of the highest quality, of the earlier periods especially, by such as Peploe, Fergusson and Cadell, by Wadsworth and Roberts, Sickert and Redpath, Burra, Lamb, Nicholson, Vaughan, Auerbach, Freud. That so many of them should have been picked up for more or less a song and are now worth at least an opera or two, should only serve to encourage them all, even like Robert Hiscox (Hiscox Holdings) in defiance of his accountants, to keep on collecting, and every other company too. From Auerbach and Bellany to Rego and Wonnacott, there is an awful lot of good British art about. The show at Sotheby's is given over not to a good cause as such, but to an artist not so much neglected as tucked up in his tight technical box and so put critically to one side. Lawrence Whistler is now 80, and celebrates with a small but fully representative and exquisitely chosen retrospective of his work as an engraver on glass (34 New Bond Street W1, until January 24). The imagery speaks of the generation which formed him as an artist, neo-romantic with a touch of surrealism, with all the close focus and density of detail of the pre-war British print. Yet convincing and enchanting as these images are of an ideal and visionary world, the more intriguing aspect of the work is the formal invention and technical command that allow those images expression. To establish a convincing pictorial space on a plane surface is problem enough: to do so on the concave inside of a goblet, and further to exploit the thickness of the glass itself by working the outer convex surface, boggles any thought of imitation. Any bending or twisting surface is bad enough, but given a reasonably consistent viewpoint, as with a fresco high up in the cupola of a church, the problem is not irresolvable. But a goblet or bowl presents itself to us every way, and its profile changes as it swoops down and up again the other side. And yet the image it carries hovers bright and consistent before us, oddly like a hologram in the darkness. Quite remarkable.</p>

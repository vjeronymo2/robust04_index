			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Assistance for Maxwell pensioners kept to minimum THE GOVERNMENT is not prepared to do more than meet its statutory requirement to pay the state guaranteed minimum pension to members of the various Maxwell company pension schemes, Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, told a Commons select committee. Mr Newton said he and representatives of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury met 10 days ago with trustees and administrators of the Maxwell schemes and told them that pensioners would receive the guaranteed minimum if pension fund assets had disappeared. 'I don't see a possibility of going beyond that,' he said. He added neither the trustees of Mirror Group Newspapers nor the administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation had discussed their plans to wind up their respective schemes. 'Those concerned had a divided opinion on the effects of winding up.' Last Friday, MGN announced it would wind up its existing pension scheme and begin a new one, paving the way for the government to supplement the fund by providing the guaranteed minimum for members. Meanwhile, Mr Newton ducked MPs' questions about the type of pension law reform - if any - under consideration by the government. 'The government's position is that we need to see the report of the Serious Fraud Office before we can decide what issues need to be addressed, he said. Separately, Mr Newton said that the Department of Social Security and the Occupational Pensions Board were preparing rules to improve the information which must be disclosed to pension fund members.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Arts: Thomas Bernhard - enfant terrible of European theatre 'I despise actors', wrote the dramatist Thomas Bernhard, 'indeed I hate them, for they ally themselves at the least sign of danger with the audience and betray the author and completely identify with stupidity and feeblemindedness . . . they are the true gravediggers of literature. Minetti is the exception'. He may have hated them, but since his death in 1989, Bernhard has become the adored enfant terrible of contemporary European theatre, his cantankerous eloquence sung out by actors in Vienna, Berlin, Paris. In particular, there is a small feast of works about the loathed profession. Minetti, inspired by Bernhard's favourite German actor, 86-year-old Bernard Minetti, opened this week in a stylish French version by the Nouveau Theatre de Belgique in Brussels, and recasts Minetti as the quintessential Bernhard type: a pessimist on the fringe of the establishment, bitter, raging, penalised for seeing the truth. This Minetti arrives in a New Year's Eve snowstorm in Ostend and shelters in a hotel where 30 years ago he met the Belgian artist James Ensor and commissioned from him a mask of Lear. Now an old actor cast out of Germany, he dreams of a rendez-vous with a director who will offer him the part of Lear. While he waits and remembers, fantastical masked figures from the past swarm on and offstage, whirling him up into a mad carnival. Henri Rosne, veteran director of seven Bernhard works, is here in his element, getting to the heart of the play through a particularised Belgian setting. His phantom revellers are embodiments of James Ensor's paintings, resembling harlequins from Ensor's 'La Gamme d'Amour'. They come in fur and satin, stage outfits and dinner suits; a dwarf in pink knickerbockers and top hat dolefully joins the procession; they burst into Rosne's haute bourgeois hotel - all mahogany bars and art deco furniture - and dance on the orderly seafront promenade, breaking up the silence and snow as they spin round Minetti, now mad, enacting Lear's scene on the heath. Rosne's set, breathtaking in the sensuous but stifling elegance of every detail, evokes exactly Bernhard's claustrophobic world view: when Minetti praises Ostend as a place to 'respirer l'air anglais', you almost feel the relief of English liberalism wafting across the Channel. Into this propriety, Rene Hainaux's Minetti spurts blood and thunder, then dissolves into mockery, spitting consonants and elongating vowels into nonsense rhymes, swooning off in a jokey drawl ('c'est l'Angleterre que je prefere: Shakespeare et Scotland Yard'). He hugs the suitcase containing the mask, symbol of exile and dreams, and suggests at once his own absurdity and the frenzied love of life that has turned to savage disappointment: a tragic hero floundering in a 'comedie misanthrope'. It is a deeply touching portrait of the artist as old man, as madman, as everyman caught between sanity and insanity, reality and fiction. Bernhard's extraordinary ability is to distil nihilism into a concrete picture of an individual's meaningless life, and to make us care desperately about that life. While the Bernhard of the novels can read like a monster of middle European gloom, a rich production - this one from Rosne, or Claus Peymann's Heldenplatz, hit of the German World Drama Festival last summer - is a shimmer of contrasts: the warmth of character and luxurious precision of setting versus the uncompromising voice calling out that all this is hollow and foolish. At the Vienna Burgtheater, desperation and madness are fixed into the tangible reality of parochial upper class Vienna in Peymann's production of Ritter Dene Voss, named after three Burgtheater stars. Voss is Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Ritter and Dene are his two sisters trapped in a paralysing relationship with their brilliant/lunatic brother. Each character is shown as the victim of his own fictions; conversation shifts between staccato exchanges and a kind of stream-of-consciousness monologue which each of the family picks up like a madrigal, individual variations expressing dissonance but the whole symbolising their helpless unity. Over them hangs the spectre of Ludwig's bullying doctors whose 'establishment' corruption is slowly unveiled. Peymann's intense, ironic production comes to northern Europe next month; a French production of the play, Dejeuner avec Ludwig W, is currently enjoying a successful run in Paris. English theatres have been missing out, but a translation of three Bernhard plays - the popular Der Theatermacher (Histrionics), also about an actor, Ritter Dene Voss and A Party for Boris - is published this week (Quartet, Pounds 19.95). Peter Jansen and Kenneth Northcott's version is a model of drama in translation; they retain the musicality and edgy comedy of Bernhard's prose-poetry, and even in reading the colour and wit underlining the seriousness shine through. Bernhard's drama, turning nihilism and dissonance into entertainment, is unique in European theatre: what a pleasure to have at last the chance of an English production.</p>

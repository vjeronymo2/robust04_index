			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Low forecast for training Many employers plan to spend no more - and some will spend less - on training in the next 20 years, says a report today from Huthwaite, the training organisation. The survey involved directors and senior managers from 150 companies employing about 2.5m people. They were asked to assess the competitive skills and training challenges facing their companies. Twenty-five per cent of employers intended to spend no more on training while 5 per cent said they intended to spend less. Only 12 per cent forecast a big increase. Companies appear to be introducing cheaper forms of training. More coaching by line managers and supervisors will be the most popular development method while classroom training will tend towards short and frequent modular programmes. 'Open' or 'distance' learning - in which an individual typically learns at his or her own pace from a package - will continue to grow in significance. Questioned about business organisation, respondents said that new employment practices, such as part - time working or job-sharing, would not in themselves do much to solve the unemployment problem as they did not anticipate a wholesale switch to these. 20:20 Vision. Huthwaite, Hoober House, Wentworth, Rotherham, South Yorks. Pounds 150.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Syria has rejected Prime Minister Rabin's proposals  to change the format of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. An  official Syrian spokesman has said that secret talks and  separate agreements will weaken the Arabs and allow Israel to  force its terms on them.    The Syrian spokesman further said that the agreement Israel  signed with the PLO did not lead to peace. Rather, it  complicated the situation and increased the agony of the Arabs  in the territories.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television The Grateful Dead are definitely a good thing. This archetypal sixties rock band has always been known to be generous with its time - they invariably play for over three hours to their besotted and faithful fans. Now Arena (BBC 2 at 9.30) reveals that they are equally generous with their money, establishing the Rex Foundation to help indigent composers. British composers in the classical tradition like James Dillon and Robert Simpson are able to keep going thanks to donations from the Dead. Two contrasting new series appear on Channel 4. In Gardens Without Borders at 9.00 designer Alan Mason starts a tour of the grandest French gardens while the return of Absolutely at 10.30 will appeal to comedy lovers untroubled by a Scottish accent. It is a hit or miss affair, but the frantic pace disguises many of the no-nos. For some people Heimat, a 16-hour epic about life in a small German village between 1919 and 1982, is one of the greatest movies of all time. You can judge at 11.00, when BBC 2 screens the first, two-hour episode. The reward for anyone hooked is that director Edgar Reitz's sequel will be shown this year.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / People: Geologist and engineer come on board M Rothschild is expanding its small coterie of managing directors from four to six, promoting two men who could not be less like the stereotype merchant banker - a geologist and a mechanical engineer and neither educated at Oxbridge. Welshman Keith Palmer, 45, the grandson of a miner, is the bank's natural resources expert, and has been responsible for building up Rothschild's corporate and project finance business in the energy, mining and utilities sectors, both in the UK and abroad. Currently looking after the British Coal mandate, Palmer (right) has also brought in plenty of overseas business; last year the UK merchant bank was financial adviser on Argentina's Dollars 3.99bn Gas del Estado deal, which was the largest energy privatisation outside the UK. Before joining Rothschild's in 1984, Palmer, who took a degree in geology from Birmingham University, had spent four years in the energy department of the World Bank. Earlier experience included a year with the IMF, two years in Tanzania and four years with the finance ministry in Papua New Guinea. He works within the corporate finance department; the divisional head, Russell Edey, is already a managing director. Meanwhile, John Bishop, the 39-year-old in charge of treasury and bullion, is a mechanical engineer from University College, London. He spent two years with Babcock &amp; Wilcox before joining Rothschilds in 1977, where he has spent his entire career on the treasury side. Treasury was the only division not represented at managing director level. The other mds are Tony Alt, heading up the capital markets side, Bernard Myers in charge of international and David Sullivan running the banking division. The bank denies that this round of promotions holds any wider significance in terms of flagging an heir apparent. 'There are plenty of family members around,' says a spokesman, referring to David de Rothschild, deputy chairman under Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, and Amschel Rothschild, recently elevated to executive chairman of Rothschild Asset Management.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui on  Thursday [24 February] pledged to do everything in his power to  heal the national wounds caused by the Feb. 28, 1947 killing of  Taiwan civilians by government troops.    "I fully understand that to heal the wounds is a very  difficult task, but I will do my best," Li said while meeting a  group of families whose relatives were killed during the  incident.    It is still unknown how many people were killed in the  incident, which Li said was triggered by a misunderstanding  between native Taiwanese and Chinese who had fled communist rule.    According to an estimate by an ad hoc committee formed by  the  Executive Yuan to deal with fallout from the incident, between  18,000 to 28,000 people -- mostly Taiwanese -- were killed.    Li said the incident was indeed a "tragedy" that he  regretted. But he stressed that the government has been active  in recent years in trying to soothe the spirits of the deceased  and compensate their families, pointing to the building of a  monument commemorating the victims and the appointment of a  special task force to handle related affairs.    Li promised to lead a memorial service when the monument is  completed next year.    Prof. Lin Tsung-yi, who represents families of the victims  on  the Executive Yuan's special committee, gave a positive  appraisal of what the government has done to assuage the  families, and thanked Li for the concern he has shown.    Li also guaranteed that he would push for passage of a bill  regarding compensation to the victims' families. The bill had  passed a first reading at the legislature, but was shelved when  the families demanded more money.    Many of those in attendance at the meeting [words  indistinct]  sobbed when recalling events of the historic day.</p>

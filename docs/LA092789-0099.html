			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN OFFERS IDEAS TO END OPEC DEADLOCK;  </P> <P> TALKS EXTENDED TO TAKE UP PROPOSAL THAT FAVORS BIG PRODUCERS  </P> <P> OPEC oil ministers Tuesday extended their talks to a fifth day after Iran put  up surprise proposals to end a deadlock on assigning production quotas among  its members.  </P> <P> Delegates of Iran told lobby reporters that higher world petroleum prices was  one goal.  </P> <P> The 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have been  stymied for four days trying to agree on output quotas to remove excess supply  from the world market.  </P> <P> Iran's initiative led to a full session of the conference due Tuesday night to  be put off until this morning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kuwait, UAE Favored  </P> <P> "Maybe the ideas need to be cooked a little more," said Iraqi minister Issam  Abdul-Rahim Chalabi, adding that some delegations would contact their  governments for instructions.  </P> <P> The Iranian formula seems to favor the big Gulf producers with some of the  poorer, debt-laden Third World OPEC members likely to get smaller increases in  their mandated quotas. It drew a mixed initial reaction, delegates said.  </P> <P> Those getting special treatment would include Kuwait and the United Arab  Emirates, whose demands to sell more oil and open violations of existing quotas  are the hot issues at the talks.  </P> <P> A conference dispute flared between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Saudis say they are tired of seeing quota busters help themselves to sales  of oil and, in the process, put enough excess on the market to keep prices  below an OPEC target of an average $18 per barrel.  </P> <P> The problem for OPEC is that it can't -- for fear of flooding the market -- set  a ceiling on its total output high enough to fit the sales ambitions of Kuwait  and the UAE into the quota system without others conceding percentage market  share.  </P> <P> The three biggest OPEC producers, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, are among those  who refuse to surrender any share of overall output.  </P> <P> But they would not do so under the reallocation now suggested by Iranian  minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh, according to Iranian delegates.  </P> <P> Their share would stay the same while smaller producers Algeria, Nigeria,  Indonesia, Libya and Venezuela would make the concessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increase for 3  </P> <P> Three other smaller exporters, Ecuador, Gabon and Qatar, which also contend  that their existing quotas are unjustly low, would get disproportionate  increases like those for Kuwait and the UAE.  </P> <P> The trick would be to set the ceiling on total volume high enough to ensure  that all of the 13 members got at least some volume increase -- but low enough  to achieve a boost in prices as a bait for those who lost on the percentage  game.  </P> <P> A Gulf delegate said he understood that Kuwait would get 1.35 million barrels  daily -- which it says it wants -- and so would the UAE. But the UAE wants  more.  </P> <P> An Iranian delegate said Saudi Arabia may accept the idea as long as it keeps  its historic 25% share.  </P></p>

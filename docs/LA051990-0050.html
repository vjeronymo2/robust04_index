			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS STATE SENATE;  </P> <P> GUIDE TO DISTRICT 22;  </P> <P> OVERVIEW  </P> <P> The Democratic primary race in state Senate District 22 pits political newcomer  William Graysen, the lawyer who defended Zsa Zsa Gabor, against longtime  Westside lawmaker Herschel Rosenthal. Rosenthal has close ties to the so-called  Berman-Waxman machine named for Reps. Howard L. Berman, (D-Panorama City) and  Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles). Graysen is a maverick running a grass-roots  campaign, and who admits he rarely answers political questionnaires because he  prefers speaking directly to the public.  </P> <P> Contenders  </P> <P> William Graysen, 37, a Democrat, has been a criminal defense lawyer for 11  years with the downtown Los Angeles firm of Graysen &amp; Kaplan. This is his  first bid for public office. Graysen received his undergraduate degree in  political science from UCLA and his law degree from the University of West Los  Angeles School of Law. He and his wife, Susan, a psychologist, have two  children, Elizabeth, 12, and Broc, 10. They live in Cheviot Hills.  </P> <P> Herschel Rosenthal, 72, is a West Los Angeles Democrat who has served in the  state Senate since 1982. Before that, he was an assemblyman for eight years. He  is chairman of the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee, and chairman  of the Joint Committee on Energy Regulation and the Environment. A Boyle  Heights native, Rosenthal attended the UCLA School of Engineering. He entered  politics 35 years ago as a Los Angeles city commissioner for the Community  Redevelopment Agency. He and his wife, Pat, have two grown children.  </P> <P> Republican Michael Schrager and Peace and Freedom candidate Margery Hinds are  unopposed in their primaries. Their names will appear on the general election  ballot in November.  </P> <P> Questionnaire  </P> <P> Questionnaires were distributed to candidates in contested primary races and  were returned this month. Answers have been edited to fit the available space.  </P> <P> Q. Under recently introduced legislation, state sales taxes would be raised  0.25% for 10 years to help finance school construction. Do you favor an  increase in sales taxes to underwrite new school construction?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. An initiative measure on the June ballot would raise taxes on gasoline sales  by nine cents a gallon to finance highway projects. Do you support the concept  of higher gas taxes to underwrite road construction?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first  three months of pregnancy?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support capital punishment?  </P> <P> Graysen: No.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support the idea of breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School  District into smaller districts?  </P> <P> Graysen: No.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Undecided. Needs more examination.  </P> <P> Q. Under current law, the state Legislature is responsible for redrawing state  legislative and congressional district boundaries. Do you believe this system  should be changed?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes. The governor, Assembly speaker, president pro tem of the Senate  and chief justice should each choose three citizens, for a committee of 12, to  draw districts.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: No. Essentially, the so-called reforms move the process one step  further away from the people.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support the so-called "Big Green" ballot initiative, which would  eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000, phase out pesticides  known to cause cancer and require that trees be planted in all new  developments?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. Do you think the state should require private employers to subsidize  day-care services for employees who request them?  </P> <P> Graysen: No. The state ought to provide day care on a sliding scale, supported  by the general tax base.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Yes, for businesses with more than 25 employees.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support the state's efforts to build prisons in Lancaster and East  Los Angeles?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Left unanswered. This prison would already be built if not for the  governor's bowing to developer interests in Lancaster.  </P> <P> Q. Proposition 112 on the June ballot would ban speaking fees and limit gifts  to state legislators while creating a commission that could pave the way for  higher legislative salaries. Do you support this ballot initiative?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes. Conflict of interest in the Legislature must be avoided.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Yes. In the Legislature, I argued for separating the salary issue  from the ban and gift limits.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support Gov. Deukmejian's proposed constitutional changes that would  require state prison inmates to work in privately sponsored industries to pay  for their incarceration?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Left unanswered.  </P> <P> Q. Do you believe our present system of criminal prosecution, interdiction of  supplies and imprisonment of users and dealers will ever significantly reduce  the level of drug use in the United States?  </P> <P> If no, what should be done?  </P> <P> Graysen: No. The demand for drugs should be lessened by education and improved  social conditions.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: No. All of the above, with an infusion of money for early education  and rehabilitation.  </P> <P> Q. Would you consider the possibility of decriminalizing the use of drugs?  </P> <P> Graysen: No.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support raising sales or other taxes to finance anti-drug law  enforcement efforts and/or anti-drug education programs?  </P> <P> If yes, by how much?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes. One percent to start; more later if effective.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Not a sales tax. Certain kinds of taxes would be acceptable.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support full or partial  </P> <P> public funding of political campaigns?  </P> <P> Graysen: No. It would unfairly favor powerful candidates.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: No. People should have the ability to decide which candidates get  their money.  </P> <P> Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit foreign individuals  and corporations from owning land in California. Do you support this?  </P> <P> Graysen: No.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: No.  </P> <P> Q. Rising property values in the Santa Monica Mountains have made it more  difficult for state and federal parks agencies to buy land for public use. Land  prices have escalated in part because local officials have allowed developers  to build more houses than provided for under zoning laws. To keep property  prices more affordable to parks agencies, should governments in Los Angeles and  Ventura counties refuse such so-called "up-zoning?"  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes. The great beauty of the Santa Monica Mountains must be preserved.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Yes. The mountains are a non-renewable natural resource which should  be preserved for the public and not compromised for the wealthy few.  </P> <P> Q. Are you willing to publicly release your tax returns and those of your  spouse before the election?  </P> <P> Graysen: No.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Yes.  </P> <P> Q. A development project called Porter Ranch would create 3,395 residential  units and nearly 6 million square feet of commercial office space in the  Chatsworth hills. Opponents say it is too big. Proponents say it represents  orderly growth. Do you support the project at this size?  </P> <P> Graysen: No.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: No.  </P> <P> Q. Do you support limits on the number of terms state legislators can serve?  </P> <P> If yes, how long should they be?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: No.  </P> <P> Q. A ballot initiative now in circulation would prohibit the spraying of  pesticides on private property without the written consent of the owner. Do you  support this measure?  </P> <P> Graysen: Yes.  </P> <P> Rosenthal: Yes.  </P></p>

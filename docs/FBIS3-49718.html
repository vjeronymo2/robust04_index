			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["F.J.Gy.-K.T."-initialled interview with Hungarian </F> President Arpad Goncz; place and date not given: "Goncz: The  Visegrad Cooperation Cannot Be Buried"]    [Text] [NEPSZABADSAG] Before Prague, and now at Prague  too, many people were burying the Visegrad cooperation. From  the very beginning, you have been a great supporter of this  integration initiative. How do you see all this now as  reflected in the current summit?    [Goncz] I would not say that the Visegrad cooperation was  buried in Prague, because this is the regional cooperation of  four given countries. In my opinion, this summit gave an  impetus to this cooperation; it will probably accelerate it, or  at least will increase the desire for economic cooperation. At  the same time, this summit could bring the region's stability  closer by the emergence of a negotiating mechanism capable of  solving the possible differences of views. Thus, the common  work of the four definitely contributes to the stability of the  region and plays a balancing role in Central Europe.    [NEPSZABADSAG] However, the Czech leaders openly say that  they have something else in mind and, for some time, they have  practically refrained from uttering the word Visegrad.    [Goncz] It makes no difference whatsoever if someone  mentions Visegrad or not. The essential think today is that the  forms of cooperation have emerged and, although not a security  guarantee, the region received the possibility of a negotiating  mechanism that has a balancing power in itself.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Should one fear that rivalry in Central  Europe might even accelerate after the acceptance of the  Partnership of Peace program?    [Goncz] Yes, there will obviously be criteria here, and the  compatibility of the countries in the region for closer  cooperation with NATO will be examined also from a military  viewpoint. Given the fact that these conditions have not been  formulated at this summit, and they will probably be formulated  later, I cannot tell which country will be the first to join.  Honestly speaking, I think this is a rather secondary issue,  because the stability of the region itself if what matters. I  interpret security in a much broader sense than only military  security. Naturally, NATO is an extremely important element of  European security, but it does not replace an all-European  security system. The way I see it, we have now made a step  forward in this direction, and a considerable step at that.    [NEPSZABADSAG] President Walesa made a particularly dramatic  statement before the meeting. What was your impression about  the Polish attitude in Prague?    [Goncz] My impression is that Lech Walesa came with the most  colorful proposals to Prague. Naturally, it was impossible to  debate these proposals in detail, but this can obviously be done  at a later date.    [NEPSZABADSAG] Does your meeting with Michal Kovac represent  any progress in the Hungarian-Slovak relations?    [Goncz] This was a really important meeting, and it was held  in a very good atmosphere. From Michal Kovac's words, I think  the most important is that they are trying to solve the issues  in harmony with the ideas of the Hungarian minority, and not by  excluding this national minority. This was not my first meeting  with Mr Kovac; I am absolutely convinced of his good will; he  spoke wise and well-thought words. The invitation to come to  Budapest continues to be valid, and I hope that this visit will  take place soon.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Government ready to name Nolan's nine The government last night invited leading figures from the worlds of politics, academia and business to join the Nolan committee investigating standards of conduct in public life. Amid continuing allegations of sleaze against ministers, the leaders of the three main political parties yesterday held negotiations over the membership of the committee to be headed by Lord Nolan, a leading Law lord. Each party leader has nominated a parliamentarian from within its own ranks to sit on the committee, which will produce its first report within six months. It is understood that the government had asked Mr Tom King, the former Northern Ireland Secretary, to be the Conservative party's nominee. Mr Peter Shore, the former cabinet minister, has been nominated by Labour and Lord Thomson of Monifieth, the former chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, was nominated by the Liberal Democrats. The committee will also include six figures from outside parliament to examine whether the rules relating to the conduct of MPs, ministers and civil servants need to be tightened up. Downing Street was still finalising the committee membership last night. However, the prime minister, who drew up the list with Lord Nolan at a meeting on Wednesday, is understood to have invited the following leading figures to join the committee: Sir Martin Jacomb, the 64-year old chairman of the British Council and former chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd; Sir William Utting, former chief inspector at the Department of Health; Ms Diana Warwick, the chief executive of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy and former general secretary of the Association of University Teachers; Mr Anthony King, professor of government at Essex University; and Sir Clifford Boulton, the retiring Clerk of the House of Commons. A tenth member of the committee is also due to be appointed, and is likely to be a leading figure from the civil service. Negotiations over the membership of the committee coincided with signs that the government and the Labour party were trying to strike a deal over the conduct of the Commons privileges committee, which is examining the cash-for-questions affair. Both sides were yesterday continuing talks to arrive at a compromise over how the committee should conduct its hearings into whether Tory MPs were paid cash to ask the questions. Last week, all seven Labour MPs on the committee withdrew after Tory members secured a vote to hold the sessions in private.</p>

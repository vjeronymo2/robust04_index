			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Canon rises 3.9% before tax CANON, the Japanese precision instrument maker, yesterday announced a 3.9 per cent rise in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y76.1bn (Dollars 618.7m) for the year ended last December, thanks to continued strong sales of its computer printers using new bubble jet and laser technology. The company's announcement comes at a time when profits at Japanese high-technology companies are being squeezed by sluggish exports and lower profit margins. Sales at Canon rose 15.3 per cent to Y1,073.4bn from Y931.30bn. Canon said that sales of its office automation machinery, including its computer printers, which rose 13 per cent to Y793bn, helped sustain profits. Camera sales increased 25 per cent to Y220.7bn. Exports rose 18 per cent to Y812.7bn, while domestic sales rose 7 per cent to Y260.6bn. The company suffered exchange rate losses due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar, but interest received on deposits rose by 18.4 per cent to Y25.7bn due to higher interest rates and an increase in short-term funds due to warrant-bond issues worth Y100bn. For the current year Canon expects a slowdown in sales and profit growth, with a 1.1 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y77bn on a 7.1 per cent rise in sales to Y1,150bn. Canon expects to maintain capital investment at high levels at Y75bn, a 5.4 per cent increase from the previous year.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Up and away for celebratory BA - The Bottom Line BRITISH AIRWAYS celebrated the fifth anniversary of its privatisation in style this week. At a time when most other international airlines are continuing to report heavy losses, BA surprised the market by announcing a fivefold increase in third quarter pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m. Buoyed by this impressive performance, its continuing merger negotiations with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and talk of a possible investment in the French regional carrier TAT, BA shares hit their all time high. Anybody who had bought the airline's shares at their original offer price of 125p in February 1987 would have more than doubled their money. The shares ended the week at 254p. All the signs point to further gains. After outperforming the competition, BA is strongly placed to take advantage of an eventual recovery in the airline business, although the timing of a sustained traffic upturn remains uncertain. 'They have managed to maintain a good increase in passenger and cargo yields despite the lack of full fare paying traffic in a very difficult period,' says James Halstead, airline analyst at Hoare Govett. 'They also managed to pull through their cost reduction programme last year and they will clearly be in a good position when the industry finally comes out of recession,' he added. Although the company benefited from lower jet fuel prices and favourable currency exchange fluctuations, its profits also reflected the cost cutting drive launched by the airline well before the outbreak of the Gulf crisis which sent the industry in a tail spin last year. The airline reduced its staff by 10.9 per cent last year from 54,665 to 48,728 employees worldwide. Productivity was increased by 11.4 per cent. And the company is continuing to maintain a tight handle on costs. 'In these uncertain conditions, it is essential to seek further cost savings,' Lord King, BA's chairman, said this week. The other important factor, which contributed to the better than expected performance, was the company's ability to improve its yields. This was the fruit of BA's sophisticated yield management system designed to get the optimum return out of its aircraft and its refusal to engage in suicidal price discounting. Apart from the general air travel slump, BA also faced last year the arrival of stronger American competition on its important transatlantic routes with the start-up of services by United Airlines and American Airlines to Heathrow, BA's London home base. BA has so far managed to fend off the initial attack from the US megacarriers, maintaining its 40 per cent share of the UK-US market. But the UK airline is bracing itself for a new onslaught from its American competitors. BA's financial performance in a particularly tough year (pre-tax profits are likely to total around Pounds 280m-Pounds 285m for the year ending March 1992 compared with Pounds 130m the year before) is expected to strengthen the company's hand in its current merger negotiations with KLM. The negotiations have entered a critical stage as the two parties continue to argue over the precise degree of ownership and control for the combined airline operations which would create a giant new carrier. BA is understood to be seeking 80 per cent ownership but would perhaps settle for 70 per cent, while KLM is currently insisting on 60 per cent for BA and 40 per cent for the smaller Dutch carrier. 'As long as BA is not greedy, the deal has strong chances of going ahead,' one City analyst said. Failure to deliver the deal is likely to disappoint the market and impact BA's shares. But if the merger succeeds, it would give the shares a big boost. The City sees substantial benefits for both BA and KLM. Rationalisation could provide up to Pounds 500m in annual cost savings. It would give BA a new European hub in Amsterdam. The new combination would become a strong competitor not only against other big carriers but also against smaller, more cost efficient airlines. It would also accelerate the overall consolidation of the industry around a few large airline groups. For Lord King it would complete his ambition to transform BA into a truly global airline. It could also be his swan song. At 74, he may decide to step down at the end of this year when his current mandate runs out. He would have successfully piloted the company through its initial restructuring leading to privatisation and then, during the last two years, through the worst period in modern aviation history. There are already strong indications that Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive and deputy chairman, will succeed him. But BA has always been idiosyncratic. It also has a habit of springing surprises, like this week's bumper third quarter profits.</p>

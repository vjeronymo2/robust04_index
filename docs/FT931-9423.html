			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Sport: On course in Florida - John Hopkins visits two resorts which were almost destroyed by debt / Golf SHOULD YOU meet Chris Blackman, an American, who is a bit of a bandit off his handicap of 12, you could ask him what it was like to be at school with Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader. 'Paddy was a handful' Blackman recalled. 'I used to keep him under control by flicking a wet towel with a knot in it at him. I found that kept him in line.' Or you could ask Blackman about the collapse of the Savings &amp; Loans institutions in the US. This financial crisis affected many golf-based properties such as Lake Nona, the resort on the outskirts of Orlando, Florida, which Sunleys, the British building company, started constructing in the early 1980s. But whereas the Sunleys experienced considerable financial turbulence at Lake Nona as a result of the S &amp; L crisis, Blackman benefited from it. He and his associates bought Grand Harbor, a resort 85 miles north of Palm Beach, for a song from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the federal government body set up to bail out casualties of the S &amp; L collapse. When Grand Harbor got into difficulties after the New Jersey Savings and Loan lent Dollars 125m (Pounds 83m) for its development and, perhaps as a consequence, went bust, Blackman and his associates bid Dollars 34m for the project. Florida has dozens of large resorts, many of them on the east coast where they are warmed by the Gulf Stream. Grand Harbor, which is in a small town called Vero Beach, 100 miles south of Orlando, is different from many in that it offers a 144-berth marina and a beach club as well as two golf courses, one designed by Pete Dye, the other by Joe Lee. To pay for all this, they offer for sale or rent hundreds of apartments, villas and town houses dotted around the 900-acre site. Vero Beach is best known as the pre-season home of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. It is a small community of fewer than 10,000 that sprang up originally because the railway and US1, the main north-south road, passed through. Citrus grows in abundance. Like many places in Florida, Vero Beach tends to be populated by the elderly who have moved south for their retirement. They are known, not very flatteringly, as VND, very near death. What marks out Grand Harbor is a run of four holes, the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th on its River Course, that are the equal of any four successive holes anywhere in the US. They grabbed my attention because they are so unlike the conventional Florida golf hole. They look superb, thanks to the imaginative use of the protected wetlands, and are demanding to play. The 14th is one of the best holes I have played, requiring length, accuracy and nerve to cover its 550 yards. It is the only par five hole on which I have had to lay up with my second shot. Anyone who plays these four holes without losing a ball or in level par is either a touring professional or playing better than he knows how. After tangling with this course, I had to pay Dollars 20 to Blackman who had played well below his handicap. As he pocketed my money, he impressed on me the advantages of buying a property at Grand Harbor. 'The climate's great' he said. 'The Gulf Stream is only one mile off shore, compared with nine miles at Palm Beach and 60 at Jacksonville, which is why it is so warm here. And real estate in Florida has rocketed in value. As Willie Nelson says in that song, they don't make land any more, so it will appreciate. A property worth Dollars 15,000 20 years ago would now be worth Dollars 700,000.' The Sunleys project at Lake Nona is a very British venture. Mike Hughesdon, a past captain of Sunningdale, seemed to win every club competition in the first few years. Denis Thatcher and former minister Lord Young were in at the birth of the club. The professionalis Gregor Jamieson, whose father Bob has been pro at the Turnberry hotel since before the flood. 'The appeal of our golf club is that it is an understated decent sort of establishment' said James Sunley, a director of the family company. 'It is not like walking in to a rather over-the-top American golf club.' Golf Magazine ranks the 18 holes designed by Tom Fazio at Lake Nona as the 37th best course in the US. They skirt the lakes that dominate this property and wind through stands of pines where white tail deer and red fox roam. David Leadbetter, the renowned golf teacher, has his school at Lake Nona. Lake Nona was thrown into confusion late in 1989 when the Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan Association went bust. 'We were into a desperate period trying to renegotiate a loan while at the same time wondering whether we were throwing good money after bad,' said Sunley. 'Eventually, we concluded a refinancing deal in August in 1992 and we're going flat-out again.' The World Cup, the two-man team event, will be held at Lake Nona in November.

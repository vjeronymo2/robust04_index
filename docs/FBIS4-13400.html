It resulted in their  arrest and the confiscation of quantities of arms.    The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the clash took place  a few days ago and that a member of the patrol was wounded. It  was discovered that the two detained men belong to the group of  10 arrested last week on charges of forming a banned  organization and planning to carry out terrorist actions inside  Jordan. The sources said that the clash took place in a suburb  west of the Jordanian capital, Amman, in Mahalah called Wadi  al-Sir. [passage omitted]</p>

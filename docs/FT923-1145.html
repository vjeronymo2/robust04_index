			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Huntleigh progress continues with interim jump to Pounds 2.35m PROGRESS AT Huntleigh Technology, the USM-quoted medical equipment manufacturer, continued in the first half of 1992 with pre-tax profits jumping from Pounds 932,000 to Pounds 2.35m, a figure almost 2 per cent higher than the full-year outcome in 1991. The interim dividend is more than doubled to 4p (1.75p), payable from earnings ahead to 17.02p (7.02p) per share. Mr Rolf Schild, chairman, said the board's policy was for the total dividend to be at least 3.5 times covered. The shares rose 38p to close at 718p. Turnover rose 33 per cent to Pounds 13m (Pounds 9.8m), though Mr Schild said that if the activities of the recorder division - now sold and providing an exceptional credit of Pounds 120,000 to the results - and the load cell joint venture were stripped out, the increase would have been 50 per cent. Mr Julian Schild, the chairman's son and finance director, said that the extent of the profits advance derived from growth across all the company's markets. He described this as 'unusual' - normally some grew as others slackened. However, malpractice suits in the US - and increasingly in Europe - as well the financial necessity for hospitals to minimise patients' stays, ensured that sales of Huntleigh's pneumatic mattresses to combat bedsores continued as the engine of growth. In more general terms, his father ascribed Huntleigh's strength to its 'narrow' product range and large volumes which allowed stocks and overheads to be reduced. That strength was maintained in spite of the adverse dollar/sterling exchange rate throughout the period, he said. He expected currency factors to be neutral over the full 12 months. Some 75 per cent of Huntleigh's products are sold abroad with 42 per cent in the US alone. Outside the UK, the company manufactures in the US, Germany and Australia and has distribution agreements for European, Far Eastern and South American territories. The UK sales force has been expanded and there is a growing contract and rental market both here and in Germany. Huntleigh is 56 per cent controlled by the Schild family and 60 per cent by the family and board.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime </F> minister and foreign minister, by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN  reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you not think that you were  exploited by Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] concerning the problem of succession to former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa?    [Watanabe] There may be various viewpoints. We are  professionals living in the political world, so it is possible  that he may have used me as a card to obtain policy concessions  from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. However, if  the SDPJ made a concession because of that, it is good for the  country, is it not?    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is said that the Hata administration has  a dual power structure or that the Hata administration is  "Ozawa's cabinet."    [Watanabe] If a man can be a scenario writer and leading  actor at the same time like former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka,  it is all right. However, a division of work is necessary to  some extent. It may be that, since the two men are not  different in their ideas, tickets will sell well if Hata, not  Ozawa, dances on the stage.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Are you still thinking of leaving the LDP if  that helps to eliminate a policy gap?    [Watanabe] The problem is that Shinseito and the LDP are at  odds with each other despite the fact that their policies are  almost identical. It will be difficult for the Hata  administration to implement its policies unless it officially  asks for the LDP's cooperation. I have been thinking of  mediating between the two parties.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Is there any possibility of your leaving the  LDP if there is a chance of political realignment?    [Watanabe] It is too dangerous to make comments on that.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] There is a movement afoot in the LDP to come  back to power in league with some members of the SDPJ and  Sakigake [Harbinger].    [Watanabe] Cooperation between the LDP and the SDPJ should  be limited to the management of Diet affairs. If, however, the  SDPJ breaks with convention and comes closer to our party in  policy cooperation than when it formed an alliance with  Shinseito and other parties, that would be another story.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What will be the nature of political  realignment?    [Watanabe] I think there will be two lines of thought: one  based on the main current of the LDP and the other different  from that. The voluntary establishment of the Constitution is  the LDP's platform, but we are not saying that we should amend  Article 9 of the Constitution. It would be ridiculous not to  discuss the problem of the Constitution since the world is  changing in many spheres, like the problem of the environment  and the problem of limiting property rights.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] There is a considerable difference between  your way of thinking and the contents of LDP President Yohei  Kono's interpellation at the Diet concerning the problem of  security.    [Watanabe] I am not saying we should approve the exercise of  the right of collective self-defense. What I am saying is:  "Concerning UN peacekeeping activities, postwar management and  attendance for the confiscation of weapons can be interpreted as  collective security from the standpoint of the Constitution.  Concerning national emergency laws, laws providing for the  minimum requirement for security can be made within the  framework of the Constitution.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] LDP President Yohei Kono has declared that  he will submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet in the  current Diet session.    [Watanabe] If a no-confidence motion is to be submitted,  there must be just cause for it. I am sure of one thing: It is  not good for a minority government, which does not represent the  will of the people, to deal with the next budget or to maintain  a cabinet for a long time. However, if the Hata administration  asks for our cooperation in pursuing the same policy as the  LDP's, we cannot submit a no-confidence motion.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think will happen after a  no-confidence motion is submitted?    [Watanabe] That is impossible to say because there is the  other party, not just us. Speaking of dissolution by mutual  consent, for example, it is also impossible to tell whether  there is mutual consent. It will take time for the current Diet  to pass bills on redrawing electoral districts, because the  opinions of local governments must be listened to. And it is  still unknown whether Prime Minister Hata will choose  dissolution.    [ASAHI SHIMBUN] If the Diet is dissolved before a bill on  redrawing electoral districts is passed, that constitutes  "torpedoing political reform," does it not?    [Watanabe] At any rate, since the single-seat constituency  system was enacted by both the ruling and opposition parties, it  is impossible to abolish it without using it even once.</p>

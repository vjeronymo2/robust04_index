"I am sure the joint statement we have endorsed will  inaugurate a new chapter in the history of the relations between  Romania and the Republic of Korea and will help raise the  general level of our bilateral cooperation," President Ion  Iliescu said, noting the similarity of standpoints expressed  during the Romanian-South-Korean dialogue.    "Both countries are resolved to promote understanding,  cooperation and peace in their regions and the world over," he  said, noting that the end of the Cold War has failed to bring  about the stability the world's nations expected and that  complex and sometimes contradictory processes of restructuring  interstate relations are taking place in the international  arena, as well as a search for new structures of cooperation on  a bilateral, regional and international plane.    President Iliescu recalled the efforts deployed by Romania  for integration in the Euro-Atlantic economic, political and  military structures, stressing that it has managed to remain a  factor of stability in a zone powerfully marked by  confrontations both in the West, in former Yugoslavia, and in  the East, in the former Soviet Republics. Likewise, the  Romanian head of state said, "we are heeding ever more the  relations with the countries in Asia and the Pacific, that  represent a region with very dynamic growth rates and greatest  development prospects in the decades to come."    President Ion Iliescu noted that the Romanian-South-Korean  summit talks emphasized certain similarities as regarded the  development of the Romanian and Korean peoples, and especially  the two peoples' aspirations to live in a climate of peace and  mutual confidence.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Scramble to preserve US link: Expulsions shake special relationship THE SPEED and relief with which Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, welcomed Israel's offer to take back 100 of the 415 Palestinians it deported in December revealed far more about American-Israeli relations than it did about the future of the Middle East peace process. It had taken Mr Christopher several days and phone calls to persuade Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, to drop his insistence that the decision on the deportees was final and irrevocable. The Palestinians had said that they would not resume peace negotiations unless the fate of the men was satisfactorily resolved, but it was not this issue which appears to have been uppermost in Mr Christopher's mind. His primary concern was that the new administration, which condemned the expulsions, should not be forced into using its veto to block any move to impose UN sanctions against Israel for refusing to implement Security Council resolution 799. Very quickly after Israel's statement on Monday night, Mr Christopher asserted that not only was talk of sanctions now unnecessary, but that it could undermine the whole peace process. To this extent, a relieved Mr Christopher and a bruised Mr Rabin might reflect on their success in sustaining the single most critical relationship in the Middle East. However, it cannot augur well for the peace process and will not have quashed moves for sanctions against Israel. The episode has already cost Mr Rabin domestic political capital needed for the day when Middle East peace talks move on to issues which demand Israeli concessions. After the partial U-turn, the Israeli leader may seek to reinforce his hardline stance on security issues, while being even less ready to compromise at the negotiating table. There will also be less enthusiasm for compromise on the other side of the table. Mr Rabin's decision to expel the Palestinians was aimed at crippling Hamas, the radical Islamic organisation gaining ground in the occupied territories at the expense of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Instead, Hamas has been given a substantial political boost. Deportees on their hillside in southern Lebanon provide potent images of defiance. While they remain, it is almost impossible for the more flexible PLO to ask its negotiators to return to the negotiating table in Washington. Mr Rabin's offer to let 100 men return does nothing to satisfy PLO demands and may perversely be damaging Israel's own peace talks strategy. In the past few months Israel's negotiators have increasingly come to sense that it might just be possible to strike a deal with Syria over the Golan Heights. Furthermore, any hint of real progress with Syria would provide a big impetus for the Palestinians to become more pliant to avoid being left behind. Syria has been providing some encouragement for this belief with Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, the foreign minister, stressing last month that Arab delegations should not break off bilateral talks where they had most to gain. If they wished to boycott anything, he argued, it should be the multilateral talks which involved issues of greater benefit to Israel. But Israel's negotiators concede that while the Palestinians stay away it will be difficult for the Syrians, Jordanians and Lebanese to return. At the very least, the framework for a solution to the plight of the deportees had to be in place, and Mr Rabin's concessions on Monday do not meet that requirement. If anything, argue some Arab diplomats, the apparent US endorsement of Mr Rabin's action has made the situation worse by damaging American credibility as an honest broker. This sense of frustration is heightened by the understanding that the three Arab governments and the PLO have no alternative to the peace process. The reasons that brought them to the Madrid conference are every bit as valid today as they were 15 months ago. But with every new confrontation hopes for negotiation are less easy to justify before a sceptical domestic audience increasingly receptive to hardline and militantly Islamic voices.</p>

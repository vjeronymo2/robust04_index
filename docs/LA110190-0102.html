			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PREGNANT WOMAN IS SHOT;  </P> <P> CRIME: SHE IS THE THIRD WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE IN THE COUNTY IN A WEEK. SHE AND A  COMPANION WERE VICTIMS OF A ROBBERY ATTEMPT.  </P> <P> The third pregnant woman in a week has fallen victim to a street shooting in  Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The most recent victim, Maria Lopez, 29, of Paramount, was wounded early  Wednesday during a robbery attempt in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Lopez was struck once in the abdomen and her companion, Mark Robert Arias, 31,  of Long Beach, was shot and killed as they sat in a parked car at 12:45 a.m.,  Police Detective Ron Pavek said.  </P> <P> The gunman demanded money from the couple and started shooting when Arias  replied that he only had $3, Pavek said.  </P> <P> With Arias unconscious in the driver's seat, Lopez managed to drive to Charter  Suburban Hospital in Paramount, where she underwent surgery.  </P> <P> Lopez was in guarded condition Wednesday afternoon, hospital spokesman Allen  Meadows said. The 5-month-old fetus was not struck by the bullet and was in  good condition, Meadows said.  </P> <P> On Monday evening, another pregnant woman was standing on the porch of a home  in South Los Angeles when she was struck once in the head by a bullet.  </P> <P> Kara Cooper, 20, was taken to County-USC Medical Center, where she was in  extremely critical condition. Cooper's 8-month-old fetus was not injured,  hospital spokeswoman Adelaida de la Cerda said. Witnesses told police  investigators that the unidentified gunman fled into an alley.  </P> <P> On Oct. 24, a 38-year-old woman was gunned down as she walked home with her  boyfriend in a West Los Angeles neighborhood, Police Detective Elliot Rada  said.  </P> <P> The detective said Pauline Ellis, who was expecting to give birth in a month,  died in a hail of bullets that may have been meant for her 29-year-old  boyfriend because of a previous dispute with the gunmen.  </P> <P> "The weather was nice for walking, and (Ellis) had to get out and exercise a  little to relieve the discomfort of being eight months pregnant," Rada said.  "She would have had a baby girl if she and the fetus had lived."  </P> <P> In Orange County, a pregnant woman was shot Tuesday as she left her  gynecologist's office.  </P> <P> Janet C. Totten, 29, of Westminster was treated at Hoag Memorial Hospital in  Newport Beach for a single rifle shot wound to the face, Lt. Ed McErlain said.  She was listed in satisfactory condition and her 5-month-old fetus was not  harmed, McErlain said.  </P> <P> Totten told investigators that she had obtained a temporary restraining order  against her husband, Anthony L. Totten, 32, for alleged death threats to her  and her unborn child.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach police arrested Anthony Totten on Wednesday.  </P></p>

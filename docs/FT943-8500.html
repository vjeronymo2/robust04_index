			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Aid sought to stem tourism decline Spending by visitors to Scotland is declining, tourist industry leaders were warned yesterday. Mr Derek Reid, new chief executive of the Scottish Tourist Board, said Scotland was falling behind other developed countries in the growth of its tourism industry. Mr Reid called for extra government funding for marketing and substantial private-sector investment in tourist facilities and training. Spending by tourists in Scotland peaked at Pounds 2.5bn in 1987, he said. Last year's spending of Pounds 2.1bn was 17 per cent below that for 1989 in real terms. Growth in overseas tourism in recent years had not been enough to offset the decline in domestic tourism, both from England and from Scotland. Mr Reid was speaking at a conference in Stirling Castle held to launch a Pounds 1.5m television advertising campaign aimed at the English market, which he described as the Scottish industry's problem child. The 40-second commercial, first screened last night in England and Northern Ireland, is intended to give Scotland a more contemporary image for the English. The Scottish Tourist Board has unveiled a new logo based on the thistle. The conference, attended by 200 leaders of organisations and companies involved in tourism, also heard details of a strategic plan prepared by the Scottish Tourism Co-Ordinating Group, which consists of public-sector agencies led by the Scottish Office. The strategy contains measures aimed at achieving 20 per cent growth in tourist spending by the year 2000 and increasing the employment in the industry from 170,000 in 1991 to 210,000 by then. The organisation of Scotland's tourist industry is being revamped. The Scottish Tourist Board promotes tourism across the whole country, having taken over marketing of the Highlands from Highlands and Islands Enterprise. However, it has handed over the task of assisting tourism businesses to the network of local enterprise companies controlled by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The number of area tourist boards is to be reduced to 14 from 34 by 1996.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad has issued Law No. 5 dated  12 June 1994, which represents the state's general budget for  1994.    Finance Minister Muhammad Khalid al-Mahayini told a Syrian  Arab News Agency correspondent that the state budget for 1994  amounts to 144.162 billion Syrian pounds. Of this amount,  76.198 billion pounds will be earmarked for current general  expenditure, and 67.964 billion pounds for investment projects;  that is, 47.14 percent of the entire state budget. This high  ration reflects the importance of development projects in this  budget, in addition to the requirements of general expenditure  for national security and general services for the people.    The minister added that most of the state's general budget  is  based on domestic resources, thus affirming the principle of  self-reliance, in addition to rationalizing the current public  expenditure, especially administrative expenditures. The budget  also included the necessary allocations to meet President's  Hafiz al-Asad generous gift to the working class, represented by  increasing salaries and remunerations for the state employees,  increasing the pensions, increasing the heating allowance, and  changes in prices as of 1 May 1994.    The minister said that the Finance Ministry issued orders to  implement the 1994 state budget law and to disburse the amounts  allocated this year for all public departments of an  administrative nature in the state. It also issued documents  related to approval of estimated allocations for the economic  public sector for 1994.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / People: Wace board pressed smaller Wace, the pre-press and specialist printing group, has decided to reduce the size of its main board following last month's appointment of Trevor Grice as chief executive. Grice replaced John Clegg, whose sudden departure rocked the group at the beginning of the year. The DTI has not yet completed a report into share-dealing in the names of some of Clegg's relatives, but Wace insists the inquiry has nothing to do with the group. Wace has decided that increased responsibility should be given to various operating boards within the group, leaving financial control and policy as main board areas. Consequently executive directors Proby Cautley and Ian Hewson are moving from the main to operating boards, reducing it to five executive and three non-executive directors. Grice says: 'The organisation structure has been a reflection of Wace's acquisitive growth during the 1980s; there was an imbalance on the board between executive and non-executive directors. These changes will provide a better balance.' Ian Wilde, 45, (above) has been appointed managing director of Wace Europe. He joined Wace in January from Orion Holdings, where he was chief executive. Wilde will report directly to Grice, with whom he previously worked for eight years at Frank Horsell Group, the printing supplies company. Jerry Lee, 40, has joined as UK sales and marketing director. Lee was a director of Wang (UK) and from 1990 was responsible for its general business systems division. He will report to Brian Dudley, Wace's managing director. Neither Wilde nor Lee will be on the main board. ***** George Inch has been appointed director, finished vehicles logistics of BRS's automotive sector. ***** Oliver Prentice, formerly md/vice-president of Holiday Inn Worldwide, has been appointed md of COMMUNITY HOSPITALS GROUP's continuing care division. ***** Rodney Westhead, a former managing partner of Grant Thornton's London office and recently a partner in the Northamptonshire practice, has been appointed group finance director of RICARDO INTERNATIONAL.</p>

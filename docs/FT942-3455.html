			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / BCCI chiefs jailed and told to pay Dollars 9bn Twelve senior executives of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International were yesterday sentenced in Abu Dhabi to serve a combined total of 61 years in prison and ordered to pay Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) for their involvement in one of the biggest frauds in history. The verdicts marked the end of the first trial to examine the role of the most important figures involved in allegedly defrauding hundreds of thousands of creditors, depositors and employees of more than Dollars 12bn in the decade before BCCI was closed by regulators in July 1991. Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's former chief executive who is on trial in the US, received in his absence the heaviest sentence of 14 years. Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the founder and president of BCCI, who is ill in Pakistan and is unlikely to be extradited, was sentenced in his absence to eight years' imprisonment. Others in detention in Abu Dhabi received sentences ranging from three to six years, while one defendant who has been on bail was acquitted. Mr Ziauddin Ali Akbar, former head of BCCI's treasury division, was given three years, though he is serving six years in England on 16 counts of false accounting involving more than Dollars 745m. The court ordered those found guilty to pay back Dollars 6.56bn stolen from the private department of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Dollars 1.35bn from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Dollars 1.22bn from the Finance Department, and to pay costs. Mr Vivien Ambrose, chief representative of the BCCI Staff Association, said: 'These sentences are very light. I think it's dreadful. The plight of the staff and the depositors remains unsolved and is going to drag on for years.' Mr John Moscow, an assistant district attorney for New York County, which has charged Mr Naqvi and Mr Abedi, said the sentences appeared to be 'relatively light' given the magnitude of the charges. Lawyers for the defendants said yesterday that they were considering appealing. The sentencing follows charges brought against 14 BCCI executives by the Abu Dhabi authorities in July last year, and a trial by the state's public prosecutor which began in October. The government of Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority shareholder, said: 'It is a landmark in the BCCI affair that these key individuals have been brought to justice.' It said it would continue to help world authorities bring 'wrongdoers' to justice. Among the other sentences handed out, three senior executives of the bank currently in detention in Abu Dhabi were given six years each: Mr Zafar Iqbal, Mr Hassan Kazmi and Mr Abdul Hafeez. A further six staff in detention in Abu Dhabi received three years each: Mr Fakhir Hussain, Mr Mohammed Azmatullah, Mr Ameer Siddiqi, Mr Imtiaz Ahmad, Mr Naseem Sheikh and Mr Bashir Tahir. Mr Iqbal Rizvi, one of the 14 originally charged, was acquitted on all charges. Mr Naqvi is due to appear again in the Federal courts in Washington, DC, today as part of a series of charges against him. BCCI struggle continues, Page 4</p>

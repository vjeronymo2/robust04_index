			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH'S TRIAL IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO  </P> <P> I am not an admirer of North. I don't approve of what he admits to doing during  the Iran-Contra fiasco. However, I will accept that a career Marine might well  see it as his duty to assume blame and protect his superiors should events take  the bad turn that they did. When I was in the military service, we were  thoroughly drilled on the ethics and responsibilities of an officer. We were  referred to as "an officer and a gentlemen." Our word was our bond, and though  you might find it hard to believe, we lived by that code. The highest priority  in an officer's life was the welfare of the people under his command.  </P> <P> I am bothered and upset by the events taking place in the trial of North. A lot  of questions keep coming up, but to me the major question is very simple, but  apparently the answer isn't. Former Commander in Chief Ronald Reagan, why don't  you come forward and help the man who served you so well?  </P> <P> RAY RUTHERFORD  </P> <P> Santa Paula  </P></p>

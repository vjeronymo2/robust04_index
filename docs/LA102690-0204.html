			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV IN SPAIN TO TALK CREDIT  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev traveled to Spain today and immediately  embarked on negotiations to receive about $1-billion worth of credits in  Spanish consumer goods desperately needed by the beleaguered Soviet economy.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, accompanied by his wife, Raisa, landed shortly before 1 p.m. at  Madrid Airport, where he was received by socialist Prime Minister Felipe  Gonzalez and Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez.  </P> <P> Officials said the main subject of business will be an estimated $1-billion  credit package that would be used by the Soviets to buy Spanish consumer goods  and industrial equipment.  </P> <P> The Spanish newspaper El Pais said the Spanish side has offered to increase the  sum to $1.5 billion, but officials at Gonzalez's office declined to comment on  the report.  </P> <P> The six-day European swing will also take Gorbachev to France, and to underline  his intent on active European diplomacy, the Soviet leader was accompanied by  Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.  </P> <P> "We are prepared and want to share actively in all European issues, including  the new security structure, and pan-European system of interaction in the  economy, ecology, energy, information and culture," Gorbachev told El Pais.  </P></p>

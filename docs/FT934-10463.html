			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Insurer hit by Lautro ruling GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the UK-based life assurance company, said yesterday that it may have to pay compensation to investors who were mis-sold insurance policies in 1990 and 1991. GRE, which has already been subject to disciplinary action and a fine from Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life assurance industry, said the latest problems were also uncovered after a Lautro compliance review. The review, earlier this year, raised concerns about the appropriateness of advice given to clients, particularly by former 'tied agents' of GRE, who sell the company's products exclusively but are not directly employed by it. GRE said it had agreed with Lautro to review the business of those representative firms and of any others where either documentation sampling or the complaints level suggested further cases of mis-selling. It would make compensation where necessary. GRE said yesterday that it had recently started recruiting tied agents again after a two-year moratorium. Meanwhile, it had cut the number of tied agents to less than 150 from about 950.</p>

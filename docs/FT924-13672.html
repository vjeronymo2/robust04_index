			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD fell again on the London bullion market yesterday, adding to Monday's losses. The recent failure to break conclusively through resistance above Dollars 350 a troy ounce has effectively capped the upside for the moment, analysts say. If US funds now abandon positions established in the wake of Europe's currency crisis - in spite of the likely volatility in financial markets as the US elections approach - then gold could fall back to Dollars 340 and possibly August's lows at Dollars 335. The market could find some support if the Bundesbank moves to cut interest rates tomorrow as rumoured in the currency and equity markets. London COCOA prices reversed direction in the afternoon, closing down. Dealers said there had been talk of light selling of Ivorian cocoa with a modest strengthening in the value of the pound versus the French franc making prices more attractive. COFFEE futures finished easier, but above the day's lows, aided by the reversal of an early fall in New York. Compiled from Reuters</p>

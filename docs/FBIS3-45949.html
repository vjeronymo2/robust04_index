Mahmoud Vaezi [name as received], deputy foreign minister  for  Euro-American affairs, said in an exclusive interview with  XINHUA, "We believe that this action will not happen because the  United States knows us better than other countries."    He said that Iran is not a small country like Libya, but it  is a big nation with an internal unity and abundant resources.    He noted that the so-called U.S. war against Iran is merely  a  psychological war by writers in Western countries. "You can't  hear this from any officials."    However, since the beginning of last year, the Western media  have occasionally reported that the United States and Israel  would launch a war against Iran before 1996 and they would  strike Iran's nuclear facilities and military bases.    According to reports, there are certain Pentagon plans to  start a war against Islamic Iran. Some Pentagon analysts  believe that a military confrontation between Iran and the  United States will be inevitable at some stage.    When asked about the Iranian Government's response to the  possible U.S. military strike on Iran, the deputy foreign  minister said, "Our government, our Army and our people are  ready for any kind of actions."    Relations between Iran and the United States have been  strained for 14 years since 1979 when the U.S. Embassy in Tehran  was seized by Moslems students.    Vaezi noted that the United States has kept a hostile  attitude toward Iran. "We should not have normal relations with  them unless they change their attitude and give us money back."    "This is a prerequisite for normalization of relations  between Iran and the United States," he added.    Meanwhile, Iranian leader Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i late last  year explicitly ruled out the possibility of negotiations  between Iran and the United States and renewed his support for  the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy.    Khamene'i also described those Iranians who advocate talks  with Washington as "naive, coward and ignorant," saying they are  unfamiliar with political issues and unaware of the dangers such  negotiations will entail.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in Brussels  last month that Washington still considered Iran an "outlaw  nation" involved in terrorism.    "And we think that strong action should be taken to deny  them  dual-use technology as well as other steps," he added.</p>

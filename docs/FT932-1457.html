			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (8): Shivers down the spines - Spanish banks in Portugal WHEN Mr Mario Conde, president of Banesto, Spain's biggest banking group, suggested at a recent annual general meeting that his institution could merge with Banco Totta e Acores (BTA), Portugal's leading private bank, he sent a shiver down the spine of many Portuguese bankers. Portuguese newspapers have for long been talking about the invasion of Portugal by Spanish banks and other businesses. But bankers paled at the idea of the takeover of one of the country's big four banks. But when the uproar died down, people were faced with another of Mr Conde's statements made at the same meeting: that directly or indirectly he owned more than 40 per cent of BTA. 'In fact Mr Conde probably controls about 50.5 per cent of BTA. There is simply no doubt that he owns the bank,' says Mr Joaquim Luiz Gomes, an analyst with independent brokers Midas Investimento in Lisbon. The legal limit on direct foreign ownership of BTA is 10 per cent, soon to be raised to 40 per cent. According to senior officials at BTA, there is little likelihood of a direct merger between the two banks. A more probable scenario is that J. P. Morgan, the US investment bank which is expected to take a stake in Banesto, may form a holding company that will control the shares of the two banks. Banesto led the Spanish invasion by buying into BTA in a privatisation operation. Other Spanish banks have taken a variety of other routes and there are now at least six Spanish banks operating in Portugal today. But to some the word 'invasion' to describe this process remains over-inflated. 'Spanish banks have at the most a 10 to 15 per cent share of the Portuguese market at the moment,' says Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist with Banco Comercial Portuguese, a leading private bank. 'Over the next 50 years this may expand to 30 per cent of the market. But what is going on is a natural process of regional expansion between two closely connected economies rather than an invasion.' This year, a Spanish bank became the biggest single shareholder in BCP in a share swap under which Banco Central Hispanoamericano acquired 10 per cent of BCP in exchange for 2 per cent of its own shares and 50 per cent in Spain's leading private banking institution, Banco Banif de Gestion Privada. BCP intends to protect itself from any expansionist ambitions by changing its statutes so that any institution acquiring more that 10 per cent of the bank has a maximum of only 10 per cent of voting rights. BTA and BCP both remain Portuguese banks with large Spanish shareholdings. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) decided to establish itself in its own right when in 1991 it paid Pounds 110m to buy out Lloyds Bank Portugal which was then a small corporate bank with 12 branches. Since then the bank has grown to 57 branches as BBV pursues a strategy of building a universal bank with enough critical mass to compete alongside the big operators. The bank has introduced its own culture, investing in some 15,000 hours of training a year and despite its big expansion has only increased the number of its staff by two. In this time, the number of customers has increased four-fold. BBV has invested Es300bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in information technology and increased the number of its large corporate customers to 387 and its small- and medium-sized company clients to 100,200. The number of staff working in the head office has fallen from 46 per cent of the total to 27 per cent as BBV has created a series of para-banking companies from leasing to brokerage. 'Portugal is a priority area for BBV along with Morocco and Latin America,' says Mr Jose Luis Jolo Marin, managing director of the bank's Portuguese operations. 'We currently have about 1.5 per cent of the Portuguese market. Our aim is to build this up into a critical mass of about 5-7 per cent over the next three years.' Mr Jolo Marin is aware that this cannot be achieved by organic growth alone. 'We are on the look-out to buy into another Portuguese bank or perhaps reach agreement on swapping networks or simply buying branches from an existing Portuguese bank,' he says. In four or five years, when it has reached the required critical mass, BBV will seek a Portuguese partner, who will be offered 20-40 per cent of the bank. Spain's Banco Santander followed yet another route by buying a substantial share of Banco Comercio e Industria, for which it has now requested permission to make a 100-per-cent takeover with its partner the Royal Bank of Scotland. Santander is Spain's second-most-successful bank in Portugal after Banesto, but it only has a 2 per cent share of the market. 'That is not enough to talk about an invasion,' says Mr Gomes, 'In my view, Banesto is the only Spanish bank that has made it big so far.' What has Spanish banking given Portugal? 'We have introduced successful new products but I think Portuguese banks are just as imaginative as we are in that respect,' says Mr Jolo Marin. 'What we are doing is bringing new life, new competition and new business to the market. When a bank moves it is because it sees a fast-growing economy with good opportunities and that is why Spanish banks are moving into Portugal.'</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Maxwell avoids bankruptcy threat IAN MAXWELL arrives with his lawyer at the High Court in London yesterday where he avoided the immediate threat of bankruptcy by making a payment of Pounds 500,000 to the liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, former manager of the Mirror Group Newspaper pension funds. Mr Maxwell was ordered to pay the money after the High Court ruled he had breached his duty as a director. Proceedings were started after his lawyers indicated he could not make the payment.

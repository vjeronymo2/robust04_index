The "Evergreen" Army engineering unit will be welcomed at an  official ceremony in the afternoon by Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae and 2,000 other officers and family members.    The unit marked South Korea's first participation in U.N.  peacekeeping operations. It arrived in Somalia last July and  was to stay one full year but decided to follow Western nations  including Italy, which was in charge of security in the area  where the Korean unit was stationed, and pull out early.    The South Korean soldiers were to leave Somalia on April 1  but pushed up the date because of an outbreak of endemic  diseases such as cholera, officials here said.    Some 500,000 U.S. dollars' worth of equipment including  jeeps  and electric generators was donated to the U.N. mission  headquarters as the South Korean unit departed from the Somali  capital of Mogadishu on Wednesday.    Other equipment left Mogadishu on Monday aboard a 5,500-ton  German vessel and will arrive in the southern port city of Pusan  around April 10.    The United Nations will pay the entire 800-million-won cost  of transporting the unit and equipment.</p>

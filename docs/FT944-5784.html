			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (12): Upjohn links up the orders - Moving to a global supply chain / A pharmaceuticals manufacturer found a feeling of system ownership was created by introducing a package designed to connect three separate systems Pharmaceuticals manufacturer Upjohn is moving from three unconnected systems in the UK to a worldwide supply chain in which demand for chemicals in one country will automatically spark off orders in another. The first step is the replacement of existing systems around the world by the same BPCS package (Business Planning and Control System) from System Software Associates (SSA), running on IBM AS/400 business computers. The project is removing barriers between departments, improving negotiations with customers and suppliers and changing attitudes towards computer systems. The US group has a UK factory in Crawley, Sussex, making 90 products, 60 per cent of which are exported. UK turnover is Pounds 70m and there are about 500 staff. The UK operation used to run manufacturing, purchasing and accounting on separate IBM System/36 computers using a package installed 10 years before. This meant information on customers and suppliers was keyed into different systems. The UK now has the single BPCS system, chosen by the US as the new group standard. 'The company was very segmented,' says information systems manager Elizabeth Bielby. 'The integrated system now forces functions to communicate and operate as a single unit, because if data is entered in one area it affects others.' There is also better communication with the computing department. 'Things have changed dramatically,' Mrs Bielby says. 'The old systems were very much owned by the IT department and remote from the people who created and used the data. Today the users own and drive the systems. Indeed we want to move the entering data as close as possible to the people who create it. For example, at present information from the shop floor is entered from paper forms by supervisors; we want to have real-time data entry by the people actually doing the production work.' This feeling of system ownership was created not least by the way the system was introduced. SSA trained 50 users, who used this standard training to develop a course geared precisely to Upjohn's needs. These people then trained their colleagues, mainly on the job as different functions came into use. Upjohn has modified the standard product to its own needs. SSA has built some of these changes into new releases to ensure that Upjohn has a package which is as near to the standard as possible. Upjohn currently has 10 major modifications outside the standard product but Mrs Bielby says she hopes this will fall to three with the next release, due for installation in October. 'The package argument is that you buy into the supplier's development work, and we're working hard to contain the number of modifications,' Mrs Bielby says. 'But the downside to taking a package is that you get the same as everyone else. We would continue to modify the package if we felt we would gain significant competitive advantage.' An unusual benefit of using a package in the chemicals industry relates to regulation. Processes have to be formally inspected by regulatory bodies; computer systems are part of those processes. 'SSA has done a lot of validation work on the package, so the inspectors simply check the company's own documentation,' Mrs Bielby says. 'This means we don't have to validate our own systems. In fact, the costs can be so great that this alone means it is no longer cost-effective to develop our own systems. So the validation costs of the package are spread among all the customers, just as the development costs are. This has emerged as a major benefit.' The new system and new way of working have had a big effect. Output is up by a third, with 7 per cent fewer staff. Inventory supplies of 3.5 months comfortably beat the target of 4.3 months - and continue to fall by 6 per cent a year. Better information, especially forecasts, means better negotiations with customers and suppliers and a tighter linking of demand to manufacturing. This is being extended across the international group: Upjohn is now looking at using information technology to bring all operations together so that chemical plants are geared precisely to the needs of product manufacturing.

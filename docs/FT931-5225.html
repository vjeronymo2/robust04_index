			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Titus deconstructed - Jackie Wullschlager reviews a mind-gripping new work by east German playwright Heiner Muller, directed by Gunter Kramer LIKE SKITTLES, the cultural giants of the former East Germany are tumbling: first it was Manfred Wekworth, director of Brecht's Berliner Ensemble; now even writers who seemed to stand against the regime - Heiner Muller, Christa Wolf - have been implicated as STASI agents. Muller, Germany's foremost living dramatist, is a fascinating case because from the start he refused to reject DDR culture wholesale in favour of capitalism. But while east Germany has mostly embraced western values with open arms, in the theatre the reverse has happened. Directors trained in the east - Muller, Katharina Thalbach, Matthias Langhoff - are in huge demand in the west. And behind them all, the ghost of Brecht, icon of DDR culture, stalks German stages more insistently than ever. His influence is overwhelming in the two major post-war dramatic traditions: theatre as political-moral debate - classics recast as condition-of-Germany plays have been standard fare since the Wall fell and theatre as pure aestheticism, texts deconstructed, action deliberately distanced from life. At extremes, the Berlin Volksbuhne's rubbish-dump Lear typifies the first, Robert Wilson's surreal Faustus the second. But the best synthesis of the two traditions I have yet seen is an eye-opening, nerve-bending, mind-gripping new Titus Andronicus, reworked by Heiner Muller and directed in Cologne by Gunter Kramer, Germany's high priest of high stylisation. Titus is Shakespeare's first and most grisly tragedy. Corpses litter the stage in minutes, limbs are amputated, tongues cut out, human flesh served to relatives for supper in a revenge war between conquering Romans and vanquished Goths. Muller sees in it the ethnic cleansing, systemised rape and guerilla tactics of the Bosnian conflict and the recent war in Afghanistan. When the Goths tip black plastic bags of bodies into the pit, they scrawl 'Death to the Romans' in elegant graffiti across the stage. Forced to learn the victor's language, terrorists chant 'amo amas amat', as they exchange mocking homosexual caresses. Some lines, Muller says in the programme, he heard from Russian soldiers in DDR days. Woven into poetry is an ironic chorus - 'William Shakespeare, my name and your name glow in blood'. Goths ridicule Roman speeches by repeating them, a second out of time, like discordant madrigals. Muller calls his play Anatomy Titus Fall of Rome: A Shakespeare Commentary; what interests Kramer is its deadly games of alienation and satire. A silent first act is mimed to the war music of Philip Glass's Ahknaten; Romans, in white robes, helmets and feathers, ashen faces painted into masks of exagerated sensuality with fat red lips, eyebrows pink or blue, sockets blackened, bop up and down against a waist-high ramp and pull faces, poke tongues, in the fight to be emperor. It is half Punch and Judy, half eerie, surreal ritual. In the hunting scene where Lavinia is raped, she runs in and out of a forest of metal rods bathed in silver-green light which descend from the ceiling and jangle as she tries to flee: visual and acoustic symbol of her terror. When her hands are cut off, the negro Aaron, in dark glasses and black gloves, seizes her frilly white parasol, sticks it between his legs and spins handstands. Aestheticised horror, the play of black on white, acrobats jibing at mutilation: in its acute calculation and rhythm, Kramer's stylisation disturbs more than the worst of blood and gore. It is given emotional as well as topical life by a cast tuned to every nuance of Muller's revision and every swing of Kramer's setting. Gerd Kunath as Titus pits a rigid, heroic propriety against an absurdist commentary on his own folly and idealism; when he cuts off his hand to save his sons and has it returned to him with their heads, he throws the useless limb into the audience with a shrug at once comic and heartbroken. His flexible face and ever-moving body now browbeaten and sagging, now blank with horror, sometimes mad, sometimes murderous, Kunath evokes a desperate warmth and pity. As Lavinia, Ingrid Andree changes from complacent Roman puppet to passionate distraught heroine, to sacrificial victim danced upon as a prop. She returns to life when she writes, as if the effort comes from the core of her being, the names of her attackers with a stick held between her teeth into the sand: a moment at once of perfect Shakespearean tenderness and Beckett-like sad absurdity, and one of many unforgettable scenes in an extraordinary production. In rep at the Schauspielhaus, Cologne</p>

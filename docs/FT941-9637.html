			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Votes speed communication unions merger Delegates from the two biggest communications unions voted decisively to merge yesterday. The votes, taken at separate delegates conferences in Bournemouth, marked the first and most important step in the merger process between the Union of Communication Workers and and the National Communications Union which is expected to create a single group by December. Delegates from the 175,000-strong UCW and the 126,000-member NCU were being asked to back a legally binding instrument of amalgamation. The UCW voted overwhelmingly to support the amalgamation and the NCU was two-to-one in favour. Discussions on a combined rulebook went less smoothly but union leaders said they expected their executives to reach an acceptable compromise on rules to allow the merger to be voted upon at the annual conferences of the unions in May and June. Conference decisions in favour of the merger will then be put to the full memberships for a final endorsement. The two union general secretaries - Mr Alan Johnson of the UCW and Mr Tony Young of the NCU - said their ability to defend members' jobs would be strengthened if everybody was in the same union. Both unions face continuing membership losses because of the rundown in jobs. The merger, which will create a union of some 310,000 members, is seen as a way of strengthening the industrial power of workers in the Post Office and British Telecommunications and also as a way of opening up new recruitment areas in Mercury and cable television. Mr Young said the proposal was 'not a takeover of one union by another'. but 'a genuine partnership'. The two general secretaries will work in tandem until 1998. The proposed merger timetable requires a postal ballot of the members of both unions to agree on a name for the new body to take place over March and April. While several names have been suggested, the most likely choice is the Communications Workers Union. One possible obstacle could emerge tomorrow when the result of the NCU general secretary election is to be announced. Mr Young has faced a difficult struggle against Mr Bill Fry, a leftwing candidate, who wants the union to adopt a more militant strategy.</p>

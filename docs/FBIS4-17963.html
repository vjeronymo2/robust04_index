			<p>BFN     [Text] At the end of today's talks, Pavel Grachev and Yi  Pyong-tae signed a memorandum on mutual understanding between  the Defense Ministries of Russia and the Republic of Korea and a  declaration on military cooperation between the two countries.  In the words of Russian Defense Minister, these documents  reflect the sides' intention to develop broader cooperation and  determine the main events within the framework of ties between  the two countries' military departments in 1994-95.    Pavel Grachev told journalists after the documents were  signed that he had received an invitation from his South Korean  counterpart to visit the Republic of Korea in 1995. We hope,  said the Russian defense minister, to sign additional documents  there on closer cooperation, perhaps in the military-technical  sphere. He did not rule out the possibility of an agreement on  preventing various kinds of unauthorized military actions being  signed in Seoul.</p>

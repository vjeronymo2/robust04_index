			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. Filipovich, reporting from Yekaterinburg </F> under the heading "Meetings": "They Take Away One Life After  Another"    [Text] The number of murders in the oblast has increased by  a factor of more than 2.5 over the past five years, and in  Yekaterinburg there has been a threefold increase. This was  discussed at a meeting of oblast law enforcement agencies.    In 1992 the oblast reported 898 homicides (an increase of  54.6 percent over the previous year). In 1993 there were 1,097  homicides in the oblast, 319 of them in Yekaterinburg. In the  oblast capital more than 30 murders were committed with firearms  (rifles and sawed-off shotguns), and in 61 cases the  perpetrators attempted to conceal their actions by dismembering  and concealing the bodies. The circumstances under which more  than 20 murders occurred indicate that they were contract  killings, i.e. carried out by professionals.    The oblast's murder conviction rate is on a par with the  Russia-wide average, but in 1992 there were 160 unsolved  murders, and 248 last year. Analysis and investigative practices  connected with these personal crimes, the most serious and most  threatening to society, were the focus of attention at a joint  meeting of law enforcement agencies held at the oblast  procuracy. Those attending included Ivan Ovcharuk, oblast court  chairman, Vladislav Tuykov, oblast procurator, Vladimir Demin,  head of the oblast Internal Affairs Administration, and Gennadiy  Voronov, head of the oblast branch of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service.    The personnel issue seems to be particularly acute. There is  constant turnover among investigators, with the professional  core eroding away. Currently, of the 153 investigators working  for the procuracy one in three has been on the job less than a  year. The situation is no better among personnel in the oblast's  criminal investigation division, either; there 45 percent of  personnel have no training for the job they are doing.  Meanwhile, the operational situation over the past two months of  this year has been a difficult one, with 190 reported murder  cases, or 20 more than in the same period last year.    All these conclusions convincingly attest to the need to  establish specialized units to investigate murder cases, and the  government of the Russian Federation should adopt decisions  toward that end.</p>

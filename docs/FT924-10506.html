			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Credit runs out for Barbadian sugar industry THE BARBADIAN sugar industry, overcome by mounting debts, has been shut down indefinitely because it has run out of money. The Barbados National Bank, which is owed USDollars 50m by Barbados Sugar Industry Ltd, the island's sole producer, has cut off all credit to the industry and has started proceedings to put the company into receivership. The move has halted preparations at the island's three mills for processing cane for the next harvest, due to begin in eight weeks. The shutdown follows years of declining production and mounting losses, with this year's output of 55,000 tonnes the lowest in 60 years. The government and the producers had started discussions with Booker Tate of the UK, seeking agreement on the terms of a management contract for the British company to run the industry. However, Barbadian industry officials said yesterday that the discussions had been 'inconclusive'. The poor performance of the industry in recent years has caused Barbados some difficulty in meeting its quota commitments to the European Community and the US, while satisfying domestic demand. Sugar has had to be imported for domestic consumption.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Jianmin (2621 1696 3046) and Wang Yingchun </F> (3769 6601 2504)]    [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a national  meeting on the supply of agricultural means of production today,  State Councillor Chen Junsheng stressed: Supply and marketing  cooperatives' agricultural production means departments should  play their role as major suppliers of agricultural means of  production, and should strive in every possible way to ensure  that markets for agricultural production means are properly  supplied.    Chen Junsheng said: Agricultural means of production are the  most basic guarantee for agricultural development. Whether this  work is done well or poorly will have a direct impact on whether  the peasants' enthusiasm for production will be effectively  sustained over a long period. In a certain sense, the work will  be the most important factor that will decide whether China will  have a bumper harvest in the agricultural sector in 1994.  Currently, China is gradually establishing and developing a  socialist market economy. While multichannel competition is very  fierce, supply and marketing cooperatives, acting as major  distributors, still command a majority share of China's total  sales volume and market. Therefore, they must play their roles  to stabilize the market. China has successively raised its  agricultural production, particularly grain production, to  several higher levels in recent years. Such achievements have  been inseparably linked to supply and marketing cooperatives  that supplied agricultural means of production and provided  other services. We hope they will, as they have done in the  past, perform their tasks in a down-to-earth manner so as to  properly do their work in supplying agricultural means of  production in 1994.    Chen Junsheng stressed: In light of the current situation,  first, we must avoid any drastic fluctuation in the prices of  agricultural production means. The general situation is that  China's stability depends on stability in the agricultural  sector. Appropriately handling agricultural affairs is not the  sole concern of any single department; it requires that all  concerned should have the overall picture in mind. The purpose  of supply and marketing cooperatives playing their role as major  suppliers of agricultural means of production is to provide  better services to enhance agricultural production; it is not  directed at raising profits. Therefore, supply and marketing  cooperatives at various levels should reduce distribution links  as much as possible so as to curtail expenses. We should  eliminate those previously so-called normal circulation links  that can be eliminated; this move should be considered a reform.  We should even more resolutely eliminate abnormal circulation  links. Only then can we lower expenses and prices and in the  end guarantee the market's smooth circulation with reasonable  prices that peasants can bear. Second, we should coordinate  with relevant departments to properly safeguard that markets of  agricultural production means circulate smoothly. Various  localities must strictly investigate and handle activities  detrimental to peasants, including excessive numbers of  operators dealing in agricultural production means, unreasonable  increases in commodity prices, and profiteering behavior whereby  the same commodities are resold several times. Third, we should  strengthen management of the quality of agricultural means of  production and establish efficient administrative organizations,  systems, and procedures to strictly crack down on fake and  substandard commodities. Supply and marketing cooperatives at  various levels definitely should not allow fake and substandard  agricultural means of production to appear on their premises.  They should ensure that an abundant high-quality supply of  agricultural means of production will be available for the  peasants. Fourth, we should establish necessary reserve systems  to ensure that the requirements for agricultural production and  disaster relief can be fulfilled.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Business rate rises will be halved in real terms Businesses facing higher rate bills as a result of the 1990 business rate reforms will receive a lower increase than expected, under changes to the transitional arrangements announced in the Budget. Those facing the biggest rises will find their increases halved in real terms, while many small shops with combined living accommodation will see no real increase for the third year running. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said 360,000 rate bills in England would benefit this year, following the Pounds 1.8bn of relief announced in the past two Budgets.</p>

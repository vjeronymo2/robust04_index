			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP) -- China said Thursday it  would send "nobody" to Pyongyang this month for President Kim  Il-song's birthday party, in a sign of a brewing showdown  between the communist allies over the Korean nuclear crisis.  "The Chinese side will send nobody to the DPRK to attend the  birthday celebrations of President Kim Il-song," said foreign  ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin, when asked at a weekly press  briefing whether even a low-level delegation would go. Wu  insisted Beijing enjoyed "good relations" with Pyongyang,  despite reports in Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN newspaper Thursday  that North Korea had targetted some surface-to-surface missiles  on China.    The spokesman said Beijing had not sent any senior leaders  to  Kim's 81st birthday last year -- however, Beijing's dispatch  then of only two artistic delegations was widely interpreted as  a snub to its long-time allies in Pyongyang. China has tried to  distance itself from Stalinist North Korea in recent years and  the ongoing crisis over Pyongyang's suspected development of  nuclear missiles has heightened the tension. While refusing to  support sanctions against North Korea to force it to open its  nuclear facilities to international inspection, China -- a UN  Security Council member -- has not thrown its support fully  behind Pyongyang while refusing a role as an intermediary in the  dispute. On Monday, Pyongyang rejected a China-framed appeal  from the Security Council for it to allow full International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections.    Wu dismissed suggestions the rejection had humiliated  Beijing. "We are always of the view that the nuclear inspections  issue of the DPRK should be settled through dialogue and all  parties concerned in this issue also expressed their desire to  continue resolving this issue through dialogue. So there is no  such thing as losing one's face," he said.    The Chinese ministry spokesman meanwhile reiterated  Beijing's  support for a negotiated settlement to the dispute, critizing  the U.S. dispatch this week of Patriot missiles to South Korea.  "Any action detrimental to the relaxation and stability of the  situation on the peninsula, be it military exercise or  deployment of missiles, is something we are not in favour of,"  he said. "Under the current circumstances, all parties  concerned should in particular refrain from taking actions that  will exacerbate the conflict," said Wu, urging all sides to show  "patience."</p>

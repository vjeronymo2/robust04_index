			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> c. What production guarantee is used to determine if the winter wheat has an adequate stand? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The provision that applies to these questions is unchanged from the present wheat endorsement. Actuarial tables for the counties in question do not designate a wheat type. When a type is not designated, the guarantee is based on wheat production without regard to the type. This guarantee is used for APH purposes and is also used to determine whether or not an adequate stand exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For winter wheat in counties that only have a spring final planting date, the policy states that insurance will attach on the earlier of the spring final planting date or the date the insurer agrees to accept the acreage. The policy also requires insureds planting winter wheat in these counties to request insurance for winter planted wheat. One comment suggested that because the insurer must inspect the crop to determine if an adequate stand exists, insurance should attach when the insurer agrees to accept liability (not on the spring final planting date). The comment suggested that the applicable sentence in subparagraph 7.(a)(2)(v) should be revised to read as follows: ``*&blank;*&blank;* Insurance will attach to acreage having an adequate stand on the date we agree to accept the acreage for insurance.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The policy language was written to set a specific date by which the insurer must accept liability. The language requires insurers to inspect acreage in a timely manner so that the insured can be advised about the coverage level prior to the spring final planting date. No changes have been made in the provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under the winter coverage endorsement, FCIC is giving producers two additional coverage options for losses on winter wheat that is damaged prior to the spring final planting date. A Montana producer expressed concern that the new provisions may change the current basic winter wheat coverage and premium levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The basic coverage under the wheat provisions is similar to the existing wheat endorsement. The changes (primarily replanting payments in certain instances) may have a small impact on the rate charged for the base coverage. The new basic policy (without the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement) clearly states that winter wheat damaged prior to the spring final planting date must be replanted in counties with both winter and spring final planting dates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One comment recommended that the calendar dates for the end of the insurance period be moved to the Special Provisions. The comment also indicated that it is incorrect to state that the end of the insurance period is ``October 31 following planting in all other states'' because, in many states, the crop is planted prior to October 31. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FCIC agrees that language regarding the end of the insurance period is incorrect and has made appropriate corrections. The Common Crop Insurance Policy (&sect;457.8), to which the Small Grains Crop Provisions attaches, requires that the calendar date for the end of the insurance period be indicated in the crop provisions. FCIC will consider placing this date in the Special Provisions at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One comment expressed concern that the provisions pertaining to sufficient or improper application of insect or disease control measures could lead FCIC towards micro-management. The comment also indicated that an over-zealous appraiser could unjustly claim that a producer did not use the right timing, kind of pesticide, or the equipment for application. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

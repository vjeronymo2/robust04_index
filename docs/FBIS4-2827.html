			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. F-18 warplane  accidentally dropped a 227-kilogram bomb upon downtown Gorazde  densely populated by Muslims Monday [11 April] while  implementing NATO's second air raid against Bosnian Serb  positions southwest of the Muslim enclave.    According to the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, the heavy  bomb caused serious material losses and high casualties and, as  a result, many horrified residents fled to mountains around the  town.    But the agency did not give the exact number of casualties.    Two U.S. bombers destroyed two Serb military ambulances and  killed two medical workers Monday afternoon when bombing the  Serb positions two kilometers away from downtown Gorazde.    It was reported that both NATO and the Pentagon are  dissatisfied with the two air raids against the Serb positions.    In the first air strike Sunday, two U.S. F-16 planes could  not find the targets in time as they lost contact with the land  control system. They hastened to drop bombs when fuel was  running out before they could return to their base.    In Monday's operation, the bad weather over Gorazde and the  complex terrain might be reasons for the accident.    Inspecting Serb positions around Gorazde, Bosnian Serb  leader  Rodovan Karadzic said that the United Nations, when authorizing  NATO to launch air strikes against Serb positions, has committed  a gross mistake that could lead to "disastrous consequences."    He also accused Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose,  commander of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia who called  in the NATO warplanes to bomb Serb positions, of siding with one  warring party, referring to the Muslims.    Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb Army who was  accompanying Karadzic during the inspection, said he and  Karadzic had ordered Serb soldiers to shoot down any NATO  warplanes that will stage air raids against Serb positions again.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Equitable Life sets share price below expectations EQUITABLE Life, the large but troubled US insurance company, yesterday finally set the price at which it is selling shares to investors at Dollars 9 apiece. This is well below Equitable's initial expectations of Dollars 11 to Dollars 14. The flotation of 43.5m shares is the final step in a lengthy conversion process, transforming the Equitable from a mutual insurance company (controlled essentially by its policyholders) to a conventional shareholder-owned business. The conversion is the largest demutualisation which has taken place in the US. The first step in the demutualisation process took place last July when Axa, the French insurer, agreed to invest Dollars 1bn in the Equitable in return for a large minority stake in the US insurer when conversion took place. The size of that stake depended on the price at which shares were floated; yesterday's decision means that Axa will get 49 per cent of the common stock. Equitable's policyholders, who received a 'free' handout of shares in the demutualisation process, will own about 19 per cent of the equity. The flotation of shares to outside investors will raise only Dollars 361m. Of this, Dollars 220m will go to pay dividends and expenses, and Dollars 72m will fund cash payments and policy credits for policyholders. About Dollars 69m will be used to increase Equitable's statutory surplus.</p>

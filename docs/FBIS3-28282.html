			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takuro Naka, journalist: "`Reason' and `Emotion' </F> Entwined Ozawa's Glittering Human Connections"]    [Text] He Had Begged: "I Would Appreciate Your  Cooperation, Mr. Yamagishi"    The words, "praise and criticism," seem to exist for Ichiro  Ozawa. From the breakup of the Takeshita faction of the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] in 1992 to the birth of the non-LDP  coalition cabinet, the entire political world was divided into  the "pro- and anti-Ozawa" groups. Questioned on whether to  accept or reject the "Ozawa-style politics," it has gone through  a sieve and moved forward to restructuring.    Political reporters, who also act as political movers, were  divided into two camps as well. A copy desk editor at a national  newspaper says, "Depending on whether the politician to be  interviewed was for or against Ozawa, our people at the  political desk were clearly divided into two groups. We had  heated arguments every day on how to evaluate Ozawa's speech and  action."    Here lie Ozawa's unique connections with people and the  strong awareness of his existence as a politician. A bureaucrat  who is considered as a close associate of Ozawa looks at the  praise and criticism of Ozawa: "Members of the LDP criticize his  aggressive methods for being undemocratic. But that misses the  point because no one speaks as straightforwardly as Mr. Ozawa.  For example, he even tells us bureaucrats that one government is  enough, and that he will eventually have to fight with us for  political reform. If you want to follow Mr. Ozawa, you will have  to accept what he says, and if not, you will oppose him  completely."    Notwithstanding his straightforwardness, Ozawa sometimes  assumes an extremely reverent posture toward his seniors,  especially those whom he respects. Although he talks haughtily  to the politicians and newspaper reporters who are junior to  him, more often than not he addresses his seniors politely as  "Mr. so and so," even if they are Dietmen of the ranks lower  than him.    There is a famous anecdote. Former Prime Minister Kakuei  Tanaka, who had been arrested by the Tokyo District Public  Prosecutor's Office in 1976 in conjunction with the Lockheed  payoff scandal, was released on bail and staying at home in  Mejirodai, with nothing to do. During that time, a young Dietman  visited Tanaka almost every day to play his favorite game of  Japanese chess. That was Ozawa; he was 34 then.    Ozawa was born in 1942, the same year as Tanaka's eldest  son, who died at a young age. Tanaka entered the political world  when he was 26 and took care of Ozawa dearly from the time he  joined the Tanaka faction. He even thought of marrying his  eldest daughter, Makiko, to Ozawa, who was two years older than  she. It's not difficult to imagine how fondly he thought of  Ozawa, who came every day to play Japanese chess quietly with  him, now an accused in the criminal case.    Capturing Tanaka's heart was the beginning of Ozawa's human  networking, both in terms of quality and quantity. Soon  afterward, Ozawa began to distinguish himself quickly within the  Tanaka faction and the LDP. Then, after leaving Tanaka and  forming the Takeshita faction, he became favored by the new don,  Shin Kanemaru. He captured the number-three position under  Noboru Takeshita, the head of the faction, and Kanemaru.    Ozawa began his own political career, surrounded by his  colleagues in the Diet, secretaries, and supporters, all of whom  were his seniors. His "charming the elders" method, which was  used on Tanaka and Kanemaru, is his learned way of success in  life. He has also used this method in developing strong  connections outside the political world.    In the spring of 1993, Ozawa had a meeting with Akira  Yamagishi, chairman of the Rengo [National Confederation of  Trade Unions]. Reportedly, he sat formerly on the tatami floor  and then lowered his head reverently over his hands placed on  the floor in front of him, saying, "Mr. Yamagishi, I would  appreciate your cooperation" in political reform and  restructuring of the political world. Impressed by this gesture,  Yamagishi, who had been suspicious of Ozawa's tactics, became an  Ozawa sympathizer. Then, after the election for the House of  Representatives in July, he kept his promise by exercising his  influence in having the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]  join the coalition government.  <H3>  Mobilizing Money and People in the Business, Labor, and  Religious Circles </H3>   In the business world, he is also well trusted by Gaishi  Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren, and Masaya Miyoshi, its  secretary general. The reason for Keidanren's curtailment of  political contributions to the LDP seems to rest not only on the  public criticism against the corruptive relationship between  politicians and industries, such as in the case of general  contractors, but also on leading businessmen's expectations for  Ozawa on restructuring of the political world.    Furthermore, in the religious world, Ozawa is reported to  have a strong connection with Taisaku Ikeda, honorary chairman  of Soka Gakkai. Originally, according to some sources, Ikeda had  connections in the political world through Noboru Takeshita.  However, Ozawa approached Ikeda, reportedly through a leading  member of Soka Gakkai who acts as a pipeline between his  organization and Komeito.    Ozawa has Komeito involved in the movement for political  restructuring; he even made Komeito's general secretary (Yuichi  Ichikawa) say, "I don't even mind losing our party's identity."  This is not only because Ozawa has a good relationship with  Ichikawa, but also because he has already obtained Ikeda's  virtual approval.    By developing close relationships with Tanaka and Kanemaru,  the former dons of the political world, as well as with the  leading figures in the business, labor, and religious worlds who  can mobilize a large amount of money and people, Ozawa has  created the man he is today.    Also in the mass media, he was favored by the late Osamu  Togawa, who was quite influential in the political world. He  used this connection to build his network in various circles.    Ozawa served once as minister of home affairs, his only  experience as a cabinet member. But, as he was a central figure  within the LDP, serving as its secretary general and was a  deputy cabinet secretary for the Takeshita administration, he  has a wide array of connections in the ministries and agencies  in Kasumigaseki.    There are many "Ozawa sympathizers" among the bureaucrats in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], especially because he  was involved in the Japan-U.S. construction talks when he was a  deputy cabinet secretary, and also as a secretary general of the  LDP, he was involved in formulating Japan's response to the Gulf  war and in drawing up the UN Peacekeeping Cooperation Law. He  seems to have cultivated these human contacts through "reason,"  while he used "emotion" to get hold of the hearts of Yamagishi  and other leading figures in various circles.    His leading protege [within MOFA] is Minoru Tanba, the  current director of the Treaties Bureau. During the Kaifu  administration, he was promoted to director of the UN Bureau,  replacing the former director who had made a series of mistakes  in replying to interpellation in the Diet on an international  peacekeeping cooperation bill (rejected). Since then, he worked  as Ozawa's right-hand man in drafting the UN Peacekeeping  Cooperation Bill. He is considered to be MOFA's most persuasive  speaker and is also an adviser to Ozawa.    Another leading protege is Michihiko Kunihiro, the current  ambassador to China, who headed a cabinet-level committee on  foreign affairs when Ozawa was deputy cabinet secretary, and was  involved in the Japan-U.S. construction talks along with Ozawa.  He joined the MOFA in the same year as Hisashi Owada, who  retired from his position as vice minister. Although he lost the  battle with Owada in becoming a MOFA vice minister, he  successively held such important posts as counselor on foreign  affairs, ambassador to Indonesia, and ambassador to China. He is  also a member of Ozawa's brain trust.    There are also some young MOFA bureaucrats who are devoted  to  Ozawa and are willing to volunteer as interpreters whenever  Ozawa receives prominent individuals from foreign countries.    Also, Yukio Okamoto -- who resigned from MOFA when he was  head of the First Section of North American Affairs and is  currently a consultant on foreign affairs -- is considered as a  close associate of Ozawa.    Another individual is Nobuo Matsunaga, the don of MOFA and  former ambassador to the United States, who is now an adviser to  MOFA. He is close to Yasuhiro Nakasone and thus is not  considered quite a member of Ozawa's brain trust. However, he  serves as chairman of the "John Manjiro Historical Group" of  which Ozawa is the de facto sponsor.    The group's purpose is to promote friendly relations between  Japan and the United States in memory of Manjiro Nakahama, who  went to the United States as a castaway toward the end of the  Edo period and devoted much labor to serve as a mediator between  Japan and the United States in the Meiji period. The one who  played a most active part in creating the group was Sadao  Hirano, a Dietman in the House of Councilors, who is from Kochi  Prefecture as was Manjiro and is considered to be Ozawa's most  trusted friend. The group was "created to expand Mr. Ozawa's  horizon and people contacts" (per a member of the group). In  fact, Ozawa has been cultivating his contacts through this  group.    For example, the group's directors include Takaya Sugiura,  chairman of All Nippon Airways; Hitoshi Kojima, president of  NTT; and Minoru Makihara, president of Mitsubishi Corporation.  Ozawa seems to have regular meetings with them.    Moreover, he is "on good terms" with Michael Armacost, the  former U.S. ambassador to Japan during the Bush administration;  he has had a number of meetings with him every month since he  was LDP general secretary. Also, Richard Chaney, the former  defense secretary, and Walter Mondale, the current U.S.  ambassador to Japan, are scheduled to speak at a meeting of the  "John Manjiro Historical Group," which is to be held in Tokyo  in the near future. They also seem to have strong relationships  with Ozawa.    His Book, Blueprint for Building a New  Japan, and Brains Behind It    Additionally, in the political world he has Nobuo Ishihara,  the deputy cabinet secretary (for administration), who reigns  over the bureaucratic organizations. He was the vice minister at  the Ministry of Home Affairs when Ozawa was the minister. When  the Takeshita administration took power in 1987, Ozawa became  deputy cabinet secretary (for political affairs) and installed  Ishihara as deputy cabinet secretary for administration. Since  then, Ishihara has served five successive prime ministers --  Takeshita, Uno, Kaifu, Miyazawa, and Hosokawa.    Although Ishihara tries to maintain a neutral stance on  political affairs, he is hawkish like Ozawa, upholding his  principles. Therefore, former prime ministers Kaifu and Miyazawa  disliked his Ozawa-like qualities, and tried to get rid of him  by making him governor of Tokyo or changing his post. However,  as Ishihara is a capable public servant who knows the  bureaucratic structure well, and can't be replaced by anyone, he  has been a deputy cabinet secretary for the longest period of  time in history. He plays the role of Ozawa's outpost within the  cabinet.    Norihiko Narita, who is known as an expert on political  reform, especially on electoral systems, left his post as  section chief at the National Diet Library to become the head  secretary (on political affairs) for Prime Minister Hosokawa. He  has also become a member of Ozawa's brain trust through Hirano  on the political reform issue.    A system of single-seat constituency and proportional  representation was based on Narita's idea -- in the midst of  debate on political reform during the ordinary session of the  Diet, it was proposed by the Private Political Reform Promotion  Council (Private Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform) as a  compromise between the leading and opposition parties'  proposals. Some people stipulate that Prime Minister Miyazawa  and the LDP members didn't want to support the proposal readily  because they felt that Ozawa was behind it.    Now, let's look at organized labor, which played a major  role  in forming the coalition government.    Here, as mentioned earlier, the main driving force has been  Akira Yamagishi, the don of organized labor, who became an Ozawa  sympathizer. But even before him, some young labor  leaders--including Etsuya Washio, chairman of the Japanese  Federation of Iron and Steel Workers' Unions; Teruhito Enomoto,  chairman of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers'  Unions; and Hisaji Sonoki, vice chairman of Rengo--have been  involved in political reform through their participation in the  Private Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform. They also had  several meetings with Ozawa and are in agreement with his stance  on political reform.    A unique individual in Ozawa's connections in organized  labor  is Masamitsu Shirojima (chairman of the labor union at  Ajinomoto), chairman of the Council of the Food Industry  Workers' Unions. He is known to be conducting his own political  activities; he formed a fraternal organization for new labor  leaders called "Shunju-kai" and has been actively cultivating  relationships with Dietmen from Komeito. He met Ozawa through  Yoshihisa Inoue, former Dietman in the House of Representatives,  and other members of Komeito. He is now like a brain for Ozawa  in the organized labor sector, inviting the people close to  Ozawa in the mass media to speak at various gatherings of  corporate executives in the food industry.    In the business world, in addition to such aforementioned  people as Hiraiwa, Miyoshi, and the members of the "John  Manjiro Historical Group," Ozawa seems to be well connected to  the top executives of the Mitsubishi group and the Toyota group  companies, including Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor  Corporation.    Aside from these politically charged connections, Ozawa is  rumored to have a group of intellectuals on his side. The rumor  came about because of his best-selling book, Blueprint for  Building a New Japan [Nihon Kaizo Keikaku], which has been  reviewed quite favorably.    A scholar on foreign affairs says, "At least on the issue of  foreign affairs, the content of the book has enough substance  for us to read. As I heard, the book was written mostly by Mr.  Ozawa, but it seems to me a summary of discussions from some  research studies. He must have a group of scholars [who helped  him write the book] although I'm not one of them." In fact, the  book has been talked about a lot lately in the academic world.    Ozawa doesn't disclose the existence of such a group of  scholars, probably to protect their status in the academic  world. According to the consensus of opinion, however, the chief  scholar is Shinichi Kitaoka, professor at Rikkyo University, who  is building his popularity recently as a political scientist.  According to some people (in the academic world), "Mr. Ozawa  seems to have a desire to develop this kind of young scholar."  Takeshi Sasaki, professor of political science at Tokyo  University, who appears frequently on TV, also often exchanges  opinions with Ozawa on the issue of political reform.    Regarding the issue of the Constitution, Setsu Kobayashi,  professor at Keio University, who supports constitutional  reform, served as an advisor to Ozawa and spoke at a meeting of  the "Research Committee on Japan's Role in the International  Community" (the so-called Ozawa Committee), which was  established within the LDP in 1991. Kenichi Ito, professor at  Aoyama Gakuin University, also seems to have some contact with  Ozawa in the area of political reform and foreign policy issues,  although he can't be considered as a member of Ozawa's brain  trust.    In the mass media, Ikki Kasuya , chief editor of GAIKO  FORUM,  is supposedly acting as a coordinator between Ozawa and these  scholars. Also, Kenzo Uchida, professor at Tokai University and  former editor in chief at KYODO News, and commentator Taro  Okuyama, have the same line of thinking as Ozawa in promoting  political reform.  <H5>  Foreign Minister Hata Is Ozawa's Close Friend </H5>   Let's now turn to the political world, Ozawa's home ground.    Ozawa entered the political world when he was 26, soon after  the death of his father, Saeki Ozawa, who had served as  construction minister, among others. Saeki was a member of the  Fujiyama faction of the LDP, and one of his colleagues in the  faction was Masumi Ezaki, former vice premier, who just retired  at the time of election for the House of Representatives in  July. Ezaki, who had left the Fujiyama faction and joined the  Tanaka faction, acted like a legal guardian for Ozawa.    As if to return favors he received in the past, Ozawa had  Ezaki's fourth son, Tetsuma, run for election as a candidate  from his own party, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Toshihiro  Nikai, who entered the political world after having served as  Ezaki's secretary, also joined Shinseito and has become one of  Ozawa's trusted young associates. Ezaki is an important  connection for Ozawa although he chose a separate way when the  Takeshita faction was formed.    It is a well-known fact that Ozawa's wife, Kazuko, is a  daughter of the president of Fukuda-gumi in Niigata, who was a  financial supporter of Kakuei Tanaka. Through this marriage,  Ozawa not only strengthened his relationship with Tanaka, but  also formed a new bond with Noboru Takeshita -- they became  distant relatives when a sister of Ozawa's wife was married to  Takeshita's brother, Meguru.    Second-generation Dietmen are also important among Ozawa's  political associates. Soon after he was elected as a Dietman for  the first time, Ozawa began to cultivate friendships with those  young Dietmen who are second- generation politicians as he is.  He probably felt close to them because they were in the same age  group and hadn't been affected by local politicking.    These Dietmen include Tsutomu Hata, Ryutaro Hashimoto, and  Keizo Obuchi, all from the Tanaka faction, and Toshio Yamaguchi  and Koichi Kato from other factions. Hata is a contemporary of  Ozawa; Hashimoto and Obuchi are two terms senior; Yamaguchi is  one term senior; and Kato is one term junior to Ozawa.    Hata, Hashimoto, and Obuchi were Ozawa's "comrades" when the  Takeshita faction was formed from the Tanaka faction. At the  time of the breakup of the Takeshita faction at the end of  1992, Ozawa acted together with Hata, but fought and parted with  Hashimoto and Obuchi. Hata and Ozawa won their first election  campaign in 1992 and became cabinet members for the first time  in the same year. Although they are rivals, they are close  friends, calling each other as "It-chan" and "Tsutomu-chan."    Yamaguchi formed the Shinjiyu Club [New Liberal Club], and  had been distant from Ozawa and the others. But suddenly, he  became close to Ozawa again when Ozawa was secretary general of  the LDP. At some point, he used to frequent and stay in the  secretary general's office. Then, during the vote of  no-confidence in the Miyazawa cabinet during a plenary session  of the House of Representatives that prompted Ozawa and others  to form Shinseito, he voted for no-confidence and left the LDP.  Although he doesn't belong to any political party at present,  rumors strongly suggest that he will join Shinseito in the near  future.    On the other hand, Kato and Ozawa used to be good friends  until a few years ago, writing each other's name in the  friendship column of a political news magazine. But they parted  with each other because Kato became a member of the  anti-political reform and anti-Takeshita faction group in order  to back Miyazawa. At one point, Ozawa even tried to approach  Yohei Kono, who was Kato's rival within the Miyazawa faction.    Aside from the second-generation Dietmen, Ozawa is on good  terms with three of the so-called seven magistrates of the  Takeshita faction -- Seiroku Kajiyama, Kozo Watanabe, and Keiwa  Okuda. Although he joined the effort to form the Takeshita  faction rather late, Okuda quickly became close to Kanemaru and  Ozawa. Since then, he was one of the first to advocate  restructuring of the political world, and when Shinseito was  formed in July he spoke up strongly for leaving the LDP and  joining Shinseito. He is the foremost supporter of the Ozawa  line in the party. Watanabe has also been an Ozawa sympathizer  for a long time. He and Ozawa share the same birthday, with a  10-year difference in age, and have thrown a joint birthday  party every year.    Among the young Dietmen from Shinseito, four individuals --  Hajime Funada, Keisuke Nakanishi, Hiroshi Kumagai, and Toshiro  Nikai -- are highly regarded as Ozawa's close associates. Funada  served as the director of the Ozawa Committee. Since then, he  has been close to Ozawa and frequently appears on TV as a  substitute for Ozawa.  <H5>  Upholding His Principle for Human Relations </H5>   Nakanishi and Kumagai play the roles of "Suke-san and  Kaku-san" [trusted assistants who served Lord Komon Mito during  the Edo period]. Having served as deputy secretary general under  LDP secretary general Ozawa, Nakanishi is like a leader of  Ozawa's action corps. Kumagai, a former bureaucrat at the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry, has been acting as  Ozawa's right-hand man in foreign affairs, accompanying Ozawa on  his trips to the former Soviet Union and other countries or  preparing for his visits beforehand in these countries.    A close associate of Ozawa worth special mention here is  Sadao Hirano, a Dietman in the House of Councilors. He served as  secretary to Shigesaburo Maeo, former speaker of the House of  Representatives, and as a house committee chairman. He has been  a friend of Ozawa since Ozawa was chairman of the Committee on  Rules and Administration. He is said to be well informed of  stories behind the stories in the political world as well as  political machinations, and as such he is the best source of  information for Ozawa on everything from how to handle  legislative proposals to political reform. As mentioned earlier,  he is the one who created the "John Manjiro Historical Group."    One of the main characteristics of Ozawa's human relations  is  that he has many strong sympathizers outside his own political  party and faction. Especially famous is his close friendship  with Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, and Takeshi  Yonezawa, general secretary of the Democratic Socialist Party.  They not only play pivotal roles in the coalition government,  but also form the center of the stormy movement toward political  restructuring--they are trying to develop a group of unified  candidates to create a new New Party.    Ozawa's friendship with Ichikawa and Yonezawa originates in  spring 1992 when they had heated discussions night after night  on the issue of additional financial aid in the amount of $9  billion for the Gulf war -- they eventually materialized this  additional aid. They are good friends, enjoying singing  occasionally at Karaoke bars. This is a typical example of  Ozawa's way of developing human relations -- mixing "reason" and  "emotion."    There were also some young Dietmen in the SDPJ who  sympathized with Ozawa on the political reform issue. They are  Nobutaka Tsutsui, Yoshito Sengoku, and Shuo Matsubara, all of  whom lost in the last election due to the waning popularity of  the SDPJ. Matsubara, however, decided to leave the SDPJ and is  planning to run in the next election as a candidate from the  Shinseito.    Finally, let's examine the flaws and weaknesses in Ozawa's  people connections.    As mentioned at the beginning of this article, when Ozawa  believes he is right, he tends to cut people off, saying, "If  you don't agree with me, you don't have to stay with me." This  creates animosity toward Ozawa and drives his once close  associates to leave him at once.    Koichi Kato is a good example. Also, Kishiro Nakamura and  Kenzo Muraoka, who had been considered as Ozawa's close  associates along with Nakanishi during their years in the  Takeshita faction, became strongly against Ozawa when the  Takeshita faction broke up in 1992. This is a danger that is  always present in Ozawa politics. However, one young Dietmen  from Shinseito says, "Mr. Ozawa is not the type of person who  will bend his principle for the sake of human relations. Even if  he goes into pieces in terms of his human relations, he will  have to go forward. The question is how many people will be able  to follow him then."</p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Austria 30-year deal further widens German maturity range THE Republic of Austria further extended the maturity profile of the German bond market yesterday when it raised DM1.5bn through an issue of 30-year Eurobonds. Austria's 30-year issue is part of a process which was started in August by LKB Baden-Wurttemberg Finance when it launched the first offering of 15-year bonds in the D-Mark sector. The issue raised DM1bn but was increased by DM500m shortly afterwards to satisfy investor demand. Syndicate managers said that Austria's offering was well received by the market, which raised hopes that the German government and other highly-rated borrowers would follow suit. In 1986, Germany's low inflation rate prompted its government to issue two DM1bn offerings of 30-year bonds. However, they became illiquid as changed market conditions dissuaded the government from issuing more 30-year bonds. Due to the lack of benchmark German government bonds beyond 10 years, yield spreads in the Dutch government bond market are used in the pricing of long-dated D-Mark Eurobonds. Lead manager Deutsche Bank said 30-year Dutch government bonds were yielding 56 to 59 basis points more than 10-year Dutch government bonds. In addition, Austria's D-Mark Eurobonds were yielding 8 to 10 basis points more than German government bonds. Therefore, Austria's 30-year Eurobonds will be priced today to yield 65 to 68 basis points over the German government's 6 per cent bond due 2003. Istituto Nacional de Industria, Spain's state industrial holding company, will launch its well-flagged Dollars 500m offering of five-year Eurobonds today. The bonds are likely to be priced to yield 37 - 40 basis points over US Treasuries. Cable &amp; Wireless is expected to raise Dollars 400m early next week through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. The issuer is well-known among investors and although unrated, it is perceived as being double-A risk. However, the yield spread on the bonds will also reflect C&amp;W's exposure to Hong Kong. China Textile Machinery is due to launch a SFr35m five-year convertible bond offering today, the first by a Chinese company listed in mainland China. China Textile, which is 50 per cent state-owned, is listed in Shanghai. The bonds, which carry a three-year put option, will be convertible into China Textile's B shares. They are likely to have a conversion premium of between 5 and 10 per cent and a coupon of between 1 and 2 per cent. If the put option is exercised the bonds will yield around 4 per cent. Hanson plc has launched two commercial paper programmes, one for Dollars 2bn in the European market and the other for ADollars 400m. Drawings under the Australian programme will reduce the amount available under the European programme.</p>

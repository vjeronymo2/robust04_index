			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Property: Learn from the past, or pay in the future - Will history repeat itself A year ago the UK property market was in the depths of its worst postwar depression. Yet there has been a remarkable turnround in market sentiment over the past 12 months. For the investment market is now gripped by a euphoria more intense than at any time during the late-1980s heyday. Investment by UK institutions is much increased, and this domestic weight of money is combining with a big inflow of overseas capital to force yields down at an accelerating rate. Yet rents are still falling, and vacancy rates remain at record levels. Can history help us to understand what is going on, and in which direction we are heading. The answer is yes. For some parallels are emerging between current events and those which followed the mid-1970s crash. In each case, the crash saw property yields move to a record high. But in each case investor sentiment then reversed, because the correction in yields had gone too far, making property historically cheap Crucial to current investor enthusiasm for property is the expectation that inflation, and therefore gilts yields, will stay low for several years. In this belief, investors will push yields down further than they have moved so far. Property Market Analysis, a research consultancy, forecasts that the average all-property yield could fall as low as 6 per cent by 1995, close to the record low attained in the late 1970s. But they are unlikely to stay at such a level for long. Optimistic voices today argue that 'inflation is dead'. The assumption is that the economy can be kept on a 'slow but steady' growth path for the next few years, and the deflationary Budgets of 1993 will certainly help this aim. However, the government will face an almost irresistible temptation to indulge in another tax-cutting Budget in 1995, ahead of the next general election. Once more inflationary forces will be unleashed, just as they were by the Lawson Budget of 1987 - plus ca change? When this happens, property yields are likely to adjust back up again quickly. As always, there will be winners and losers in this investment casino. However, of more lasting importance to the sector, and to the wider economy, is the impact of the recovery in the investment market on development. As values rise, developers are dusting off the planning permissions which they had to shelve in the crash. The development appraisals which looked so negative only a year ago are beginning to stack up again. This year will therefore see the start of a new wave of development in the UK market - funded not by the banks but by the institutions. Again, there is a historical parallel. The decline in yields after the 1974 crash encouraged institutions to engage in direct development for the first time. And by the early 1960s commercial building starts had risen back close to their real level at the height of the early 1970s boom. As before, these buildings reached the market just as the economy was plunging into the recession of 1980-81. There was no collapse in rents, because they had only just started to recover from the previous crash. However, real rental growth was stalled for five years, until the upswing at the start of the late-1980s. The lesson of the early-1980s cycle is the risk that a new investor-led wave of development in the mid 1990s will choke off the very recovery in rents upon which it is founded. For the worst combination of circumstances would be excessive development reaching completion just as the economy moves into another business cycle downturn in the second half of the decade. The result would be the combination of stagnant rents, rising yields and falling values with which we are all too familiar. Equally, if not more, important than the likely volume of building is the question of whether the next wave of development will produce the right type of buildings to meet occupier demand. The industry is of course aware of the importance of responding to conditions in the occupier market - particularly at a time of substantial over-supply. However, the industry must also be responsive to the needs of the investment market, and these two sets of demands do not necessarily coincide. The growth of institutional demand tends to produce ever-larger development schemes, irrespective of the predominant occupier demand for small and medium units. The search for prime investments is speeding up economic obsolescence, as each wave of over-supply pushes more secondary buildings towards vacancy and redevelopment, way before the end of their physical life. Finally, the criteria of 'institutional acceptability' militate against innovative developments, yet they tend to produce buildings which are over-specified for occupier needs, because of the desire for 'trophy investments' which add prestige to the fund. The more autonomous these investor demands, the greater the risk that they will fail to meet the changing patterns of occupier demand. There are four trends which could produce important changes in occupier requirements for property over the next 10 years. First, occupiers may come to favour smaller buildings in more dispersed locations. Advances in information technology networking will accelerate the current 'downsizing' of businesses. At the same time, changes in the labour force, particularly the trend towards more part-time female employment, will strengthen the demand for workplaces closer to home, to reduce commuting times. Second, a desire for more functional, energy-efficient buildings could go hand-in-hand with the suggested shift in demand towards a smaller-scale, more dispersed pattern of development. There is evidence that developers are moving away from some of the excesses of the 1980s, in the design of office buildings and shopping centres. Third, there is evidence of demand for more mixed-use developments, giving greater integration of urban activities. Schemes which mix housing, shops and offices may be preferred in a society concerned about improving the quality of life through increased security and reduced congestion. Fourth, there are signs of a reaction against large-scale out-of-town development. The most obvious example so far is government resistance to the further undermining of town-centre retailing by the twin assault of regional shopping centres and superstores. Similar resistance may emerge to the development of business parks with inadequate public transport access. The problem is that such trends would run directly counter to the recent dynamic of development. However, unless the industry adapts to changing patterns of occupier demand, it will find itself producing more of the same in the next development cycle - unwanted buildings of the wrong size and specification in the wrong place. In this sense, there could be a high price to pay if history does continue to repeat itself in the market. The author is a partner with Property Market Analysis, a research consultancy.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Positive' move on stadia plans MPs PRESSED the government last night to rethink plans to make all soccer clubs install all-seat stadia by the turn of the century. Mr Tom Pendry, chairman of the all-party parliamentary football committee, said it had received a 'very positive response' from Mr David Mellor, the national heritage secretary, whose department has responsibility for sport. The prime minister, like Mr Mellor a supporter of Chelsea, is understood to be ready to reconsider rules that require Third and Fourth Division clubs to install seats by 1999. It is unlikely that he will shift from his insistence on all-seat stadia for clubs in the top two divisions by 1994. The government backed Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation for scrapping terracing after the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. The committee argued yesterday that league clubs had spent millions of pounds on safety improvements at a time when they were facing escalating policing costs.</p>

On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the  State Council, and the Central Military Commission, I hereby  extend my cordial regards and high respects to all of you, to  all democratic parties and patriots without party affiliation,  and to workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres, commanders and  fighters of the People's Liberation Army, armed police officers  and men, and public security cadres and policemen of all  nationalities across the country. I hereby also extend my  sincere festival greetings and good wishes to Taiwan  compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, our countrymen  living abroad, and our international friends who have shown  concern for and given support and assistance to China's  modernization drive.    The year 1993 was a year in which, under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we continued  to win victories by grasping the opportunity to deepen reform  and to develop the economy rapidly and in a healthy manner. It  was also a year in which we made a major stride toward the goal  set by the 14th CPC National Congress of building a socialist  market economic system. China has maintained social and  political stability, our economy has developed rapidly, people  of all nationalities have worked in unison, and new progress has  been made in our endeavors in all spheres. Last year, we  continued to reap bumper agricultural harvests, our industrial  production grew rapidly, the domestic market was brisk, our  foreign trade was active, and our people's livelihood continued  to improve. We won new diplomatic victories, and China's  international influential power grew further. All these  encourage us to usher in the new year with full confidence.    The year 1994 will be a very crucial year for our reform,  opening up, and modernization. All party members and people of  all nationalities across the country should more closely unite,  work industriously, adhere to and carry out the guidelines of  the 14th CPC National Congress and of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and, closely revolving around  the central task of economic construction, go all-out to push  forward our socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and  socialist spiritual civilization.    In the new year, the nucleus of our efforts to deepen reform  is to meticulously organize and implement a series of major  reform measures designed to build a socialist market economic  system. Due to the arduousness and comprehensiveness of the  task, many new situations, problems, or even difficulties are  bound to arise. Therefore, we must make thorough preparations  beforehand, decide the best time to initiate each reform  measure, carefully observe the progress we make, sum up  experience in a timely manner, and ensure that our work is  successful. We should continue to bring up new ideas of  economic development, strengthen and improve macroregulation and  control, and apply ourselves to restructuring the economy, to  truly bring about a coexistence between speedy development and  an improvement in economic efficiency. In carrying out the new  year's economic work, we not only should make new major progress  in economic reform, but we also should strive to make new  progress in increasing our agricultural development potential,  in increasing peasants' income, in transforming state-owned  enterprises' operating mechanisms, in increasing these  enterprises' vitality, in increasing the quality of enterprises'  economic management, in assuring good order in our economic  activities in all sectors, and in further broadening the scope  of opening up to the outside world, so that we ensure that our  economy develops rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner.    In the new year, one of our important tasks in developing  socialist democratic politics is safeguarding and developing  unity and political stability by relying on and uniting the  people, so as to continue providing good social and political  conditions for reforms and development. Leading comrades at all  levels must bear in mind Comrade Xiaoping's important thinking  that "stability is the overwhelming priority"; must correctly  understand and handle the dialectical relationship between  reform, development, and stability; and must correctly  understand and handle the two types of social contradictions  differing in nature. Leaders at all levels must crack down on  crime according to the law; they should never be tenderhearted  in dealing with crime. At the same time, they should earnestly  study the new form of contradictions among the people and the  trend of development of such contradictions and pay particular  attention to new problems and new contradictions which may be  created as a result of the need to further readjust the  structure and relationship of interests in the course of  deepening reform. Under no circumstances should they be  negligent in this regard. From a long-range point of view, the  development of the economy and the deepening of reform can  further rationalize the various patterns and relationships of  interests and lead to the objective of common prosperity for all  people. However, in the course of reform it will be difficult  to avoid certain degrees of gaps in benefits received by the  people. Leading comrades at all levels must be good at  analyzing and handling all types of contradictions among the  people; they must do their ideological- political work and other  corresponding work among the people meticulously and solidly to  make them feel that the party and the government are reasonable  and that they are sincere about safeguarding their interests and  about caring about their hardships. Thus, the people will  truthfully and sincerely support us and actively help us, or  coordinate with us, in handling the various types of  contradictions and problems. In this way, political stability  and unity will continue to consolidate and develop.    In the new year, we must vigorously promote the building of  a  socialist spiritual civilization and strive for a breakthrough  in achieving the progress of spiritual civilization in the  entire society. This is urgently necessary if we are to  accelerate reforms and development and bring about all-round  progress in society. This also constitutes the urgent demand  and common aspiration of the people of all nationalities across  the country. In everything we do, we must do so according to  the demands and aspirations of the people. Only thus can we  gain their trust, and only thus can we gain the initiative and  be successful in our work. At no time should we forget this  historical truth. Our important strategic policy is to build a  material civilization and a spiritual civilization  simultaneously in the entire process of embarking on the  socialist modernization drive. The more vigorously we develop  the socialist market economy, the more truly we should  strengthen the building of a spiritual civilization; develop  education, science, and culture; arm the people with a correct  ideology and ethics; and develop a noble, healthy atmosphere  characteristic of our nation, a good social order, and a good  social mood. This will provide us with a strong motivation and  an important guarantee for building a material civilization, and  ensure the all-round development of socialism with Chinese  characteristics.    To ensure long-term political stability in China and to make  it a prosperous and strong country, we must arm the whole party  with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. We must adhere to the ideological line  of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts; strive to  strengthen the party ideologically and organizationally; improve  its style of work; and consolidate and strengthen the  flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the people. The call  of the times and the expectations of the people demand that we  strengthen the building of party organizations at all levels in  the new period and that, in particular, we build a contingent of  cadres who are capable of carrying on and developing the party's  fine traditions, who are capable of going deep into reality to  see how things really are, who advance in a pioneering spirit,  who dare to assume responsibility, who take the interest of the  whole into account, and who carry out their duties honestly.  Cadres at all levels must bear in mind that they should  establish contacts with the masses, carry out propaganda among  the masses, organize the masses, and unite the masses to work  for their own benefit -- this is our party's underlying strength  and asset, as well as a way for to achieve victories in all  areas of our work. We sincerely hope that everyone will give  primary consideration in every respect to the interests of the  party and the state, will make the masses their base, will  discard all kinds of unhealthy practices of bureaucratism and  formalism, will make progress in their leading skills and work  methods, and will create a new style in wholeheartedly serving  the people's interests.    The CPPCC has availed itself of the elite of prominent  figures of all democratic parties, prominent figures without  party affiliation, and prominent figures from all circles of the  country. Over the past year, they earnestly carried out their  responsibility to conduct political consultations and democratic  supervision, in accomplishing a great deal of work and making  many contributions. Adhering to the principles of "long-term  coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other with all  sincerity, and sharing weal and woe," the CPC will continue to  strengthen its close cooperation with all democratic parties and  patriots without party affiliation, to give better play to the  system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation  under the CPC's leadership. I hope that each of you will  continue to offer your opinions and suggestions for the  country's reform and development so that we can combine our  efforts to serve the country and the people.    Realizing the great cause of the motherland's reunification  is a sacred mission of all Chinese people, as well as an  inevitable trend of the development of the Chinese nation. The  Chinese Government and people across the country have the  confidence, determination, and ability to promote the  motherland's reunification according to the principle of  "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems." We  resolutely oppose any forms of "two Chinas," "one China and one  Taiwan," or "one country, two governments"; we resolutely oppose  any discussions and actions aimed at promoting "Taiwan  independence." We hope that the Taiwan authorities will put  national righteousness above everything else and agree to  establish direct contacts between the two sides of the strait as  soon as possible under the principle of one China, in order to  do some practical things to pave the way for the motherland's  peaceful reunification. Recently, due to Britain's insistence  on its erroneous position, the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's  1994-95 election arrangements have broken down. As a matter of  course, this has been denounced by all Chinese people, including  our Hong Kong compatriots. Whatever problems may lie ahead, we  will join all patriotic compatriots of all circles of Hong Kong  in upholding the "one country, two systems" principle and the  principle of the Hong Kong Basic Law; we will not change our  determination to restore the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong and to preserve Hong Kong's long-term stability and  prosperity. We believe that with the common efforts of the  Chinese and Portuguese Governments, a steady transition of Macao  and a smooth handover of its political power will be ensured.    In the world's current process of the development of  multipolarization, China is an important force for preserving  world peace and stability. China's development will not pose a  threat to any country. We oppose all kinds of hegemony and  power politics. In the new year, we, as always, will practice  our independent foreign policy of peace, insist on developing  friendly and cooperative relations with all countries on the  basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and  continue to work actively to build a peaceful, stable, fair, and  reasonable new international order.    Comrades and friends, the lofty cause that we have been  toiling to achieve is to build China into a strong, democratic,  civilized, and modern socialist country, following the path of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Whatever  difficulties and disturbances we might encounter on the way of  our expedition, our great cause shall not waver, and the pace of  our advance must not slacken. Let us unite together more  closely, firmly grasp the historic opportunity, and work hard  for the Chinese nation's rejuvenation and the Chinese people's  good future.</p>

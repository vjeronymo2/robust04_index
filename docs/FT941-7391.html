			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Two stones roll into China's path to HK: A double event has made Beijing's regaining the colony harder though no less sure - LegCo may have scored a victory in a war destined to be lost Until this week it was possible to argue that developments in Hong Kong were moving in China's direction. Opinion polls showed people getting bored and frustrated with the bickering about politics. Governor Chris Patten's popularity showed signs of slipping. There was even talk of defeat for Mr Patten in an important vote in the local legislature. But two things have changed this outlook and made China's recovery of Hong Kong in 1997 no less certain, but seemingly more difficult. The first was Wednesday's vote in the Legislative Council (LegCo) on the first stage of Mr Patten's plans to broaden democracy in the colony; the second, the publication of a disturbing report about attitudes to China held by the colony's senior civil servants, virtually all of whom are ethnic Chinese. Contrary to expectations, Wednesday's vote showed the margin of support in LegCo for Mr Patten's democracy plans had increased. Excluding the three officials who had to vote Mr Patten's way, the majority in favour of pushing ahead rose to 10 from 8 members of the 60-strong assembly. This increased margin may prove a useful cushion to Mr Patten when LegCo comes to debate his second political reform bill to be published today. In the face of Chinese opposition, this bill seeks to broaden the democratic franchise for 40 of LegCo's seats at present subject to restricted votes. The significance of Wednesday's vote was that China had drawn a line and Hong Kong's local politicians collectively crossed it. China had said, and it repeated it yesterday, that it would repudiate whatever LegCo decided because no agreement between Beijing and London had been reached on the conduct of Hong Kong's elections this year and next. LegCo ignored the warning and defied Beijing. This defiance may prove no more than an early victory in a war LegCo is destined to lose. China is viscerally opposed to what Mr Patten is doing; it views any attempt to lay down the roots of western democracy in Hong Kong as Britain's way of perpetuating colonial rule. It also holds the cards. Beijing is busily working on the 'second stove', its term for Hong Kong's political structure after 1997. The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), a group of 57 mainland officials and Hong Kong plutocrats, has been charged with designing this structure. The PWC is at present meeting in Beijing to discuss the future structure of Hong Kong's executive branch of government; by July it plans to have concluded its work on the political structure. The hope expressed by British officials is that by the time China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong it will see that the result of LegCo's 1995 polls pose it no threat. As Mr Jimmy McGregor, an independent democrat, put it on Wednesday: 'What may be impossible or difficult for China to accept today may be less so in three years' time. Possibly. But Hong Kong's senior civil servants do not appear to think so. An academic survey of attitudes to 1997 held by the 1,000 top managers of the colony's 180,000-strong civil service lays bare a crisis for China in the making. The civil service, one of Hong Kong's prized elite institutions, is often credited with providing the foundation for the colony's remarkable economic success. Members of the directorate, as the top echelon is known, are recruited from the cream of the colony's educational institutions. According to Dr Jane Lee, a co-author of the study and a member of the department of public and social administration at the City Polytechnic of Hong Kong: 'The civil service in Hong Kong is valued for its efficiency and rationality; it is seen as incorruptible. 'Even though the government is not elected, it enjoys a high degree of legitimacy because of the civil service'. Yet her survey found a third of top civil servants said they plan to leave government administration before 1997; another 30 per cent were undecided. 'Strong resentment exists against political interference from China. A sense of impotence is evident among senior bureaucrats,' she and her co-author Prof Joseph Cheng said in the report. Senior civil servants have moved to protect themselves by taking out foreign nationality; 77 per cent have a foreign passport. In doing so, they have effectively disbarred themselves from senior positions after 1997. When China resumes sovereignty, top officials will not permitted to have the right of abode outside Hong Kong.</p>

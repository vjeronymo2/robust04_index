			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ipeco suffers from lower interest rates IPECO HOLDINGS, the Southend-on-Sea aerospace and defence equipment group, showed little overall change in 1992, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.3m, against Pounds 3.38m. Sales rose from Pounds 18m to Pounds 19.9m and operating profit from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 3.06m, but that was counterbalanced by a reduction from Pounds 458,000 to Pounds 234,000 in treasury operations as interest rates fell. Earnings per share dipped to 7.72p (8.18p). Having regard to the continuing strength of the operating profit and ungeared balance sheet, the dividend is stepped up from 3.4p to 3.6p, the final being 2.3p. On the future Mr Christopher Johnson, chairman, believed the main part of order rescheduling activity by large airframe makers had been completed, and the group could have some 'reasonable confidence' in the delivery projections of the core aerospace equipment business. There was evidence of increasing customer demand in the defence and aircraft maintenance and refurbishment activities, he said. See People</p>

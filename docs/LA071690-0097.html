			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> WITH A BOOST FROM JPL, JAPANESE LUNAR MISSION MAY GET BACK ON TRACK  </P> <P> Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena have come up with a way  to salvage a troubled Japanese space mission, but they will need a little help  from a strange area of space called the "fuzzy boundary."  </P> <P> Japan became only the third nation in history to launch a successful lunar  mission earlier this year when it sent a basketball-size probe into orbit  around the moon.  </P> <P> The achievement was hailed as a major one for Japan's Institute of Space and  Astronautical Science. A small research center with an annual budget of only  $150 million, it is the rival of Japan's more powerful and better endowed  National Space Development Agency.  </P> <P> But the success was diminished when the spacecraft's transmitter failed just as  the probe reached the moon and it could not send back the scientific data it  was sent to collect.  </P> <P> Now experts at the Jet Propulsion Lab have devised a bold plan that could  salvage Japan's mission by diverting the mother ship that launched the lunar  orbiter and sending it to the moon also. The maneuver would be a tricky one,  because the larger spacecraft was not designed for lunar orbit. But Japanese  officials have eagerly embraced JPL's suggestion.  </P> <P> The joint Japanese-American effort began during an informal discussion, said  Edward A. Belbruno, a mathematician at JPL who is among a handful of scientists  dabbling in the fringe field of doing more with less -- almost heresy in  today's world of space science.  </P> <P> Belbruno and James K. Miller, an expert in orbital mechanics at JPL, think they  have figured out how to get the mother ship -- now in an elliptical orbit  around the Earth that carries it beyond the moon's orbital path -- to orbit no  more than about 60 miles above the lunar surface.  </P> <P> If the mother ship had been designed to do that, the task would have been  relatively simple. At just the right moment as it was passing the moon, the  craft could have slowed down by firing its engines, allowing the moon's gravity  to pull it into close orbit.  </P> <P> But the spacecraft carries only a limited amount of fuel.  </P> <P> "I think they would spend too much propellant" if they tried to reach lunar  orbit through traditional methods, Miller said. "They wouldn't be able to do  anything when they got there."  </P> <P> So, how does a spaceship get into lunar orbit when it wasn't designed to go  there?  </P> <P> In a recent report to Japanese officials, the two JPL scientists said the  larger spacecraft could be put into lunar orbit by taking advantage of the  "fuzzy boundary." That is a region of the sky about 1 million miles from Earth  where the gravitational fields of the Earth and the sun nearly cancel each  other out, leaving a spacecraft vulnerable to subtle influences.  </P> <P> "Funny things can happen there," Belbruno said.  </P> <P> Miller compared the fuzzy boundary, also known as a weak stabilization  boundary, to the top of the arch created when a baseball is tossed into the  air. At the top, the baseball is moving very slowly, and even a minor force can  change its course substantially.  </P> <P> The spacecraft could alter its course to carry it close to the moon by firing  its thrusters while in the fuzzy boundary, where only a slight nudge would do  the job. That would put it on the right course to intercept the moon, and the  maneuver would use little fuel. Once it reaches the moon, the spacecraft could  gently slip into orbit by once again firing its small thrusters inside another  fuzzy boundary created by the canceling gravitational fields of the Earth, the  sun and the moon.  </P> <P> If the plan works, the spacecraft could provide valuable scientific data.  Miller said it carries a highly sensitive tracking device, a Doppler  transponder, that would allow scientists to monitor its flight precisely. That,  in turn, should tell much about the moon's gravitational field, something that  will be important in future moon missions.  </P> <P> Like the Earth, the moon is "very irregular, a lumpy body," Miller said. So its  gravitational field is somewhat irregular. Those irregularities could affect  future satellites.  </P> <P> However, the real payoff from the Belbruno-Miller proposal -- if it works --  could come in the years ahead when huge quantities of construction materials  are needed to build a permanent lunar base. By learning to take advantage of  the fuzzy boundary, scientists could save enormous amounts of fuel that  normally would be needed to transport the heavy equipment and supplies,  Belbruno said.  </P> <P> The trip would take longer, about four months instead of three days, but "that  translates into weight" that can be carried at no additional charge, he said.  </P> <P> Japanese officials are now examining the proposal. In their latest  communications with the JPL team, Japanese engineers said they had done the  same computations and had come up with the same conclusions. The attempt to try  it could come next April.  </P> <P> GETTING TO THE MOON  </P> <P> Scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have come up with a plan to send a  Japanese spaceship with a low supply of fuel into lunar orbit with help from an  area in space called the 'fuzzy boundary.'  </P> <P> The fuzzy boundary is a region of space where the gravitational fields of Earth  and the sun nearly cancel each other.  </P> <P> 1. Briefly firing the rocket's thrusters while in the fuzzy boundary between  Earth and the sun will put it on course for the moon using very little fuel.  </P> <P> 2. A second firing in the Earth-moon fuzzy boundary will ease the spaceship  into lunar orbit.  </P></p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / BNF accounts delayed by Thorp BRITISH Nuclear Fuels' annual report and accounts, which had been expected last week, may not be published until the end of January because of uncertainty about the future of its controversial Thorp reprocessing plant. BNF said last night: 'We are hanging on as long as possible until we get a clear picture on Thorp'. The state-owned company is obliged to produce accounts by the end of January, 10 months after the end of its financial year. Testing of the Thorp equipment began again early yesterday after a leak of nitrogen dioxide gas on Tuesday afternoon. BNF said yesterday that the cause of the leak was the testing equipment, not Thorp. Mr John Kane, secretary of the Sellafield unions' campaign committee, which is pressing for Thorp's operational go-ahead, said the unions did not intend to change their pro-Thorp campaign because of the incident, although they conceded that its timing was unfortunate. 'It was just during testing; the idea of testing is to find out if there's anything wrong,' he said. The government has already said that it is 'minded' to give approval for the plant. It will make a final decision after the current public consultation, due to end on October 4. BNF said that the uncertainty 'affects all kinds of figures, not least how to write off the costs of building Thorp if we do not get authorisation'. The company has warned that profit for the year will be less than Pounds 100m - a drop of Pounds 60m on last year - because of the delay. BNF, which expected a licence to start operation at the start of the year, says it has been losing some Pounds 2m a week while waiting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports from the areas of Hasbayya and  Jazzin, the Israeli occupation forces have started to  disseminate information on an impending withdrawal from these  two areas, which could be done suddenly sometime within the next  two months.    The NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY [NNA] correspondent in al-Nabatiyah  has reported that the information coincides with the completion  of the road that the occupation forces recently dug between Jisr  al-Khardali and Tallat Khazin in the Jazzin area and the  creation of an iron gate in Tallat Khazin. The correspondent  added that this Israeli step may indicate that a new crossing  point will be set up there in lieu of the Kafr Huna-Batir  crossing. Other information indicates that the Kafr Tibnit  crossing will be removed and that crossing will be restricted to  Tallat Khazin after the withdrawal from Jazzin, the  correspondent said.    The NNA correspondent pointed out that the construction of  the new crossing point coincides with the Israelis' evacuation  from their last position on Tallat al-Ahmadiyah in Hasbayya,  which overlooks Western al-Biqa', and the handing over of all  their positions to the agent militia 20 days ago.    The correspondent cited sources in the area as saying that  should this withdrawal be carried out, the town of Jazzin and  nearby villages--including 'Aramta, al-'Ayshiyah, al-Qatranah,  and al-Surayri--will return to the legitimate authority's  control and that the Sidon-Mashgharah road will be reopened via  Jazzin.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Arts: Non-vintage but plenty of fizz - Edinburgh International Festival NOBODY would call this a vintage year for the Edinburgh Fringe: a fact which probably reflects the recession. I won't spend time on most of the Fringe shows I've seen this year. I was glad to see an Italian troupe, Le Maschere, perform Goldoni's Un Curioso Accidente at the Richard Demarco Gallery (in Italian) and an Edinburgh student troupe, Les Escogriffes, perform Marivaux's Les Fausses Confidences at the Adama House Theatre (in French), but my pleasure was in the plays. Likewise Sex After Supper, a celebration of erotic poetry from Shakespeare to the Restoration, was a welcome introduction to reams of period sex. In none of these cases, however, were the performances remarkable. It is a tonic when an interpreter of real authority turns up. In the case of Eleanor Bron there are two types of interpretation involved. She has translated from the German Christine Bruckner's Desdemona - if you had only spoken] (1983) - subtitled 'Eleven Uncensored Speeches of Eleven Incensed Women' - and has had it published by Virago (paperback Pounds 5.90). She is also presenting three of the speeches as a one-person show, directed by Stuart Burge. At the Pleasance it is a sell-out, with several hundred viewers a day. Bruckner's ploy - women of history or legend telling history or legend their way - is not new, but it is fun. This is Feminism Without Tears, devoid of stridency; Goethe's common, fat wife does not rail at Goethe but merely rebukes his aristocratic soul-love, Charlotte von Stein, for being so snotty. As a stage show, it is meant to be a tour de force, and succeeds. Everything about Bron turns into expression. The very bones of her face are grateful for the limelight; the grand arcs of the eyebrows rise and fall; the dark eyes themselves turn and gleam; the teeth and lips shine and open. She turns each character, flawlessly, into someone British. Martin Luther's wife busy at her kitchen table, is Scottish; Petrarch's Laura, dying of the plague, speaks with the grand utterance of a Mediterranean aristocrat who has learnt English; Goethe's wife Christiane, fat, heavy, fond of port and not long to live, is Yorkshire. But the show is rather too charming. I admired Bron's elegance and virtuosity, but she didn't always make these characters real. We're too conscious of the effect each moment is designed to make. Her diction is beautiful, but it goes more for the music of the lines than their drama. (The two need not be distinct goals.) Bron is always a charmer; but she could be so much more. As sociology and as politics, but not as entertainment, let me recommend the late-night Moulin Russ, a satirical cabaret given by half-a-dozen Moscow University Student Show. The intellectual age of most Festival fringe Shows is about 19, but this one is nearer 12. The kids begin by sending up the world's cliched idea of Russia - Tchaikovsky, soul, high art - and then present an equally cliched but far more cynical idea, in which all Russians are bored with work, are besotted with vodka and keep committing suicmde. I laughed three times. Twice at the all-male dead-drunk Siberian Tango, all off-balance and drink-driven. And once as the cute compere behaved like a pimp to one of his girls and took from her the tip she had just received; beaming at the audience, he announced proudly 'Our first step towards capitalism.' The show's most interesting side was its pretence at decadence while displaying a sexual innocence unknown in the West. Once I thought two men were miming fellatio, but no, it was just part of some mirthless Russian romp. At the end they all go swimming, and two of the men are briefly seen naked. What larks] The rest of the show was dire - with the kids lip-synching poorly to taped songs in Russian and miming heavily, repetitiously and very eagerly. The zest with which they sent up the sins of Russia was baffling. Don't these studunts know these harsh jokes at Russia's expense have all been made before, for decades, inside Russia and out?                          *      *      * WHEN so much is on offer, how best to judge the music at the Edinburgh festival? Contrary to the headlines, which busy themselves with the big operatic and orchestral events, the climate is probably most accurately gauged at the recitals. A morning that starts well at the Queen's Hall, the festival's prime recital venue, will be a day on which the sun shines for the visiting music-lover. Weather report this year: mostly fine so far. A series of five solo vocal recitals has brought together an uncommonly talented group of young singers. Three have appeared in the festival's opening fortnight; the other two are scheduled for the final week. They promise to be very different musical personalities, but if the ideal young recitalist is one fresh and uncomplicated, the first in the series will have fitted the bill nicely. The early-morning sunshine shone right through Barbara Bonney's programme. With her bright soprano and unaffected manner, she made songs by Mendelssohn and Grieg effortlessly sparkle. There is more depth to some of the music she chooses, such as Berg's Seven Early Songs and the more brooding of the Richard Strauss, that this essentially bright-eyed, pristine singing can find. It was surprising to find her miss the dewy-eyed delicacy of Strauss's Standchen, too. But within her own scope of interpretation everything works. Barber's Hermit Songs, well accompanied by Geoffrey Parsons, were particularly engaging. This is an unusual series of songs to pre-medieval monastic Irish poetry and Bonney's ability to resoind simply and honestly, without the slightest trace of the sentimental, went to their heart - a shining example of the art that conceals art. The second to appear was Isabelle Vernet, accompanied by Marie-Jeanne Serero. This French soprano, on whom so many hopes have been pinned, is a more complex proposition by far. Not the least reason for that is the voice itself, a fine, if unpredictable instrument, poorly-focused, uncontrolled at the top, but also saturated in beautiful and sensuous colours. There is operatic potential here without a doubt. Unfortunately, the young Vernet arrived in Edinburgh with her luggage packed full of ideas from her teacher, the much-loved Regine Crespin. As she made her way through a programme of French songs, including Faure, Hahn, Ravel's Sheherazade and even Rosenthal's Fido the dog, a favourite Crespin encore, there was barely a phrase which was not an echo of her great predecessor. But in replication, all that had been individual originally lost its force. Her love for the songs is not in doubt. The promise is real. Now it is time for the real Miss Vernet to sing out. The third of the singers, and the most warmly received, was Andreas Schmidt, taking the place of the advertised Uwe Heilmann. Those who have followed this young baritone's career closely say that he, too, used to emulate a certain great Lieder singer. But his performance of Schubert's Die schone Mullerin was largely free from affectation. This was a scrupulously prepared piece of singing, a bit monochrome, with not much spontaneity, but giving pleasure in the exemplary warmth and roundness of the voice. Schmidt must have worked hard to get the tone sounding so natural on every vowel. Everything essential is already in place for the mature artist to develop at his own pace. Geoffrey Parsons was again the pianist, offering accompaniments inidividually tailored to Schmidt's requirements, not just off-the-peg support. His frequent presence is another feature that reliably signals a good start to the day.</p>

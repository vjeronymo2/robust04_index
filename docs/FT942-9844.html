			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Visible trade deficit narrows to Pounds 731m Britain's trade balance may be improving, it emerged yesterday, with figures showing the surprise narrowing of February's deficit. The slight closing of February's deficit - to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 731m from January's Pounds 880m shortfall - was greeted with relief in the City, which had predicted a widening to about Pounds 1.1bn. The Central Statistical Office also released a government review which revised the 1993 deficit figures by a smaller-than-expected amount. The news helped to lift sterling by nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark in London to close at DM2.5052. After a sweeping analysis of the new system used to collect trade data in the European Union, known as Intrastat, the CSO said UK imports from the EU had been revised up by Pounds 300m - lifting last year's visible trade deficit to Pounds 13.7bn from Pounds 13.4bn previously. The City had expected to see a significant deterioration in the 1993 UK trade balance of about Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn. But some market analysts yesterday remained unconvinced by the review. They warned that February's improvement partly reflected record oil exports. If oil and other erratic items are excluded from the February figure, the deficit widened to Pounds 1.34bn in the month from Pounds 1.29bn in January. The three-monthly balance - regarded as the more accurate indicator of trends - showed an improvement in the deficit to Pounds 3.02bn for the three months to February from Pounds 3.58bn during the previous three months. February's smaller-than-expected deficit was largely brought about by a drop in imports, which fell 3 per cent, compared with a 1.8 per cent fall in exports. Coming after five months of strong import figures, some economists suggest this indicates a slight easing in the pace of UK recovery. Others believe UK industry may be replacing imported goods in home markets. The Treasury welcomed the figures. 'This should ease commentators' worries that the balance of payments will be a constraint on performance,' it said. Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said the figures showed a 'pretty stable performance'. Details, Page 10; Government bonds, Page 27; Currencies, Page 29; London stocks, Page 38; See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The federal leadership of the Free  Democratic Party [FDP] has frankly conceded its severe defeat in  the Saxony Anhalt state elections. FDP General Secretary Werner  Hoyer described the result here this evening as an "electoral  disaster" and "a bitter moment for the Liberals." What is  needed now above all is to give FDP members enough motivation  for the forthcoming state and federal elections, he said.  According to Hoyer, the reasons for the result lie in "the poor  image of the federal FDP as a whole" and also in certain special  reasons regarding the FDP in Saxony-Anhalt.</p>

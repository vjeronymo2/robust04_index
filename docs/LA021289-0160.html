			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER'S STANCE ON GAYS AND LESBIANS  </P> <P> I was sickened by Dannemeyer's letter. His representation of our county in  Congress as well as that of his ideological twin, Rep. Robert K. Dornan, is an  embarrassment to all reasonable-minded citizens.  </P> <P> As a mental health professional for the last 24 years I take exception to  Dannemeyer's view that homosexuality is a personal choice. All homosexuals I  have had contact with have expressed feelings of being "different" as soon as  early latency period and, at the latest, early adolescence.  </P> <P> To think that an individual would willingly choose to be treated as a leper and  be subjected to discrimination and prejudice is foolish.  </P> <P> As a resident of Laguna Beach, I find our homosexual neighbors concerned about  the identical issues as other homeowners. I know of no homosexuals who are  remotely interested in "hopping from small city to small city to promote  ordinances" as the representative's paranoia would suggest. I, for one, have  had enough of his sick rantings.  </P> <P> KEA SIMON  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

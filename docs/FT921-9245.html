			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Burton chief takes Pounds 750,000 pay-off MR Laurence Cooklin, who succeeded Sir Ralph Halpern as chief executive of Burton Group, is leaving the company after little more than a year in the post with a pay-off of Pounds 773,000. The company provided no official reason for his departure although analysts suggested that Mr Cooklin had not performed with sufficient vigour to impress Burton's non-executive directors. Mr John Hoerner, a 52-year-old American who previously ran Debenhams department stores, took over as chief executive yesterday. His priority will be to address the future strategy of Burton's struggling fashion multiples, such as Burton, Top Shop, Top Man and Dorothy Perkins, which many industry observers believe are unsuitable for the changed retailing climate of the 1990s. Mr Cooklin, who had been on the Burton board for 12 years, was intimately linked with the Halpern era. His compensation package was certainly reminiscent of Burton's extravagant years which saw its directors receiving substantial bonuses. Sir Ralph Halpern received a Pounds 2m pay-off when he left the company in November 1990 and two other departing directors, Mr Paul Plant and Mr Michael Wood, received compensation packages of Pounds 600,000 and Pounds 350,000 respectively. Mr Cooklin is also entitled to unspecified bonus payments deferred from past years. Burton's remaining executive directors have all been appointed since Sir Ralph's departure. Ms Kimlan Cook, retail analyst at stockbrokers County NatWest, said Mr Cooklin had helped remedy some of the worst mistakes of the past. 'But he failed to make the necessary radical changes to the fashion multiples,' she said. Verdict, the retail consultancy, is about to publish a study which shows that Burton steadily lost market share in the year to August. Mr Richard Hyman, Verdict's director, estimated that Burton's share of the Pounds 17.3bn UK clothing market had fallen from 9.5 per cent to 8.8 per cent. 'The significance of Burton's figures has to be placed in the context of a strategy that has seen them sacrificing margin to maintain volume. They have given away margin and they have lost market share,' he said. Mr Richard North, Burton's finance director, said Burton had since stemmed this loss of market share and was perhaps now regaining it. Lex, Page 20</p>

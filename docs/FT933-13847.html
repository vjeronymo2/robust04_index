			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): A change of climate for the rainy-day money - John is dismayed by low building society interest rates, and Alison disregards the opinion of Mr Stagge / The Plowshares JOHN IS in his study, perusing the six-monthly interest statement from his wife's building society account. He is appalled to see just how little the return on their rainy-day money has become. Pushing aside piles of papers, he eventually finds a calculator. After a fair amount of cursing and scribbling on the back of an envelope, he discovers that the Pounds 22,000 which the couple prudently left in the building society (in Alison's name, for tax purposes) is now getting interest at only half the percentage rate that was applicable when they put the money into the account two years ago. Further digging in John's desk produces the statements on the family's portfolio of unit trusts and returns on its personal equity plan holdings. Things look decidedly brighter on this front, where the unit trust portfolio is up more than 30 per cent over the past year, thanks to the kind attention of Mr Stagge, of stockbrokers Stagge &amp; Hoppit; and their Pep holdings are worth Pounds 31,000. It seems to John that the time may be right for a little portfolio updating. Later that evening, he and Alison are eating supper and discussing life in general. John is certain that he has spotted the tiniest, most insubstantial green shoot of recovery at work - a middling-to-large project having arrived at his firm's door, requiring it to take on a new member of staff. Better news on the work front has made him quietly confident that things may be improving generally. He tells Alison: 'I've been thinking about our rainy-day building society money. We've got over Pounds 20,000 which is only earning 6 per cent interest at the moment, while our equity investments through unit trusts made just over 30 per cent last year. 'I think that we should move some of the savings money over to equities. History shows that equities have always outperformed simple savings accounts over the long term.' Alison rather enjoys the fact that she has something of a proprietary hold over the building society money, because it is in her name and she is wary of giving this up. So her response to John is to suggest that they look into other options for their savings very thoroughly, rather than just stuff it into the unit trust portfolio. 'The rainy-day money isn't supposed to be exposed to any risk,' she reminds John. 'Remember that we are always supposed to be able to get at it in an emergency.' The next day, as the Plowshares devour the Sunday papers, John finds an advertisement for a 'guaranteed stockmarket bond'. At first glance, this is a product made in heaven, specifically for them. With this type of product, held over a fixed period of five years, an investment earns a high proportion of the growth of, in this case, the FT-SE 100 share index over that period, while enjoying a full money-back guarantee against the original investment. Even Alison is hard put to find any problems with this concept, and the Plowshares send off for more information. When the brochure arrives, they sit down and pay particular attention to the fine print. The bond, it turns out, offers two types of return. In either case, the investor gets back all his investment after five years if the stockmarket does not grow at all. However, he can choose either to accept returns based on 98 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100 index, or to go for a lock-in option. In the latter case, returns are based on 90 per cent of the rise in the Footsie index, with growth locked in when the market achieves 20, 30, 40 and 50 per cent more than its current level. It is clear to the Plowshares that the second option lowers the amount of risk - but it also lowers the return. And the amount by which the return is lowered is effectively a front-end charge on the product - of either 2 per cent or 10 per cent, depending on which variation is chosen. A much greater charge on the product, however, results from the lack of a dividend yield. Were an investor actually to buy all the shares in the FT-SE 100 index, he or she would earn a dividend yield of 4-5 per cent a year, an overall return of 20 per cent plus over five years. Most guaranteed bonds do not give investors the benefit of the dividend yield. Of course, if the stockmarket were to remain completely flat for five years, there would be no charge on the product, and John likes the idea that they are guaranteed to get 100 per cent of their money back. Alison points out that this is not as good as it sounds. If the guarantee has to be used, they will have lost out on five years of interest payments, and their capital will have been eaten away by inflation. The tax structure of the bond is reasonably simple. Gains are paid net of income tax at the basic rate. On some products, sold by insurance companies, this tax cannot be reclaimed. When sold by building societies, however, returns can be received gross. For most taxpayers, though, this is not a particularly tax-efficient way of investing in equities. Most of the return on a unit trust, for example, is in the form of capital gain. Since few investors use up their annual CGT allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1993-94), such returns are effectively tax-free. The Plowshares' decide to take their findings to their stockbroker. Alison has insisted upon this concession, on the grounds that, once in a stockmarket bond, the investor ought to stay, because there are quite hefty penalties if you come out early. 'This is supposed to be rainy-day emergency money,' she reminds John again. 'We shouldn't tie it up.' When consulted, Mr Stagge agrees with the Plowshares that too large a chunk of their money is sitting on cash deposit. 'The growth of your unit trust portfolio and Pep,' he observes, 'is such that you have enough of a cushion to cover all emergencies. I would recommend that one of you take your maximum capital gain, of Pounds 5,800, out of your unit trust portfolio, top this up and put Pounds 6,000 into one more Pep.' Mr Stagge says that a good general rule is that, 'if you believe the markets are going to go up, buy an indexed unit trust; if you don't believe the market is going to go up, don't buy equities in the first place.' Nevertheless, Alison, having heard the arguments against the product, agrees with John that they should invest Pounds 10,000 in the bond, for one over-riding reason - security. 'I know that we are paying for the comfort of a guarantee,' she says, 'but I must admit to being fond of comfort.' Help in compiling this feature was provided by SM Searle, from Gerrard Vivian Gray, who put together the portfolio, and David Oldridge, of Hill Oldridge, who supplied financial advice.</p>

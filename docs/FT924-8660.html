			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Letter: Rethink on financial services regulation cannot be avoided Sir, Recent comments from authoritative sources indicate that City support for the Financial Services Act, always half-hearted at best, is now substantially eroded. As with so many modern compromises, the concept of practitioner-based self-regulation backed by statute has satisfied no one. Despite the government's well-known reluctance to countenance new or amended legislation in the field of financial services regulation, a fundamental rethink cannot be long avoided. It is hoped that the review ordered by the Treasury from the SIB will set the stage. Surely the problem is the fatal flaw in the original legislation initiative. The government sought to deal with two entirely distinct problems with a single bill. A more sensible approach would have been two separate bills, one dealing with investor protection within the retail financial services industry and the other with the wholesale and international markets of the City. The first bill would have been dominated by conduct of business and compensation issues and the second would have focused on systemic risk. It is absurd to believe that investor protection of the public at large can be self-financed and self-regulated. It is like asking the Police Federation to pay for and supervise policing. The so-called independent financial advisers cannot pay for regulation or pass the costs on to their clients and the producers of financial products are clearly disinclined to pick up the cost. The only alternative is to tax the wholesale markets but this will affect London's competitive position. The retail sector should be regulated by a taxpayer-financed government agency. Self-financed self-regulation should be applied only to the wholesale markets under the aegis of an agency with the same independence (in supervisory matters) and authority as the Bank of England. Harmonisation requirements driven from Brussels will force change in any case. To persist with self-regulation in the retail area is rightly deemed eccentric in the rest of Europe. However, the European wholesale financial community, mostly represented in London, could be mustered to support sensible and flexible regulation of intra-professional markets with maximum practitioner involvement in the process.

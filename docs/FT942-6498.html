			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: National Grid Goldman Sachs' appointment as the National Grid Company's adviser is not only a mark of how US investment banks are invading British banks' home territory. It also moves the Grid's flotation one step nearer. The final decision will be taken by National Grid Holding, the parent company, and the 12 regional electricity companies which own it. But the Grid itself is straining at the leash and Goldman, which masterminded Vodafone's demerger from Racal, will presumably furnish clever arguments for demerger this time too. The industrial case for demerger looks strong: the Grid would be able to develop its business better if it was free from the tutelage of 12 bickering shareholders. There is also something in the financial case: investors would be able to buy the Grid direct rather than via a Rec where it is submerged by other businesses. Still, most estimates of how much shareholder value would be boosted look optimistic. It is not possible, as some sales patter suggests, to add the Grid's value of, say, Pounds 4bn to the Recs' collective capitalisation of Pounds 13bn. Rec shareholders would quickly notice that the Grid's dividends, which account for nearly 10 per cent of Rec earnings, had vanished. They would also appreciate that the Grid's dividends provide high quality income for Recs since they are almost three times covered by the Grid's earnings. Finally, there could be a tax payment of up to Pounds 1bn. While ways of avoiding tax could be dreamt up, the Treasury would not be pleased. And, given its golden share in the Grid, it has the power to demand a slice of the profit.</p>

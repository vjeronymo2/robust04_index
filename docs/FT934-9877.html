			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japanese oil refiners pull out of Saudi deal JAPAN'S three leading oil refiners yesterday announced the cancellation of a Y1,000bn (Pounds 6.27bn) joint venture with Saudi Arabia. Nippon Oil, Nikko Kyodo and Arabian Oil said they were pulling out of the proposed oil refining project with Aramco, the Saudi-owned oil company, and Caltex Petroleum of the US, due to a sharp fall in demand triggered by Japan's economic slowdown. The decision is a blow to the Japanese government, which had hoped to establish a stable oil procurement route through the joint venture. Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice minister of international trade and industry, yesterday said the government regretted the cancellation. Saudi officials in Riyadh had no immediate comment on the cancellation of the proposed joint venture, feasibility studies for which began last year. The joint venture had planned to buy two existing oil refineries from Nikko Kyodo and Nippon Oil. It also planned to build a new refinery in southern Japan, but the Japanese refiners decided they could not afford to build a new plant which was expected to become profitable only after 12 to 14 years. Japanese oil refiners and distributors have been hit by the economic downturn, and Nikko Kyodo faces Y90bn in extraordinary losses caused by the liquidation of its US affiliate. The loss of expected income from the sale of the oil refineries to the joint venture may force the companies to implement cost-cutting measures. The Japanese joint venture was expected to cement Saudi Aramco's Asian presence. However, it is understood that the company has not abandoned plans to expand its downstream operations in Asia and is exploring possible alternative joint ventures in the region. The Saudi state oil group, which recently merged with the state refining and marketing arm, Samarec, is understood to have begun negotiations with other potential partners in Asia. No details have so far been made public, but the search for alternative deals would fit in with Aramco's long-standing plans to guarantee market access for its crude oil through participatory ventures. Saudi Aramco's moves to bind supplies of crude to joint venture refineries in its main markets began with the 1988 deal to supply about 600,000 barrels a day of Saudi crude to Star Enterprises, a 50-50 refining and marketing venture with Texaco, the US oil company. Three years later Aramco bought a 35 per cent stake in Ssangyong Oil of South Korea - the country's third biggest refiner. It has explored a similar such deal in Europe - though here again Saudi officials have refused to confirm any specific approaches to European refiners.</p>

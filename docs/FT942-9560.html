			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Under starter's orders - As France prepares for its summer invasion of Britons, Weekend FT writers have been gathering news and views from its regions Hors d'oeuvre. The phrase hangs heavy on my lips, associated as it is with meals unwillingly partaken in railway hotel dining rooms 30 years ago, experiences so gloom-laden that I have not dared return. It is difficult to forget the smell of stale foods that weighed down the curtains. The carpets with patterns that screamed. The occasional whisper between diners that passed for conversation. And the food. Hors d'oeuvre was probably the only alternative to glutinous Brown Windsor Soup. There were poor quality sardines swimming in poor quality oil, denied even a smattering of parsley to cover their misery. There were frozen peas, diced carrots and potatoes in salad cream masquerading as Russian salad. There were cold baked beans and hard-boiled eggs with rubbery whites and black-rimmed yolks that stuck in the throat like golf balls. Thank goodness for change. First, the spread of the trattoria with its lighter and fresher tasting antipasti forced British hors d'oeuvre trolleys to improve their standards. And now that the fashion for lighter eating is firmly established, hors d'oeuvre, antipasti, mezze, zakuski, call them what you will, have become a star turn. A sparkling selection of small and appetising dishes is rightly prized, not only for serving in its traditional role as a first course, but also as lunch in its own right. What could be nicer for lunch in the garden when summer weather plays fair? A few choice meats and fish are usual. Classics include fat salt anchovies, ventresca tuna and cured herrings. Also excellent are garlic fried squid, mussels lightly steamed and dressed with fresh herb vinaigrette, and brown shrimps or cold water prawns served in their pink armour with wedges of lemon or lime or home-made mayonnaise or aioli. I tend to wave the flag for meats such as Scottish smoked venison and Cumbrian or west country air-dried ham instead of salami and saucisson. Dairy produce may be welcomed by those who eat neither meat nor fish. For example: crottins or other small goats cheeses preserved in oil, sliced paper hoop thin and scattered with nasturtium petals. Cubes of salty ewes-milk fetta tossed with fresh chopped thyme, oregano and toasted coriander seed. Slices of buffalo mozzarella sandwiched between basil leaves and slipped toast-rack-fashion into slits made in large tomatoes cut nearly but not quite through. Pancake herb omelettes (one-egg omelettes, cooled, rolled up like a cigarette and snipped across into ribbons) are also good, as are hard-boiled eggs that are not indigestibly hard. (For yolks that are creamy rather than bullet-like, just cover the eggs with cold water, bring slowly to the boil and boil for six minutes only, then plunge in cold water to arrest cooking.) But the main part of the spread - indeed sometimes the whole of it - should consist of vegetable offerings. Currently a la mode, and utterly effortless for the cook, are such things as artichoke hearts, wild and cultivated mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, grilled baby onions and other bulbs preserved in oil. Quality varies enormously from brand to brand. Most of the best I have tasted come from southern Italy and are bottled in virgin olive oil. My own preference lies with raw vegetables and freshly cooked salads because they tend to be cleaner tasting. For the freshest impact, the trick is to serve cooked salads before they are completely cold after cooking. Never should they be chilled. Present favourites of mine include: Barely wilted spinach anointed with oil in which mustard seeds have been warmed until they popped. Baby courgettes halved lengthways, lightly steamed, patted dry and spread with parsley and coriander pesto. Baby leeks steamed and dressed with vinaigrette a l'oeuf. Steamed cauliflower sprigs tossed with olive oil, lemon juice, chopped capers, olives, mint and green coriander. Cucumbers are better, I think, seasoned with sugar rather than salt. Dress the slices with vinegar, but no oil, coarsely ground black pepper, chopped dill or herb fennel and starry-eyed blue borage flowers. Roasted red peppers call for oil but no vinegar, a little sea salt and a soupcon of finely chopped garlic. Small cultivated mushrooms (marrons for preference) are delicious raw if sliced and tossed twice over, first with a little salt and lemon juice, then with a few tablespoons of sizzling hot olive oil aromatised with bay leaves and toasted and crushed cumin. Boiled French beans welcome a squeeze of lemon if aioli is on the menu, or a few spoonfuls of very finely chopped tomato flavoured with a sliver of garlic and a few crushed fennel seeds. Raw wedges of crisp Florentine fennel need no adornment. Slices of avocado benefit from a dressing of chopped chillies, green coriander and lime. Good bread is always needed to mop up fragrant juices and to provide starchy contrast. A mealy dish of pulses is also to be recommended. Lentils with lovage and bacon makes a splendidly savoury choice: cook 5oz of little green lentils and a small chopped onion in  3/4 pt water with the juice and zest of half a lemon, adding salt only when the lentils are tender. Dress with garlicky vinaigrette using two parts oil to one of lemon and mix in 2 tablespoons of chopped tender young lovage leaves and 2oz grilled streaky bacon cut into snippets. If no lovage is to hand, add a pinch of curry powder to the cooking pot and finish the dish with chopped celery leaves.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Investment innovations on horizon in Japan - The new products to be introduced after Tokyo's markets are liberalised LIBERALISATION of Japan's financial markets, currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance, will result in the gradual removal of legal barriers which have restricted the introduction of new investment products. Revision of the Securities and Exchange Law, expected to be submitted to parliament next month, would pave the way for further deregulated interest rates, easing of barriers between the securities and banking industries, and widening of the definition of security. Rule changes are expected to be completed next year. While new vehicles are expected to be introduced gradually, it will mean more liquid secondary markets and more attractive instruments, increasing fee-generating activities for financial institutions. Liberalisation will also activate Japan's dwindling asset-backed securities market, allowing banks and corporations to minimise balance sheets. New instruments expected to be introduced in the near future include: Asset-backed securities: Growth of Japan's asset-backed securities market has been stunted by Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, the Japanese version of the US Glass Steagall Act, which defines negotiable securities as equity shares, or public and corporate bond certificates. Since asset-backed securities were not categorised as a security, institutional investors have been reluctant to actively invest in the products, and the market has remained at the Y1,000bn level, compared with the Dollars 1,000bn market in the US. The new definition of what constitutes a security is expected to be similar to that in the US, including promissory notes, loan trust certificates and monetary claims. Disclosure requirements are likely to focus on informing investors of the risks of the underlying assets. Brokerage officials believe that with legislative changes and new disclosure rules, institutional investors should feel more comfortable with investments in products such as corporate loans and housing loans. Securitisation of credit card loans and car loans are also viewed as potential new products for the individual. However, legal restructuring will involve other ministries, such as the Construction Ministry in the case of housing loans and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in the case of corporate loan securitisation, and a battle over legislative turf may hamper new developments. Money market funds: As an alternative to bank deposits, the securities industry plans to introduce a Japanese version of the US money market fund for individual investors. As with the chukoku fund, the currently-available medium-term government bond fund, the new product will be invested in medium-term Treasury bills, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. However, dividends will be closer to market rates, and the penalty fee for early withdrawal is expected to be reduced. Along with full-fledged deregulation in the future, a significant portion of the money market fund is expected to be invested into money market instruments, increasing product liquidity. New money trusts: Trust banks are expected to launch a new money trust product with dividend payments directly reflecting investment performance. Loan trusts, currently offered by trust banks, reflect the long-term prime rate. However, the investment trust industry is strongly opposed to the launch, as the funds will be invested in securities, including equity stocks. Bank deposits: Interest rate deregulation of large-lot time deposits over Y10m was completed in 1989, and deposits with a minimum balance of over Y500,000 now reflect market interest rates. Banks are now considering the creation of shorter term products, such as one-week deposits, in order to compete with the securities industry's money market fund. Interest-rate deregulation will force banks to raise rates on demand deposits, which account for a third of total deposits at Japanese banks. In order to cope with rising costs, the banks expect to introduce maintenance fees or minimum balance requirements for savings accounts.</p>

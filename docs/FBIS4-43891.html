			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with EC Commissioner Leon Brittan by Fabio </F> Squillante; place and date not given: "Brittan: If Rome  Supports Me, Axis With London Will Be Born"]    [Text] Brussels -- The 12 leaders of the European Union  [EU] will meet in Corfu on Friday [24 June] to decide, among  other things, who is to replace Jacques Delors as head of the  European Commission. One of the leading candidates is Sir Leon  Brittan, a "heavyweight" of the Commission since 1989. But  France and Germany oppose him, and Brittan desperately needs  Italy's support. However, Sir Leon has countered Italy in  matters ranging from steel to milk, and in 1991 he prevented  Alenia's purchase of De Havilland and defended the British side.  Just after the European elections, Brittan rejects his  anti-Italian label and puts forward his vision of Europe -- a  union of right-wing forces in parliament, an Italian-British  axis, and limits on the Commission's decisionmaking powers.    [Squillante] The European elections brought losses for the  Socialists and a fragmentation of the Right, with the entry onto  the scene of the anti-Europeanists. The only exception to this  was London. What is your assessment?    [Brittan] Your analysis is correct. The Left was weakened,  but the Right is more fragmented. The Right's capacity to  resist the Socialists therefore depends on cooperation among its  various parts. Personally, I am in favor of a rapprochement  among the groups of the moderate Right -- and I stress, moderate.    [Squillante] What role would you assign, as president, to  the  Commission?    [Brittan] The Commission must respond to public opinion and  acknowledge that in Europe now those who are unenthusiastic  about the speed of integration do enjoy some support. We must  involve the public and national parliaments more and tackle the  real tasks of EU, without becoming involved in the ordinary  lives of businesses and individuals. The first problem to tackle  is unemployment. The second is to extend the Union to the  countries of Central and East Europe -- and not only them --  without causing a slowing of the Union as a result.    [Squillante] Without a joint executive, can the governments,  exposed as they are to changes on the part of the electorate,  guarantee a continuous leadership of a Europe that will perhaps  have 20 members in the future?    [Brittan] The distinction between intergovernmental and  Community action was made in the Maastricht Treaty, and it will  not be substantially modified. With the membership of new  countries, it will be necessary to give careful attention to all  the Union's institutions and to consider how they might function  with 20 or 25 member countries, what changes need to be  introduced to ensure their proper functioning.    [Squillante] [Former French President] Giscard has again  suggested the idea of a "European president." Can this be  considered?    [Brittan] It is certainly an interesting idea, but I doubt  whether it could be accepted by everyone.    [Squillante] Britain has always advocated a "free trade"  Europe rather than a federal union. Some people in Rome share  this philosophy. Is it possible to envisage an Italian-British  axis?    [Brittan] At present there is a broad range of common  interests, but this was so with previous governments too -- for  instance, in the negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty and in  common defense policy. These interests must be supported  increasingly in other European countries too, and I think that  Britain's and Italy's ideas will become increasingly important  in the Europe of the future.    [Squillante] Italy will be crucial in the election of the  president of the Commission, but you have made a reputation for  yourself as Rome's stubborn adversary...    [Brittan] This is not true. Italy is a country to which I  feel very close, but I draw a distinction between the interests  of certain sectors of industry and the interests of Italian  consumers and taxpayers. When I was responsible for competition  I tried to reduce state aid to industry, which at the time  constituted 28 percent of your budget deficit. If I had  succeeded, one of the main financial problems would have been  considerably reduced, and Italy would have had a better chance  to share in the single European currency.    [Squillante] Pardon me, but Mr. Berlusconi controls a large  proportion of the advertising and television market and has  interests in construction, commerce, and finance: Why should he  support somebody like you, who has adopted free competition as  his philosophy?    [Brittan] I do not want to enter into domestic political  matters. If anyone thinks that Europe's laws have been  violated, he must address the Court of Justice and prove it.</p>

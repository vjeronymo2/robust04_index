			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Castletown boosted by acquisitions Profits before tax of Castletown Group, a manufacturer and printer of stationery, rose from IPounds 259,757 to IPounds 399,154 (Pounds 373,495) for the year to April 30. Boosted by acquisitions, turnover rose 94 per cent to IPounds 5.92m. Directors said further substantial increases in turnover would follow as purchases made so far would be in place for the full current year. For the full year the benefits of acquisitions lifted earnings by 27 per cent to 9.36p (7.37p). The Celbridge companies - Castletown Press Ireland, Castletown Press Manufacturing and Coulter Data Forms - are to be sold to Mr Michael Keating, a former group director. The companies represent less than 5 per cent of pre-tax profits.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Euro car price list seen as Brussels victory THE first mandatory pan-European new car price lists published yesterday at the order of the European Commission show variations between countries of up to 30 per cent. But most fall between the EC's own 12-18 per cent guidelines and the Commission itself refrained from the harsh criciticism which parts of the European industry had been fearing. Under the terms of an agreement made with the Commission last year, Europe's car makers and importers are required to publish price lists twice a year. This followsfierce complaints from consumer organisations in Brussels and in the UK claiming that price divergences are big enough and persistent enough to breach EC regulations. The lists released yesterday take the form of an index related to the prices of 55 European and 17 Japanese top-selling models on May 1 this year, based on recommended retail prices, adjusted for equipment differences and converted to Ecus. Among small cars, variations of up to 24 per cent were found - in the case of Fiat's Cincequento - between the most expensive market, France, and the cheapest, Spain. In the large saloon category, Ford's new Mondeo 1.6LX saloon was found to be 23.9 per cent more expensive in Germany than in the cheapest markets, Italy and Ireland. At the executive car level BMW's biggest variation was of 22 per cent, in the case of its 730i V8 model, in France, with the UK being the cheapest. The Commission, which hopes the information will help motorists to shop around in the EC for best buys, acknowledged that exchange rate fluctuations have played a large part in the variations. It added it would be wrong to arrive at 'far-reaching conclusions' about manufacturers' commercial policies from the price comparisons. But it said the next report in November would enable the Commission to assess the trend in price differentials, which it expects to diminish. Last night the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, which has persistently claimed the variations are largely outside the industry's control, said the Commission's statement showed that exchange rate fluctuations and widely varying taxation regimes were largely to blame for the discrepancies and that these would have to continue until EC economies themselves converged. The issue is of profound importance to car makers and their dealers because in 1995 the present 10-year 'block exemption' which allows them to operate a selective distribution system - in contravention of EC competition rules - is due to expire. The EC competition directorate has warned that a renewal of the block exemption will depend heavily on car prices staying broadly within the EC's guidelines for price differentials. These state that prices should not differ between EC member states by more than 12 per cent in the long-term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year.</p>

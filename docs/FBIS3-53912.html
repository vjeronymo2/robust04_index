			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikha'el Rosolio and Arye Kiesel] </F>   [Excerpts] Yesterday, at the conclusion of the second week  of the latest round of Taba talks, the heads of the Israeli and  PLO Security Committees managed to arrive at a mutually  acceptable document. The four-page paper sums up the agreements  -- but primarily the disagreements -- pertaining to the border  crossings problem. [passage omitted]    The following are some of the points specified in the paper:    -- The parties agree that anything that is decided with  regard to the Allenby Bridge border crossing will also apply to  the other border crossings.    -- It is agreed that all the existing border crossings,  including the crossings from Jordan and Egypt into Israel, as  well as the crossings from the Green Line into the territories,  will remain where they are to be used as border crossings in the  future.    -- The parties agree that the crossings will be manned by a  policing force that will wear nonmilitary dress uniforms similar  to those worn by the security inspectors at the Taba border  crossing.    -- Israel and the PLO -- each one individually -- want their  own control at the border crossings and reject any attempt to  entrust the crossings to a foreign element, such as the United  Nations.    This is where the agreements end and the disagreements  begin:    -- The PLO wishes to separate the crossings into the  territories from the crossings into Israeli territory and to  assume full control over the crossings into the territories.    -- The PLO wishes to decide on its own and without Israeli  dictates who will be allowed into the territories and how  visitors passports will be stamped.    -- Alternatively, if a joint border crossing is operated,  the  PLO wants its security inspector to be the first to receive each  person reaching the crossing point and to determine whether that  person may pass through. The PLO representative will have no  authority over Israelis but will be the decisive authority in  the case of foreign tourists.    -- Flags: The PLO wants its flag to be flown at each border  crossing. In the case of a joint border crossing, it will be  flown next to the Israeli flag.</p>

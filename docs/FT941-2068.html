			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US rocks shipbuilding subsidy talks An unexpected shift of position by the US has thrown into disarray international negotiations aimed at reducing shipbuilding subsidies, just as other countries had offered concessions removing some of the biggest obstacles to agreement. The US surprised other delegations at talks at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris last week by insisting on the freedom to require that ships financed by its export credit schemes be built in US yards. Though such 'home-build' provisions are a normal feature of most export credit schemes, the demand that they be formalised in a legal requirement is seen by other delegations as an attempt to establish a principle which is both unacceptable and contrary to the purpose of the negotiations. The US demand followed important concessions at last week's meeting by Japan and South Korea, which had been widely regarded as taking the most inflexible positions in the five-year-long talks. The two countries finally agreed to the establishment of an international anti-dumping code for ships, to prevent 'injurious pricing'. Substantial progress has also been made on the detailed provisions of such a code. In addition, Japan has agreed to modify the terms of shipbuilding credits provided by the Japan Development Bank, to bring them into line with tighter restrictions on financing demanded by the US. However, because a successful outcome of the negotiations depends on a complex package deal, these concessions could be put in jeopardy if the last-minute US shift makes overall agreement impossible. The latest turn of events creates a particularly awkward problem for the European Union. The Commission is expected to take a firm line with the US, because it sees an agreement in the OECD as crucial to its efforts to phase out national shipbuilding subsidies in Europe. There is a danger that the US demands could undermine EU cohesion on the issue if some shipbuilding industries and member governments, particularly in southern Europe, seize on them as a pretext to press for a relaxation of national subsidy rules. A further obstacle to agreement is the US refusal to negotiate a repeal of the Jones Act, which requires that a fixed proportion of cargo passing through US ports be carried in US-registered ships. However, it is thought that a way could be found around this problem by gradually relaxing the application of the act. Prospects for breaking the deadlock will depend on a report being drawn by Mr Staffan Sohlman, Sweden's ambassador to the OECD, who is chairing the talks. If he believes scope for compromise remains, he will reconvene the negotiations, probably late next month. The negotiations, which were originally instituted under pressure from the US, involve the world's largest shipbuilding countries. They also include Finland, Norway and Sweden.</p>

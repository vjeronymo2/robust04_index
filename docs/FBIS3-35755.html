The prepared information, signed by acting Prime Minister  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, points out that 80-90 percent of the total  requirement for oil and gas, 80 percent of raw materials for  light industry and 70 percent of component parts for the  machine-building industry come from CIS countries. Ukraine is  also one of the main suppliers of agricultural products, cast  iron, steel, etc to markets in the CIS, but the competitiveness  of a significant part of the exportable goods is low.    The document draws the conclusion that at present "the basis  for economic integration is very weak," and because of this it  is difficult to foresee an equal coordination of reform  processes." However, "in the event of Ukraine not joining the  economic union a possibility exists that discriminatory measures  on the part of members of the CIS economic union, in the first  instance of Russia, will be adopted against it:" a tougher  customs regime; a search for and the creation of alternative  transportation routes and ports for trade with the West  (negotiations are already being held on designing a new gas  pipeline through Belarus and Poland, a new port is being  designed in St. Petersburg, and the port in Novorossiysk is  being enlarged); restricting supplies of weapons to Ukraine, a  search for alternative suppliers for traditional Ukrainian goods  entering CIS markets; tougher competition with Ukrainian goods  in markets of third countries, and a refusal to support Ukraine  in international and financial organizations. There is also a  "considerable dependency on Russian for storing and processing  used nuclear fuel."    In the opinion of the authors of the document, total losses  in the event of Ukraine not joining the economic union and  discriminatory measures being adopted against it are estimated  at approximately $4.6 billion annually.    The document's conclusion is that, "in this situation the  most reasonable and well-considered approach is Ukraine's  cooperation with the economic union as an associate member."</p>

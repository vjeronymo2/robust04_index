			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: TRIBUTE TO S.D. WOMEN  </P> <P> Commonly held wisdom has it that Irving Gill is San Diego's sole legacy to the  world of architecture.  </P> <P> Pick up almost any architectural book, and, if it mentions San Diego at all,  the reference is usually to Gill.  </P> <P> In one sense, he has been this city's most significant innovator of the 20th  Century, designing clean-lined, modern buildings beginning in 1907 or so, years  before Le Corbusier, Mies Van Der Rohe, Loos and others became modern  architecture's heroes.  </P> <P> But there are important San Diego architects and designers largely ignored by  history. Among them are the three women featured in the exhibit "In Harmony  With the Land," opening Saturday at the Museum of San Diego History in Balboa  Park.  </P> <P> Women in Architecture and the San Diego Historical Society are teaming up to  present the show, which will run through the end of the year.  </P> <P> Opening at the same time and running through Sept. 10 is "That Exceptional  One," a tribute to 100 years of female architects, dating back to 1888 when  Louise Blanchard Bethune became the first woman member of the American  Institute of Architects.  </P> <P> Of the three San Diego architects featured in the local show, Lilian Rice is  the best known. Also included are Hazel Waterman and landscape designer  Harriett Wimmer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Believed in Total Site Planning  </P> <P> The show's title is meant to reflect the way all three women believed in total  site planning, with close relationships between buildings and their surrounding  landscapes.  </P> <P> Rice is best known for the Spanish-influenced buildings she designed in Rancho  Santa Fe between 1922 and her death in 1938 at the age of 49 from an  undiagnosed case of appendicitis.  </P> <P> Rice was working for Richard Requa, the well-known designer of many of San  Diego's finest Mediterranean-style homes, and his partner Herbert Jackson, when  they were commissioned to come up with a master plan for Rancho Santa Fe and  design several buildings.  </P> <P> Because the commute from San Diego would have occupied too much of the  partners' time, they turned day-to-day details over to Rice, and she eventually  designed many of the buildings on Paseo Delicias in the business district of  Rancho Santa Fe, as well as about 60 houses.  </P> <P> Today, these buildings house Quimby's and Mille Fleurs restaurants, Ashley's  market and other local businesses.  </P> <P> At the time, some of the only buildings in the area were adobe ranch houses  dating back to the mid-1800s. With these -- and probably the San Diego County  missions -- in mind, the Santa Fe Land Improvement Co., the developers of  Rancho Santa Fe, decided that Spanish-flavored architecture would be  appropriate for the new community.  </P> <P> Many of Rice's buildings in Rancho Santa Fe have tile roofs, deep-set window  and door openings, interior courtyards and carefully laid-out gardens linked to  the homes by French doors and generous windows. Most have white stucco walls  that imitate the thick, plastered-over adobe found on buildings in the  Mediterranean.  </P> <P> "She wasn't a pioneer or innovator; she was carrying out the plan the  developers wanted," said Lucinda Eddy, who completed her master's thesis on  Rice at the University of San Diego in 1985 and helped organize the exhibit.  </P> <P> But there is more to Rice's work. Outside Rancho Santa Fe, her residential  designs have an entirely different appearance. Many use horizontal wood siding  and shingle roofs, with interior walls paneled in redwood.  </P> <P> Typical of this style is the rustic ZLAC Rowing Club at 1111 Pacific Beach  Drive. A high ceiling supported by heavy redwood beams rises to a peak above a  hardwood floor. French doors open out on a veranda at the edge of the beach on  the shore of Mission Bay.  </P> <P> Rice learned to love natural materials while studying architecture at  University of California, Berkeley, when the department was headed by John  Galen Howard, who designed many campus buildings. Buildings such as the rowing  clubhouse echo the organic, Craftsman style that Rice saw in the work of  Howard, Bernard Maybeck and other San Francisco-rea architects.  </P> <P> Although Rice's buildings are simple in form and materials, they do a masterful  job of manipulating light and space.  </P> <P> "She wanted her structures to be an extension of the outdoors," Eddy said. "Her  houses were intended to be details in the landscape."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subtle Innovations  </P> <P> Although it is easy to pass off Rice as a talented but unoriginal designer  heavily influenced by her mentors, her best work is innovative in subtle ways.  </P> <P> Imagine replacing the tile roofs on many of her Rancho Santa Fe homes with the  flat roofs preferred by Gill, and her buildings show a strong relationship to  modernism. Examine the way she masses and composes a home such as the Carpenter  residence of 1928, and you see the eye of an artist at work.  </P> <P> Like Rice's, the work of Waterman, who apprenticed with Gill and his partner,  William Hebbard, is also under-appreciated. (Waterman later hired Rice as her  own apprentice.)  </P> <P> As Eddy pointed out, Waterman's success is remarkable considering she had only  a year of college work in design and learned architecture from correspondence  courses. Gill hired her after he designed a house for her and her husband and  sensed she had talent.  </P> <P> Many of her finest designs, including buildings in Balboa Park for the San  Diego Children's Home, completed in 1925, are no longer standing. But  photographs of them, and buildings such as her Wednesday Club (1911) at Ivy  Lane and 6th Avenue, show that she assimilated Gill's flat surfaces, arched  openings and carefully placed square and rectangular windows.  </P> <P> While Rice and Waterman are well-represented by drawings and historic photos,  Wimmer's work is tougher to document, according to Eddy. Wimmer laid out  landscapes mostly in her head, so no drawings ever existed. Instead, her work  will be represented by several photographs, and the lineup is impressive.  </P> <P> Working with landscape architect Joe Yamada, who became her partner in 1960,  Wimmer handled plant selection and placement for Scripps Institution of  Oceanography, areas of the UC San Diego campus, Sea World and many homes.  </P> <P> Next Thursday, in Room 102 at the Casa del Prado in Balboa Park, Sally Bullard  Thornton, the author of a biography on Waterman, and Barbara Thornburgh Carlton  will discuss Waterman's work.  </P></p>

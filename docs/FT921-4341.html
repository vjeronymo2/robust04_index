			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / MPs demand tougher credit marketing law TOUGHER LEGISLATION on the marketing of credit to deter banks and building societies from encouraging reckless borrowing was called for by a cross-party committee of MPs yesterday. The Treasury and Civil Service Committee said Department of Trade and Industry proposals for laws on credit marketing should not be abandoned simply because the banks had introduced codes of practice. The committee says there appears to be continuing significant use of junk mail urging individuals to borrow. Good Banking, the code published by the banks and consumer groups last year and due to come into operation next week, is a step in the right direction, says the report, but banks and building societies must be willing to accept revisions reflecting the wishes of customers. The committee recommends that for personal customers, banks and building societies should: Stipulate maximum periods for holding funds before they are cleared for payment. Consider how customers could be given details of cleared balances in their accounts. Give customers the right to pre-notification of account charges. Inform customers of the standard of care expected from them when they hold credit cards. The committee repeats its warning to banks and building societies not to encourage customers to borrow against the value of their home over and above their mortgage and to stick to prudent limits on borrowing. The MPs say building societies should support money advice centres more generously and lenders should try to ensure that adequate money advice services are available wherever they are needed, rather than concentrated in a few large cities.

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Bernie Grant joins Labour deputy race THE RACE for the Labour deputy leadership widened yesterday as the leftwing Campaign group of MPs endorsed the nomination of Mr Bernie Grant, the MP for Tottenham. At a meeting at Westminster about 10 MPs from the Campaign group, which claims a membership of around 30, also supported the candidacy of Mr Ken Livingstone - the MP for Brent East in London and the leader of the Greater London Council when it was abolished in 1986 - for the leadership. The fifth MP to join the deputy leadership contest, Mr Grant is unlikely to get the 55 signatures from MPs needed for his name to appear on the ballot paper for the election in July, but his candidacy may damage the chances of Ms Ann Clwyd, the MP for Cynon Valley in south Wales. Nominations close next Tuesday. Ms Clwyd will launch her manifesto for the deputy leadership today. There had been some speculation that the Campaign group would support her, but the move seems to have faltered over her pro-proportional representation stance. If Ms Clwyd, Mr Grant and Mr John Prescott all proceed with their candidacies for the deputy leadership, they may each fail to win the required number of signatures, leaving the election to be contested solely by Mr Bryan Gould and Mrs Margaret Beckett. But Mr Grant, a former leader of Haringey Borough Council in north London, who became an MP in 1987, said after the meeting yesterday: 'We feel the leadership has been stitched up and that there is a need for the party to be given a wider range of choice.' He highlighted the elements of the Campaign group programme dealing with anti-racism and equality for women, and made clear that his campaign was partly in opposition to the rule specifying the minimum number of nominations for the election, which the Campaign group called anti-democratic. The Campaign group ticket has the most positive policies on Labour's links with the unions of any of the groups campaigning for for the leadership. 'We are offering a choice not an echo,' Mr Livingstone said. 'We are committed to keeping the trade union links and rebuilding party membership.' He issued a plea to socialists who had 'lost heart in recent years' to return and help change the party. Mr Jeremy Corbyn, MP for Islington North and secretary to the Campaign group, said it supported a 10-point plan which included opposition to pacts with the Liberal Democrats and to proportional representation; withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism; redistribution of wealth and cuts in defence spending together with the scrapping of nuclear weapons. Mr Livingstone said last week that Labour's plans to tax middle-income families 'cost us the election'.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Assn. said it estimated that the industry's  book-to-bill ratio fell to 0.93 in December, down from 0.95 in November,  reflecting an increase in semiconductor sales for the month but a decrease in  orders. A book-to-bill ratio of 0.93 means that for every $100 worth of  computer chips shipped, manufacturers received new orders worth $93. The  association said an increase in semiconductor sales and a decrease in orders  led to the decline in the ratio for December, which was a five-week reporting  month, as opposed to November, a four-week month.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``Sardar Asif's Timely Warning''] </F>   [Text] The South Asian region continues to be haunted by  danger and difficulties, as there is no sign of a resolution to  the main dispute between Pakistan and India -- the Kashmir  issue. A new round of bilateral talks was recently held after a  lapse of more than a year. The talks failed, however, due to  India's refusal to budge even an inch from its earlier position.  Some U.S. Government spokesmen -- especially Joseph P. Hoar,  commander-in-chief of the Central Command -- are giving the  impression that the talks did not fail and that there has been  considerable progress, but a review of the statements of  Pakistani and Indian spokesmen would hardly convince a person to  share U.S. optimism. The general impression is that the 2-3  January talks remained abortive. This means the black cloud of  tension is still hovering over the Indian subcontinent.    Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali rightly  told  his hosts in Tashkent that the Indian subcontinent and South  Asia are facing great danger. He is also correct in saying that  if the Kashmir dispute is not settled in accordance with the  principles of justice and the UN resolutions, then war might  erupt again between the two countries. If this happens, God  forbid, the war might become nuclear. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali's  statement could never be called an exaggeration. Observers of  history and relations between the two countries know they have  already fought three wars; Kashmir was the main dispute in all  of them. Since the last war in 1971, the two countries have  achieved nuclear capability. India openly carried out a nuclear  explosion. Pakistan has not carried out such an explosion, but  it acknowledges that it has the ability to make a nuclear weapon.    It is true that Pakistan has not manufactured a nuclear  weapon, nor does it intend to do so. But if war erupts and it  finds out that its opponent has a nuclear weapon, then Pakistan  might take any step to defend itself. We know that on more than  one occasion the two countries have come to the brink of war  because of Indian military exercises; in these cases some  foreign circles saw a real danger of nuclear war. Given the  situation, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali's expression of apprehension  about a nuclear war cannot be called an exaggeration or an  unfounded product of imagination.    There is a real risk of nuclear war that not only threatens  peace in South Asia, but in the whole world. The only way to  avoid such a danger is to strike at the root cause of tension  between the two countries -- the well-known Kashmir dispute.  The world powers, especially the United States, should put all  their weight behind resolving the Kashmir issue if they want to  save the Indian subcontinent from devastation and nuclear war.  The danger signal given by Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali is not without  its causes. He has informed the world in a timely manner of a  possible danger; prudence dictates that serious efforts be made  to deal with the situation before we miss the chance. It is not  inappropriate to hope that the United Nations, the United  States, the European countries, the Islamic Conference  Organization, the PRC, and other Asian countries realize their  responsibility in maintaining peace in this area and make  wholehearted efforts to convince India to see reason. Pakistan  has repeatedly conveyed its readiness to accept and implement  any fair and reasonable proposal on Kashmir. Now it is up to  India to realize its responsibilities and make sincere efforts  to implement them. It will benefit the subcontinent and the two  countries as well.</p>

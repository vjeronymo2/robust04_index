			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses unimpressed by dollar intervention Central bank intervention in support of the dollar was unable to rescue bourses yesterday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT wrote an unsettled and gloomy end to the official week, down 2.2 per cent and closing with the Dax index 16.79 lower at 2,005.31. There was a brief recovery later, but the Ibis-indicated Dax subsided again to close at 2,005.07. 'Currency intervention never lasts,' said a broker. 'It's an emergency signal, a bit of a panic measure, and it shows that something is radically wrong.' Turnover fell from DM9.2bn to DM7bn. Activity was dominated by another sharp fall in Deutsche Bank, which ended DM18.20 lower at DM669.80, after DM663, down 8.5 per cent on the week. The stock's outlook has been clouded by investor worries about the bank's exposure to volatile debt markets and recent property scandals. PARIS fell away sharply in line with the trend among the late closing markets with the CAC-40 index finishing just above the 1,900 support level at 1,907.02, a decline of 32.00 for the session and 1.4 per cent for the week. Turnover on the first day of the new account was estimated at some FFr3.4bn. In spite of the overall gloomy mood some bright spots could be found among equities. Sanofi improved FFr38 to FFr853 in reaction to Thursday's news that it was buying Sterling Winthrop's prescription drug business, while some of the companies which have been forecasting better earnings prospects also turned positive, St Gobain up FFr2 at FFr648 and Michelin adding FFr6.70 at FFr221.50. There was more bad news for Euro Disney, suspended limit down at one stage before closing down FFr3.10 or 19 per cent at FFr12.90. There has been considerable technical trading in the shares as doubts have grown about the aftermath of the ongoing FFr6bn rights issue. Elf Aquitaine slipped FFr14 to FFr390 as the group issued a profits warning. ZURICH ended under renewed pressure. The SMI index fell through support at the 2,580 level, losing 49.5 to 2,577.2, for a 1.9 per cent drop on the week. Cyclicals remained vulnerable, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim, to the threat of earnings revisions on the back of the weak dollar. Sulzer lost SFr18 to SFr912 while Holderbank was SFr17 down at SFr900. Banks, which had earlier in the week halted their long slide, turned lower again, losing an average of 1 per cent, although CS Holding fell SFr17 or 3.1 per cent to SFr535. MILAN overcame early weakness as local investors covered positions ahead of the weekend although the Comit index failed to register the late improvement, losing 8.52 at 698.92, unchanged on the week. Olivetti, however, was a bright spot, rising L45 to L2,455 following its link with Hughes Network System to provide digital satellite communications across Europe. CIR, the holding company, climbed L65 to L2,525. Montedison gained another L22 or 1.5 per cent to L1,490 as investors concentrated on its turnround potential. MADRID reacted badly to the failure of dollar intervention, banks particularly weak as the general index dropped 5.88, or 1.9 per cent to 299.14, 2.8 per cent lower on the week. The exception in the banking sector, once again, was Bankinter, where 600,000 shares were put through the market, Bankinter itself buying from Santander at Pta11,500 a share. The shares closed unchanged at Pta11,000. Elsewhere, the decline took in construction, utilities and US favourites like Repsol, down Pta125 at Pta3,870, but Telefonica showed relative strength, easing just Pta15 to Pta1,760. Brokers said that there was strong buying on the run-up to the placing of Telefonica International. AMSTERDAM was unsettled by the currencies turbulence with many of its multinationals dependent on dollar earnings. The AEX index finished at the session low of 381.43, down 5.95 on the day and 2.8 per cent on the week.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun 24                                     THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes           Open     10.30     11.00     12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1325.42   1326.51   1325.39   1324.53 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1326.33   1325.66   1331.50   1328.34  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1353.86   1352.98   1352.97   1350.32 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1352.04   1351.24   1356.55   1354.15  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       Jun 23    Jun 22    Jun 21    Jun 20    Jun 17  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1336.98   1323.00   1303.48   1306.43   1350.34 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1366.22   1357.37   1345.33   1351.80   1389.87  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 -  1332.79 ; 200 -  1358.58 Low/day: 100 -  1323.22  200 -  1348.58  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane, John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

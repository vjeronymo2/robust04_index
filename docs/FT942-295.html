			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (16): Banal heroes - Xerox / Real life sales story has mixed success The Force by David Dorsey Random House, Pounds 23 315 pages It's nerve-shredding time in the sales department: late November, with only a few weeks left in the year and the team below its budget target. In a spasm of anger, one rep throws her frozen Thanksgiving turkey down a flight of stairs at her husband. Others down medicine to deaden the nausea they feel on their most crucial sales calls. Welcome to the world as seen through the eyes of a crack Xerox's sales team in the rust-belt city of Cleveland, Ohio: purveyors of copier machines to local industry and facing ferocious competition from rivals such as Eastman Kodak, Pitney-Bowes and Konica. First-time author David Dorsey, a business journalist, approached Xerox with a smart idea: to get under the skin of the great American salesperson by spending a year with the Cleveland team on client calls and customer entertainment outings, going to staff meetings and to their homes. Surprisingly, Xerox agreed, though it may now regret doing so, for his warts-and-all account portrays one of America's most admired corporations, and a leading promoter of the Total Quality Management (TQM) movement, in a very mixed light. Unfortunately, the book is equally mixed, due mainly to the writing style adopted by Dorsey - that pioneered by Tracy Kidder (who provides a dust-jacket endorsement) in The Soul of a New Machine, the story of the development of a new computer. This uses a novel's narrative style to tell a non-fiction story. It requires great talent to pull off and Dorsey has not quite mastered it. The problem is partly his tendency to indulge in long passages of purple prose, and it is partly the way he structures the story, with important background information introduced too late in the narrative, or not at all. We never do find out precisely what equipment the reps are selling, which is presumably an important part of their job. But the difficulty is mainly because this type of narrative needs a strong, compelling plot. Dorsey's main story-line focuses on Fred Thomas, a star sales manager: will he beat his annual sales target and 'make trip' - in other words, get on Xerox's annual jamboree for its top reps, being held this year in the Californian desert resort of Palm Springs? A sub-plot involves Fred's up-and-down relationship with his wife, Kathy, whose ambition in life is to invent a game show which she can sell for vast sums of money to a television company. The problem in sustaining this story is twofold: the lives of Dorsey's heroes are pretty banal and there are only so many ways to describe the sale of a Xerox machine. In short, your attention begins to wander. But it is well worth persevering, because large chunks of the book do give a fly-on-the-wall insight into the life of the salesman and his methods. 'In a sales call,' says Dorsey, 'even if only subliminally, you're reminded of how much you want to be liked, and yet how little you know of what other people say when your back is turned. If the salesman seizes the opportunity this presents, if he realises how easy it is to manipulate a person who needs to be liked . . . then he can make large sums of money, because he understands something terrible about human affection.' We learn the difference between the 'grease' sale (lots of financial incentives and client entertainment) and the 'puppy-dog' sale - where the rep builds up a friendly relationship over months which is 'used to box the customer into a corner where he feels he can't say no without feeling like a fool'. One of the book's more interesting insights is into the tension created in the sales force by Xerox's adoption of TQM, which lays great emphasis on customer satisfaction. Fred had sold for Xerox for years when the the only guiding principle was 'to write as much business as possible, as early as possible, by any means possible'. Now the Cleveland district was trying to sell both ways at once - promoting customer satisfaction, yet encouraging high pressure sales when success was at stake. But TQM did produce results. For one thing, it allowed the rep in charge of wooing 'non users' (companies burnt by Xerox in the past) to get through the door again, with the message that Xerox had changed, become an expert on quality and could help its clients become one too. It also built better relations with existing customers: At the climax of the book, one of Fred's most crucial sales is to a company which decides to order Xerox equipment, rather than take a cheaper deal from Pitney-Bowes, because of the company's quality programme and emphasis on partnership. Fred and Kathy, you will be pleased to hear, do get to go to Palm Springs, where a great time is had by all: Three days of golf, tennis, lazing by a swimming pool and general alcoholic over-indulgence. They say it's not like the old days, when people became totally uncontrollable and marriages fell apart, but the Cleveland crowd try to keep the sense of excess alive.</p>

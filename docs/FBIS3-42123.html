			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vasyl Kotko, deputy chairman of Ukraine's </F> State Committee for the Utilization of Nuclear Energy, by  UKRINFORM correspondent Viktor Rozsokha; place and date not  given: "How Much Is an Atomic Kilowatt?" -- first three  paragraphs published in boldface]    [Text] It is hardly necessary to explain what energy  sources mean for Ukraine and for its economy today. Nor is it  necessary to explain that our standard of living increasingly  depends upon the cost of electric energy, coal, gas, and fuel  oil.    The conference of heads of Ukraine's basic industries --  power engineering, metallurgy, and coal industry -- that was  recently held at the Cabinet of Ministers showed that there will  be no easy decisions. Although there was consensus on the need  to reasonably restrain prices of products, the very approaches  to the forming of the tariffs were not responded to unanimously.    This is how deputy chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for  the Utilization of Nuclear Energy Vasyl Kotko explains the  position of atomic power engineers.    Kotko: Atomic power engineering is perhaps the  only branch of Ukraine's national economy that finished the year  1993 with a marked growth in the volume of production.    However, the situation that has presently taken shape in the  industry, is not simply difficult, but, one can say,  catastrophic. All of the AES's [atomic electric power plants]  are in an extremely difficult economic situation. Due to lack  of funds, starting from the second part of 1993, virtually no  fuel has been purchased. In 1993, the amount of fuel purchased  was half that in 1990. Also, due to lack of funds, used nuclear  fuel has not been taken out for long-term storage. Contractual  relations with regard to equipment, spare parts, and scientific  servicing of nuclear installations between the AES's and many  suppliers have practically been severed....    Rozsokha: However, our atomic power engineering  is fully cost accountable and depends upon the electric energy  it produces. How could it happen that a branch with such growth  in production volume has now almost become a financial bankrupt?    Kotko: The explanation here is in that the atomic  power engineers have produced the electric energy and sold it to  the state, but the state has not paid for it. There are two  reasons here. An apparent reason lies in the fact that our main  and only consumer -- the National Dispatcher Center at Ukraine's  Ministry of Power Engineering -- does not pay at all or does not  pay regularly for the electric energy received from us. The  ministry's debt to the atomic plants is presently about 550  billion karbovantsi [K], or approximately the cost of our  month's operation. However, this is how the matter appears.  The main cause lies in our government's policy with regard to  tariffs. By fixing the prices of electric energy, coal, and  gas, it is trying to curb the total growth of prices in all  branches of the national economy, more specifically, to curb  inflation. I will point out that, from the beginning of 1993,  the tariff for the AES's remained unchanged for almost half a  year. The putting into effect of every new tariff was delayed  by one or two months. As a result, inflation was not stopped,  but power engineering resources were strongly depleted. It is  even difficult to estimate the losses.    Rozsokha: What is today's rate of the electric  energy produced by atomic plants?    Kotko: It is presently K118 per kilowatt/hour.  However, on the whole, throughout last year, our rate was at  least one-half that at thermal plants. AES's represent  effective power engineering.    Rozsokha: Why then, in such an economic  situation, can you not convince the government of the need to  change the policy regarding tariffs?    Kotko: The government has officially recognized  the need to change the tariffs policy. Moreover, it pointed out  in its resolution that the prices of electric energy must change  automatically only in those cases when the prices of energy  sources increase by more than 20 percent.    Rozsokha: However, the Cabinet of Ministers does  not fulfill its own decision. Why?    Kotko: Because it realizes that an increase in  the prices of energy sources will lead to an increase of prices  of everything else. That is why it is trying to maintain the  previously set prices as long as possible.    It goes without saying that nobody -- either the population  or the government -- wants to have the prices of bread, butter,  and that same electric energy raised. However, this unpopular  decision will later have to be adopted, but with more serious  consequences.    Rozsokha: How much longer can the AES's persevere  if this policy with regard to tariffs continues?    Kotko: I believe that we have now reached the  limit and have exhausted the resources of the branch and, if  such a policy continues, irreversible processes may start.    I think that if the situation does not change now, we will,  tomorrow, find ourselves in a situation in which stoppages of  some power units and possibly also of all atomic plants  successively, will be inevitable. We now need to urgently  revise our tariff, which must be at least K300 per  kilowatt/hour. It must change with the rate of inflation.  These are two minimum mandatory conditions.</p>

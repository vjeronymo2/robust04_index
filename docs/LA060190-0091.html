			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL DECIDES TO MOVE IRVING BRANCH LIBRARY;  </P> <P> CULTURE: DESPITE PROTEST, FACILITY WILL BE MOVED FROM HISTORIC LOCATION TO A  SITE OCCUPIED BY A CARWASH. COMMISSIONERS CALL ACTION 'EMOTIONAL AND  HEARTWRENCHING.'  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Public Library Commission, in an action that members described  as "emotional and heartwrenching," has decided to move the Washington Irving  branch from its historic mid-city home of 64 years to a new location now  occupied by a carwash.  </P> <P> After a 4 1/2-hour meeting, the commission voted 4-1 in favor of the move,  overriding calls by a majority of 62 speakers to save the old branch by  renovating and expanding the 3,918-square-foot stucco-and-brick building named  for the 19th-Century author of "Rip van Winkle."  </P> <P> Many in the crowd of about 120 book lovers at Holman United Methodist Church  said they could not make sense of the decision to abandon the library on  Arlington Avenue -- declared a city historic monument in 1976 -- in favor of a  new $3.3-million, 9,000-square-foot structure. The cost of the move to the new  site 13 blocks west on Washington Boulevard was put at $2.4 million.  </P> <P> "We don't need bigger modern buildings," said Dr. Margo Griswell, a mid-city  resident who opposes a new library.  </P> <P> But the five-member commission, faced with the prospect that the Irving branch  would have to be closed by June, 1991, because it does not meet earthquake  safety standards, decided to order the staff to begin negotiations to purchase  a plot of land on Washington Boulevard. The site is now home to Freddy Dee's  Carwash.  </P> <P> "I'm old and I appreciate old things," commission President Martha D.  Katsufrankis said in explaining her vote for the new library. " . . . But we  have to think about serving the whole community for the future."  </P> <P> To mollify those who wanted to preserve the old building, the commission took  its action after area City Councilman Nate Holden guaranteed that another  "viable funded" use, such as a community center, would be found.  </P> <P> There have been repeated assurances that the Irving building would be preserved  by the city regardless of the commission's decision. But those promises did  little to calm the fears of some preservationists that no city agencies would  be interested in using the building.  </P> <P> "I don't believe that for one second," said one area resident. "What are they  going to turn it into -- a police station? A fire station? It's a library, damn  it."  </P> <P> The debate over the fate of the Irving branch has dogged the commission for the  last several months, resulting in several marathon meetings. A mediation panel  offered by the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. held 18 hours of discussions with  various factions within the mid-city area to reach a compromise. But those  efforts were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> The passions evoked by the debate were readily evident Wednesday night. Speaker  after speaker marched to a single microphone during a two-hour public hearing  to argue the matter.  </P> <P> "We need a new library," area resident Bernie Gill said. "Everyone should look  to the future."  </P> <P> "A new library on Washington Boulevard would be a good start to upgrade the  area," added Neil Berry, a former president of the Mid-City Chamber of  Commerce.  </P> <P> Suzette Clark, a 20-year-old college student who is a lifelong area resident,  countered: "I go to Boston College, and the library there was built in 1863.  They just built a new library there. But no one wants to study in (there)."  </P></p>

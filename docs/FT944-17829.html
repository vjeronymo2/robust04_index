			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Book Review: Private motives of a public man Inside Richard Branson's Business Empire By Tim Jackson Harper Collins, Pounds 17.50, 383 pages When Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin group, was preparing to cross the Atlantic in a hot air balloon in 1987, he came across a television station's video monitor running his obituary. The station was demonstrating no more than prudence: the Atlantic crossing almost ended in disaster when Branson's balloon ditched in the sea off Ireland. Branson, 44, has since forsworn dangerous sports, and the obituaries spawned by his penchant for life-threatening exploits remain in the archives. Few of them, in any case, would have offered great insight into the private Branson. Tim Jackson, a journalist who writes for the Independent, has tried to fill the gap with a book that attempts to answer the question: what is Richard Branson really like? The principal facts of Branson's business life are well-known: he created one of the world's leading music companies, which he later sold for Pounds 560m; an airline, Virgin Atlantic, which attracted much attention; and several other businesses, including a worldwide record retailing chain. More difficult to capture are the many contradictions that surround him. Of the three young British entrepreneurs who rose to great prominence during the 1980s - the others being Alan Sugar of Amstrad and Anita Roddick of Body Shop - Branson remains the most difficult to understand. Sugar trod the path from Jewish working class to entrepreneurial success which many others had walked before. Roddick is currently fighting off allegations that she has not lived up to the ideals that motivated her and her company. There has never been any doubt, however, what those ideals are: respect for the natural environment and for human rights, and opposition to cruelty to animals. What motivates Branson has never been clear. He seems to embody the libertarian ideals of the 1960s, appearing in the most august company without a tie. He lived on a houseboat and promoted the sale of condoms. Yet he was a favourite of Margaret Thatcher. His talent for publicity is notorious. He launched his airline dressed in an old-fashioned leather flying helmet and goggles. He submitted his unsuccessful application to run the UK national lottery in the company of a horse. Yet for all the apparent love of attention, the private Branson finds it difficult to look people in the eye. He is surprisingly inarticulate. If the idea were not so ludicrous, one would think he was shy. Tim Jackson's book is filled with such puzzles. Branson has used his vast wealth to buy a Caribbean island. He flew a pair of Balinese craftsmen to his Oxfordshire home to build a cricket pavilion in the style of a traditional temple. Yet Branson seemed not to notice that the paint was flaking off the back of his Holland Park home. When Branson decided to cross the Pacific in a balloon, he paid Pounds 87,000 for Shinto priests to bless it before departure. But he quibbled with Per Lindstrand, who piloted the balloon, over a bill for Pounds 150. The book has its rough edges. The collapse of Air Europe is thrown into the narrative without any explanation for the non-expert reader of its relevance. Jackson recounts a row about the Social Democratic party between Branson and a dinner guest, but frustratingly omits to say which side Branson took. Overall, however, it is an admirable biography. Parts make gripping reading: the balloon expeditions, the struggle to establish the airline and British Airways's dirty tricks campaign against it. But does it bring us any closer to the real Branson? We understand his business style better by the end: his determination to make new ideas work and his need to move on to something else when they have. As to the person, the conclusion has to be that there is no resolving the contradictions: they are part of the man. What is clear is that, if anyone is going to explain who Branson is, Branson would prefer to be the one who does it. One of the reasons he took the group private after floating it on the London Stock Exchange was that he disliked having what he saw as ill-informed stockbrokers' analysts commenting on it. He initially refused to co-operate in the writing of this book. When Jackson decided to go ahead anyway, however, Branson met him for long and detailed interviews and encouraged his friends and colleagues to do the same. According to Jackson, Branson later changed his mind and decided the book would be biased against him. Branson was then offered the chance to read the manuscript and correct mistakes, on condition that he did not send his lawyers in afterwards. Branson's solicitors told him to reject this offer. As Jackson makes clear, Branson always pays for the best legal advice. Any lawyer who advised him to waive his right to legal action before he knew whether the book contained anything defamatory would not be worth his fee. There is much for him to dislike in this book. Some youthful indiscretions, including a near-prosecution by the Customs &amp; Excise, are not new. More hurtful will be the views of Virgin Music employees who worked for the company for years, but had no shares to cash in when it was sold. Yet Jackson clearly admires Branson for his energy, his originality and his regard for people often ignored by other business leaders: women, clerks, cleaners, customers. Jackson's conclusion that, despite Branson's apparent lack of political convictions, he could emerge as a British Berlusconi, appears to be a lapse from his usual sceptical standards of judgment. But then the sceptics sneered at the idea that anyone could get an airline flying four months after being presented with the idea - and that is exactly what Branson did.</p>

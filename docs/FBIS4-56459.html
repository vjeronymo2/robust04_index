			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 2 May (EFE) -- Foreign Minister Carlos  Figueroa said today that he does not reject the possibility of  signing an economic agreement with the Republic of Croatia on  improved conditions for investment, investments in social  security, and the privatization process.    Figueroa made this statement after signing an agreement  between the Chilean and Croatian Governments extending visa  requirements for carriers of diplomatic, official, and special  passports.    The agreement was signed by Foreign Minister Figueroa and  visiting Croatian Vice President Mate Granic within the  framework of the latter's three-day official visit. Granic  arrived in Santiago on 1 May from Buenos Aires, Argentina.    Foreign Minister Figueroa explained that Chile will receive  from Croatia training in the educational and technical  professional fields.    He added that there are discussions under way on the  possibility of establishing "joint ventures" with Chilean  companies in the area of shipyards.    Furthermore, Foreign Minister Figueroa expressed his  satisfaction that Croatia has achieved peace, which has enabled  it to achieve political and economic stability.    He explained that the remaining conflict in the area  occupied  by the Serbs will be resolved through negotiations.    In addition, Croatian Vice President Mate Granic, who is  also  foreign minister, thanked the Chilean people for having been the  first Latin American country to have recognized Croatia's  independence, which was declared on 16 January 1992.    He added that 25 percent of Croatian territory is still  under  the domain of the local Serbs, who are supported and encouraged  by the regime in Belgrade, an area protected by the United  Nations. Nevertheless, Croatia has been able to achieve its  political stability.    Granic said that his country seeks two basic objectives:  first, to achieve the peaceful reintegration of the occupied  territories and integrate them into the legal political system  that is enforced today in Croatia; and second, to achieve an  economic development integrated with the country's political  system.</p>

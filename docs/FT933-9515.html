			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / The Hard Ecu and All That: a Good Thing? WHAT is the hard Ecu? It is an idea for a new, parallel European currency dreamed up by Britain in 1990 as its contribution to the debate over European monetary union. It was dropped after opposition from the rest of the EC which believed it to be a diversionary tactic aimed at camouflaging Britain's lack of interest in Emu. But with the Maastricht process thrown into disarray by the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism, the hard Ecu could come back on to the agenda. Why would anyone want hard Ecus? They would bridge the gap between national currencies, such as the D-Mark and sterling, and a new single currency for Europe to be ushered in later. They would be used by business people, tourists and anyone buying and selling goods and services in different parts of Europe. Circulating in parallel with national currencies and freely convertible, hard Ecus would perform a function similar to Esperanto in languages. Who is backing the hard Ecu? The Institute of Directors, a free-market UK pressure group, thinks it great news for businesses, especially small ones. The Treasury and prime minister's office are playing it cool. Mr Norman Lamont, the accident-prone former chancellor, is an enthusiastic backer - which may not do much for the currency's chances. More positively, supporters of the currency reckon Mr Edouard Balladur, who took over as French prime minister earlier this year, said nice things about it while in opposition. What about critics? If the hard Ecu ever took off, banks would lose a fortune by the reduction in money-changing fees. So don't expect too many plaudits from them. The Bundesbank does not like the hard Ecu either. In its view, there is a strong, freely circulating currency that could be used across Europe - the D-Mark. Who would issue hard Ecus? This could be a job for the European Monetary Institute, a souped-up committee of European central bank governors, which is due to be set up on January 1 in an as-yet undecided location. Under the Maastricht guidelines, the EMI is due eventually to become Europe's central bank, in charge of pan-European interest rates and a single currency. But what would happen to the Ecu already in existence? The existing Ecu (European currency unit) was invented in 1979 and is a purely artificial currency based on a 'basket' or set weights of national currencies. At present the D-Mark accounts for about 30 per cent of the Ecu and sterling 12. Although banks, big corporations and governments use Ecus for settling international transactions and for borrowing money, the currency has never caught on as a spending unit in the real world. Less than 1 per cent of EC trade is paid for using Ecus. You cannot use Ecus (worth 75.2p) in shops. So how would hard Ecus differ from 'basket' Ecus? The governments behind the hard Ecu would guarantee that it would never be devalued against the strongest national currency - essentially the D-Mark. They would use their foreign currency reserves and set interest rates to keep the hard Ecu strong. This is a completely different system to the one governing the basket Ecu - which no single body administers and whose value changes over time. Why is Mr John Major, the prime minister, dusting off the hard Ecu files? Reviving the proposals could help Britain maintain it has a solid set of proposals to help in the aftermath of the ERM fiasco. By underlining the pragmatic nature of the proposal that is basically to do with helping business, Mr Major could steer a middle way between the warring factions of the Conservative party over Europe. What happens now? Britain is expected to start detailed conversations with the rest of Europe over the hard Ecu in the autumn. Like the 1960s England soccer player Martin Peters, the hard Ecu could be a phenomenon ahead of its time, but which eventually is a hard act to beat.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We issued a separate document to interpret this and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other provisions of COBRA. In it, we left to the States the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for defining these services listed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute within the bounds of broad policy guidelines (54 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7798, February 23, 1989 and 55 FR 48601, November 21, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that the same principles apply for the pregnancy-related services and services which may complicate pregnancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are specific to the section 1902(1) group of women.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See &sect;440.250(q).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the State plan includes services identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 1905(a) (1) through (24) of the Act (mandatory and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optional services that are considered as medical assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to Medicaid recipients). Many of these services can qualify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as appropriate components of the areas of care required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute; that is, prenatal services, delivery services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postpartum services, and family planning services, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services related to conditions that may complicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnancy. For example, physicians' services in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1905(a)(5) can qualify as prenatal services, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations by a physician are part of prenatal care, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as delivery services, since a physician may also deliver the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> woman's baby. Therefore, a State plan must provide pregnant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women with what the State has decided are enough services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in section 1905(a) to sufficiently cover each of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required areas of care. In addition, a State, at its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option, may provide services under section 1905(a) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act (for example, rehabilitative services or nutritional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements) only to pregnant women and not to any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categorically needy eligible Medicaid recipient, as long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such services qualify as either services related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnancy or to other conditions that may complicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnancy. A State would not be required to specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify which services it provides to pregnant women.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the State would be required to specify in its plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it covers each of the required areas of care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We interpret ``pregnancy-related services'' to mean those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services which are needed because the woman is or was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant, either because they are necessary for the health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the pregnant woman or fetus or because the services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> became necessary as a result of the woman having been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant. These include, but are not limited to, prenatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care, delivery, family planning, and postpartum services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the other hand, ``services relating to any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition which may complicate pregnancy'' are not ``pregnancy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related'' because they do not arise because of the pregnancy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These services include those for diagnosis or treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illnesses or medical conditions which might threaten the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrying of the fetus to full term or the safe delivery of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fetus. Because these services are for conditions ``which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may complicate the pregnancy,'' the services can be provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only while the woman is pregnant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note that, unlike the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility groups of pregnant women who are entitled to at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least the full range of services available under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular State's Medicaid plan to recipients of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility group, these low-income categorically needy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnant women are only entitled to pregnancy-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services (including family planning services) and services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the treatment of conditions that may complicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pregnancy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Infants and children in these eligibility groups are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for all appropriate Medicaid services included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the approved State plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Premiums for Pregnant Women and Infants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4101(d) of OBRA '87 redesignated section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1916(c) as 1916(d) and created a new section 1916(c) which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits States to impose a monthly premium on optional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categorically needy low-income pregnant women and infants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States may impose the premium on these individuals if their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income equals or exceeds 150 percent, but is not more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 185 percent, of the poverty level for a family of the size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved. The amount of the premium imposed may not exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 percent of the amount by which the family's income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds 150 percent of the poverty income guidelines. Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the care of a dependent child must be deducted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the family's income under this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States are prohibited from requiring the prepayment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> premium. Eligibility may not be terminated for failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay this premium unless the premium has been unpaid for at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least 60 days. In cases of undue hardship, as defined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State, the State may waive the payment of the premium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a State may use State or local funds from other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs to pay the premium. Under section 1916(c)(4) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act, if these funds are used, they may not be counted as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income to the individual for whom payment is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Congress did not specifically address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning of the term ``costs of care for a dependent child''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (the Conference Report refers to these costs as ``child care''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses (H. Rep. No. 495, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 731  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1987)), we believe that there was no Congressional intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to use a broader concept of child care costs for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision than that traditionally used under the AFDC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Therefore, we propose to define child care costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of this provision as costs related to the care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a child necessary to enable a member of the family whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income was included in the eligibility determination to work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or participate in training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

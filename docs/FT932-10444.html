			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Keeping insiders out Gartmore's broadside against the stock exchange on insider dealing comes at an unfortunate time for the government. It underlines the weakness in the proposed insider legislation before parliament. The main current problem is not that of defining the offence which is the thrust of the new law. Instead it is one of enforcement. There is some prima facie evidence, as Gartmore claims, of insider dealing in Tiphook shares. But the 11 per cent fall in its shares ahead of its profit warning proves nothing. If, as seems likely, no firm evidence turns up, the temptation will be to dismiss the exchange's inquiry as inadequate. The exchange is hampered both by the limitations on its scope to investigate and by the need for proof sufficient to secure conviction in a criminal court. Perhaps because it was primarily designed to satisfy the bureaucratic need to comply with the European directive, the new law ignores this problem. Instead it originally broadened the definition of insider information in a way that threatened to undermine the legitimate work of corporate advisers and stockbrokers. Yesterday's redrafting goes a long way towards redressing this difficulty, but it says nothing new on enforcement. The exchange itself has rightly picked out two changes which would help. Miscreants would be easier to expose if the authorities had recourse to civil as well as criminal penalties, as is the case in the US. Investigation conducted by one central body would be more effective. That also makes sense given the planned expansion of the legislation to new markets such as derivatives. The exchange's role would diminish further, but this, presumably, is one area where it would be happy to see that happen.</p>

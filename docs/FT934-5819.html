			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Santa, may I have a holiday in Hawaii? - If children of any age are on your Christmas list and you are stuck for what to give them, then it might just be worth listening to what the children have to say. Here, Suzanna Drew-Edwards goes after insider information So what is it that children really want today? Have playground preferences for trainers and Nintendo moved on or are they still top of the list? Hamleys, where approximately Pounds 1bn is spent on toys and games in the run-up to Christmas, is putting the odds on Sega and Nintendo video games as best-sellers this year. Traditionalists will be happy to know that Lego, Trivial Pursuit, Marvin's Magic and teddy bears also have a place in the top ten. But where better to go for advice than children? Their Christmas lists are surprisingly varied and, just occasionally, unobtainable. Matthew Bushnell, nine years old. An Airfix model, a calculator, Monopoly, a classical piano cassette tape, an exciting adventure book, a pair of slippers, a surprise. 'I can do Airfix models by myself now, although Dad does still help me a bit  -I'm just finishing off a ship. I was given a calculator last year, but it wasn't very good because it broke the first time I used it. I want a tape because I'm learning to play the piano and my slippers have holes in, so I want a new pair to keep my feet warm.' Oliver Bushnell, seven. A Backgammon set and a padlock. 'I've only got a pocket set of Backgammon and I want a bigger set. I want the padlock so I can lock things and keep them secret from my brother Matthew.' Winona Navin-Holder, nearly three. Some fairy dust from Peter Pan, Tiny Tears, the Jungle Book video and a Beauty and the Beast T-shirt. 'I want Peter Pan to bring me same fairy dust so I can fly to Never Land and I want a Tiny Tears dolly because my friend Georgia has one and she lets me play with her.' Lucy Gosling, eight. Computer games, a mountain bike, a science kit. 'I'd like some computer games because Daddy's just bought a computer. There's one called Flight Simulator where you have to land the plane, but Mummy says it's very expensive. I want a mountain bike because I've only got a BMX and it doesn't have any gears for going up and down hills.' Thomas Gosling, six. 'Can I have a Playmobile Lorry? And army clothes for dressing up and Scalextric and that's all.' Rebecca Monk, 12. Money, a holiday, a colour television, a hi-fi system, a set of encyclopedias. 'I'd like some money to put aside in National Savings so I can buy a car when I'm older, but most likely I'd go on a holiday to Barbados or Hawaii. I want the TV and the hi-fi for my bedroom because I spend a bit more time in there now with friends.' Christopher Osborne, 14. Guns and Roses CDs, an airbrush set, Sony Fontopia headphones, aftershave. 'I'm into art and one of my mates has an airbrush set which is really good. I'd like the headphones so I can listen in peace to my CDs.' Joshua Drewe, 8. Jurassic Park Command Compound and an Avanti 2001 car. 'The Jurassic Park Command Compound has an electronic voice which gives out warnings. I want an Avanti 2001 racing car because it goes really fast and it has five gears.' William Mallett, 9 1/2 . World Cup cricket, some shin pads for football, a Nintendo Game Boy and a mini-basketball set. 'My cousin has a set of World Cup cricket and it's really good. I want some shin pads because I play football at school and although I've never played mini-basketball before, it looks good fun.' Charlotte Mallett, 11. Football boots, craft sets, horse books, clothes. 'I play football at school and at home with my brother William and I really like it. I already have a candle-making set which I enjoy and I'd like something similar. I want some books which tell you how to care for horses and some horsey stories because I've been riding for the last year and a half and for clothes, I'd like some jeans, although not flared ones, some body suits and a chiffon top. I can wear them to discos and friends' parties.' Alice Taylor, nearly four. Goofy and a trip to the North Pole. 'I want Goofy to come on Christmas day and help me open my presents because he makes me laugh and I want to go to the North Pole to see Father Christmas and his reindeer, because that's where Daddy says he lives.' Caroline Prescott, 13. A telephone line. 'I'd like to have a private phone in my bedroom so that I can ring my boyfriend and not have Mum and Dad listening in while I'm doing it and telling me how expensive the call is.' Alf and Bert Jones, 15-month-old twins. Too young to speak up for themselves their mother, Chrissie Probert-Jones, says that what Alf and Bert really like are buttons - 'they're addicted to them' - so they will be getting nice chunky Aran cardigans with big buttons to fiddle with. 'They also love toothbrushes so much that they take them to bed with them. Bert has six teeth - all corkers and Alf has four neat ones. They like to have a toothbrush in each hand and tend to fight over them. 'They are fascinated by pens so they'll get a set with safe lids that are hard to get off. They also love noise and adore musical books such as The Snowman which a friend gave them last Christmas, so we'll get them another musical book. They love rattling maracas so we'll give them those. 'We're going to give them stockings with very little in them except masses of tissue paper which they can crunch up and envelopes that they can toy with. They are fascinated by electrical gadgets but they will not be getting any of those just yet. They're just beginning to like piling up bricks and to be able to fit things together so I think they'd like something like Lego or Brio. 'Alfie can run - he's been walking for two months already - but Bert just crawls but they both love trampolining so they'll get a mini-trampoline from John Lewis. I've given one to many of my nieces and nephews and they've all loved it.'</p>

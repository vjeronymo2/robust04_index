			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raul Llanos, Emilio Lomas M., and Yolanda </F> Gonzalez from Hermosillo, Sonora State]    [Text] Jaime Serra Puche, secretary of commerce and  industrial development [Secofi], admitted that despite the  measures taken by the federal government to expedite credits for  Mexican companies, interest rates remain high and are the main  concern for small and intermediate businesses.    Serra maintains that the greater number of national banks  and  the opening of foreign credit institutions, which will accompany  NAFTA, will create more competition and allow the country to  receive new resources that will increase the money supply.  "Both circumstances," he predicted, "will put downward pressure  on interest rates."    In his speech before the 76th General Assembly of the  Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco), the  Secofi secretary said the foreign trade indicators for the first  quarter of this year "are very positive" and added that for the  January-March period, total exports increased approximately 17  percent compared to the same period in 1993.    In addition, Serra reported that the sale of manufactured  products abroad was the sector with the most dynamic growth.  This sector grew nearly 26 percent, particularly exports of  cotton fabrics and other vegetal fibers as well as plastic  products and automobiles.    Serra explained that according to statistics compiled in the  United States, Mexican exports to that country increased 22  percent in the first two months of the year, a figure double the  increase registered by exports from the rest of the world.    In a speech given before President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari,  Serra also declared that the type of imports to the country  demonstrate the technological modernization and competitiveness  of the national economy, adding that intermediate goods  accounted for 71 percent of imports, capital goods for 17  percent, and final consumption products for 12 percent. Such  results of the commercial balance, Serra continued, show the  benefits of NAFTA and the growing competitiveness of the  country's economy.    Regarding financing, the secretary spoke of an increase of  over 4 billion new pesos in credit lines from the National Bank  of Internal Trade (BNCI) in 1994, representing a 60-percent  increase over last year. Of this amount, nearly 30 percent is  destined for the creation of infrastructure and 44 percent for  small and intermediate businesses.    Regarding development banking, the Commercial Development  Fund (Fidec) tripled its financing from 1990 to 1993 with its  credit supply going from 1 billion to 3.2 billion new pesos,  Serra remarked.    Serra said financing resulted in the construction of 463,000  square meters of storage and cold storage facilities, while  Fidec is expected to increase its credits for businesses'  working capital this year by 81 percent, and for those destined  for building commercial centers by 166 percent.    Serra also said emphasis has been placed on promoting new  forms of business associations to improve the scale of operation  by organizing purchasing credit and integrating business groups.    Regarding legal changes, Serra noted that between 1989 and  1993, the number of credit unions that can operate in any sector  of the economy, issue bonds, and trade assets grew by 22 percent  annually. Consequently, the secretary of Secofi concluded,  these new forms of association can resolve businessmen's credit  problems, problems of joint negotiations with purveyors, and  problems searching for markets and forming associations with  foreign businessmen.</p>

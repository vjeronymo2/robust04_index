			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Uncertain road - Richard Gourlay on the rare case of a company that sought protection by calling in the administrator This time last year Paddy Hopkirk was on a roll. His Bedfordshire company, which makes cycle racks and other car accessories, was expecting big new orders from Germany. He was introducing new Japanese production techniques that invigorated his workforce and led to productivity improvements. And after some loss-making years, the former Monte Carlo rally driver felt his company was back on the road. That optimism has now evaporated. Last month, Paddy Hopkirk Ltd received court approval for the appointment of administrators. As sales failed to materialise and overheads ballooned, the company faced a cash crisis and the prospect that the directors risked trading while insolvent. 'You do not take this decision lightly,' says Hopkirk, the majority shareholder, who having injected fresh equity in recent years this time was advised not to provide his personal guarantee. 'But it is the only way of protecting the business.' The administrators, Leonard Curtis, say the core business is sound. They say they are confident that potential investors from continental Europe might want to buy the Paddy Hopkirk name and manufacturing base as a cheap way into the UK car accessory market. But as potential buyers troop around the factory in front of a worried workforce, this relatively happy outcome is far from certain. It could have been a lot worse. It is still rare for insolvent companies to go into administration, the UK procedure that accountants say provides most protection for a business while it tries to agree restructuring or an arrangement with creditors. So far this year about 20,000 companies have gone directly into liquidation, many of them small companies with few assets worth retrieving. Only about 2,000 companies have gone into receivership and there have been fewer than 200 appointments of administrators, according to figures compiled from the DTI and accounting firms. What is more, it is almost impossible to enter a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which also confers protection on the business's assets, without going through the expensive procedure of applying to a court for administration first. Figures like these and the failure of CVAs to live up to expectations since they were introduced in 1986, have prompted the Department of Trade and Industry to improve insolvency procedures and encourage what the chancellor called a 'rescue culture' in his November Budget. The government plans to introduce a 28-day moratorium for all parties to allow insolvent companies time to reach voluntary arrangements with creditors. The government's case - challenged by some in the insolvency profession - is that too many businesses are closed by their creditors before all rescue options have been explored. This debate gives the Paddy Hopkirk administration significance beyond the question of whether its business can be saved. The 28-day moratorium could work as a similar, but cheaper version of administration. The attitude of the banks will remain crucial. Hopkirk's bank, Northern Bank of Northern Ireland, had fixed and floating charges over the company's assets. It was therefore in a position to put the company directly into receivership. Jeff Jones, the administrator for Leonard Curtis, says the bank chose to accept his firm's plan for administration, acting with a degree of integrity sometimes not shown by creditor banks. The problems at Hopkirk may be familiar to a large number of companies that have not tipped over the edge into insolvency. The company had focused considerable management time on improving the productivity of its manufacturing processes. Late last year it had called in the services of consultants from the Kaizen Institute who were trying to introduce ideas of continuous improvement and the notion that the workforce is the best source of ideas on improving productivity (see Management page, January 4). Hopkirk admits that while there was so much focus on the shop floor, management's attention might have wandered from more pressing issues elsewhere. Despite good computers and software, the board lacked a clear idea of its cost of materials and the gross margin made on its six basic products. 'We thought we knew how much the products were costing us but in hindsight we got it wrong,' says Hopkirk. 'In manufacturing that is very common.' There was also the over-optimism of some managers, who have now left, who had rapidly expanded the workforce and overhead base to cope with sales that did not materialise. 'They had the overheads for a Pounds 10m plus business rather than a Pounds 6m business (the actual sales level last year),' Jones says. The company was also 'chasing sales', he says. 'They had a good core product but they seemed to expand into hundreds of variations to satisfy complicated orders that damaged the core business.' The company believes that many of the financial control problems of six months ago have been addressed. Some of the least viable product lines have been suspended or closed. And the workforce has been reduced from a peak of more than 160 to 83 - a level below which Jones believes he will not need to go. But the company is at the point of its year when cash is most squeezed - its sales of car bicycle racks, for example, are greatest in the summer and yet it has to build for stock now. Hopkirk tried to raise extra capital from an investor but when this did not materialise, he got in touch through his auditors with the administrators. Jones says Hopkirk's decisive early approach to the administrators after the refinancing fell through was not only valuable for the business but also unusual. 'We were introduced to the business at a sufficiently early stage that allowed steps to be taken to secure the business to give it an opportunity to protect its future,' says Jones. That future remains as uncertain as the proposition that a 28-day moratorium will improve insolvency procedures. But Hopkirk, who has a strong sense of loyalty to his workforce, may have taken the best steps to ensure part of his business survives, if not his company.</p>

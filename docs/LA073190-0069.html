			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> For the first time, New York Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly, plagued by a  back problem, has mentioned retirement as an option.  </P> <P> But only a final option.  </P> <P> "I'd think about (retiring) hard," Mattingly was quoted as saying in Monday's  New York Daily News. "It depends on what (the doctors) tell me. But if I can't  be myself and be productive, then I won't keep playing. I would walk away from  it. But I'll be fine. I'm not done."  </P> <P> Mattingly, who is resting at his home in Evansville, Ind., was put on the  21-day disabled list Thursday because of a bulging degenerative disk.  </P> <P> He is planning a trip to Los Angeles to be examined by Robert Watkins, the  specialist who performed successful back surgery on Dave Winfield and who is  treating Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins.  </P> <P> Mattingly, who in April agreed to a guaranteed, five-year, $19.3-million  contract extension through 1995, is hitting only .245 this year. He has not hit  a home run since May 20.  </P></p>

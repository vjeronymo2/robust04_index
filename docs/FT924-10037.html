			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Israeli strike tests plans for sell-off ISRAEL'S Labour-led government yesterday faced the first industrial action against its privatisation plans when workers at Bezeq, the state-owned telecommunications monopoly, went on strike in protest at a proposal to allow private-sector competition in mobile telephone networks and some international communications. Operator services and most repair and maintenance operations were closed because of the action by 10,000 Bezeq employees, with cover only for emergency breakdowns. International links appeared to be functioning normally, however, and the workers did not carry out a threat to shut state radio and television services. Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, and his government defeated a vote of no-confidence yesterday ensuring continued support for his peace policies, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Parliament threw out no-confidence motions from four opposition parties by 59 votes to 51 after Mr Rabin resolved a bitter row between Jewish orthodox and secular coalition partners.</p>

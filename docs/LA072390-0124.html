			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS CONFIRM EPILEPTIC DRUG IS IN SHORT SUPPLY IN 4 STATES  </P> <P> A prescription drug taken by thousands of Americans to control epileptic  seizures is in short supply in at least four states, including California,  company officials confirmed today.  </P> <P> Officials for Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss drug manufacturer, said  higher-than-expected demand and manufacturing problems have created spot  shortages of carbamazepine, which is sold under the brand name Tegretol.  </P> <P> "We do have a shortage," said Cathy Kernen, a spokeswoman at the company's  offices in Summit, N.J. "We hope not for long, but we're afraid to say at this  point how long. It might be a couple of months."  </P> <P> Shortages of the drug have occurred most frequently in the last two months in  Texas, Ohio, Indiana and parts of California, Kernen said.  </P> <P> She said Ciba-Geigy's current shortage is due to equipment problems at a Swiss  plant where the active ingredient for Tegretol is made.  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Far right rises as Hungary's economy sinks: Issues of race and territory have swept in with the new political season HUNGARY'S far right, restless but dormant for the past two years of moderate conservative government, has burst into life without warning. Its issues of race and territory swept more mundane matters of budgets and economic reform off the agenda as parliament reconvened this week as the new political season began after the summer recess. The political talk is suddenly focused on the danger of 'Balkan chaos' and Hungary's prized stability - which made the country the favourite for western investors - is looking surface-deep. What stirred the waters was an article in the party weekly by Mr Istvan Csurka, a vice president and leading ideologist of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the ruling centre-right party. It has been received as a manifesto so explosive that it has been termed an 'intellectual Molotov cocktail'. Mr Csurka, a former novelist with the bulk - both physical and political - of a Jean Marie Le Pen, called true Hungarians to arms in a tract which opponents have described as nothing less than a foundation for Hungarian neo-Nazism. He demanded an end to moderation and compromise, linking Jews, communists, liberals, the International Monetary Fund and bankers in a conspiracy to destroy the government and smother Hungary's national revival. Anti-Semitic remarks littered the text, with Mr Csurka writing of the influence of 'the Paris, New York and Tel Aviv networks' and of 'the Hungarian Jewish position of hegemony'. In a sideswipe at western interference, he accused the IMF of pulling the strings behind the new financial elite, comparing the institution to the occupying Red Army which propped up the communists. He even called into question the Trianon peace treaty, the territorial settlement after the First World War which cost Hungary 60 per cent of its land area and left 3.5m ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states. With borders starting to unravel all over the Balkans and eastern Europe, he relished 'the opportunities to create a new Hungarian living space'. Mr Csurka's essay can - and has been by opposition politicians - be dismissed lightly as the rantings of an anti-Semite who has come out of the closet. More significant, however, has been the reluctance of Mr Jozsef Antall, the moderate prime minister, and the party he leads, to condemn the author outright and force his resignation. After a week of mounting pressure, the prime minister this week belatedly and begrudgingly distanced himself from Mr Csurka's standpoint, describing parts of the essay as 'politically mistaken and harmful'. But Mr Antall reassured Mr Csurka and his Volk-national right-wingers that there was an important place for them in the governing party. The latter's national committee went even further in support of Mr Csurka, concluding in its communique: 'The bulk of the essay's foundations are very useful in working out the Hungarian Democratic Forum's new programme.' It is the party's accommodation of Mr Csurka's outburst, rather than the words themselves, that is causing observers to look more seriously at the challenge from the far right. Mr Csurka, one of the founding heroes of the Forum, is believed to command the allegiance of up to a third of the ruling party's activists. Mr Antall, an innately cautious personality, can ill afford to force a deep split within his own party when both his coalition partners are also increasingly rebellious. He is even less disposed to react at a time when his government is trailing badly in the opinion polls and still reeling from two by-elections at which ministers suffered humiliating defeats. But Mr Csurka's constituency is more than just a faction within the Forum, and the debate about his essay goes beyond internal party politics. He has articulated the frustration of many Hungarians with the government's apparent inability or reluctance to purge those people who made their money or influence under the former communist regime. Their indignation has grown as Hungary's economic depression has deepened and thrown the growing wealth of communists-turned-businessmen into relief. Furthermore, Mr Csurka's extreme rhetoric taps a strong Hungarian vein of virulent nationalism and anti-Semitism. In their hearts, many Hungarians have not given up the territories they lost after the first world war, nor stopped casting around for scapegoats for this national tragedy. Territorial ambition and racism led to Hungary's wartime alliance with Nazi Germany when 600,000 Hungarian Jews died, most in German concentration camps, but up to 100,000 in Hungary at the hands of Hungarians, according to Jewish leaders. But even Forum supporters who admit the anti-Semitism in Mr Csurka's thinking do not want to see him forced out. 'Csurka cannot be evicted from the political scene. The best place for him is the Forum because the Forum can moderate him,' says one. The opposition predictably sees it the other way around. 'Your party is the prisoner of Csurka,' said Mr Laszlo Kover, an opposition leader, pointing accusingly across the parliamentary chamber at Forum MPs. Their disagreement leaves open the question, and it is an old one: when moderates pander to extremists in order to tame them, who controls whom?</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / International Company News: Third-quarter profits down 36% at Alcoa ALCOA, the big US aluminium producer, said its own 25 per cent cutback in US aluminium production in the third quarter had failed to bolster prices, and that rising world aluminium inventories and a corresponding price slide led to a 36 per cent drop in its third-quarter earnings, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. The company said it earned Dollars 28.8m, or 32 cents per common share, in the quarter, down from Dollars 45.3m, or 52 cents, in the same quarter last year. The quarterly results benefited from Dollars 22.6m in tax adjustments, and included a Dollars 4m charge for employment reductions at Alcoa's fabricating plant in Davenport, Iowa. Sales for the third quarter slipped to Dollars 2.2bn, from Dollars 2.4bn a year ago. For the first nine months, Alcoa had operating earnings of Dollars 96m or Dollars 1.08 a share, although special charges reduced the total to Dollars 91.7m or Dollars 1.03. In the comparable period last year, before a special accounting change, the company earned Dollars 156.9m or Dollars 1.81 a share.</p>

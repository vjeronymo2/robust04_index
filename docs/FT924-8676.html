			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: God among the pots and pans - William Packer admires the still-life paintings of Picasso Should the myth still persist that Picasso was no more than this century's greatest charlatan and fraud, this exhibition at Paris should finally explode it. Its subject is Picasso as a painter, and occasional sculptor, of the still-life, and it fills two large galleries on one floor of the Grand Palais. Given the size of the known oeuvre, it would have been infinitely extendable. But the exhibition has been beautifully chosen, its scope perfectly balanced to its concentration. It has already been seen in Cleveland and Philadelphia and this is its sole European showing. There can be no better reason for getting to Paris before the year is out. 'God moves among the pots and pans', said Saint Teresa of Avila. Picasso made much the same point himself in saying that 'the most ordinary of objects is . . . a vehicle for my thought - just as the parable was for Christ.' The principle of much in little, of virtue in simplicity, of all the world in a grain of sand, is, in whatever guise, unanswerable. For the artist the still-life has been a focus of preoccupation since art began. The symbolic appurtenances of the hero or the attributes of the saint may have served the purpose of simple identification but, more than that, the flower at the foot of the Virgin, the lily in the hand of the Angel, brought back the story into the real world, brought it quite literally down to earth. Still-life became a distinct discipline during the more secular post-Reformation world. It is in relation to that movement that we can see more clearly the significance of Picasso. For the point of the still life, is that the artist is confronted by objects which are real, immediate and commonplace. The effect upon a true artist is to drain off all self-conscious cleverness and formality. The still life offers no model to flatter or seduce, no grand design to achieve, no patron to please. The work is done for its own sake, enabling the artist to try out ideas, to experiment, to analyse, understand and realise forms. It is thus no accident that still-life should have been the staple of Picasso's work at the time of his most intense and private research, along with Braque, in the great Cubist adventure in the years around 1910. And how odd it is that all this high-cubist nature morte, (as the French call it with conscious irony) that once seemed difficult and austere, should now appear to us rich, lively and beautiful. Picasso's lifelong interest in still-life is displayed at this exhibition: here are the bowls of fruit, the glasses, bottles, the pipes and papers, and the guitars. And ever present, too, is mortality as leitmotif, the skulls and heads, the fish and fowl for the table, nature morte indeed. Such symbolism might seem especially poignant in the work of the early 1940s, for Picasso was in Paris throughout the Occupation. Indeed, it is generally agreed that his work was especially dark and gloomy during that time. Here is a painting of late May 1940, of a fish and a crab apparently biting and clawing at each other, with the Battle of France still fiercely in progress and occupation by no means certain. And here is the 'Tete de mort' of 1943, the image an abstracted death's head modelled and cast in bronze. Some of the most obviously angst-ridden works date rather from later 1930s, post-'Guernica' (his response to the Spanish civil war)and a time when his private life was particularly disrupted. Little is known of Picasso in Paris during the war. He was a distinguished neutral alien in his later middle age; materials no doubt were hard to come by, scope and palette alike necessarily restricted. I believe he simply kept his head down in difficult and gloomy times. Some wonderful things came out of this period, all as formally lively and wittily inventive as ever, sometimes even positively light-hearted. A grisaille of May 1941, than which one might think nothing would be gloomier, turns out to be of a coil of sausage, a bottle and artichokes upon a table, and the knives and forks springing out of the open drawer, like nestlings clamouring to be fed. More soberly, the exhibition shows the life-long centrality of cubism to the work. Once established, it might rest for a while suppressed beneath the surface, but it was always present as a powerful and determining creative force. The exposition of the young artist's development through the 1900s, from precocious talent to the mature and full achievement of cubism, affords the show's greatest thrill. The proto-cubist works of 1906 to 1909 in particular, as they move out of the shadow of 'les Demoiselles d'Avignon' towards a more universal, less equivocal image and reference, are astonishing for their formal certainty and monumental character. In later periods Picasso would often achieve still life on the grand and monumental scale, but never would he surpass the achievement of those early years. The large canvas from Basle, of the table with its leaf down across the picture plane, its top established by bread and fruit and grey compotier, and more bread leant against the wall and the green curtain behind, turns the corner from Cezanne towards the modernism, in all its aspects, of our own time. It is, in its simplicity, one of the great paintings of the century. Picasso et les choses: Grand Palais, Paris, until December 28; sponsored by United Technologies.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / World Trade News: State sector leads Singapore in the scramble for China - The focus is on infrastructure projects management and on advice SINGAPORE is both winning and losing the race to invest in China. The island is successfully carving out a niche for itself as China's leading adviser in many areas. It is managing multi-million dollar infrastructure projects and advising China on economic and financial matters. But so far it has bitten off only a small slice of the China investment cake. According to official Chinese figures, Singapore companies became involved in more than 700 projects in China in 1992, with a total value of USDollars 997m (Pounds 664m). The figures are small compared with those of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Last year alone Taiwan is estimated to have invested Dollars 5bn in China. Singapore's economic success has been built on the twin pillars of foreign multinationals and efficiently run, powerful, state companies. Singapore's private sector, grown fat on profits at home, has only recently started to expand overseas. It is the Singapore government rather than the private sector which is leading the rush to China. Two recent deals demonstrate the Singapore approach: In mid-May the Singapore authorities and China signed a provisional agreement to develop a 70 sq km industrial township in Suzhou, near Shanghai. Called 'Singapore II' by the Singaporean press, the township will be built with Singapore's integrated planning approach. Chinese officials will be seconded to Singapore government departments and taught the island republic's planning methods. Singapore managers will oversee work on the project, organising a expected Dollars 20bn of investments in the new town. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, played a key role in the Suzhou deal. Mr Lee says Singapore will not only build up goodwill through the project, it will also make the connections (guanxi)so necessary to winning further contracts. 'If we transfer this asset over seven to 10 years, it will be useful to them and in the process we will get to know them well at different levels. . . That's the trade-off,' says Mr Lee. Last December two state-controlled Singapore companies, Singapore Technologies Industrial and Jurong Environmental Engineering, entered into agreements with the Chinese authorities to help develop and market a 5,000ha commercial, industrial and residential complex in Fujian province. The first phase of the scheme will cost about Dollars 185m. Again the hope is that in the course of the project, Singapore companies will win lucrative contracts. Similar deals have been signed for a variety of other schemes, involving airport planning, road construction, and property development. China has been tapping Singapore expertise in other fields. More than 200 Chinese delegations have visited Singapore in the past year. In some respects Singapore represents a model for China's planners. It is an open and successful market economy within a tightly controlled, centralised political system. Mr Goh Keng Swee, a former Singapore finance minister, has been acting as an economic adviser to China since 1985. Mr Goh played a central role in Singapore's planning process in the 1960s and 1970s, setting up the island republic's Economic Development Board, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and other key institutions. Bankers say it is clear that the MAS is playing an important role advising China's central bank, the People's Bank of China. The Singapore government is investing in companies with close China connections. It recently took a 12.5 per cent stake in New China Hong Kong Group, a company based in the colony, said to have close links with the Chinese leadership. Mr Lee and other Singapore leaders say the government cannot always be expected to take the lead in establishing China contacts. They chastise Singapore's business community for its paucity of overseas investment. 'No one wants to go abroad. . . We have got to shake Singaporeans up, make them adventurous, or we will be losers.' says Mr Lee. Mr Lee himself is blamed for fostering a risk-averse culture in Singapore. Critics say that by building up an over-regulated, carefully controlled society, the entrepreneur - so evident in Taiwan and Hong Kong - has been squeezed out of Singapore. Some elderly Singaporean businessmen have retained close China links, based on family and dialect groups. 'Most of the young Singaporeans are no good at China business,' says an older Singapore trader with close connections in Shanghai. 'They expect things to work just as they do at home. They are arrogant and don't understand the way things are done.'</p>

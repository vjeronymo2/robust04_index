			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Enlarged Stratagem up at Pounds 1.2m Profits of Stratagem rose from Pounds 386,000 to Pounds 1.2m pre-tax for the year to August 31. The figures reflected a period of strategic change and development for the company. The group has evolved from an investment company into a group with interests in the manufacturing, distribution and service sectors. Turnover totalled Pounds 10.5m (nil) and earnings per share worked through at 9.5p (2.7p). A recommended final dividend of 3.25p makes a same-again 4.75p total. The directors said they were confident that the various parts of the enlarged group would benefit from the management and financial changes which the acquisition of Harrison Industries and the recent Pounds 8m capital raising had facilitated.</p>

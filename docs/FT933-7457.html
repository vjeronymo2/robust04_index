			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Merrett bows to Lloyd's pressure ONE OF the leading underwriting managers at Lloyd's of London yesterday bowed to pressure for changes from seven of the most powerful managing agents in the insurance market. Merrett Underwriting Agency Management (MUAM) agreed to replace Mr Stephen Merrett as chairman and appoint two new non-executive directors. The action follows an unusual campaign by an ad hoc group of members' agents in the last few weeks. They threatened to withdraw business from MUAM unless certain demands were met. These included the appointment of a senior executive to strengthen management and disclosure of Mr Merrett's interest in the company. Mr Merrett said the concerns focused on criticism of his personality. 'I would not suggest any criticisms of me have been unfair,' he said. The members' agents were Sedgwick, Anton, London Wall, Sturge, Murray Lawrence, Wellington and Willis Faber. They wrote to MUAM in July and triggered a series of meetings and letters. A letter from Mr Dennis Purkiss, MUAM's deputy chairman, circulated to the group yesterday set out its response. The company is to appoint a new chairman by the middle of October, who is likely to be a non-executive, and the board has already decided to appoint its first two non-executive directors. The letter showed that Mr Merrett held three of the 25 MUAM 'A' voting shares. Mr Merrett said: 'Pressure from the group coincided with our own concerns. We thought there was very little in the points they were making. It looks as though we have met them.'</p>

HUD will advise IHAs to use handbooks concerning procedures the IHA may use to determine what assistance they need from the BIA and IHS. At the request of a Tribe through the IHA, the BIA (including Area Road Engineers and Realty Officers) and IHS will provide, to the extent feasible, technical reviews and recommendations on project planning, design and construction documents involving supporting infrastructure, and related requirements at appropriate project review points. Appropriate project review points will be determined on a project by project basis and may include: project coordination schedule review, housing site feasibility review, project plan review, project final inspection, and record drawings review. Schedules or commitments made as a result of project coordination require the approval of the appropriate IHS and/or BIA official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.1.3&blank;Standard vs Assisted Housing Development Method. The Standard Method of development refers to all procedures, guidelines and requirements associated with the normal development of an Indian housing project by an administratively capable IHA. The Assisted Method contains all of the procedures, guidelines and requirements associated with the development of an Indian housing development by an IHA which has requested additional HUD assistance due to its inexperience or lack of staff resources, or by an IHA which has been deemed by HUD to need additional assistance, monitoring and supervision during the development process. The Standard Method will require less oversight by the signatory agencies as compared to the Assisted Method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.2&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BIA RESPONSIBILITIES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leases, Easements and Real Estate Appraisals on Trust Property.

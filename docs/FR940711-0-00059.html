The tea standards are provided for under the Tea Importation Act (the Act). The Act prohibits the importation of a tea that is inferior to the annual tea standard. Under the Act, the importation of a tea may be withheld until FDA examines the tea and is sure that it complies with the annual standard. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Effective May 1, 1994; written comments by August 10, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Submit written comments to the Docket Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Michelle A. Smith, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;158), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;205&hyph;5099. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the unique nature of the decisionmaking process for establishing annual standards for tea, the procedural protections that are part of this process, and the short period within which standards must be set, FDA has never, since the enactment in 1897 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 41), used notice and comment rulemaking for tea standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each final rule setting the standards is based on the recommendations of the Board of Tea Experts (the board), which is comprised of tea experts who are representative of the tea trade. The board selects standards each year according to the provisions of the Act. The board bases its selection on tea samples submitted by members of the tea trade to the board. Relying primarily on organoleptic examination, the board selects one tea to represent the standard for each major type of tea imported into the United States. In choosing a standard, the board tries to select one at least equal in quality to that of the previous year. The Act prohibits the importation of a tea that is inferior to the annual tea standard. Under the Act, the importation of a tea may be withheld until FDA examines the tea and is sure that it complies with the annual standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The annual meeting of the board is open to the public and is announced in advance in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . At the annual meeting any interested person may present data, information, or views orally or in writing regarding new standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The annual tea standards are prepared and submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by the board (21 CFR 1220.41). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should a tea importer be dissatisfied with an FDA tea examiner's rejection of a shipment of tea, the importer can refer its complaint to the U.S. Board of Tea Appeals and then to the U.S. Court of Appeals. FDA is unaware of any complaints or arguments having ever occurred concerning a designated standard, despite the many years since the enactment of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA concludes that notice and comment rulemaking to set tea standards is impracticable, contrary to the public interest, and unnecessary by virtue of the factors discussed above, i.e., the unique, longstanding procedures that apply to establishing a standard, the fact that standards are based principally on organoleptic examinations by tea experts, the public participation opportunities already provided, and the timeframes required for issuing annual standards. Hence, the agency is not following notice and comment rulemaking procedures in establishing the final tea standards for 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of this rule on small entities, including small businesses, was reviewed in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) (5 U.S.C. 601). FDA has concluded that this action will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, FDA certifies, in accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities will derive from this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons may, on or before August 10, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this regulation. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Any changes in this regulation justified by such comments will be the subject of a further amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 1220 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Customs duties and inspection, Imports, Public health, Tea. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, under the authority delegated to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by the Tea Importation Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, 21 CFR part 1220 is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1220_REGULATIONS UNDER THE TEA IMPORTATION ACT <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

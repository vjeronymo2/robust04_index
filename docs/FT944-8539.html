			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Society home loans drop 30% Further gloom descended on the UK mortgage market yesterday with the release of figures showing that new net mortgage lending by building societies dropped by almost 30 per cent last month compared with September, to reach its lowest level since February. Statistics from the Building Societies Association showed new net lending at Pounds 788m in October, compared with Pounds 1.11bn the previous month. In contrast to recent months, when figures have not been encouraging but have shown a slight rise compared with the same month last year, this is lower than the Pounds 825m net lending undertaken by societies in October last year. While the drop may reflect fears about future interest rate rises, these loans will have been agreed before the 0.5 of a percentage point rise in interest rates during September. The rise in mortgage rates in response to that may be a further depressant factor which has yet to feed through. The amount of net new commitments - which will translate into loans undertaken in the coming weeks and so is a forward-looking indicator - fell to Pounds 2.81bn in October from Pounds 2.97bn the month before. Although the October level is higher than the same month last year, the drop between September and October is greater this year. The number of net new commitments - at 46,000 - was lower than in October last year when it stood at 48,000. New gross lending in October also slipped - by almost 9 per cent to Pounds 2.9bn, compared with Pounds 3.19bn in September - but remained above last October's figure of Pounds 2.6bn. Mr Peter Williams, BSA head of research and external affairs, said the 'disappointing' fall in net advances reflected the fears of interest rate rises and uncertainty in the approach to the Budget. Even the subdued levels of activity expected in the coming months could be put at risk by Budget changes, he said. Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said the figures for new mortgage approvals, when adjusted for seasonal variations, were the weakest since July and were clearly showing the effects of the September rate rise. But Mr Rob Thomas, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, expressed doubt that the interest rate rise had an immediate effect. He said more important factors were uncertainty about the Budget and the cumulative impact of some months without a clear injection of confidence in the market. There was, however, better news for societies on savings with an unexpectedly high net retail inflow of Pounds 871m in October - about 40 per cent more than in October last year. Statistics released separately by the British Bankers' Association showed new mortgage lending by banks in October at Pounds 572m - below the recent average monthly figure of more than Pounds 600m.</p>

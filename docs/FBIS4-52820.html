			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Sok-hwan] </F>   [Text] President Kim Yong-sam said he will not rush the  issue of bringing North Korean loggers who escaped from logging  camps in Siberia into the ROK. Moscow is welcoming such a  remark by stating that the ROK Government has now started to  have a correct understanding of the situation.    It was pointed out that various reports in Seoul on the  North  Korean loggers were quite different from the actual situation in  Siberia.    Seoul's reports quoting ROK policy-makers that 'there are  signs of collapse in North Korea,' and that hundreds of North  Korean loggers earnestly desire to defect to the ROK, have left  ROK diplomats in Moscow and correspondents, who have examined  the loggers' issue for over three years, very bewildered.    These reports were formulated as if all of the escapees  wanted to defect to the ROK and that the motive for their  defection was due to the desire for freedom and disillusion of  the Kim Il-song regime. This is greatly different from the  actual situation.    Without considering the other side's situation, the ROK  Government dealt with this complicated diplomatic issue as if it  was a domestic issue, and gave the impression that the ROK  Government had decided to accept the North Korean loggers. This  was brought about due to the misunderstanding of the actual  situation.    Three years ago ROK media reported on the human rights issue  regarding the North Korean loggers. In 1993 this issue was  presented to the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva. This  resulted in Russia including an article on human rights in the  agreement on North Korean loggers.    At that time the escapees appealed for help at the ROK  Embassy in Moscow, various companies, and churches, and some of  them married 'Koreans' living in Moscow or Russian women to  obtain certificates of residence. Some other escapees were  successful in escaping to the ROK.    A total of 170 North Korean loggers went to the ROK  diplomatic missions in Moscow, Vladivostok, and Almaty to seek  help. Officials of these diplomatic missions, however, estimate  that many loggers made repeat visits.    It is also being argued that among the 170 loggers there are  a considerable amount of people who are working as 'foreign  currency money earners' roaming throughout the former Soviet  Union after conspiring with the agents of the North Korean  logging sites. The Russian daily (SIBODNYA) made an in-depth  study of the North Korean loggers issue and supported such an  argument.    (SIBODNYA) reports that the foreign currency money earners  work and receive daily wages by working in plants and  cooperative farms in the Khavarovsk region run by Russians  because it is far easier to earn money than by working in the  logging camps. They even ignore the date for their return to  the logging camps and run away to the back country in Russia and  marry Russian women to guarantee their status.    ROK Embassy officials analyze that except for a minimum  number of escapees, most of them want to remain in Russia and  work as businessmen if their status is guaranteed because they  fear the fatal blow their families in North Korea may face.    Some of the escapees appeared in ROK media and appealed  through tears for their situation. It is a fact, however, that  some of them still exchange letters with their families in the  North. This shows that there are loggers who are unclear about  their status and purpose.    Therefore, officials in Russia point out that if the  government truly has the intention of resolving this issue, they  must not hold the view that "even just a few of the escapees  must be taken to the ROK" before President Kim visits Russia.    Rather, voices are being raised that a measure must be  established, after a more thorough investigation of the  situation is carried out, so that it will not become a difficult  issue which will make it hard to hold dialogue with North Korea.</p>

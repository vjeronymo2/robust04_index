			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> Kudos to those who went to court to seek restraining orders against Los Angeles  County authorities who extort contributions to the United Way and other  charities from their employees (Metro, Nov. 3).  </P> <P> My charities are my business. Every year, I and millions of other employees are  badgered, harassed, coerced and strong-armed to contribute time and money to  our employers' pet charities.  </P> <P> Irrespective of any verbal or written reassurance, the employees contribute  mostly out of fear. We feel that our failure to contribute will jeopardize our  chances for advancement or will aggravate a pre-existing or future disciplinary  problem.  </P> <P> It is time to ban all solicitations for donations from the workplace and to ban  any kind of payroll deductions for any charities.  </P> <P> URSULA LOPEZ  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

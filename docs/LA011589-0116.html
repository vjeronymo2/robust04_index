			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EPILEPSY IN YOUNG: EARLY TREATMENT FOUND ESSENTIAL  </P> <P> Some children may become suddenly unresponsive once in while, staring blankly.  Then, they may begin chewing and repeating odd, mechanical motions. Some may  try to take off their clothes or run and flail at restraint. Others simply may  suffer sudden falls for no apparent reason.  </P> <P> Such confusing behavior may last for just moments and go unnoticed, or result  in ridicule from other children and punishment from adults, who misinterpret it  as a discipline problem.  </P> <P> Sharp-eyed day-care providers, teachers and parents should suspect epilepsy, an  unfortunately common neurological disorder that often responds well to early  treatment. It need not limit the child's activities or education.  </P> <P> This disorder is produced by brief changes in the brain's electrical system due  to a sudden increase in the amount of energy passing between cells in one small  area of the brain.  </P> <P> Recently reported studies have shown that many in the early stages of epilepsy  can discontinue all medication entirely once they have been treated and free of  seizures for at least two years. Left untreated, they risk developing a more  severe disorder in the future.  </P> <P> Dr. E. H. Reynolds of Kings College Hospital and Medical School in London  reports that unless a person's seizures are controlled within the first two  years of onset, they may not ever be controlled. The reasons for this pattern,  observed in a 10-year study, are not understood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Early Treatment Important'  </P> <P> "Early treatment is very important," Reynolds said, adding that the interplay  between natural remission and the medication is unclear. "But there seems to be  little doubt that drugs play a major role in the high remission rates," he  concludes.  </P> <P> In a few pediatric cases where standard treatment fails, a high-fat,  high-calorie diet helps.  </P> <P> "Many times, a teacher is the first person to pick up on subtle symptoms of  epilepsy," said Epilepsy Foundation of America spokeswoman Nancy Hembree.  </P> <P> The Landover, Md.-based EFA recently produced a poster and revised pamphlet to  help teachers and others who work with the public know the best responses to a  seizure as well as how to recognize a potential problem.  </P> <P> Contrary to the stereotype, epilepsy does not always involve a "fit," a term  which wrongly suggests mental derangement.  </P> <P> There are more than 20 different types of seizures, ranging in severity as well  as frequency, and an estimated one person in 100 has recurring ones. About  750,000 of the more than 2 million people with epilepsy are children and  teen-agers, Hembree said.  </P> <P> A Grand Mal seizure, also known as the generalized tonic-clonic type, is the  most severe and involves massive body convulsions, loss of consciousness, and  sometimes loss of bladder or bowel control. When consciousness returns, the  person can feel confused and sleepy, and will not have any memory of the  seizure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not All Convulsive  </P> <P> Not all seizures are convulsive, but in all cases, what you should not do is as  important as what you should do.  </P> <P> * Do not put anything in the child's mouth and do not try to hold the tongue;  it is physically impossible for the child to swallow it.  </P> <P> * Do not try to give liquids or medicines during or just after the seizure.  </P> <P> * Very important: Do not restrain the child's movements. Rather, guide the  child away from hard, sharp or hot objects. Put something soft under his or her  head. Turn the child on one side to keep airway clear.  </P> <P> In a Petit Mal seizure, a blank stare comes over the child's face for a few  seconds. It may be accompanied by rapid blinking, upward rolling of the eyes,  chewing movements. The child may drop what he or she was holding and be out of  touch, unresponsive, although the child appears to respond to his or her name.  </P> <P> Partial seizures can include involuntary jerking of fingers or toes, sometimes  spreading up the body. Other types may cause the child to suddenly collapse or  fall. In children between 3 months and 3 years of age, seizures may be  characterized by sudden jerking movements, with the head dropping or the body  pulling into a kind of fetal position.  </P> <P> In all cases, observe the child carefully, making sure he or she cannot be hurt  by surroundings. And it is important always to speak calmly and reassuringly.  Comfort the child afterwards. If the child has not been diagnosed with  epilepsy, medical evaluation is necessary.  </P></p>

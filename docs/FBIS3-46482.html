The  Khmer Rouge opened fire again at 0530 on Prince Sihanouk's  government forces at Chong Thmodon-Chong Klang, about one  kilometer from the Thai border. As a result, about 150 Cambodian  civilians and soldiers crossed the border into Thailand. The  Khmer Rouge have taken control of Chong Thmodon-Chong Klang, the  site of Prince Norodom Sihanouk's former palace.    After the clashes, the Suranari Task Force ordered soldiers  of Infantry Unit 23, Border Patrol Police Unit 21, and  territorial defense forces of Kap Choeng District, Surin  Province, to provide initial help for the Cambodians.  Reinforcements have been sent to guard the border and prevent  the fighting from spilling over into Thailand.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Adjudication urged in gas dispute THE GAS Consumers' Council, which represents 17m gas customers, is calling on British Gas and the industry regulator Ofgas to refer to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission their dispute over the rate of return on the gas pipeline business. Letters from Mr James Cooper, chairman of the council, were delivered yesterday to Mr Cedric Brown, who will take over tomorrow as chief executive of British Gas, and Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas. Mr Cooper said he could see no alternative to a wide-ranging inquiry into the structure of the UK gas industry. As moves were made towards greater competition in the industry, it was essential to ensure that public interest was being properly served, he added. 'There is a risk that the consequence of increased competition will be higher prices. Such a risk is too great to be accepted without a public inquiry.' Mr Cooper suggested that some changes proposed by the government and the Office of Fair Trading might be 'going too far or too fast', and it was time for an 'impartial referee' to adjudicate. Under the terms of an agreement with the OFT, British Gas must hive off its transportation and storage business into an arm's-length subsidiary by 1994. A pricing system is due to be published by September. British Gas insists that it must be allowed to earn an adequate rate of return from the pipeline business - a return which it puts at 6.7 per cent on existing assets and 10.8 per cent on new investment. Mr Brown said last week he did not rule out a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if there was no agreement. Sir James is believed to favour a lower return, although he has yet to respond to British Gas's submission. The consumers' council says the case for a review of the price cap, which limits the rise in consumer gas prices to the RPI minus 5 per cent, is 'worryingly strong' while British Gas faces additional costs from its separate pipeline and storage business. That might result in higher prices.</p>

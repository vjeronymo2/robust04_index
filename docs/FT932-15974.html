			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Flagging oil sector at odds over tax changes: Fears over the future of exploration dilute the welcome given to the regime TWO projects announced separately by Shell and British Petroleum in the past week will inject close to Pounds 2bn into the North Sea over the next five years. This is a shot in the arm for the flagging oil sector, which is suffering from persistently low oil prices. They are the type of projects the chancellor intended to encourage when he announced changes to petroleum revenue tax rules in the Budget. Both projects stand to benefit from the tax changes - some analysts reckon the new rules have added Pounds 100m to the value of BP's Forth field, which it announced it would develop last Friday. In addition, the lower tax rate will give Shell an added incentive to go ahead with the extensive plans it revealed on Tuesday to extend the life of its Brent field. But both projects were planned long before the tax changes and would probably have gone ahead anyway. Because of the long lead times required for large investment decisions in the North Sea, many oil companies fear the full effects of the changes will not be evident for many years. By that time, they argue, exploration will dwindle and it will be too late to entice it back by changing the rules again. The new rules lower the rate of tax paid on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it altogether for new fields. They also remove tax relief on exploration and appraisal work in the North Sea which will hit many of the small independent companies hardest. The Treasury estimates that the rule changes will raise Pounds 700m over three years. But this forecast has been challenged by Wood MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based industry analyst, which estimates the revenue increase to be Pounds 115m over the same period. The industry agrees that the tax changes will quadruple the cost of exploring in the North Sea and this has caused an outcry in the oil industry. But the new rules have also led to a row between companies that stand to gain from the proposals and those that will lose. British Petroleum is one of the winners. Wood MacKenzie reckons that the new rules will improve its cashflow by Pounds 412m or 14 per cent over three years. Companies such as Amerada Hess stand to lose the most  - an estimated Pounds 83m or 10 per cent knocked off its cashflow until 1996, according to Wood MacKenzie. The split between winners and losers has made it very difficult for the industry to formulate a joint response to the government's proposals and this has undoubtedly weakened its case. The Treasury sees little justification for making changes to the new rules. But there is one issue that has united the industry - the retrospective nature of the tax changes. Companies applying for acreage to drill in the North Sea must make presentations to the Department of Trade and Industry in which they sketch out their plans for exploration. As part of this they will agree to drill a certain number of wells over a specific period of time. 'We make these commitments in good faith that the rules at the time will stay in place,' said Mr David Keith, managing director of Seafield Resources, one of the smaller UK exploration companies. Companies are calling either for a transition period during which tax relief will still apply to wells they are committed to or to be released from the obligations made under previous licensing rounds. Under the present arrangements, if companies do not drill the wells to which they are committed, the government can take away their exploration licences. The DTI has yet to respond, but it has sent a letter to companies asking if they want to revise their bids made for the 14th licensing round, the results of which are due to be announced in a couple of months. It is the independent oil sector that will be most severely affected by the new rules and many say they are looking to move much of their exploration effort overseas. Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director of British Borneo, one of the small UK exploration companies, sums it up: 'This will greatly curtail future exploration activity which is needed to find the next generation of new fields. It will decimate the drilling contractors and in the long run, will shut down much of the North Sea much sooner than we would have expected.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Peter Ionno] </F>   [Text] General Georg Meiring is the ultimate professional  soldier: conservative by nature but innovative; authoritarian  but adaptable.    He is not doctrinaire except on the issue of defence force  standards.    For a man labelled a hardliner he has shown a remarkable  capacity for flexibility. The "reality" to which he refers  constantly is about cold assessment, not the heated passion of  ideology.    Yet his reconciliation with the ANC, his transformation from  hawk to dove, after years of full-blooded confrontation is one  of the miracles of transition.    A clue to how this leopard changed his spots to win the  confidence of his former enemies is in the first lines of a  ground- breaking paper he presented in November, setting out his  vision for the future of the defence force.    "It is a reality that if one does not plan one's own future  that someone else may do it for you and you may not like what  you eventually get," he said.    The paper, emphasising legitimacy, high standards of  preparedness within a non-threatening posture, acceptance of  integration and commitment to national development helped settle  the controversy around his appointment to succeed General Kat  Liebenberg as Chief of the SADF [South Africa Defense Force].    There was never any doubt that General Meiring is ideally  qualified. His 30-year experience is unusually broad, and it  was accepted that he commanded the loyalty of the SADF and could  be counted on to pull it through what was widely expected to be  a turbulent and violent election.    The distrust was understandable. The NP [National Party] had  tainted the SADF's protestations of no political allegiances by  keeping it in reserve, out of negotiations. It was perceived as  the white minority's ace in the hole.    These perceptions of partiality were underlined by General  Meiring himself. In a series of unsubstantiated allegations  about MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe; Spear of the Nation; ANC military  wing] plots and in his outright resistance to integration of MK  into the SADF he stood against the ANC.    Part of the miracle is the speed with which trust has  developed between General Meiring and Mr Joe Modise, the new  Defence Minister. Direct contact between the SADF and Umkhonto  we Sizwe was forbidden until April last year.    In taking the job in the face of Mr Modise's plans to  establish a civilian department of defence which will be  responsible for policy, personnel and finance, General Meiring  has tacitly accepted that his power will be diluted.    Georg Lodewyk Meiring was born in Ladybrand, in the [Orange]  Free State platteland, on October 18, 1939. His five-year  service contract will keep him employed past the usual defence  force retirement age of 55.    General Meiring's advisers refused to allow an interview for  this profile, but a handful of his past and present  general-staff colleagues were prepared to discuss Meiring the  man on condition that they were not identified.    All seized on his scientific background -- he received an  MSc  (physics) from the University of the Free State in 1962 -- and  his military origins in signals as key factors in his  development.    "His only problem is that he is a signaller," said a  headquarters colleague. "It is always a challenge for someone  who does not come from a fighting arm, infantry, to take  command. It just isn't done.    "His strength is that he is a realist, a soldier who  appreciates that you can only achieve limited objectives by  military action.    "The fact that he was given a fighting command in South West  (Africa) from 1983 and stayed until 1987 is an indication that  Constand Viljoen and Jannie Geldenhuys had discovered somebody  special in Georg Meiring. He was being groomed from the early  days."    He is a challenging taskmaster. "He tends to think like a  scientist, he does things systematically and he expects the same  from his subordinates," said one of his advisers.    "He tends to be quite far ahead of anybody speaking to him.  Sometimes it's most distracting. If you are talking rubbish he  knows it long before you do.    "He is not one of those people who thinks he knows it all,  but if he does appreciate something you have done he is a bit  shy about revealing it.    "He is not a relaxable kind of person. There is always some  tension about him. Even when I socialise with him I am always  sitting on the edge of my chair."    A rare glimpse of gentleness behind the steely facade is  revealed in a long letter replying to a 14-year-old student's  request for personal details from his hero. "If you accept  challenges, believe in yourself and in God, you will make a  success of your career," General Meiring told the lad.    Soothing the boy's fears, General Meiring wrote: "It is  wrong to speak of the `new South Africa'. There will be changes  in the political and legal terrain, but this does not mean we  will find ourselves in a new land.    "We in the army realised a few years ago that there would be  changes in our land. We could have ignored the signals, behaved  passively and hoped for the best. We felt that was not what we  should do."    These are the words of a pragmatist. As the defence buckles  down to historic change, he will see it through, even if it was  not of his choosing. General Georg Meiring will do his duty.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Sterling windfall brings machinery mini-boom Farmers visiting last week's Smithfield Show had their cheque books at the ready The organisers of last week's Royal Smithfield Show at Earl's Court in London are describing it as the most successful for five years. They report that the attendance was some 44,000 - up 8,000 on last year; that two-thirds of visitors were substantial farmers; and that one-third of the total placed an order while there. For although Smithfield is widely known as the indoor farm show at which champion meat animals are chosen, it is also the main British winter exhibition for agricultural machinery. Indeed, for the majority of farmers who do not show their animals competitively, machinery has dominated the event for many years and is the main reason why most take a December trip to London. A year ago, many farmers did not bother to attend the show. They had no money to spend and the prospect was that, following reform of the European Union's common agricultural policy, they would have even less before long. So in 1992 farmers stayed away in droves. Those who went to Earl's Court asked one another how long the show could survive. There was talk of holding it every second year as a compromise. Some said the agricultural industry could not afford two major national shows - the Smithfield and the Royal, held outdoors in July - and that one would have to go. But a year is a long time in agriculture. The full effects of the UK's departure from the ERM have now expressed themselves in the shape of higher farm prices. The increases, brought about by the working of the EU's green monetary system, which supports the local value of guaranteed prices in European currency unit terms when a national currency is devalued, in most cases exceeded reductions caused by CAP reform. The value of compensation for set-aside also increased for similar reasons and suddenly many UK farmers found themselves unexpectedly flush with cash. As always, when farmers have money, they spend it - and not always in the best long-term financial interests of their businesses. For although farm incomes have had a boost, they are still a long way short, in real terms, of where they were 10 years ago. But there were good reasons to spend this year. The most pressing was that few machines had been replaced for several years and many were becoming unreliable and expensive to maintain. The fact that farmers themselves are being forced, because of labour economies, to drive tractors themselves, helps persuade them to buy new. And the 40 per cent first-year capital allowance against tax, which applied until October 31, clinched the decision for many. The result was that UK tractor sales to the end of October were up by 29.4 per cent and although the carrot of capital allowance has now disappeared, the Agricultural Engineers' Association estimates that total sales to the end of the year will reach about 18,500 units, compared with the long-time low of 14,296 in 1992. The AEA further expects UK sales of combine harvesters, which represents some 20 per cent of the total value of the farm machinery market, to be up by at least 6 per cent on last year's 1,014 units. Other machinery, for cultivation etc, that is not registered and is therefore more difficult to count, is expected to be up 15 per cent in cash terms. But because two-thirds is imported and list prices have risen (the reverse side of the sterling devaluation coin) the rise in volume of sales is probably nearer 7 per cent. All of this may appear to suggest that farmers are doing pretty well and that CAP reform is not hurting - so it cannot be working. But comparison with tractor sales figures in countries that have not benefitted from a currency devaluation is instructive. In Greece, sales are down an estimated 64 per cent on last year, which admittedly was exceptional; in Holland, 48 per cent fewer tractors have been sold this year than last, again partly the result of special tax concessions in 1992. Denmark, which had no special circumstances, has recorded 37 per cent fewer sales and Belgium's are 25 per cent down. French and German sales figures are respectively 5 per cent and 11 per cent lower than in 1992. Overall, EU farmers are estimated to have bought 13 per cent fewer new tractors this year than last. And, as many advisers to the farming industry said at the Smithfield Show, the agricultural economics which dictated those gloomy figures will hit the UK soon. Benefits from devaluation were once and for all. The politicians did not mean it to happen. It was an accident. A Gatt agreement, which will almost certainly impose further cuts in farm incomes and production, now looks more likely than at any time since negotiations began in 1987. The best plan for UK farmers would be to hang on to as much as possible of the extra income from farming in 1993 because it will not last, the pundits said. Many farmers, the report from the Smithfield Show seems to indicate, ignored that advice. Indeed, the trend was towards even bigger, more expensive machinery, on the basis that more horse-power means less paid-labour and the ability to earn money by doing contract work for neighbours. The average horse-power of the tractors sold so far this year is up 5 per cent from 1992 against a rolling annual increase of just 2 per cent. Good luck to the farm machinery trade, which will make hay while the EU's area-aid cheques shine. But judging by experience elsewhere its members should not expect the mini-boom to last.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by HSN, Duesseldorf correspondent: "Machine </F> Manufacturers Must Learn Orientation to Customers' Needs"]    [Text] Duesseldorf--The German machine tool  manufacturers are now undergoing a reorientation process. They  have to develop machines with fewer technical extra features and  for a lower price. HANDELSBLATT talked with Prof Tilo Pfeifer,  business managing director of Werkzeugmaschinenlabor [Machine  Tool Labor] (WZL) in Aachen about the technical  consequences.    The machine tool industry is still essential to machine and  plant building, because every type of production is based on use  of machine tools. Germany was always leader in this field and,  according to Pfeifer, "has actually not more than to a marginal  degree relinquished its position to its chief competitor Japan."    The medium-size machine tool manufacturers were particularly  hard hit by the decreasing demand for capital goods. They had  specialized in machine tools high-tech fabrication processes,  the first ones factories struck from their purchase lists for  reasons of the high cost. The crisis in machine tool  manufacturing is not a problem faced by this industry  particularly but rather a major a consequence of overproduction  in all sectors of industry "affecting any enterprise when the  demand decreases and competition on the market becomes ever  keener," says Pfeifer.  <H5>  Machines Too Expensive in Times of Cash Shortage </H5>   While competing with the Japanese, the machine tool  manufacturers have in the past let themselves be pushed too hard  into the specialty niche and left the mass market to the  Japanese. However, also the Japanese had to realize now that in  an economic crisis it is not any more the volume they can count  upon to ensure cost-effective production. These machine tool  manufacturing enterprises, like all others, now need more  flexibility in order to more quickly respond to market  fluctuations.    In order to find a way out of the crisis, it is especially  the German machine tool manufacturers who must learn to orient  their products to customers' needs. "This is a very important  prerequisite for as soon as possible regaining a foothold on the  market," says Pfeifer. Most enterprises do not understand that  this is also a significant aspect of quality management, a  strategy much talked about but implemented by only a few  enterprises.    "Furthermore, our abilities and creativity have pushed us  too  far in targeting many branches of industry and made us build  into the machine tools features which, while nice and  attractive, are of no use to the customer," says Pfeifer in a  mood of self-criticism. Now, when money for investments is  scarce, the customer wants only what can be cost effectively  utilized. The machine tool must be as robust as possible and  allow for future additions.  <H5>  Integrated Fabricating Operations Not Flexible Enough </H5>   During the second half of the 1980's German manufacturers  had  more heavily emphasized integrating the operations, with the  machine tool a component of a computer-controlled system. At  that time they were convinced that such systems, which a  computer can fully automate through all stages from planning to  production, will perform better and respond faster to demand  fluctuation. "However, this was an illusion," Pfeifer deduces  from what he now knows.    The trend is now back to autonomous units. In this way  individual production stages acquire more independence. "This  does not, however, mean a return to manual labor," explains  Pfeifer. Rather, this should eventually make possible relatively  quick on-site modification of part programs without prior  involvement of lengthy planning procedures. The organization of  these autonomous units will then be controlled not from a  higher-echelon center but by a self-regulating mechanism. In  connection with this one is considering chaos organization and  cooperating fractals. Various catch phrases have already been  coined, essentially referring to similar concepts of autonomous  production units.    One of the key development regarded by Pfeifer as a  future-oriented one is, therefore, an autonomous production  cell: a machine tool which makes efficiently performed functions  in the production process available to the human operator. In  this way the attendant who programs the machine tool should have  available an integrated computer technology which requires only  that the configuration of machine tool components necessary for  machining blank parts be entered. "The whole task of assigning  operations to cutters and planning the procedure is  automatically performed by processors and controls in the  background behind the machine tool."    A production cell is moreover equipped to perform a broad  range of monitoring functions: first of all ascertaining that  all necessary functions are properly included, then inspecting  and monitoring the tools, and finally monitoring the machining  process. Many new measuring operations are integrated into  machine tool for this purpose.    The third level of functions to be added concerns the  machining itself. The aim is to meet the demand that a machine  tool can be set up so that both turning and milling can be done  at the same time rather than only classical turning at time,  this having already been proved to be feasible in several cases.  As the next interesting feature will be considered combination  of turning, milling, and drilling in a single setup. Says  Pfeifer: "I think this will be a further evolving process which  will indicate how many classical machining operations can be  rationally combined."  <H5>  More Functions Integrated in One Machine Tool </H5>   Beyond that efforts will be made to integrate new  technologies such as, for instance, laser machining into the  machine tool. "This idea is not entirely new idea," Pfeifer  admits, "but still in an early development stage." In this way  it will become possible to process parts made of hard materials  by first heating them with a laser beam and then machining them  while they are hot.    Development of future machine tools could lead to a more  far-reaching than before collaboration with the user industries,  says Pfeifer: "Colleges could take over the development work for  future machine designs, work which at this time individual  medium-size enterprises can financially not afford to do." The  advantage would be that those enterprises could then integrate  the innovations into their own products on a step-by-step basis  without impairing their competitiveness.</p>

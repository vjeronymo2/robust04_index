			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Rakhmaninov: "The Results of Russian </F> Election May Be Repeated in Our Country"]    [Text] A meeting of supporters of the Ukrainian National  Assembly [UNA] and the Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNSO],  which was held at the Cinema House, has not become a significant  event in Ukraine's political life. Everyone has already become  used to gatherings of UNSO members. Nevertheless, compared to  other activities of Korchynskyy and company, the meeting was  unusual. First of all, the most meritorious participants of the  battles in Caucasus received official awards from Georgia.  Secondly, the meeting at the Cinema House was held following a  two-day congress of Slavic national patriotic organizations,  which had been held at the Moscow Hotel at the initiative of UNA  and UNSO.    Journalists who arrived on Saturday morning to admire Dmytro  Korchynskyy and his followers were met by a cordon of militia  officers: Law enforcement authorities had received an anonymous  tip that a bomb had been planted in the Cinema House. Although  they conducted a thorough search, no bomb was found. There were  plenty of versions as to the reasons behind this threat:  Somebody insisted that this was a communist provocation; others  claimed that UNA members prepared the show to attract more  attention to their organization.    Events that took place inside the building, when it was  already clear that there was no danger of the grand assembly  blowing up, also resembled a well-directed performance. The  main goal of the meeting was to confirm the participants of  their strength, and to impress those observing the meeting.  Should one be scared of UNA and UNSO? Is it true that these  two organizations (in fact the political and military subunits  of one organization) represent serious power? I do not intend  to assess the real importance or threat represented by  Shukhevych's and Korchynskyy's organization, however, only a  blind man would not notice its growing influence. The words  voiced at the meeting may provoke a reflection of how the  organization's image was enhanced.    "All other political organizations are losing members. Only  we are growing stronger... The policy endorsed by the president  and the government leads a manager of commercial bank, a miner,  and a UNSO gunner to the same trench, and pretty soon they will  be shooting in one direction." Although these two statements by  Dmytro Korchynskyy had previously been delivered on two  different occasions, their author took the risk of combining  them, to demonstrate the principle of propagandist-psychological  activities of UNA ideologists. The principle is as simple as  mumbling, and it could be brilliantly carried into effect by  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the greatest populist of our times: The  people should hear what they want to hear. The thesis about  "fulfilling the reform movement with real sense" or "the weighed  centrist-reform policy" would be met by the people with less  understanding than simple postulates of UNSO: For the people --  a strong state; for the hungry -- a hunk of bread; for the  traitor -- the gallows. This rings a bell, doesn't it?    The UNA and UNSO slogans, as well as the election promises  of  Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy], can be heard on bread lines  and in smoking rooms. Liberal reasoning and discussions on  serious matters are prohibited there -- the more  straight-forward the statement, the better it is received. An  illustrative example of UNSO's logic was presented by one of its  members: "Earlier, our country resembled a zone where  `legitimate crooks' were in power, now, it resembles a zone  where bitches who violated the crooked law are in power. I do  not want to be ruled by bitches, I am not a swine." Could you  tell me who would admit being a swine? After such words,  Korchynskyy's statement that "only UNA member live properly, the  rest do not live at all" does not sound shocking.    The attractiveness of the Ukrainian Nazi lies in the fact  that they have chosen those in power as their enemies, which is  very appealing to the common man. Here are those guilty of all  the misfortunes -- a bunch of thugs who are stealing away our  state and teaching others how to do the same. It would not be  so bad if UNA ideologists only exploited the centuries-old  desire of the people to seek "extremes," but unfortunately such  "extremes" occur pretty often, demonstrating political inertia  and corrupting the people. Therefore, Korchynskyy's words about  a miner and a UNSO member in the same trench are not simply  bravado.    The guidelines of populist policy also provide for the  necessary existence of myth. The inventive boys from UNA have  constantly been refreshing the myth of their power and  popularity, since the establishment of their organization.  According to Korchynskyy, the Agro detachment that fought in  Abkhazia is the best organized military unit. Following the  same logic, UNA and UNSO are the best organized political forces  in our country. The reasoning is very simple: UNA is the only  organization which possesses experience in conducting politics  in the situation of complete destabilization, meaning Cisdnestr  and Abkhazia. According to UNSO theory, the time of talkative  politicians has gone, and a time of "commanders with combat  experience" is coming, since only such politicians are able to  avert complete disaster, during a period when the people's wrath  reaches its apogee, and one must save enemies of the people from  that wrath as well as the country from complete ruin and  possible occupation.    The myth of an apparently existing external threat is yet  another example of UNSO's tricks. To root the myth in people's  consciousness, and to simultaneously obtain certain support in  case UNSO is banned (the 11 November legislation on illegal  paramilitary organizations was predominantly aimed at UNSO),  Korchynskyy, Luponis, Kovalenko and their comrades organized the  congress at the Moscow Hotel. The idea of a united Slavic  territory, which was discussed by national-Slavs from Ukraine,  Russia, Belarus, and Poland, can hardly be carried into effect.  The discrepancies between, for example, Ukraine's Party of  Slavic Unity and the Russian People's Social Party or the  Belarusian Slavic Union Belaya Rus, are too significant.  Nevertheless, the idea of Slavic unity developed by  organizations with ultranationalistic image, will undoubtedly  attract more followers. Probably, this was the main goal of the  congress.    The only thing that could scare an average citizen, on whom  the UNSO Goebbels count, is open fascism. "Today is that rare  day when UNSO does not have to storm anything or beat anybody...  Of course, we could chase them all into a corner, but we will  soon need some scapegoats... The poor German neo-Nazis look  toward Ukraine in hope that maybe salvation will come from  there. It will surely come..." These words were delivered by  one UNSO leader during the congress. They fall in line with the  frantic hail of "Death for enemies!" and the stretched-out and  raised right arms. Even the uniforms of certain UNSO members  resembled those of Schtrasser and Rem [SS officers].    The brown color seen between the red and black colors of  UNSO  may either attract or scare someone, as once the possibility to  play a real war attracted some UNSO members. By the way, the  Nazis were not always the most massive and influential force in  Germany. In the beginning, their ideas shocked the people's  consciousness, but soon all of Germany hailed the swastika.  Western historians have been trying to explain the phenomenon  of Hitler. Today, Russian politicians are trying to understand  the phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy.    Seven people who wanted to play war in Caucasus will never  come home. No orders, no assurances that "henceforth our  organization will be like one family" will return those sons to  their crying mothers and Ukraine, the interests of which, as the  UNSO leadership assures, were defended by the gunmen in the  Caucasus.</p>

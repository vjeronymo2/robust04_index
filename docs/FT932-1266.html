			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Simple logic, devilish detail for Richemont: The divorce of tobacco and luxury brands RESTRUCTURING the house of Richemont, the parent company for Rothmans cigarettes and some of Europe's leading luxury brand names, has long seemed simple in logic but devilish in detail. The reorganisation announced on Tuesday, designed to separate the group's tobacco and luxury goods businesses into two separately listed companies, will simplify Richemont's convoluted group structure. It also appears to dodge the detail of tax considerations for Richemont's controlling South African shareholders and a tax liability on possibly the star in Richemont's firmament, Cartier. Terms of the restructuring are expected soon, possibly with Rothmans annual results tomorrow. Ahead of that, analysts agreed that the move is a welcome one. It should lead to operational and marketing benefits when sales of cigarettes and luxury goods are being hit respectively by price cutting and recession. 'There should be practical and cosmetic improvements, although underlying valuations were recognised so there may not be a lot more extra value created,' according to Mr Paul Beaufrere at James Capel. Richemont was set up in 1988 as the Swiss-based vehicle for the overseas assets of the South African Rembrandt group, founded by Mr Anton Rupert. His son Johann, who trained as a merchant banker, helped devise Richemont's share structure, which allows the Rupert family to retain control despite holding only 10 per cent of the shares. Richemont's main holding was its stake in Rothmans, which the Rupert family had controlled since the early 1970s, and which in turn owned 57 per cent of Dunhill Holdings. Throughout the 1980s, the group made a number of luxury goods acquisitions, some of which were shared between Rothmans and Richemont, and some of which were held directly by Richemont. As luxury goods sales rallied in the late 1980s, the company felt its structure was undervaluing assets because the main holding company for luxury goods, Luxco, was unquoted. From 1989, Mr Johann Rupert looked at setting up a quoted luxury goods company to own all of Cartier. But the whole of Cartier had been bought for about Pounds 160m in 1984, since when the company's estimated value has soared to more than Pounds 1bn. Selling Rothmans' 47 per cent stake in Cartier would therefore incur heavy capital gains tax. Instead, under the planned reorganisation, tax should be avoided, according to Mr Clive Richardson at Henderson Crosthwaite. 'Richemont is not floating off any businesses, it's just shifting its shareholdings within different structures,' he said. However, he pointed out that the structure still needs approval from the Inland Revenue. Rothmans, as with other tobacco companies, generates large amounts of cash and has a net pile of about Pounds 1bn. Divorced from luxury goods, the new tobacco company will be free to concentrate on developing its own businesses. One analyst suggested that Rothmans had enough problems of its own without having to worry about Dunhill's as well. After losing market share in its important market of Europe in the 1980s, Rothmans has concentrated on improving its margins through cost cutting. It has also devised a strategy, under management installed by Mr Rupert, which simplified its operations into four geographical regions, rather than a host of semi-autonomous country managers. But growth in cigarette volumes will come from new markets like China and eastern Europe. In Asia, Rothmans' main weakness is that its brands are Virginian rather than 'American'. To compete with brands like Philip Morris's Marlboro, analysts argue that Rothmans faces an uphill and very expensive struggle building brands. Rothmans' dividend policy, constrained by advance corporation tax problems in the past, may also be relaxed. The new tobacco and luxury goods companies will be structured as twinned UK and non-UK holding companies. This is partly designed to shelter Richemont and other overseas shareholders from UK taxes, and is a similar structure to that employed by Reed International and Elsevier, the UK and Dutch publishing groups which merged on January 1. That merger enabled money to be remitted to Dutch shareholders without incurring any ACT. The new luxury goods company will combine some of the most glamorous European brand names, including watches and fashion products made by Cartier, Montblanc pens and Karl Lagerfeld, the designer. There will be some immediate advantages - from cross marketing, for example. In the past Dunhill used its strong position in Japan to improve Montblanc's visibility. But the two parts of the group are also very different. Dunhill mainly sub-contracts its manufacturing, its products are largely male orientated, its operations are largely UK based, and its management - including chairman Lord Douro, the future ninth Duke of Wellington - is rather British. In contrast, the companies within Luxco manufacture their own products, which are largely female orientated. Their management style, and product sales, are very European. 'One imagines there will be a hell of a culture clash,' an analyst said. Rothmans and Dunhill said on Tuesday they intend to distribute to shareholders cash resources 'considered surplus' to the needs of the new companies. Analysts estimated Rothmans had more than Pounds 300m cash available for distribution, while Dunhill had net cash of Pounds 120m at its March year-end. That would imply a cash distribution of 60p a share for Rothmans and 80p for Dunhill. If all this cash were distributed, Richemont would receive about Pounds 200m. The timing would be fortunate. The company is next year due to repay Pounds 612m of borrowings taken on in 1989 to buy out Philip Morris's minority stake in Rothmans.</p>

The BE&hyph;577 is a mandatory survey of U.S. direct investment abroad conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), U.S. Department of Commerce. Under this proposed rule, the exemption level for the survey_the level below which reports are not required_would be raised from $15 million to $20 million. This change will reduce the number of respondents that otherwise must report in the survey, thus reducing both the reporting and processing burdens. (As noted below, however, BEA is proposing the addition of a number of items to the survey form that do not require a rule change and that will increase reporting burden, exactly offsetting the reduction in burden due to raising the exemption level.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on this proposed rule will receive consideration if submitted in writing on or before January 26, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments may be mailed to the Office of the Chief, International Investment Division (BE&hyph;50), Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, or hand delivered to Shipping and Receiving, Section M&hyph;100, 1441 L Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20005.

Barker, Chief, International Investment Division (BE&hyph;50), Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; phone (202) 606&hyph;9800. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The BE&hyph;577, Direct Transactions of U.S. Reporter With Foreign Affiliate, is part of BEA's regular data collection program for U.S. direct investment abroad. The survey is mandatory and is conducted pursuant to the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (Pub. L. 94&hyph;472, 90 Stat. 2059, 22 U.S.C. 3101&hyph;3108, as amended). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The exemption level is set in terms of the size of a U.S. company's foreign affiliates. Under this proposed rule, the exemption level for the BE&hyph;577 survey will be raised from $15 million to $20 million. Thus, if an affiliate is owned 10 percent or more by the U.S. company and has assets, sales, or net income greater than $20 million (positive or negative), it will have to be reported. The last time the exemption level was raised was May 1, 1986. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Raising the exemption level lowers the number of reports that otherwise must be filed, thus reducing the reporting and processing burdens. The proposed changes would be effective commencing on January 1, 1995 with the reports for the first quarter of 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BEA is proposing changes to the BE&hyph;577 survey form in addition to the raising of the exemption level. These changes, however, do not require rule changes and are not reflected in the proposed rule. They are a result of changes made to the related BE&hyph;10, Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad_1994. They include the combination of two items that appeared on the 1994 BE&hyph;577 survey and the addition of other items that are on the 1994 BE&hyph;10 but were not on the 1994 BE&hyph;577. Changes in the survey instructions are being made primarily for purposes of clarification and to reflect the combination or addition of items on the form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Added to the form are items, to be completed annually, on services transactions between U.S. Reporters and their foreign affiliates by type and an item, to be completed quarterly by affiliates classified in banking, on the U.S. Reporter's share of the affiliate's provision for loan losses. The additional detail on services transactions by type will move BEA's services data into closer conformity with international guidelines in the fifth edition of the International Monetary Fund's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Balance of Payments Manual,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which suggest that services transactions be disaggregated by specific types of services. The item on the loan losses of banks is needed by BEA to adjust net income of U.S. multinational companies to an economic accounting basis, as required for entry into the U.S. national income and product accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reporting burden for the 1995 BE&hyph;577 survey is estimated at 46,000 hours, 4,000 hours more than the estimate currently in the OMB inventory. The increase reflects an adjustment in the hours currently in the OMB inventory to account for an increase in the number of respondents, due to natural growth in the affiliate sample, since the estimate in the inventory was made. There is no net change in burden hours due to program changes; the increase in burden due to the addition of new items to the form is exactly offset by the decrease in burden due to raising the exemption level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the proposed survey forms may be obtained from: Office of the Chief, Direct Investment Abroad Branch, International Investment Division (BE&hyph;69(A), Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; phone (202) 606&hyph;5566. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

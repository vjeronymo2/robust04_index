			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: IRA exploited reduction in spot security checks THE second significant IRA bomb attack in the heart of the City in just over a year has served as a chilling reminder of the terrorist organisation's capacity to strike and strike again, and the security forces' apparent inability to stop it. According to Mr John Wyatt, a bomb disposal expert and security adviser, the type of bomb proved the extent of the IRA's logistical and organisational capacity. Unlike Semtex, which can be lethal even in small quantities, the ammonium nitrate fertiliser used in the City bomb needs to be gathered in considerable quantities, mixed with other base materials, and then packed into several containers. The process by which this material was gathered, stored, assembled, and then transported to the City seems at no point to have been detected by the security forces. According to security sources, the IRA appears to have exploited a reduction in the frequency of armed spot checks on traffic by the City of London police. The security forces are understood to have been assuming the next big terrorist attack would be directed at a political figure rather than property. Professor Paul Wilkinson, an expert on terrorism, estimated yesterday that there were probably now as many as 40 people actively engaged in IRA terrorism on the mainland. In a comment echoed by some MPs, Prof Wilkinson described present arrangements for dealing with the IRA as a 'recipe for fragmentation' and urged the creation of a 'single body' to co-ordinate resources and intelligence. Since last year MI5 has in theory been in overall charge of intelligence gathering, with the Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist squad giving it logistical support. But in practice the mainland anti-terrorist drive has continued to involve any of Britain's 54 regional constabularies, as well as forces on both sides of the Irish border. The intelligence record in fighting against the IRA remains in deficit, with bomb attacks far outnumbering arrests, let alone convictions. 'Short of turning each building in the City into a concrete bunker at huge cost there is no guarantee this won't happen again,' said Mr Wyatt. But he believes companies can make themselves, if not totally secure, at least less vulnerable by using a strategy based on: Restricted access of large vehicles to specific times which can be monitored by the companies concerned and the police. The use of mobile screens of laminated fibre glass mat which can quickly cover an office's window in an emergency and reduce injuries from shattering glass. The location of computers and other expensive equipment well away from street-facing areas of an office. Mr Owen Kelly, City of London police commissioner, called yesterday for extended powers to tackle the terrorist threat. He said he wanted the power to set up road checks 'wherever and whenever, without specific reason for doing so'. In the meantime, the IRA will consider the weekend events as a significant coup, consistent with the terrorist organisation's own policy of forcing Northern Ireland on to the English and international political agenda.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Christmas is a lot closer than you think] - Only 14 shopping days left, don't panic] Lucia van der Post has some tips Well, here we are, just 14 shopping days left to Christmas. Time is running out and though I daresay some of you are already sitting back looking at all those neatly-wrapped parcels, there are plenty of us whose lists still look dauntingly full. For those still wondering what to buy for whom, here are a few suggestions. Personally, I think old-fashioned games are infinitely more fun than almost any new one you care to name and they make a splendid family present. So what about a set of packs of cards specially designed for Racing Demon? Beautifully packaged, four packs of cards, plus an instruction leaflet, cost Pounds 16.50 either direct from Elizabeth Designs, Mousehill Court, Milford, Godalming, Surrey GU8 5EA. (Tel: 0483-417-357) or from Aspreys of Bond Street, London W1 and the General Trading Company of 144, Sloane Street, London SW1. For something off-beat what about a fossil? Cobra &amp; Bellamy of 149 Sloane Street, London SW1 have brought a collection back from the Dominican Republic. They are about 35m years old and there is quite a choice. Ants seem almost two-a-penny at Pounds 60 a time. Also Pounds 60 are winged termites, flowers, petals, stamens. Mosquitoes, also mired in clear amber, are about Pounds 850 while the piece de resistance of the collection (for which a bid has already been made by the Natural History Museum) is a sitting-up scorpion at Pounds 6,000. A praying mantis is Pounds 5,000. For bookworms, bookchecks are good stocking presents. Printed almost exactly like a check-book they are designed to keep a check on book borrowers - you write your own name on the major part, tear it out and give it to the borrower to use as a bookmark and reminder of the owner. You keep the stubs where the filled-in foil reminds you of who has borrowed which book. There are several different designs, each pack has 20 checks and costs Pounds 3.95 from Museum shops, good bookshops such as Waterstones and Dillons. To buy by mail write to: Bookchecks, Ibthorpe House, Andover, Hampshire SP11 OBY. Telephone: 0264-76683. For the keep-fit brigade who have not yet found a club that suits them what could be better than a subscription to a health or indoor tennis club? True, it is expensive, but it is the sort of present that lasts all year round. The Carlton Tennis Club, for instance, has three indoor courts and a fitness studio. Full membership costs Pounds 650 a year with a joining fee of Pounds 250. You get an introductory game free. The club is at Alfred Road, Westbourne Green, London W2 5EU. For membership details ring 071-286-1985. Give her a beauty session - for Pounds 25 Jean Ashley, 32, Albert Bridge Road, London SW11 4PY (Telephone: 071-720-4239) will provide a complete facial treatment and she is happy to give appointments either in the evening or on Saturday morning for busy working women. Stephen Glass of Face Facts at 73 Wigmore Street, London W1 (Telephone: 071-486-8287) will give a complete make-up lesson with step-by-step tuition and advice for Pounds 59. He is not only expert, he is terribly nice. Trivial Pursuits - the boardgame of the 1980s - is now available on video. For the sports fanatic there is a Sports Editions with some 100 TV clips of memorable sporting moments and questions to match. The Family Edition homes in on questions of a more general nature covering news, entertainment and historical events. Both are Pounds 19.99 from games departments, video shops and departments. Not everybody knows that The Design Museum at Butlers Wharf, London SE1 2YD (Telephone: 071-403-6933) has a shop of its own. Particularly interesting are the reconditioned vintage telephones ranging from Bell's Bakelite Belgian version to the 1970s Ericafon. Prices range from Pounds 32 to Pounds 115. For the home, Colefax and Fowler of 110 Fulham Road, London SW3 6RL (Telephone: 071-244-7427) has a surprisingly reasonably priced range of attractive, modish accessories. A set of three circular tartan boxes is Pounds 18 (plus VAT), a blue and white flower brick is Pounds 29.95, a beautifully turned wooden Tazza is Pounds 48 (plus VAT), a silver metal oval bakeset (it would make a splendid cache-pot) is Pounds 35 and a charming sea-shell picture frame is Pounds 30 (plus VAT).</p>

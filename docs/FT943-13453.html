			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (8): So polite about the past - Asians concentrate on bid for Japanese capital When Asians fret about Japan these days, they are rarely concerned by Japanese atrocities in Asia during World War Two or the tactless denials of Japan's war record by right-wing politicians in Tokyo; they are usually anxious about winning a share of the next round of Japanese investment. Except in China, Korea and occasionally in the Philippines and Singapore - whose peoples suffered most from Japanese imperialism - there is little interest in Japan's tentative efforts to adopt a more assertive foreign policy to match its economic power. Asian governments and businesses from India to the Philippines are more preoccupied by Japan's money and manufacturing skills than its history. This is especially true of south-east Asia. Japanese investment in everything from vehicle assembly to the manufacture of computer disk-drives and air conditioners has been the driving force behind the rapid economic growth of countries such as Thailand and Malaysia since the 1970s. More than 90 per cent of cars in Thailand are Japanese marques, most of them assembled in Thailand. In Malaysia, the factories of the Japanese company Matsushita alone account for about four per cent of the country's gdp. The recent liberalisation of the economies of China, Vietnam and India was therefore regarded with some trepidation in south-east Asia, because it was assumed that these three capital-hungry countries would receive so much Japanese investment that the rest of Asia would be starved of new money. At first the figures appeared to confirmed the hypothesis. Japanese investment at the start of the decade rose sharply in China - Hitachi says six of its nine joint ventures in China were established in the past three years - and fell in some traditional south-east Asian recipient countries. Governments hurried to improve their investment incentives. They need not have worried. The remorseless rise of the yen against the dollar has obliged Japanese companies to move increasingly sophisticated production lines offshore where wages are lower, and the big corporations are being followed by component suppliers which also need to reduce costs to remain competitive. Broadly, investments in China are designed to supply goods to China's huge domestic market or to produce labour-intensive products for export. The various national markets of south-east Asia are also important (especially Indonesia and Thailand), but the purpose of many new Japanese investments there is to produce medium or high-technology products for export to Japan, America and Europe. Mitsubishi Electric, for example, shifted production of its standard line of elevators from Japan to Thailand in 1991. The same company says that since last year it has been producing 90 per cent of its floppy disk drives in Thailand. Last year for the first time Japan imported more colour televisions than it exported; the same is true of other products such as refrigerators. Hitachi is in the process of shifting production of one type of refrigerator compressor from Japan to a new factory in Ayudhya north of Bangkok, and is building a facility in the Philippines to make mini hard disk-drives. But the six members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) - namely Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand  -will have to deal with two potential problems in their partnership with Japanese companies if they are to prosper in the midst of corporate Japan's growing fascination with China and India: the first problem is the slow evolution of the Asean Free Trade Area (Afta), and the second is a dispute over technology transfer. Although the influential Japanese motor industry managed through lengthy negotiations to secure special tariff reductions for car components traded between Asean countries - the so-called 'brand-to-brand complementarity scheme' - Japanese and other manufacturers are often frustrated by the difficulty of establishing integrated operations within Asean. Car component maker Nippondenso, for instance, is in the throes of negotiations with Asean governments; the company wants to specialise in particular products at each of its factories in Asean instead of duplicating its efforts in several different countries. Afta is an attempt to deal with this sort of difficulty, but under the present agreements individual countries can and do undermine free trade principles by excluding numerous products they regard as sensitive from the tariff cuts. Even for products embraced by Afta, tariffs are scheduled to fall to between zero and five per cent only in the year 2008. Economies of scale are therefore not always available in Asean, at least not for the regional market. 'If they want to grow faster they have to give up these nationalistic policies,' says Mr Minoru Tsukada, manager of Asian business development at Hitachi. If Afta succeeds, therefore, Asean members may have to watch Japanese companies close down operations in one country and consolidate their operations in another - a process which has from time to time caused nationalistic outrage in parts of Europe. And if Asean baulks at such rationalisation, Japanese companies can always mention China. Mr Nobuhiro Ogura of Mitsubishi Electric says of the company's television plants in Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore (the Singapore operation is expected to move to neighbouring Johor State in Malaysia): 'Either we still continue to produce in those three locations; or by integrating and increasing the volume we reduce the cost; or we establish a new facility in China and we discontinue those which produce in smaller countries.' As for technology transfer, non-Japanese Asians often accuse Japanese investors of arrogantly refusing to pass modern technology to developing countries or promote enough locals to management posts. This was particularly true of Proton, the Malaysian carmaker in which Mitsubishi Motors has a 15 per cent stake. Japanese businessmen can barely hide their impatience at such accusations, pointing out that technical knowhow takes time to acquire and cannot simply be handed over like a car component. They complain of everything from a lack of trained scientists to unstable electricity supplies. But they acknowledge that they have been slow to move research and development activities into Asia, and are gradually starting to do so now. In spite of Japan's war record in Asia, and in spite of occasional disputes, commercial relations between Japan and the rest of Asia seem to be warmer than ever. A decade ago, Japan exported a third more to the US than to Asia; now it exports a third more to Asia than to the US. US trade officials look to Asia for allies when they argue with Tokyo over Japan's trade surpluses, because, like the US, many Asian countries suffer from severe deficits in their trade with Japan. One reason why the US finds little sympathy in Asia is that Asian exports to Japan are increasing, and many of those exports are Japanese branded products made outside Japan.</p>

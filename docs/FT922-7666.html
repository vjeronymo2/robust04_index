			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Books: Behind the Pine Ridge shoot out IN THE SPIRIT OF CRAZY HORSE by Peter Mathiessen Harvill Pounds 9.99, 646 pages IF YOU think Rodney King got a bum deal, spare a thought for Leonard Peltier. Since 1977, the American Indian activist has been serving a double life sentence for the murder of two FBI agents after having been convicted on the flimsiest of evidence. Unfortunately for Peltier, there was nobody with a camcorder on the scene to show what really happened. On the other hand, he does have Peter Mathiessen, the distinguished writer and traveller, whose In the Spirit of Crazy Horse, now released after nine years of legal wrangling, comprehensively proves that Peltier is the victim of a perversion of justice every bit as cynical as the one that caused the recent rioting in Los Angeles. Peltier is a member of the American Indian Movement (AIM), a radical civil rights organisation set up the 1960s to agitate on behalf of North America's beleaguered native people. After a series of heated confrontations with white authority, most notably occupations of Alcatraz Prison and Wounded Knee, site of the 1890 massacre of innocent Sioux by the US Cavalry, AIM were targeted by the FBI as a subversive organisation on a par with the Black Panthers and the Weather Underground. AIM's activity soon came to be centred on the sprawling Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, home of the Sioux descendants of Crazy Horse, where violence, fuelled by government-sponsored goon squads, had become endemic. The inevitable shoot-out took place in June 1975, leaving two Federal agents and one Indian dead. Although 30 AIM warriors were on the scene when the shooting occurred, only four were charged, and just one, Peltier, was convicted. Even before the prison door rang shut, however, gaping holes in the Government's case became apparent. Ballistics reports had been doctored and denied, prosecution witnesses coached and intimidated - the government never even established that Peltier was on the scene, much less that he was the triggerman. As Mathiessen patiently establishes, it was prejudice and a thirst for revenge, rather than reason and prudence, that put Peltier behind bars. But Mathiessen does more than simply unravel the government's prosecution. He also establishes how the US government, through a policy that vacillated between neglect and hostility, created the murderous atmosphere at Pine Ridge, an atmosphere in which the seemingly cold-blooded execution of two law enforcement officers could be seen as an act of self-defence. The author then shows how the two agents may very well have caused their own death by bursting into an Indian camp in a botched attempt to draw fire, whereupon they could call in the cavalry to finish off AIM. But Mathiessen lays ultimate blame for the whole affair at the feet of the military and industrial interests who saw AIM preventing them from grabbing the rich uranium deposits beneath the Black Hills badlands where the Sioux had been exiled a century earlier. Not surprisingly, Mathiessen's impassioned yet cogent book brought down the ire of the authorities when first released in 1983, inspiring some Dollars 50m worth of libel suits which caused it to be withdrawn from circulation for nearly a decade while the author and his publishers defended themselves in court. Thankfully, Mathiessen kept on the case during the years, coming up with an epilogue that provides what is perhaps the book's most sensational bit of reportage - an interview in 1990 with a hooded, anonymous AIM warrior who admits that it was he, not Peltier, who gunned down the two agents at close range. One of the book's most gratifying elements is the manner by which Mathiessen balances his outrage at the treatment of Peltier and his people with the cold, cool tone of the investigative reporter. He lets everyone have their say, be they drunken goons or dedicated warriors, gung-ho FBI agents or wizened Sioux medicine men. In the end, you are left with the feeling that everybody involved with the shootings at Pine Ridge was a victim of a government engaged in strip-mining not just the land but an entire people's culture. Upon finishing this book, one finds it impossible to believe that Peltier can still be in prison. Perhaps the coming Oliver Stone film based on the book will finally set the man free. And lest British readers feel too smugly critical about the American judicial system as it lies exposed here, they should bear in mind the fact that eight US courts defended Mathiessen's constitutional right to express the opinion that various officials, from the Governor of South Dakota right down to FBI Field agents, behaved like liars, thugs and conspirators. In the British courts, he would have been paying out money to the men who railroaded Peltier until long after the prisoner had finished his term.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Building suppliers provide evidence of recovery Fresh signs that the recovery is spreading across the UK economy emerged yesterday, after building suppliers said an improvement in the housing market had created a surge in the sales of construction materials this spring. Meanwhile, official figures also showed that retail spending remains relatively buoyant in spite of April's tax increases - although hints have emerged that consumers may be becoming more cautious in the way they use credit cards. Shares of building material suppliers rose nearly 3 per cent on the London Stock Exchange yesterday after a 9.05 per cent rise in merchants' sales during the three months to the end of May, compared with the corresponding period last year. The jump was led by a big increase in sales to housebuilders, reflecting the improvement in the housing market earlier this year, according to the Builders Merchants Federation which published the figures. Mr Peter Gill, federation director, said sales had risen by 7.9 per cent over the previous three months, the highest annual increase since 1987. However, he warned: 'Reports from building societies, and some house builders that the pace of the housing recovery is faltering are worrying.' In another sign of economic pick-up, the Central Statistical Office said consumers spent a record Pounds 3.06bn on credit cards in May, pushing the total level of new consumer borrowing to near record levels of Pounds 5.16bn. The level of credit card repayment, however, was also sharply higher, as more consumers sought to settle their credit card debts. Net lending fell sharply during the month to Pounds 203m, down from Pounds 412m in April. This fall disappointed the City, which had expected a figure of about Pounds 350m. But the Treasury pointed out that the underlying trend remained upwards, with net lending in the three months to May higher than in the three months to February. Any disappointment was also offset by a strong June figure for M0 - the narrowest measure of money supply, chiefly notes and coins. This showed it growing by 6.8 per cent last month compared with the previous June. Some analysts suggested the figure indicated that June's retail sales data would be strong. The Treasury pointed out, however, that the recent growth in M0 also reflected the fact that lower interest rates were encouraging consumers to hold more cash.

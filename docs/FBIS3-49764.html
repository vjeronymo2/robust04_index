			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stanislaw Grzymski: "Olechowski and Pawlak Back </F> From Prague; We Can Count on Help"--last paragraph attributed to  P.K.]    [Text] "Poland is now more secure and closer to NATO," said  Foreign Affair Minister Andrzej Olechowski at a press conference  on Thursday [13 January] after having returned from Prague.    Commenting on the talks of the Visegrad Group leaders, the  chief Polish diplomat based his view on the evolution that has  occurred in the concept of the "Partnership for Peace" since it  was first put forward by Bill Clinton.    Minister Olechowski believes that the U.S. "Partnership for  Peace" initiative was enriched by the declaration that NATO will  remain open to the states of Central Europe.    These states were assured that they can count on NATO's help  in crises and that their security is closely related to the  security of NATO. "Partnership for Peace" will also incorporate  Ukraine and Russia into the international security system.    Minister Olechowski claims that "Partnership for Peace" will  enhance Poland's defense capabilities. The proposed program of  military cooperation with NATO will lead to  "interoperationalness" of the armies of NATO and of the states  of Central Europe. In line with this program, Poland will have  access to NATO technology and information, as well as to Western  early-warning systems. Poland will also have the right to hold  consultations with the 16 member states of NATO if its  sovereignty is jeopardized, and the possibility of establishing  joint units with them.    While commenting on the talks in Prague, Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak said that, aside from the "Partnership for  Peace," which offers Poland "political prospects and prospects  of security," we also need a "partnership for development." He  stressed that "economic stability is one of the most important  security factors."    Prime Minister Pawlak stated that the leaders of the Czech  Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia agreed on the need to extend the  political platform of the Visegrad Group to the economic  platform and to establish a formula of "G-4," similar to "G-7,"  the seven richest countries in the world. The Visegrad Group  states will jointly resolve regional problems, intensify their  economic cooperation, and create the appropriate infrastructure.  It is expected that, in April of this year, the liberalization  of trade within the framework of the Central European Free Trade  Zone will be accelerated.    Asked whether the meeting of the presidents of the United  States and the Visegrad Group states was a success, President  Lech Walesa stressed upon his return from Prague that new  concepts are being created that are headed in the right  direction; however, the important thing is the rate of the  transformations: "I take advantage of any good moment; there are  also other strategists, who walk the assigned path step by  step," said the president, emphasizing the role of the mass  media, especially in the West, in explaining Poland's stand on  this issue.</p>

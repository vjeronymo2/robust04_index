			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOME: TOWN RETAINS VESTIGES OF RURAL PAST;  </P> <P> VILLA PARK: ONCE THE SCENE OF CATTLE DRIVES, THIS SMALL ORANGE COUNTY CITY'S  HOMES ARE ON SPACIOUS LOTS, THERE ARE LOTS OF TRAILS AND NO STREET LIGHTS.  </P> <P> A few weeks after moving to Orange County in 1959, a Villa Park resident was  late for an appointment in Tustin because he got into a traffic jam on Santiago  Boulevard. Not cars. Cows.  </P> <P> A few hundred yards off Katella Avenue, cowboys from the Irvine Ranch were  driving several dozen head of cattle from one side of Santiago to the other.  Apparently the grass was greener where million-dollar homes would grow three  decades later.  </P> <P> "Ranches" haven't completely disappeared from Villa Park, although now they are  limited to an acre or so and "cowboys" to the several miles of trails that wind  throughout the city. Now built to 95% capacity of its planned development,  Villa Park still manages to maintain a rather rural ambience.  </P> <P> There are no street lights, no parks, no gas stations, no churches, and only an  occasional stoplight or sidewalk. And that's the way the 7,000 residents of the  2.1-square-mile city like it.  </P> <P> "Oh, the street lights throw people at first," said Lesslie Giacobbi) of Seven  Gables Real Estate, who has lived in the city since 1978. "They're all up in  arms, ready to take the city to task. And then they realize that lights would  ruin the country atmosphere."  </P> <P> For all it may lack in urban amenities, life in Villa Park is hardly roughing  it.  </P> <P> The homes range from comfortable to the absolutely massive, and they are set on  lots of a minimum of one-half acre throughout most of the city. The standard  back-yard swimming pool is often augmented by stables, corrals, guest houses or  tennis courts.  </P> <P> Homes are a mix of ubiquitous rambling one-story ranch styles, and in the newer  sections, imposing French Country styles are shoulder to shoulder with Cape Cod  and Mediterranean facades.  </P> <P> "It certainly is diverse, not the cookie-cutter look you might find in other  communities," Giacobbi said.  </P> <P> And all this atmosphere doesn't come cheap. According to Giacobbi, the median  home price is $682,000, several hundred thousand above most Orange County  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "It is difficult to compare Villa Park to other cities because there are no  condominiums or town homes, only single-family detached homes on very large  lots," Giacobbi said.  </P> <P> At the low end of the market, buyers can find a home in the "buffer zone" of  10,000-square-foot lots near the city's southwest border for $335,000. For that  money, a purchaser may get a 20-year-old, five-bedroom, three-bath house with a  little more than 2,000 square feet.  </P> <P> By contrast, a buyer in the more prestigious northern part of Villa Park could  spend close to $4 million on a new 10,000-square-foot mansion with a view  stretching to the ocean and Catalina Island.  </P> <P> Another alternative that is increasing in popularity is tearing down older,  smaller homes (that are often on the largest lots) and subdividing the property  for two or more homes. A tiny house on one acre with a view could go for  $600,000.  </P> <P> Recent efforts by developers to rezone to a higher density some of the  buildable parcels left in Villa Park was met with vocal opposition by  homeowners. In fact, zoning was the catalyst in the city's incorporation a  little more than a quarter-century ago.  </P> <P> With the housing boom of the late 1950s, the city of Orange began annexing  parcels of the Villa Park area and allowing much denser building than the  area's traditional 1.5 homes per acre minimum. Voters approved incorporation in  1962, making it Orange County's 24th and smallest city.  </P> <P> Instead of discouraging growth as residents had hoped, the zoning appealed to  developers who began tearing down orchards of oranges and avocados to build  tracts of homes. Some older residents didn't adapt to the newcomers easily.  </P> <P> "I remember one City Council meeting in particular, when we were discussing the  building of the city hall, one gentleman called us carpetbaggers," said  Catherine Wells, a resident since 1968.  </P> <P> For all its wealth (the median household income is nearly $10,000 higher than  the county average) Villa Park maintains a relatively low profile. Situated in  northern Orange County, Villa Park is completely surrounded by the city of  Orange.  </P> <P> "People have usually heard of us, they're just not sure exactly where we are,"  laughed Craig Ota, who moved to Villa Park with his wife, Margaret, and three  daughters in 1976.  </P> <P> Once people find Villa Park they seem to stay there quite a while. "Many  residents are doing major remodeling, sometimes involving hundreds of thousands  of dollars, instead of moving, especially since it would be hard to  'over-improve' for this area," Giacobbi said.  </P> <P> Margaret Ota estimates that nearly half of their neighbors who moved in at the  same time she did are still there. After looking around at other communities,  particularly south Orange County, the Otas decided to forgo moving for  remodeling.  </P> <P> "Why move? We would be paying more money for less house and less land," she  said.  </P> <P> Also driving home prices up is Villa Park's centralized location. For all its  rural charm, the city is just five minutes from the Newport-Costa Mesa Freeway.  "You have to watch the clock and avoid the peak times, but it's usually pretty  easy to get around," Craig Ota said.  </P> <P> Which is a good thing, since Villa Park has no movie theaters or restaurants.  In fact, the city's only shopping center features a grocery store, a variety of  small shops, city hall and a library.  </P> <P> "It is interesting to note, however, that our shopping center has four banks,"  Giacobbi said.  </P> <P> Aside from the obvious expense of buying a home there, residents find little to  complain about in their community. The crime rate is the lowest in the county,  according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department, with just 35 burglaries so  far this year.  </P> <P> The Otas say Villa Park is a close-knit neighborhood, where people work  together to maintain the small-town ambience. And they rave about the country  flavor the city has managed to preserve, and the bobcats, raccoons and rabbits  that occasionally wander their property.  </P> <P> "It would be nice to have a golf or tennis club nearby, but now the land is  worth so much, it's out of the question," Craig Ota said.  </P> <P> The Otas, who previously lived in Huntington Beach, bought in a small tract of  customized homes in the hilly, northern part of the city. Ota, a dentist,  estimates that their 4,000-square-foot home on about 1 1/2 acres has tripled in  value since they purchased it.  </P> <P> Catherine Wells and her family bought a house on Jacotal Street in 1968 because  they liked the large lots and the "wall-to-wall kids."  </P> <P> "With four schools within walking distance of the house, it was a dream come  true for a station wagon refugee," Wells said.  </P> <P> Wells, who serves as the city's historian, reminisces about the days you could  drive through Villa Park and enjoy the sweet fragrance of acres of orange  trees, which was the area's major crop for almost 60 years. It was the citrus  growers who molded Villa Park into a vital community and organized its  incorporation.  </P> <P> Does the city's growth and the impending development of the wide open spaces  east of Villa Park bother her? "That's progress," she said.  </P> <P> Ron Accornero of North Hills Realty was so taken with Villa Park 10 years ago  that he changed careers to stay there. "It was a gradual thing, but one of the  reasons I left the air-freight business and went into real estate was so that I  could live here," Accornero said. He raves about the large setbacks from the  street, a minimum of 30 feet, and the privacy large lots afford. But what keeps  him in Villa Park, he says, are the people.  </P> <P> "When my wife passed away three months ago, people were so caring," he said.  "The outpouring of cards and flowers really touched me. My neighbors are still  bringing food over. You can't buy friendship or community spirit like that."  </P> <P> AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> 1989 estimate: 6,961  </P> <P> 1980-89 change: -2.5%  </P> <P> Median age: 30.8 years  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix  </P> <P> White (non-Latino) 88.0%  </P> <P> Latino: 5.3%  </P> <P> Black: 0.3%  </P> <P> Other: 6.4%  </P> <P> Annual income  </P> <P> Per capita: $26,223  </P> <P> Median household: $78,715  </P> <P> Household distribution  </P> <P> Less than $15,000: 4.5%  </P> <P> $15,000 - $30,000: 5.4%  </P> <P> $30,000 - $50,000: 14.4%  </P> <P> $50,000 - $75,000: 22.7%  </P> <P> $75,000 + 53.1%  </P></p>

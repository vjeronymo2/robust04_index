			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Political commentary: "The U.S. Troops' Nightmare!"] </F>   [Text] The downing of two UN helicopters in northern Iraq  -- said to have been shot down by U.S. fighter planes by mistake  -- resulted in the killing of 26 high-level officers of the  allied forces.    This incident has raised questions regarding the U.S.  military command and their troops who have the most advanced  tracking and identification equipment.    The lack of motivation and interest in military operations,  and the disordered state of U.S. soldiers in other parts of the  world are among the causes of such incidents.    The U.S. forces have the most advanced equipment at their  disposal but they are becoming weaker by the day. These  disasters can be attributed to the Somalia crisis and the  Persian Gulf war. At present U.S. military capability in various  operations all over the world is being questioned, and Pentagon  officials have to respond to official inquiries into such  disasters.    The incompetence of the U.S. forces becomes clearer when  such  incidents occur and this will certainly have an adverse impact  on military relations between the United States and its allied  countries.    The U.S. allies should review their military relations with  Washington as a matter of course, especially if they wish to  eliminate, or at least reduce, such incidents. U.S. military  officials are also under pressure from their own people, who do  not wish to see their offspring killed for the ideas of these  officials.    In any case, in view of the increasing U.S. military  intervention around the world, the frequency of such incidents  will increase proportionately. Such incidents are possible in  every part of the world where the U.S. troops are deployed.</p>

According to this source, diGenova is to verify reports  claiming that the Czechoslovak secret service provided the  election staff of former President George Bush with information  discrediting his then election rival, Bill Clinton.    The U.S. investigator is mostly interested in the illegal  search for information in President Bill Clinton's travel  documents. Clinton came for a visit as a student in the 1970's.  The former Czechoslovak authorities allegedly provided Bush's  election team with, among other things, the report that Bill  Clinton's sojourn in Prague has not been registered with the  police. This information has then been correlated to the  never-confirmed link between Clinton and the Soviet secret  service KGB. Marek Skolil, director of the Press Department of  the Foreign Ministry has so far refused to comment on the visit  of the U.S. investigator.</p>

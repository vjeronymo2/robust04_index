			<p>BFN     [Text] European Parliament [EP] President Egon Klepsch has  stated that the EP supports the European Union [EU] expansion  through the accession of Cyprus and Malta, and that he will also  support this position at the Corfu Summit conference to be held  in June. Klepsch stressed: We must exert every effort toward  finding a peaceful Cyprus solution. It would be an honor for  whomever achieves this goal.    Klepsch, who is on a two-day official visit to Cyprus, made  this statement after meeting with House of Representatives  President Alexis Galanos this morning.    The House of Representatives president said Klepsch's visit  stresses the EP decision and collective desire to support  Cyprus' efforts for its accession to the EU. Galanos noted: The  most substantive message to the Turkish side so that it may sit  at the talks with the political will to find a solution is for  the talks on Cyprus' accession to the EU to begin in January  1995. Galanos said he was satisfied with Klepsch's moral support  in these difficult times.    The EP president also met with party leaders and  representatives today. Now he is in a meeting with President  Glavkos Kliridhis.</p>

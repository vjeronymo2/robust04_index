Or is it really  a continuation of the methods employed so far?    This is the diagnosis that the participants of a seminar  organized by the Economic Sciences Institute of the Polish  Academy of Sciences tried to make.    According to Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, who participated in  the seminar, the weakness of the ownership transformation  processes carried out so far has been the lack of a  privatization strategy, linking it to the economic policy, lack  of the criteria for the evaluation of the transformations, and  analyses of their effects. The founders' supervision over the  partnerships was insufficient; however, these shortcomings are  not being eliminated. There are still difficulties in  communicating with trade unions. Privatization with the  participation of private individuals acting as strategic  investors was also not always successful. Motivation for  privatization is still only passive (the desire to escape  dividends and the popiwek--tax on excessive wage increases--or  the managers' desire to maintain a "row of souls" in the  enterprise). The characteristic feature of Polish ownership  transformations is also the modest participation of capital  privatization; employee's privatization is dominating, which  large enterprises advised against. In the past, the ownership  laws were not set in order; it concerns reprivatization and  cooperative property.    Minister Kaczmarek wants to continue employing the  privatization techniques that have been used so far; however, at  the same time, along with other ministries, he intends to draw  up a "privatization map." The map will show strategic areas, in  which the Treasury will maintain most of the shares, and the  other areas, which will not be limited in ownership  transformations. Privatization procedures will be set in order.  It is also planned that a dormant path of privatization--that  is, auctions--will be established. The minister believes that  most of the property that could be sold at once was actually  sold; the rest of the enterprises need restructuring before this  could be done. This is supposed to be achieved through the  program of National Investment Funds, EFSAL [expansion unknown]  and the SRP [expansion unknown], financed by the European Bank  for Reconstruction and Development and the European Community.    The scientists participating in the seminar focused first on  remarks concerning the transformations that have been made so  far, as well as on conclusions concerning the future. According  to Barbara Blaszczyk, in the "Directions of Privatization" for  1994, too many priorities were adopted; therefore, it will be  difficult to implement all of them. So far, the employees'  privatization, powered by the initiative "from below," has been  the quickest; therefore, the "Pact on State Enterprise"  unnecessarily imposes on enterprises a six-month period for  selecting a privatization path. The employees of large and good  enterprises--for example, those that are sent to the Stock  Exchange--gain too much in privatization. In comparison with  other countries, the overall balance sheet of privatization  looks good; it is just a pity that some partnerships have become  stuck in the intermediate stage.    According to Tadeusz Kowalik, the tensions concerning  privatization need to be lessened; however, he does not know  whether the minister will manage to achieve this. Privatization  should be accelerated, but this process must be healthier than  it has been so far.    According to Anna Fornalczyk, privatization depended on  politics, it still does, and it will continue to depend on it;  however, efforts will have to be made to eliminate it. In  Poland, there is still not enough evaluation of privatization  results; therefore, continuous monitoring [preceding word in  English] must be established. Maria Jarosz believes that  employees' partnerships should be looked upon as a transitional  form; she adds that they should be allowed to look for capital  and to concentrate on property.    Zofia Dobska fears that partial privatization--where the  Treasury keeps some of the shares--is not being employed as much  as it should be. In the meantime, as a result of the recession,  which is felt not only in Poland, the prices that are arrived at  in transactions are not really satisfactory. The lack of foreign  capital should be explained by the fact that, in recent years,  privatization in the postsocialist states has amounted to merely  5 percent of the global ownership transformations; 25 percent in  Third World countries and 75 percent in developed countries [as  published].    While answering questions, Minister Kaczmarek mentioned the  possibility of supporting privatization through the emission of  obligations, which could be converted into ownership titles, and  the establishment of a system of credit pledges guaranteed by  the state.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Observer: Liquid liability Dreams, unlike razors, cannot be sold cheap. That's the lesson perfume connoisseurs are drawing from the decision by Bic - the French throwaway-lighters, razors and ball-pen specialist - to ditch its latest disposable gadget, the ultra-cheap perfume. Baron Marcel Bich, the company's 76-year-old chairman and founder, launched his range of quick-shot perfumes three years ago in an attempt to repeat the success of his other products by democratising posh scents. The four Bic perfumes, at FFr20 to FFr25 for a plain glass phial in your local supermarket, allowed women - and men - to buy a whiff of class for less than a book of metro tickets. 'Puts Paris in your pocket,' was Bic's US advertising slogan. However, the idea failed to live up to Bic's expectations. Its perfume division continued to exude losses as sales stubbornly stagnated despite heavy advertising. After a final attempt at a perfume relaunch, the Baron was reluctantly obliged to throw in the sponge. The moral of this story is that scents do not sell on mere price. What is needed is a luxury image, ideally linked to an haute couture designer, even if few customers can actually afford the clothes that live up to the bouquet. 'To separate perfumes from the world of dreams - that would have been a revolution,' concluded one sweet-smelling expert yesterday.</p>

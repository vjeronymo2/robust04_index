Bujak, addressing the committee meeting, argued that the  transformation of the Vistula region troops into, as he put it,  a presidential guard, would be "a dangerous shift on the  political arena." He said that such a military unit may be  "equally efficient in averting as well as in carrying out a coup  d'etat." Bujak expressed the opinion that any kind of  one-person control of a concrete political force over the  Vistula troops poses a "threat of their misuse." A further  discussion of committee members was held behind closed doors.    A draft law prepared by the National Security Bureau at the  Presidential Chancellery and approved by the National Defence  Committee last year, provided for the transformation of the  Vistula troops into a national guard subordinate to the  president. The idea caused much controversy, including protests  from deputies and members of the parliamentary national defence  committee.    Among tasks of the elite unit is the protection of 36  government buildings and 130 foreign diplomatic missions in  Poland and Polish diplomatic and consular missions in 16 states.    At present the unit, with 12,000 soldiers and civilian  employees, is subordinate to the minister of internal affairs.</p>

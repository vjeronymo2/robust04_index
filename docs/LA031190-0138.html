			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOLLEK BLAMES BUSH FOR CITY'S TENSION  </P> <P> Mayor Teddy Kollek on Saturday blamed recent statements by President Bush for  raising tensions in the city.  </P> <P> Both Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III said in the last 10 days  that Israel's policy of settling Jews in the occupied lands, including Arab  East Jerusalem, is an impediment to peace.  </P> <P> Kollek called Bush's remarks untimely and unjustified.  </P> <P> "I feel offended by the lack of knowledge about what is going on here on the  part of very important people who are our friends (but) who have no idea what's  happening," the mayor said on Israel Radio.  </P></p>

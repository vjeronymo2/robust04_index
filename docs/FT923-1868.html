			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Sudan ceasefire 'very soon': Lonrho chief optimistic after a week of shuttle diplomacy A CEASEFIRE in Sudan's civil war will be negotiated 'very soon', Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive of the international conglomerate Lonrho, said yesterday. Mr Rowland, in an interview, described a hectic week of shuttle diplomacy, which has taken him from a further round of Mozambique peace talks in Botswana to southern Sudan for lunch with rebel leader John Garang. Mr Rowland, whose company's African interests include investments in Sudan and Mozambique, was speaking in Nairobi before flying to Khartoum for a private meeting with President Omar Hassan Ahmed el Bashir, the country's military leader. Mr Rowland disclosed that he and Mr Mark Too, deputy chairman of Lonrho East Africa, flew into southern Sudan last Thursday for talks with Mr Garang, leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). He had left with a message from Mr Garang to President Bashir, and expected his efforts to result in the first face to face meeting between the two sides. This would 'very soon' lead to a ceasefire in the conflict which has cost hundreds of thousands of lives: 'I have been at this for eight years and this one is going to be settled soon,' said Mr Rowland. He and Mr Too plan to return from Khartoum to Nairobi today and fly back into southern Sudan for further talks with Mr Garang and Mr Lam Akol, the leader of a second rebel faction. Mr Rowland, who has assumed the mantle of broker in two of Africa's most devastating civil wars, was also optimistic about last month's peace agreement between the Mozambique government and Renamo rebel movement. It was 'absolutely solid', he said. The first stage of the peace accord was signed at a ceremony in Rome last month, attended by Mr Rowland. He has continued to act behind the scenes, and his arrival in Nairobi on Saturday night followed his participation at a meeting between Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano and Renamo leader Alfonso Dhlakama in Gaborone, capital of Botswana. The meeting has resolved the last remaining obstacles to a ceasefire - the formation of a national army composed of both Renamo and government troops, and the role of the intelligence service during the transition to multi-party elections next year. Mr Vincent Zacarias Uluzu, general secretary of Renamo, said the two sides agreed to restructure the intelligence service and police force. Mr Rowland said a formal ceasefire agreement would be signed on October 1 in either Gaborone or Harare.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> FEW VIET EXILES FIND U.S.RICHES;  </P> <P> REFUGEES HAVE FORGED AN ENDURING STEREOTYPE OF ECONOMIC AND INTELLECTUAL  OVERACHIEVEMENT. BUT MOST LIVE IN POVERTY, WITH SIGNIFICANT LANGUAGE AND  CULTURAL HANDICAPS.NIGHTMARE ON RIVERSIDE FREEWAY;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC: WITH THE GROWTH OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY BEYOND ALL EXPECTATIONS, OFFICIALS  ARE SEEKING SOLUTIONS TO THE BUMPER-TO-BUMPER COMMUTER BOTTLENECKS.  </P> <P> Almost 10 years ago, a new eight-lane stretch of the Riverside Freeway opened,  bringing relief to Orange County residents making their way through Santa Ana  Canyon into the Inland Empire.  </P> <P> Where drivers once had to maneuver along a narrow, winding highway, the freeway  opening meant motorists could go from Anaheim Hills to Corona and on to Palm  Springs and Las Vegas in record time.  </P> <P> But what was once hailed as a solution to gridlock has turned into one of the  region's worst nightmares. With the growth of Riverside County beyond anyone's  expectations, the corridor, within the past five years, has once again become a  bottleneck. And this time, transportation officials in both counties doubt the  problem has an easy solution.  </P> <P> Every weekday starting at 4 a.m., commuters heading to jobs in Orange County  often travel bumper to bumper along the freeway, with traffic jams at times  extending from Corona to the Costa Mesa Freeway.  </P> <P> These same commuters -- many of whom moved to Riverside County seeking  affordable housing -- face the same gridlock coming home when eastbound traffic  backs up for miles. In all, more than 200,000 vehicles pass through the  corridor every day, and the volume is only getting worse.  </P> <P> "This is not the worst freeway in Southern California, but it's getting there,"  said Min-Der Day, a civil traffic engineer for the city of Corona.  </P> <P> While potential solutions, ranging from connector roads and parallel routes to  commuter rails and double-decked freeways, are being proposed, all remain in  the planning stages.  </P> <P> For now, Riverside and Orange county officials are pinning their hopes on the  construction of car-pool lanes, one in each direction, that would stretch from  Magnolia Avenue in Riverside to the Orange Freeway.  </P> <P> Riverside County will fund most of its portion of the project with money  generated from a countywide half-cent sales tax passed last year. Construction  is expected to begin in January.  </P> <P> But Orange County still has no funding, and transportation experts warn that if  lanes are built only in Riverside County, the situation won't be much better  because traffic will simply become snarled at the county line.  </P> <P> Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation  Commission, suggested that Riverside County lend Orange County money so the new  lanes could be built at the same time.  </P> <P> But Jack Reagan, the executive director of the Riverside County Transportation  Commission, said he doubts the board would approve such a request.  </P> <P> "There's no way we could spend our highway money for a project in another  county," Reagan said.  </P> <P> And even with the car-pool lanes, officials worry that it is too little, too  late.  </P> <P> "It's a start, but it's not going to meet the demand for the next 20 years,"  Day said. "It doesn't matter how big the roadway is, it's not enough. One  accident is going to stop all the traffic."  </P> <P> Jim Bradley, the executive vice president of the Corona Chamber of Commerce,  predicted that within two or three years after the lanes open, traffic will  once again come to a halt because of the heavy growth in the area.  </P> <P> Corona officials say the solution rests in diverting traffic away from Corona.  They are anxious to do something about the heavy traffic on local streets  caused by thousands of commuters who cut through Corona to avoid the Riverside  Freeway.  </P> <P> "People make a parking lot out of our city," Bradley said.  </P> <P> Corona officials are among the most vocal advocates of an alternative, parallel  route to the Riverside Freeway that would go through the Cleveland National  Forest. The route, called the Cajalco corridor, would link on the east with the  existing two-lane Cajalco Road between the Corona Freeway and the Escondido  Expressway, and on the west with the proposed Foothill or Eastern toll road in  Orange County.  </P> <P> The Riverside County Transportation Commission has commissioned a $285,000  study of the corridor, Reagan said. The cost of the project, if it ever is  built, could exceed $500 million, he said.  </P> <P> But Orange County officials say that any such road is bound to run into  environmental opposition.  </P> <P> "It illustrates the desperation Riverside folks are feeling to find an  alternate route," Oftelie said. He added that OCTC has been unable to widen the  Ortega Highway, an existing route through the same forest, because of  environmental concerns.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Orange County officials are studying the idea of a commuter train  that would link the two counties along existing track that runs parallel to the  freeway, said Kia Mortazavi, the manager of highway programs with OCTC. The  project could be partially funded with revenue generated from the state gas-tax  initiative, he said.  </P> <P> But what could ultimately alter the traffic flow is a gradual shift in jobs to  Riverside County.  </P> <P> "(Employees) can't work well when they're blown away in their fatigue," Reagan  said. "It's going to happen. We just want it to happen quicker."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposed Riverside Freeway Solutions  </P> <P> 1. Addition of a car-pool lane in each direction from the Orange Freeway to  Magnolia Avenue in Riverside.  </P> <P> 2. Commuter train on existing Santa Fe rail track.  </P> <P> 3. /4. Corona expressway connector road through Tonner and Soquel canyons.  </P> <P> 5. Cajaico Expressway through Cleveland National Forest.  </P> <P> 6. Proposed Foothill toll road.  </P></p>

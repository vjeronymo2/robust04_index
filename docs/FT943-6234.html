			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Paris opera chief's entry barred Mr Myung Wung Chung, the Korean conductor who is fighting his dismissal as artistic director of Opera de Paris, yesterday was physically barred from entering the Bastille opera house by Mr Jean-Paul Cluzel, the director. Opera de Paris fired Mr Chung two weeks ago after fruitless negotiations over his contract. However, Mr Chung won an important battle in his legal campaign against his dismissal on Monday when a Paris judge ruled that he should be reinstated until his case had been heard. The judge also ruled that Opera de Paris would not be allowed to appoint other conductors for productions originally to be directed by Mr Chung. The Opera de Paris management refused to reinstate Mr Chung and to admit him when he arrived at the Bastille yesterday for a rehearsal of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, which is due to open the Bastille's autumn season on September 19. Members of the orchestra said they would strike in protest if Simon Boccanegra went ahead without Mr Chung.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORIOLES KEEP THEIR SPELL ON ANGELS;  </P> <P> PITCHING COLLAPSE PERPETUATES SKID IN MEMORIAL STADIUM  </P> <P> It had to happen sooner or later.  </P> <P> The Angel pitching staff, proud owners of the best earned-run average (2.69)  and the fewest number of walks (61) in the American League before Tuesday, saw  the magic of April evaporate during their first outing of May.  </P> <P> Angel pitchers took a walk on the wild side Tuesday night, sending 10 Orioles  to first via the base on balls -- including five in the seventh inning -- as  the Orioles came from behind to beat the Angels, 4-3, before 17,688 in Memorial  Stadium.  </P> <P> The Angels led, 3-1, when starter Chuck Finley walked Billy Ripken and Brady  Anderson with one out in the seventh. Then came reliever Greg Minton, who got  Phil Bradley to fly out to center on his first pitch.  </P> <P> Minton threw 13 more pitches, 12 of which were balls, one of which was a wild  pitch. And the Angels, who are 13-0 when leading after seven innings, let one  get away.  </P> <P> "(Catcher Lance) Parrish came out to the mound and said, 'The ball's moving  great, just throw strikes,"' Minton said, managing a smile. "I thought, 'Good  idea, Lance, but I'm not trying to bounce these to the backstop.'  </P> <P> "I'll take the blame for this one. The whole game hinged on a few outs and I  didn't get them."  </P> <P> By the time Bob McClure came to the mound, the score was tied and the Orioles  still didn't have a hit in the inning. McClure got the final out of the seventh  and Willie Fraser worked a 1-2-3 eighth. But Fraser gave up a leadoff double to  Anderson in the ninth and, a sacrifice bunt and sacrifice fly later, the  Orioles were alone atop the AL East standings.  </P> <P> "Greg didn't miss by that much, but the bottom line is (the calls) went the  other way," Manager Doug Rader said. "As well as he's pitched for us this year,  I certainly hope no one is overly critical of him."  </P> <P> Minton, whose nickname is Moon Man, acknowledged that he fell into a crater  this time, but he has been getting the key outs all season. He had allowed a  run in only two of his first nine appearances and last night's was the first  save opportunity he has blown.  </P> <P> "Everything was low," Minton said. "After the first few balls, I started  thinking, 'I've got to get this one up.' Then I thought, 'Wait a minute, I  can't throw a high sinker.  </P> <P> "The Moonie just vapor-locked this time."  </P> <P> For the first 6 1/2 innings, the Angel machine appeared to be running as  smoothly as it has all season. Finley struggled a bit, but had given up six  hits and only one run when Billy Ripken singled to left, Anderson walked and  Bradley singled to score Ripken in the fifth.  </P> <P> The sweet music of April then struck a sour chord when the Angel pitchers  couldn't find the strike zone. They walked seven Orioles in the last three  innings, including two intentional walks to load the bases with one out in the  ninth.  </P> <P> That's when pinch-hitter Jim Traber, after fouling off a half dozen pitches,  hit a fly ball to the warning track in right. But Anderson wasn't able to trot  home with the winning run. Rookie right fielder Dante Bichette, who had thrown  out Larry Sheets trying for a double and almost got the speedy Anderson in the  same situation in the ninth, cranked up and fired the ball over Parrish's head  at the plate.  </P> <P> Gregg Olson, who pitched two innings in relief of starter Jose Bautista, got  the victory for Baltimore.  </P> <P> "Traber's at-bat was one of the better at-bats of the season," Oriole Manager  Frank Robinson said. "There were three key plays in this game -- Anderson's  double, Bradley's sacrifice and Traber's fly ball."  </P> <P> Rader, however, pointed to the Angels' inability to keep Billy Ripken, who had  two walks and a single, and Anderson, who had two walks and a double, off base.  </P> <P> "The difference in this game was we couldn't get out the No. 9 hitter (Billy  Ripken) and the No. 1 hitter (Anderson)," Rader said. "That's the ballgame."  </P> <P> The Angels went ahead, 2-0, in the fourth inning when Wally Joyner and Johnny  Ray found a spot on the right-field wall to their liking. Joyner missed a home  run by about two feet -- in two directions -- with a drive that hit next to the  360 sign on the 14-foot high wall.  </P> <P> Two feet higher and it would have been over the fence; two feet more toward  center and it would have hit the yellow area that designates a home run where  the outfield fence veers away from the wall.  </P> <P> Joyner had to settle for a double, but he scored in a hurry when Ray followed  with a slightly shorter shot that cleared the glove of a leaping Mike Devereaux  and bounced off the wall for a triple. Ray scored on Devon White's single to  right.  </P> <P> The Orioles cut the lead to two in the fifth, but Brian Downing, leading off  the sixth, hit his fourth homer of the year.  </P> <P> "We could have easily won this one," Finley said. "When Brian hit the homer, we  should have won it. But it all comes back to those walks. Like they say, walks  will haunt you."  </P> <P> The Angels, who haven't won a season series in Memorial Stadium since 1978,  always seem to find a weird way to lose in this park.  </P> <P> This time, it was the spectre of the base on balls that scared up another  Oriole victory.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Outfielder Claudell Washington flew home to Orinda, Calif. before Tuesday's  game to be with his 15-year-old daughter, Camille, who was hospitalized after a  household accident Tuesday afternoon. Washington departed in a rush and club  officials had only sketchy details. . . . Right-hander Rich Monteleone, who was  recalled from triple-A affiliate Edmonton on Monday, was 1-3 with a 3.82  earned-run average, but the Trappers were shut out in his three losses. "I was  pleased with the way I was pitching," Monteleone said. "I was in a groove as  far as what I wanted to do with the ball." Monteleone acknowledged that he was  surprised to be called up, especially considering the way the Angel pitching  staff has performed. "It's not like they need pitching, the bullpen hasn't had  much work," Monteleone said. "I'm just happy to be here, though."  </P> <P> The question now is whether Monteleone will remain with the Angels when  shortstop Dick Schofield, on the disabled list because of a minor tear of a  chest muscle, returns. Trainer Rick Smith said Schofield should be ready for  the four-game series against the Blue Jays that begins Thursday in Toronto. "I  hope I'm not just here for a couple of days," Monteleone said. Manager Doug  Rader isn't ready to announce a decision, but he opened the season with an  11-man staff and said Tuesday that Monteleone was brought up and second baseman  Mark McLemore was sent down to "protect" the pitching. "Our pitching has put us  where we are," Rader said, "and I feel working with your strengths is a better  way to go than attempting to shore up your weaknesses."  </P> <P> Tony Armas continues to feel tightness in his strained left hamstring when he  runs and the Angels are taking no chances with the 35-year-old outfielder. "I  think it's still going to be 10 days to two weeks," Smith said. "He's had  problems with his legs before and we don't want 3 1/2 weeks of therapy to go  down the drain because we tried to get him back one or two days early."  </P></p>

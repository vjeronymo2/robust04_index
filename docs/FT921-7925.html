			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / A cautionary tale of banking in Spain: The fall from investment glamour of Ibercorp Twenty-five years ago, when Mr Manuel de la Concha, former president of the Madrid stock exchange, was a mere agente de bolsa, or stock market notary, one of the people who entrusted an investment portfolio to him was his good friend Mr Mariano Rubio, now the governor of the Bank of Spain. He must now be wishing he had not. For Mr de la Concha's story has become a cautionary tale of modern Spain and threatens the credibility of a chunk of Spanish investment banking. Taking advantage of the economic good times after Spain joined the European Community in 1986 and a rush of Spanish brokers and bankers into new financial services, Mr de la Concha and his partner, Mr Jaime Soto, built their Ibercorp group into the most glamorous of the small new investment banking conglomerates. By last year, Ibercorp's clients had placed some Pta21bn (Pounds 116.3m) under its management, ranking the group's bank among the country's top 20 in that category. Ibercorp was one of the first of the new boutiques which marketed themselves as personal fund managers and pioneered a Spanish twist to the mergers and acquisitions strategies they were learning from bigger competitors. The small Spanish financial groups - especially after the liberalisation of the stock markets in 1989 made it clear there would not be much margin in straight broking - began to buy weak investment targets and restructure them before floating them off or selling them directly to foreign buyers. This worked well but then the Gulf crisis throttled the stock market. Ibercorp bought and tried to float a metal shelving company but had to sell it back to its original owner in late 1990. Earlier, it had bought an office furniture group, Sistemas AF, turned it around and then sold off the assets, keeping the holding company for itself. Some of the money Mr Rubio had lodged with Ibercorp was invested in this rump, now renamed Sistemas Financieros. In spring of 1990, its stock came under heavy selling pressure, with one of the big buyers being the company itself, which accumulated heavy treasury stocks. Soon after, the shares collapsed. Among the shares bought back at good prices by Sistemas Financieros, were Mr Rubio's, along with some other public figures. They are now being accused by the press of receiving favoured treatment from Sistemas Financieros while other shareholders were left to take losses. Mr Rubio is in considerable trouble, especially as his second term of office ends this summer. He confirmed that last Monday he offered his resignation to the finance minister but was told to stay on. His going would be a pity, because he has skilfully presided over the liberalisation in Spanish banking. Mr Rubio's total portfolio is worth only Dollars 120,000 (Pounds 68,400). 'I never paid any attention to my portfolio,' he said yesterday. 'I had always said that if I needed to know something about the portfolio I would ask.' Mr Rubio is to appear before a parliamentary commission today to answer questions on the affair. Mr Rubio's real problem, it seems, was in leaving his portfolio with Ibercorp in the first place and that Mr de la Concha invested it in a company he controlled. As the Spanish stock market has slumped, it has become clear that many of the small financial services groups created in the past four years simply do not have the the capital with which to cushion themselves against hard times. The Bank of Spain, which has handed out banking licences to boutiques since 1986, got its first taste of trouble last year when Banco Europeo de Finanzas, the head of a mini financial services conglomerate, found itself unable to meet a Pta17bn obligation in the interbank market. The bank was sold off to its creditors. The BEF saga frightened larger Spanish banks into freezing interbank business with the boutiques and Mr Rubio was forced to set aside about Pta40bn to ensure that others did not get into similar trouble. 'For a while we simply stopped lending to small banks,' says a senior Madrid banker. Spain's banking crisis of the early 1980s, in which about 40 banks had to be rescued, still jangles nerves. Every time a niche opens in Spain - the latest is unit trusts - the boutiques and their larger foreign and domestic competitors have rushed to fill it. 'In the good times,' says the governor, 'everyone wants to do the same things.' But as the scope of the boutique business has spread, so have Mr Rubio's nerves been stretched. Earlier this year, the finance ministry and the Bank of Spain took the unusual step of declaring that no bank would be allowed to go to the wall. Now, as some small banks report tight conditions on the interbank market, the Bank of Spain is again offering to help with liquidity. 'The other small banks will have time to deal with any problems,' Mr Rubio promises, but conceded that the scandal surrounding Ibercorp was creating problems for the bank. Not only is Ibercorp being accused of favouring powerful clients but when the stock market commission began investigating the share sales by Sistemas Financieros, Mr de la Concha inexplicably altered the names of some of the sellers - Mr Rubio became 'M Jimenez', Jimenez being his mother's name. The media assumed he was trying to disguise the names. This is dynamite in a country concerned about its international image as a cliquey, corrupt and impenetrable place of business. It has also become clear that an audit by Arthur Andersen of the Ibercorp group stated its 1990 losses were some Pta2.5bn higher than the Pta473m group loss Ibercorp had publicly declared. Ibercorp is now up for sale. The Bank of Spain has offered it, in vain, to almost all of Spain's large commercial banks. 'We have always done this sort of thing when banks get into trouble,' Mr Rubio said, but 'this is not a very good year for banking. The market is very competitive.' He said there was 'some optimism' that a buyer could be found 'but it is not certain'. Ibercorp, he said, would normally easily survive, but constant attacks in the press 'can create problems for any institution'. Investors have withdrawn about Dollars 11m from Ibercorp's managed investment trusts - about a third of its unit trust portfolio - since late last week. If Ibercorp fails, so could Spain's experiment with specialised investment banking. And Mr Rubio's position as chief regulator could become untenable.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IBERCORP - UNCONSOLIDATED GROUP RESULTS (PTA MILLIONS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1990                   1989                          Declared    Audited    Declared    Audited                        Result (net)*  Result**   Result      Result  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banco Ibercorp              140         162        73          51 Grupo Financiero Ibercorp   265        -669         -           - Sistemas Financieros        789         -88         -           - Ibercorp Bolsa             -137           -        31          31 Ibercorp Financiacion    -1,076      -1,351      -335        -504 Ibercorp Leasing           -417        -767      -469        -519 Sistemas y Desarrollos  Inmobiliarios              -37         -37       -15           -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Results passed by group to stock market and banking regulators **Adjustments and qualifications by Arthur Andersen  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Audited Accounts and 'Expansion'70% controlled by Credit Agricole  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

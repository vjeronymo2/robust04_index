			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / BAT's American tobacco hopes raise a question of competition: Richard Tomkins reports on the US cigarette market and why the anti-trust regulator opposes a bid by the British group In 1927, the British took over a big chunk of the US cigarette industry when the UK company now known as BAT Industries bought Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, one of the largest US cigarette manufacturers. Now BAT Industries is trying to take another slice through a Dollars 1bn takeover of American Tobacco. Will the US let it happen? The answer will largely hang on a hearing that begins today in New York, at the end of which a US federal court will decide whether or not to support the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to block the acquisition. BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and financial services group, made its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) cash offer for American Tobacco, the fifth biggest US cigarette maker, in April. The would-be vendor is American Brands, the diversified US consumer products group that is American Tobacco's parent. Both BAT and American Brands are keen to complete the deal. But at the end of October the Federal Trade Commission announced that it would try to halt it, saying the takeover would substantially reduce competition in the US cigarette market and result in anti-competitive pricing. Over the next two weeks, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York will consider the FTC's request for an injunction barring the acquisition. In theory, an injunction would be a temporary measure pending a full hearing of the FTC's complaint; in practice, the court's decision, or any appeal against it, is likely to settle the matter. In many ways, it seems odd that BAT should want to buy American Tobacco at all. In the US, the proportion of adults who smoke has dwindled to 25 per cent, and in the last 10 years cigarette sales have been shrinking the rate of 2-3 per cent a year. Meanwhile, smokers and cigarette makers are under siege: big increases in cigarette taxes may be on the way, the Clinton administration is threatening to introduce sweeping curbs on smoking in public places, and the manufacturers are facing a new wave of product liability lawsuits from well-heeled plaintiff attorneys. These factors, however, have driven down the market value of US cigarette companies, making them more attractive to buyers. And since BAT Industries already owns Brown &amp; Williamson in the US, it stands to reap big benefits from the acquisition of American Tobacco because of the cost savings that would result from merging the two companies' manufacturing and distribution. The FTC's objection to the takeover rests on the argument that it would remove a player from a market that is already highly concentrated. American Tobacco has not followed other companies' price increases, the FTC says, so the acquisition would eliminate an aggressive competitor. If American Tobacco went, the chances of collusion between remaining players would increase, and prices would probably go up. The FTC's argument is compelling. There are only six cigarette manufacturers in the US, one of which is already owned by BAT. According to US merger guidelines, a market is regarded as highly concentrated if it scores more than 1,800 points on a formula called the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. The US cigarette market scores more than 2,900. Yet BAT has some strong arguments, too. It points out that the two largest companies in the US cigarette market, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds Tobacco, together account for more than 70 per cent of cigarette sales. BAT's Brown &amp; Williamson, the third biggest, has only 11 per cent. Even after a merger with American Tobacco, Brown &amp; Williamson would remain a distant third with a market share of less than 18 per cent: but a stronger Brown &amp; Williamson would be better able to compete with the two market giants. On price, BAT says there is no likelihood of collusion, with or without the takeover. Competition is becoming more intense as manufacturers fight to increase sales in a shrinking market. In addition, restrictions on cigarette advertising have eroded loyalty to all but the most powerful brands, leading to extremely competitive pricing. Recently, BAT points out, the downward pressure on prices has grown still stronger because of the proliferation of cut-price, own-label cigarettes. If evidence were needed of the increasing competitive pressures, it came last year on 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip Morris slashed the price of its leading brand to claw back market share. The arguments are finely balanced and it would take a brave pundit to predict the outcome. But BAT does at least start with the advantage that it has been here before: in 1988 it spend eight months fighting the regulatory authorities in nine states before succeeding in its Dollars 5.2bn takeover bid for Farmers, the US insurance group.</p>

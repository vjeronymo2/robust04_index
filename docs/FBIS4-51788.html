			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean deep-sea  fishing industry is being threatened by fishermen from the  former Soviet Union and their cheap catches, the Korea Maritime  and Port Administration (KMTA) said Monday.    A KMTA report said that in the fishing grounds of New  Zealand, Tahiti and Australia, former Soviet fishermen are  making inroads into major areas and selling their catch at half  the price charged by their Korean counterparts thanks to low  labor costs. Fishermen from the former communist bloc earn less  than 100 U.S. dollars a month, under one-14th the starting  salary of 1,400 dollars for Koreans. Captains from the former  Soviet Union are paid no more than 150 dollars, even less than  the montly 500-dollar pay of Indonesian fishermen.    In order to increase their catch and save costs, Korean  fishing boats have decided not to return to port unless bad  weather or ship problems arise. To save docking time, they are  being supplied with food and drink by freight boats, a KMTA  official said.    Adding to their problems, Korean fishing vessels will likely  find it difficult to gain longer periods at sea from bases like  New Zealand, which are demanding that their nationals be  employed as sailors. Koreans prefer not to employ them,  however, as they refuse to work longer hours. Four Korean  fishing companies operate in New Zealand and 10 in tahiti.  Industry sources predict encroachment by fishermen from the  former Soviet Union in other areas like Spain as well.    Japanese fishermen, hit by declining profitability caused by  high labor costs, are selling their ships and returning home.</p>

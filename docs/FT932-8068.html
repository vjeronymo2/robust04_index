			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Weak demand trims Maple Leaf to CDollars 10m FIRST-quarter earnings of Maple Leaf Foods, the Canadian food processor which is 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings, dipped by almost 5 per cent as a result of weak demand and fierce competition. Net earnings were CDollars 10.2m (Pounds 5.2m) or 13 cents a share, down from CDollars 12m, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. Last year's figures exclude a CDollars 3.3m contribution from the discontinued edible oils business. Sales dropped slightly, from CDollars 638m to CDollars 632m, but operating profits tumbled by 24 per cent to CDollars 13.2m. The directors explained that results were cushioned by higher interest income and lower tax provisions. Large tax payments made during the quarter have reduced cash reserves to CDollars 172m compared with CDollars 205m at the end of 1992. Long-term debt has grown from CDollars 12.5m to CDollars 43.6m in the past year. The company said that many sectors of the retail food business had been hit by lower demand, competitive pricing and 'trading-down' by consumers to lower margin products. On the other hand, agribusiness earnings improved sharply, partly because of a rationalisation of facilities. Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive, forecast an improvement in earnings over the rest of the year thanks to lower costs and new products.</p>

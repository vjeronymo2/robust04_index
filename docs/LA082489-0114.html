			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YEAR AFTER FBI CAPITOL RAID, ETHICS MEASURES OKD BY 2 COMMITTEES  </P> <P> One year after the FBI raided the Capitol in an investigation of political  corruption, two legislative committees unanimously approved wide-ranging  measures Wednesday to clean up the Legislature's tarnished image and curb its  members' most flagrant ethical abuses.  </P> <P> The Assembly Select Committee on Ethics, concluding eight months of meetings,  formally adopted a package that would limit the gifts and speaking fees that  legislators can receive and impose tougher enforcement of ethics violations.  </P> <P> Hours later, the Senate Rules Committee approved a proposed constitutional  amendment that would ask voters to ban honorariums for legislators while  establishing a salary commission to decide on the level of compensation that  all state elected officials should receive.  </P> <P> Backers of the legislation said they hope to reconcile differences between the  two measures and rush them through the Legislature by Sept. 15, when both  houses adjourn for the year.  </P> <P> But it remains to be seen whether rank-and-file legislators are willing to vote  for legislation that would restrict their own lucrative speaking fees, free  travel to foreign countries and a wide array of gifts.  </P> <P> "If this package passes, there will be nothing like it in the country," said  Common Cause lobbyist Walter Zelman after the Assembly committee approved its  plan. "There is more they could do, but from a realistic point of view, you  have to be very impressed with how far they've moved."  </P> <P> While the Assembly plan is more restrictive and detailed than the Senate  measure, both proposals are designed to reduce the amount of money and gifts  legislators receive from individuals and businesses that have an interest in  bills before the Legislature.  </P> <P> In large part, the Legislature's current interest in ethics legislation was  sparked by the FBI's political corruption investigation, which so far has led  to the indictment of Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) and a former top aide,  Amiel Jaramillo, on 12 felony counts of racketeering, extortion and money  laundering.  </P> <P> The FBI's investigation, which began as an undercover operation in 1985, became  public in dramatic fashion a year ago today when federal agents made a  late-night raid of legislators' Capitol offices.  </P> <P> Since then, the investigation has widened as federal authorities look for links  between lawmakers' votes on specific bills and payments they may have received  from individuals affected by the legislation.  </P> <P> At least five elected officials continue to be subjects of the investigation:  Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier),  Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and  state Board of Equalization member Paul Carpenter, a former Democratic state  senator from Cypress.  </P> <P> "There's a healthy movement within the Legislature to take a long hard look at  the way we and other state elected officials do public business," said Senate  President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) as he urged the Senate Rules  Committee to adopt stricter ethical standards.  </P> <P> For the first time, the Assembly proposal would hold to legislators to the same  conflict-of-interest laws that apply to local government officials throughout  the state. However, the Assembly panel rejected a proposal to turn over  enforcement to the Fair Political Practices Commission, which polices conflict  of interest violations among local officials.  </P> <P> Under the plan, the attorney general or local district attorneys would be given  authority to enforce laws prohibiting legislators from voting on matters that  would affect their own personal finances. In certain cases, prosecution could  be turned over to an independent counsel. In addition, the plan calls for the  creation of an Assembly Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to oversee  legislators' behavior.  </P> <P> The Assembly package, which was drafted in an unusual series of public  meetings, also calls for an immediate limit of $1,000 on individual  honorariums, with each legislator's total annual honorariums not to exceed  $10,200.  </P> <P> In addition, legislators would not be able to accept gifts of more than $100  from a single source per year, with exceptions for such items as presents from  family members, under the Assembly plan.  </P> <P> Gifts of foreign travel would be allowed only if they come from a foreign  government or a bona fide educational institution, or if they receive special  approval in advance from the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee.  </P> <P> "We have put together the first comprehensive ethics conduct program," said  Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Assembly Select  Committee on Ethics, after the panel voted 8 to 0 to approve the package.  </P> <P> Like the Senate proposal, the Assembly plan calls for a constitutional  amendment to be placed before the voters next year that would create a  commission to decide what compensation legislators should receive. Many  lawmakers support the commission plan because they believe that they are  underpaid and that an independent commission would give them a hefty raise.  </P> <P> Under both the Assembly and Senate proposals, voter approval of the salary  commission would mean a ban on all honorariums for legislators.  </P> <P> Both proposals also would prohibit former legislators from lobbying the  Legislature for 12 months after leaving office, and prohibit former top  Administration officials from lobbying the executive branch for the same  period.  </P> <P> Unlike the Assembly plan, however, most of the Senate proposal is contingent on  approval by the voters. A proposed $250 annual restriction on gifts, the ban on  honorariums and the prohibition on lobbying by former officials would not take  effect unless voters agree to create the salary commission.  </P> <P> The Senate proposal, sponsored by Roberti and Senate Republican Leader Ken  Maddy of Fresno, was approved by the Rules Committee on a 5-0 vote.  </P></p>

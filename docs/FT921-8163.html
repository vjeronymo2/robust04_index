			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance Yesterday's statement from Royal, AMB and Fondiaria was typically continental in flavour, liberally spiced with co-operative sentiments and infused with the spirit of the single market. But even in Europe idealism is laced with self interest. In AMB's case the joint venture will be a useful way of fending off the unwanted attentions of French insurer AGF; in Royal's case the fact that its Dutch insurance operations are the only ones for the moment to be injected into the joint holding company means it becomes the grateful recipient of badly needed cash. The noble sentiments expressed by the Epic partners would have sounded more convincing if AMB and Fondiaria had given clearer commitments as to which assets they plan to bring to the party. Nor is the three way boardroom split a feature calculated to bolster market confidence. Rotating presidencies may be acceptable practice for political organisations in Brussels; they are not well known recipes for the success of companies based in Luxembourg. This said, the real pressures on Royal are short term, not long term, and the company badly needs the boost to its solvency ratio, which remains unacceptably low at 34 per cent. The market is well aware that another means of repairing the damage is to pass or cut the final dividend. A more intriguing question, though, is whether a partner will now be found for Royal Life. After yesterday pride will no longer be a problem; and the boost to Royal's balance sheet could be rather greater than from the European deal.</p>

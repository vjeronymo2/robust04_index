			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Management: Building a better rocking chair - Lucy Kellaway meets Robert Fritz, America's eclectic guru The publicity announcing the arrival in Britain of Robert Fritz, the latest management guru from the US, describes him as composer, film maker, author and management consultant, in that order. He has just finished making a psychodrama for television about a boy who is injured in a car accident, suffers brain damage and finds his relations with the outside world changed forever. With that sort of background one would expect a pretty alternative view of management. At the very least he might be relied upon to be a devotee of new theories of corporate creativity. Yet this ex-clarinetist looks like a Wall Street banker and says firmly that he is 'not interested' in creativity. He deplores the fashionable psychological theories which suggest managers need only get themselves into a creative 'mindset' and all their bad old ways will be changed overnight. What matters, he says, is not creativity but creating. In order to create something it is necessary only to know what the goal is, and what steps to take to get there. This is his battle cry: that companies, like composers or film makers, need to have a clear idea of what they are there for and what they are trying to do. 'It sounds so simple. Everyone tells you: we do that,' says Fritz. Yet his contention is that they do not. He has trawled round companies asking them where they want to go and has discovered that most have no idea. 'Their first reply is usually a combination of ideals, vague statements that don't mean anything and solutions to problems they haven't named. Very seldom do you find someone who knows what they are after.' Fritz argues that companies must first understand how they generate wealth. He says that if you ask most chief executives they only have a hazy idea. From this lack of clarity stems all sorts of problems. Companies may have several conflicting goals that vie for attention, with the result that it oscillates between them. Fritz calls these companies 'rocking chairs'. The behaviour that follows comes in many forms. The recent 'downsizing' by corporations is a good example. Companies have never stopped to work out what their capacity costs them, and so can find themselves in a cycle where they over-expand when times are good and contract too much when times get hard. Another common 'rocking' pattern is between centralising and decentralising decision-making. Companies want to grow and to do so they decentralise decision-making. This leads to a loss of control and a desire for stability, which in turn makes them centralise decision-making. After a while the company decides it wants to grow and the process starts all over again. The answer, says Fritz, is for companies to recognise their desire both for growth and stability at the outset and work out which one is most important. They should pay attention to what he calls the structure of their organisation. Structure, as he conceives it, describes all the relationships in the organisation; the reason for the rocking chair is poor structure. The company might have conflicting goals, it might have reward systems that conflict with company values. For example, many companies try to encourage teamwork or to get different departments to work together, but persist in handing out rewards based on the performance of the individual or the department. Whatever the structural flaw, it must be sorted out before any new management idea has a hope of working. Fritz's favourite image is that of a car that pulls to the left. 'If you want to go straight you must pull to the right. But most advisers will say that if you want to go straight you must steer straight. If you do that, it will not work.' His point is that if you do not understand the structure, you will never get anywhere.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Korean National  Peace Committee sent a letter to the World Peace Council on May  18, which called upon the council to take a serious view of the  criminal nuclear development by the South Korean authorities and  lift up the voice informing the world community of it.    Noting that the United States invented "nuclear suspicion"  against the DPRK, describing its 5 megawatt experimental nuclear  power station as one for the development of nuclear arms, and  has escalated the anti-DPRK campaign over the "nuclear issue,"  the letter said:    The one posing a nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula is  not the DPRK, a non-nuclear state, but the United States which  deployed over 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea and is hell  bent on nuclear war exercises directed against the North. What  is used for nuclear development is not the North's 5-megawatt  experimental nuclear power station but the heavy water reactor  and the multipurpose research reactor in South Korea.    As South Korean officials in charge of nuclear development  confessed, the Wolsong heavy water reactor disguised as a  reactor for "commercial use" and the Taedok multipurpose atomic  reactor disguised as one for "research", were introduced for the  purpose of developing nuclear weapons.    South Korea is now producing a large quantity of plutonium  through those reactors. The Wolsong heavy water reactor has  produced plutonium enough to make 370 or more nuclear bombs  after it started operation in 1983. Nevertheless, the nuclear  development in South Korea has not been taken seriously in the  international community. This is because of the deliberate  connivance of the United States and the International Atomic  Energy Agency and their biased act aimed at stifling the DPRK.    We consider that the South Korean authorities' nuclear arms  development can never be tolerated in view of peace in Asia and  the rest of the world or of the World Peace Council's idea of  building a nuclear-free world.    It is the primary requisite to the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula for the South Korean authorities to give up  their nuclear arms development and dismantle the heavy water  reactor and the multipurpose research reactor designed for the  development of nuclear arms.    Since the DPRK Government expressed its willingness to  replace its graphite-moderated experimental power reactor with a  light-water reactor, they must clearly state to the world public  their willingness to scrap the heavy water reactor and the  multipurpose research reactor which are being used in developing  nuclear weapons.    For the Korean peninsula to be turned into a nuclear-free  zone and a durable peace to be ensured there, it is essential to  get the U.S. forces and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South  Korea unconditionally and totally. This is the main question  which must be solved in removing the danger of a nuclear war on  the Korean peninsula over which the world is now concerned, and  guaranteeing peace.    We believe that the council will take a serious view of the  criminal nuclear arms development by the South Korean  authorities, which is being feverishly promoted behind the scene  of the U.S. nuclear smear campaign, and lift up voices exposing  it to the international community.    We also express the hope that you will continue to extend  unstinting support to the Korean people's just cause of peace on  the Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Relations between Ukraine and Russia should be build  on a long-term basis. The head of our state, Leonid Kravchuk,  declared this in an interview for the Moscow-based newspaper  TRUD. According to him, relations between the two countries  should be sincere and those of partnership, truly friendly and  equal. Leonid Kravchuk flatly denied a possibility of any  military clash between Ukraine and Russia. He devoted a  significant part of his interview to the Crimean issue.

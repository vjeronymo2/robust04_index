			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: Council misses the point - Architecture I sense a new harmony in the air. Peace accords between formerly intransigent enemies in the Middle East bring an important sense of hope into the world. Will this optimism bring about a sense of rejuvenation instead of conflict in the world at large? Governments are speaking much more of collaboration between sectors of society rather than confrontation. Only last week the British government talked of restructuring the urban programme with one co-ordinator, in the shape of Mr John Wakeham, to unite and rationalise all the urban inner city initiatives which have recently flowered in a glorious garden of incoherence. The reconstruction of the cities of Britain needs not just a solid alliance between the public and the private sectors but also a sense of unified direction that is clearly missing at the moment. It is hard to get the measure of the assured Mr Selwyn Gummer at the Department of the Environment - I detect that he has a high level of concern for his surroundings, not least because he lives in a house designed by S. S. Teulon, one of the most sophisticated and difficult Victorian architects. I wonder whether he will be able to withstand the biased blandishments of the architectural establishment or will he listen to the architects' customers and consumers? The need in Britain now is not for another development boom that will again take scant regard of the needs of the community, but for a measured and harmonious approach to planning and development in response to some long-term goals. In the interests of bridge building and harmony and the encouragement of the architectural debate it is worth examining one of the government's more dubious ways of encouraging good architecture through the Arts Council's Pounds 200,000 grant programme. More than a quarter of this money this year has been awarded to one London body, The Architecture Foundation, which is really a centre for fairly arcane exhibitions. A great many of the smaller grants go to the predictable crop of old fashioned Modernist promoters. An example of the wisdom of the Arts Council is the decision to give a modest Pounds 1,500 to workshops on the Italian Renaissance and Pounds 5,000 for an exhibition about post-war British architecture. There is practically nothing for architectural history of any serious kind, nothing to help the development industry encourage better design in private housing, but there is the inevitably politically correct donation to the Women in Construction Alliance. There is an obsessive belief in the minds of art bureaucrats that if there is a hint of public interest in a subject then you must set up a 'centre' for it. English Estates has been prevailed upon to give Pounds 30,000 towards studies for the establishment of nine architecture centres throughout England. It is staggering that no grants are given to television, radio, video or other contemporary media that could spread the word about architecture without the need for offices, personnel, endless committees and the inbreeding of art bureaucrats that architecture 'centres' will inevitably cause. The pointlessness of so much that this architecture unit has so far achieved seems to make it an ideal candidate for Mr Portillo's public spending cutting knife. It will be no loss. * I was fascinated to read that, 'the majority of people in Britain know next to nothing about architecture' and only 13 per cent of the 1,000 people questioned by Gallup for the Riba Journal, could name three architects. Sir Christopher Wren was recognised as an architect by 32 per cent of the respondents. This poll asked loaded questions to encourage the continuing protection of the architect's title. How would you answer the question, 'Do you think that anyone should be able to call themselves an architect, regardless of qualification?' Of course you would answer 'No'. But the deregistration of architects currently under consideration does not suggest that anyone can practice 'regardless of qualification'. If you ask the right questions you get the answers you want. * I am looking forward to the exhibition of the work of that neglected genius of British architecture - Beresford Pite (1861-1934) which opens on 16 September at the Riba Heinz Gallery, 21 Portman Square, London W1, until 23 October. He was a bridge builder in the sense that his brilliant and more or less unknown buildings attempted to fuse the virtues of Classical and Gothic design in the modern city. He also had a vision of the city and of the need for wholeness and harmony in architecture. His ideas make a great deal of sense today at a time when the architectural establishment seems to find it impossible to believe (in spite of Gallup polls) that the public wants inspiration and harmony - not endless repetitions of fashionable and irrelevant nostrums.</p>

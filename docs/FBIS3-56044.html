Yevgenyev under </F> the "Point of View" rubric; place and date not given: "The Man  Who Does Not Hurry Is Always on Time"]    [Text] [Yevgenyev] Pavel Grigoryevich, do you not think  that, in its uncertainty, the current situation resembles the  situation that we had a year ago? You remember: Parliament  flew into a rage, Gaydar left, and the premier's chair, it  seemed, was occupied by a man of a different mettle -- a "gas  magnate." No one could say then what awaited the country. Even  the commentaries of analysts were somewhat timid and  inarticulate.    [Bunich] At that time I, too, would not have undertaken to  make forecasts. Chernomyrdin was unknown and not understood.  Hence everyone was possessed by great alarm over whether we  would continue with the reforms, or retreat back to the command  economy. Right now, things are calmer in this sense. The  premier's intentions are clear. The same goes for the general  direction of movement toward the market. The question is, how  to move forward. We can continue to do what we did before --  then it will be just as difficult as now, but will not become  worse. The other option is acceleration. We will get to the  goal quicker, but at the cost of maximum exertion of energy,  which society might not have in sufficient supply on the home  stretch. And finally, we could try a more sparing regime --  extended in time, and not so socially austere. All these are,  in general, questions of tactics. Not one of these genuinely  market-oriented models is a retreat to the past.    [Yevgenyev] On the other hand, the State Duma is a pig in a  poke.    [Bunich] I hope that we will never again see the naked  extremism that lately characterized the Supreme Soviet. I  somehow think that the parliament of the present convocation  will be "fluid" -- that is to say that there will not be  draconian discipline. Just because a man is elected from one  bloc or party or another, he will not be deprived of the freedom  to think and make decisions independently. The democrats will  most likely squabble among themselves over secondary issues, but  when it comes to crucial issues they will find in themselves the  strength to unite. I do not know Zhirinovskiy's program, but I  am not quite convinced that he will blindly follow the  communists with their naivete toward everything to do with the  market. Thus the outlook looks to me at least no worse than one  year ago.    [Yevgenyev] But the Duma will gather and raise a hue and  cry: Industry is perishing, everyone to the rescue of industry!    [Bunich] The slump in production is indeed great. According  to some statistics, there has been a 52-percent downturn in  production since 1989. Although this process is not simple.  Some enterprises are commonly acknowledged to be doomed, and  should expire on the road to a normal economy -- they are  superfluous! Others are so unprofitable, labor-intensive, and  nontechnological that there is no sense in reviving them. I am  more worried by something else: While losing enterprises, we  are creating nothing in their place.    [Yevgenyev] With an annual inflation rate of 1,000 percent?    [Bunich] This is the very premise on which the Cabinet  proceeds: Whatever the cost, inflation must be squeezed. But  what is the result? It is still harder to cut expenditure, and  you do not especially increase revenues -- production shrinks,  and tax revenue into the state coffers with it. The jacket  shrinks to fit the wearer. Hence the delays over settling debts  to the military-industrial complex and the countryside and over  payments to the budget-financed sphere. I am afraid that  stabilization achieved at such a cost would prove unstable.    At one time we loved to talk about production reserves.  Today there are almost none left. Fixed capital is 50 percent  worn out. The volume of investments in industry has fallen by  two-thirds since 1989. Enterprises do not have the funds for  simple reproduction, let alone development.    I am not calling for trillions of rubles to be poured  wholesale into industry again. But I do think it necessary to  aid through reasonable allowances those who are ready to take  risks, who have the ability and knowledge to escape from the  clutches of the crisis, and have a promising business plan.  Picking out such enterprises is work of a special kind.  Piecework, if you like. We have somewhat gotten out of the  habit; from the pinnacles of power it looks to some people  almost shameful. What is an individual little plant, pit, or  building, on the scale of Mother Russia! The time will come  when these things will get back on their feet by themselves.  Reliance on this "by themselves" could prove illusory. Credits  and taxes acceptable to all on the strength of which we might  get back on our feet will not appear in our country quickly, if  we undertake nothing. At the same time, labor collectives are  realizing more and more clearly that no one is going to come  along and wave a magic wand for them or cross their palms with  silver, and are ready to go without some things today in order  to reap the profits tomorrow. An example that is near to home  for me: Right now in the Academy of the National Economy we are  building a facility that will bring in hard-currency revenue,  and have told our staff that we could pay them far more, but  then the construction work would be delayed. Choose the one or  the other. They all decided that we would be patient for three  years and then let the facility. But on the other hand,  inflation is snapping at our heels: Better a bird in the hand...    [Yevgenyev] Nevertheless, without major investments, you  will not get far.    [Bunich] Well, first, we are getting wiser after all. How  many joint-stock companies of the closed type appeared in the  initial period. Now they have got accustomed to their new  surroundings, looked around, and are gradually "opening up."  They are issuing shares and increasing capital.    It is said that loans at the market rate are dear. But why  not take them on security? Bankers do not especially trust  promises to pay through future output -- maybe it will exist,  maybe not. But industrial property, land -- that is reliable.  And advantageous to the industry itself. You keep the money,  and you even get more in the form of handsome credits. That is  how it is done the world over. But in our country people are  still apprehensive: As if you were removing your underwear and  taking it to the pawnbroker's. What it is, I do not know:  Either the general atmosphere of uncertainty is taking its  toll, or directors have insufficient grasp of the basics.    Investment auctions could be more widely practised, selling  shares advantageously to those who guarantee investment  contributions -- these also amount to assets of a kind.    But look what is happening with depreciation payments. They  were deliberately exempted from taxation in order to ensure the  revival of production. But enterprises are constantly plowing  them into pay. Since the new year, following the revaluation,  the value of fixed capital has grown thirtyfold. But what is  the benefit of this, if we continue to squander funds set aside  for depreciation [amortizatsiyu proedat]? That being the case,  you might as well tax it, if you cannot put things in order.    [Yevgenyev] But you say we should start helping industry.  But it will once again throw everything to the four winds.    [Bunich] What I mean is: He who seeks is capable of finding  something. But this is not enough. On the other hand, we  should help only those who know how to make use of this help.  And not, of course, state enterprises. Even in the current  difficult times privatized facilities look far healthier than  state facilities. Among the former only 9 percent are  unprofitable, against 20 percent in the state sphere, and  profitability is on average 10 percent higher. But of course,  they were not allocated sufficient time to recover.    [Yevgenyev] Nevertheless, Ukraine has clearly shown what  happens when you try with all your might to preserve industry.    [Bunich] I think that we have already passed this station.  Also the station at which it was justified to pay any price for  victory over inflation. Now we should look ahead and learn to  optimize our decisions, while not forgetting about the old rule  of thumb: "The man who does not hurry is always on time." Let  the budget temporarily lose out somewhat over relatively low  taxes and cheap credit for a chosen few -- at reasonable levels,  this is not so terrible. Some inflationary indulgences quickly  become a powerful anti-inflationary factor -- this is what  should be kept in mind. Tomorrow's gains will cover today's  losses many times over. He who takes his opportunity will not  only pay back his debt a hundredfold, but also will become a  reliable support for the new economy, which quite simply has no  chance of developing in the present conditions.</p>

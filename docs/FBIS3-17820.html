Joint Exercises by Forces From Five  Navies Have Been Completed in North Atlantic; Cooperation Is  Continuing"]    [Text] Nowadays few would be surprised by Russia's  military cooperation with powers which it once opposed.  Something else would surprise a number of people: Despite all  the difficulties it is experiencing, the Russian Navy is by no  means playing second fiddle in this embryonic partnership.    The colors of the participants' flags in the "Pomor-94"  exercises were identical -- red, white, and blue. But the  interests of the countries which have now sent their ships to  the North Atlantic used to be as different as the design of  their flags. Today they have more and more interests in common  and increasing grounds for cooperation. The fact that the  world's oceans are becoming safer in advance of other regions  was confirmed by the "Pomor-94" exercises, which took place  without a shot being fired.    During this exercise six ships -- two from Norway and one  each from the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and the  Russian escort ship Legkiy from the Northern Fleet -- practiced  tasks involving joint maneuvers, search and rescue of those in  distress, coordination of operations with patrol aircraft back  at base, and coastal blockades with the aim of preventing  smuggling. The phrase "for the first time" may be applied to  these exercises in many ways, not least because this is the  first time such maneuvers have ever been held. It is also  remarkable that for the first time a Russian military journalist  traveled on board a Norwegian ship during exercises on this  scale. And the fact that Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy  commander in chief of the Navy, participated in the exercises  made them important enough for the Norwegian defense minister to  attend as well.    The "Pomor-94" exercises started and finished with news  conferences by leaders and organizers of this new round of  marine cooperation. The Norwegian Admiral Ove Sten Olsen, who  was in charge of the exercise campaign headquarters, spoke  highly of the Russian sailors and noted that cooperation of this  sort would also be planned in future. In reply, Admiral Igor  Kasatonov announced that the Russian Navy is this year planning  to participate in a number of other similar joint exercises,  including the landing of a Russian-U.S. assault force near  Vladivostok. Next year the Russian Northern Fleet plans to host  the "Pomor" exercises combined squadron.</p>

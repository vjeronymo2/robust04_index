			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong said yesterday that  the government will revise a law governing foreign direct  investment (FDI) this year to modernize and internationalize  rules for FDI system. He said the revision of the Foreign  Capital Inducement Act (FCIA) will be made in this autumn's  National Assembly session.    Through the FCIA revision, the government hopes to eliminate  or ease rules that hindered the FDI inflow.    Many expatriate businessmen have criticized the act for  being  too restrictive toward foreign investors.    The act, which was passed in 1966, was revised eight times  in  the past but has been criticized as being revised piecemeal and  mostly under foreign pressure. This time, the government seeks  to rewrite the act "voluntarily" to be more friendly to foreign  businessmen, a Ministry of Finance official said.    The minister acknowledged that despite efforts, Korea could  not make drastic improvements for foreign businessmen due to  "domestic- oriented factors." But Korea can no longer delay its  plan to improve the FDI climate.    Minister Hong said Korea should improve its foreign direct  investment system to levels prevailing in Western OECD  (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)  countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yehuda Litani: "Wrong, Yesha' Is Not </F> Here"]    [Text] This week, the Council of the Jewish Settlements in  Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza region sent me a letter containing  a small colored pamphlet with the title, "A daily shekel for the  sake of the settlements." Attached to the pamphlet was another  page with a standing order to the bank, on the other side of  which was written: "Contribute by a standing order a daily  shekel to the settlements, and the medallion will be sent to  you. A daily shekel: a bronze medallion, 2 shekels a day: a  silver-plated medallion, 5 shekels a day: a numbered  silver-plated medallion, by an annual standing order or by  credit card."    All this appears in the framework of a campaign by that  council that is called "Yesha' Is Here," a campaign during which  young settlers are covering most of the road signs in the  country with the same caption, in an attempt to persuade the  satiated Israelis that Yesha' will pursue them everywhere, even  in their quiet neighborhoods in the coastal plain, because there  is no difference, in their opinion, between Nablus and Tel Aviv.  Not a little has already been written about the change of  terminology from "settlement" [a heritary portion] and  "settlement" [a place to live] by the settlers in the  territories. When their campaigns of pushing into centers of  Arab population in the West Bank began, it seemed to them that  they were continuing on the path of Joshua Bin-Nun, the great  settler [on a hereditary portion] (and, by the way, that is also  the biblical figure most admired by the former prime minister,  Yitzhaq Shamir--not King David, not Jeremiah and Isaiah, not  Moses our Teacher, but precisely the one-dimensional, combative,  and strong-man figure, a grey and boring man like Shamir  himself). Therefore, they chose with great pride the words  "settlement" [on a hereditary portion]. After they learned that  the word itself was in the eyes of many Israelis a synonym for a  messianic minority group that seeks quarrel and strife, whose  entire goal is daily friction with the Palestinians, they  changed the concept to "settlement" and to "settler," to say: we  are the torchbearers and following in the steps of the first,  second, and third aliyahs, we are the true descendants of the  pioneers and founders of this country.  <H5>  This Is the Time To Settle </H5>   On the second page of the small, colorful pamphlet of the  'Aly settlement located between Ramallah and Nabulus, in the  heart of the territories of the autonomy that is intended for  the Palestinians, is written, "Now is the time to settle in the  heart of...," states the upper caption, and farther below is  stated: "I went up and I fell in love...how could it not be?"  And in smaller letters: "You have a wonderful dream. You want  quality of life, good company, a single home, a well-tended  garden, a breathtaking view. You want the best for the family.  You want to participate and be a partner in the upbuilding of  the land. Call us. We also want to do that. 'Aly's absorption  team will be glad to host you. You will suddenly discover that  you, too--in an accelerated process and on excellent purchase  terms--can realize your dream. 'Aly--a settlement in the heart  of the country and in the heart of the people. A 40-45 minute  drive from Jerusalem and Gush Dan. A heterogeneous settlement,  absorbing families and young couples. Employment opportunities  and studies at a reasonable distance. Good air and wonderful  scenery from every window. Houses at surprising prices!  Possibilities for purchase and rental."    Everything is asked here, except for some most important  matters: Do you want to endanger the members of your family?  Your small children are endangered every day by an ambush at  night and stone throwing by day. Have you lost your mind,  precisely now, to move to this dangerous place, precisely in the  middle of the negotiations with the Palestinians? Did you know  that 'Aly is located in the heart of the Palestinian autonomy?    It is difficult not to be impressed, for example, by the  sentences: "A breathtaking view...good air and a wonderful view  from every window." And what is the landscape seen from every  window in 'Aly? A landscape of Palestinian villages on every  side. A 45-minute drive from Jerusalem or Gush Dan, but what a  route! A friend who is a resident of 'Ofra, which is nearer to  Jerusalem than the settlement of 'Aly, and who works in  Jerusalem, told me of her daily fears on the way to work and on  the way back. That delicate woman, armed with a pistol in the  glove compartment, and twice a day she is overwhelmed by fear,  especially when she transports her small children.    This is an arrogant notice, which intentionally ignores the  difficult reality, with the aim of trying to tempt whoever is  still unaware of the new facts of life in the field. After a  difficult intifadah of six years, it recommends moving to a  godforsaken settlement in Samaria, in the heart of the danger,  and to move from his home within the Green Line for the sake of  "good company, a single home, a well-tended garden."    Who are they trying to persuade, when every day we see on  television reports about serious concerns on the part of the  settlers, who are seeking to abandon their homes and return  immediately, almost in flight, to their former places? Had they  only mentioned in one or two words the serious and complicated  problems that confront anyone who decides now to bring his  family to a settlement in Samaria, it would be possible to  relate to this announcement properly. But only a fool or someone  who has become mentally disturbed would believe the settlement  announcement of 'Aly, which says that: "You want what is best  for your family."  <H5>  The Nation Is Behind Us </H5>   But the height of arrogance is the notice on the following  page, the third page of the pamphlet, which cites several  sentences from the appeal, "The Union of Rabbis," in the name of  a conference of 1,200 rabbis that was held in Jerusalem. The  notice states: "The decision to give up parts of Eretz-Yisra'el  that we hold lacks authority, contradicts Jewish faith and  tradition from generation to generation, was not taken by the  nation, and action must be taken to abrogate it as if it never  were. The agreement involves a real mortal danger to many in  Israel."    What does it mean, "was not taken by the nation"? The nation  accepted it a long time ago, and the proof is that after a  policy of massive encouragement by the various governments  (including those of the Alignment, but primarily of the Likud)  for 26 years, generous loans, almost free gifts of houses and  land (usurped), the number of settlers throughout the West Bank  and the Gaza Strip comes to 110,000; 2.5 percent of the Jewish  residents of the state. That is all. An negligible minority,  indeed problematic, but not significant. The people voted with  their feet even before they voted at the ballot box, they  decided to stay at home and not to be tempted to messianic  adventures.    The same appeal by the rabbis talks about the agreement  involving "a real mortal danger to many in Israel." As if the  current presence of the settlers throughout the West Bank and  Gaza does not constitute a real mortal danger for every settler  and the members of his family. It is precisely their current  presence there that brings upon each and every settler the  immediate danger, and every unnecessary presence there only  increases the dangers.    But just as a not inconsiderable portion of the settlers  already know that their struggle is almost lost, and that it  will be necessary, at the end of the process, to withdraw from  most of the area of the West Bank and the Strip, they also know  that they cannot struggle within their own camp with the extreme  standard bearers, who march with eyes almost shut to a struggle  that is already lost, which will only increase division and  strife in Israel.    So we can expect in the coming year and the one afterwards  to  be witnesses to an attempt, which already appears pathetic and  desperate, to hold on to the settlers' past achievements, while  consciously ignoring and attempting to blur the severe dangers  and the reality that is crystallizing in the territories. And  all because they adhere to the anachronistic formula that also  is written in the pamphlet that is signed by the heads of  Yesha', according to which, "It again becomes clear that it is  the settlements that will determine the borders of Jewish  sovereignty and the future of the state and its security."    A sign, which was written by the Yesha' Council on the main  Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road in the area of Latrun, says "Yesha' is  here." An anonymous hand added below: "Wrong, it is not here."  Correct, a bad mistake, a mistake that is costing us a lot of  blood.</p>

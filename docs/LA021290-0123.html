			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PURCHASING POWER IMPROVES FOR FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS  </P> <P> Declining mortgage rates and lower prices for starter houses gave first-time  home buyers greater purchasing power during the fourth quarter of last year,  the National Assn. of Realtors said today.  </P> <P> The association's first-time home buyer affordability index measured 74.4  during the three-month period ended in December, an improvement from a rating  of 71 in the previous quarter.  </P> <P> That means that typical first-time buyers had 74.4% of the income needed to  qualify for a starter home.  </P> <P> The relief may be short lived, however, as interest rates have pushed upward  during the first quarter.  </P> <P> John Tuccillo, the association's chief economist, said the return of higher  interest rates this quarter should make it even more difficult for first-time  home buyers to qualify for a loan.  </P> <P> First-timers will have to be "more inventive to get into the housing market,"  Tuccillo said.  </P></p>

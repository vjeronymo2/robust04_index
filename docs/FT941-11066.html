			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Rise unlikely to hit flow of funds to emerging markets The first tightening of monetary conditions in the US in five years appears unlikely to slow flows of funds to financial markets in Latin America and Asia, according to economists on Wall Street. These 'emerging' markets have been buoyed over the last year by heavy capital flows from US mutual fund investors pursuing higher returns on investment than those available in the US. But the quarter-point rise was believed to be insufficient to affect these flows. 'There would have to be a move of considerably more than this to have any significant effect on these markets. Even as much a 100 to 150 basis points (1-1 1/2 percentage points) might not have a terrible impact,' said Mr John Purcell of Salomon Brothers in New York. Short-term rates of 3 1/4 per cent and long term rates of just over 6.3 per cent did not appear enough to compete with recent returns on emerging market investment. Latin American markets have been particularly strong this year; the worst-performing, Mexico's, is up 8.5 per cent since the start of the year, while Brazil's is up by some 40 per cent.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Critics of British Gas retreat from their success: The MMC report has received little support THE consultation period for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on British Gas closes this week amid growing speculation that the government will reject its recommendations. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will probably give his decision by the end of the year. In August the commission found that there was a conflict in British Gas being a gas supplier when it owned the pipeline network. It recommended that the company should be split by 1997, and that British Gas's monopoly of the tariff (domestic) market be phased out by 2002. The cost of the changes would be passed on to consumers, but they would gain as greater competition brought lower prices and better service. But although the recommendations went much further than expected, they received little support in the gas industry. Even the departing gas industry regulator, Sir James McKinnon of Ofgas, who triggered the inquiry, said he did not believe that break-up was necessary to create competition. The consensus was that the government should give priority to phasing out the monopoly, leaving break-up as a later option if needed. The independents want Mr Heseltine to bring forward the commission's recommended timetable for introducing competition, although they propose different target dates. Kinetica, a joint venture of PowerGen and the US oil company Conoco, wants competition opened to the 2m or so consumers who use more than 1,000 therms a year in 1995, with full abolition in 1998 to coincide with the introduction of competition into the electricity industry. But several other independents want access to the full tariff market of about 18m gas customers by 1996. Consumer associations have also been lukewarm over a break-up. Both the Gas Consumers' Council and the National Consumer Council oppose the commission's recommendation that customers bear the costs of a British Gas restructuring. Alliance Gas, a joint venture between BP and Statoil of Norway, also argues that increased competition is the main issue, but it believes that 'sustainable competition' requires a break-up. 'Chinese walls are not going to work,' said Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director. Only a break-up will result in a British Gas transport company which 'treats the independents as valued customers'. British Gas itself remains one of the few other institutions which still favours break-up, in spite of its earlier bitter opposition. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, said: 'We don't think break-up is necessary for competition purposes, but given that the MMC recommended it we are prepared to work with the government to help bring it about.' The attraction for British Gas is that it would be able to realise some gains for its shareholders who, it feels, have had a raw deal from a regulatory regime which has favoured the consumer. But if Mr Heseltine opts for ending the monopoly first, he will have to satisfy himself on a number of points. The most important is that gas prices really will fall, as independent gas companies claim. Twelve independents recently claimed they could deliver average annual savings on gas bills of 8 per cent. However, Dr John Wright, who specialises in utility regulation at accountants Price Waterhouse, warns that prices could go up, at least in the short term, as new competitors bid for supplies. Customers might also want to avoid locking themselves into a supplier once they can choose between several. This will create greater risks for gas suppliers, who will want to be compensated by higher prices. British Gas believes small consumers could face higher bills because of the elimination of cross-subsidies. Mr Brown queries the calculations made in the independents' report. 'They say that prices will come down, but they're a bit thin on how they're going to do it. How can they make these claims without knowing what the gas transportation charges will be?' Confusion over whether competition will lead to lower prices last week caused the Gas Consumers' Council to ask the government to delay any decision on the commission's report until it could quantify the likely impact on consumers of the various proposals. The independents have made proposals which they say will ensure that security of supply and social obligations to the elderly and disabled are maintained. British Gas has commissioned Arthur D Little, the management consultancy, to prepare a report on how a competitive market might be organised, and how the transition should be made. It should be ready later this month, and will be passed to the Department of Trade and Industry. There will also be continuing liaison between the DTI and Ofgas and its new director-general, Mrs Claire Spottiswood, who has yet to give her views on the report.</p>

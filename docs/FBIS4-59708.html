			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer] </F>   [Excerpt] For the first time since the beginning of the  Israeli-Syrian negotiations, high-ranking political sources last  night voiced "cautious optimism" concerning the contacts with  Damascus.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived in  Israel yesterday afternoon after a series of talks with  President al-Asad and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' in  Damascus, met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at his Jerusalem  residence late last night. The meeting, which was attended by  Dennis Ross and Professor Itamar Rabinovich, lasted about an  hour and a half.    After the meeting, Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to  the United States, said: "The negotiations held in Damascus  should be viewed as a few more small steps at the start of a  long trek. Further declarations were made and answers given in  the course of Christopher's talks. The talks should be viewed  in terms of protracted negotiations. Not every declaration or  answer immediately creates a new reality."    Nevertheless, last night both American and Israeli sources  were under the impression that practical Israeli-Syrian  negotiations have been launched and that while the gaps between  the parties' stands are very profound, Christopher sensed that  the Syrian stand has shifted.    Last night, Christopher presented Rabin with detailed Syrian  answers to the clarifications Israel had requested concerning  the arrangement proposed by Syria. [passage omitted]    [Reporting on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT  on  17 May, political correspondent Shlomo Raz states that  "Jerusalem primarily took note of the Syrian media reports,  which are also being interpreted as an attempt to improve the  atmosphere and not as actual progress in the negotiations.  These include the TISHRIN report about withdrawal within a  reasonable period and the AL-HAYAH report outlining five points  of the Israeli-Syrian peace arrangement." Raz cites "a senior  political source" as saying that the AL-HAYAH report "is  inaccurate, because that is not what Warren Christopher brought  back from Damascus, although it indicates a desire to improve  the atmosphere."    [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 17 May, in a report by  political correspondent Aluf Ben on page A1, cites "a senior  political element" as saying "last night" that "the Syrian  replies addressed every component of the Israeli peace proposal:  withdrawal, security arrangements, the substance of peace, the  time factor, and the linkage between withdrawal and  normalization. According to him, the answers were `low key'."]</p>

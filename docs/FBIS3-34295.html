			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In today's cabinet session, security sources  reported that the Fatah Hawks do not accept the authority of  PLO-Tunis, and that since the signing of the Israel-PLO  Declaration of Principles they have not ceased their terror  activity.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Prime  Minister Rabin emphasized to the ministers that in the talks  which preceded the formulation of the Declaration of Principles  he prevented the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] involvement  because at that time political decisions were being made. Now,  however, the military echelon is involved in the negotiations  because military decisions are being made on issues such as  external security, safeguarding the traffic axes, and securing  the settlements.    Mr. Rabin explained that he wants the 'Arafat-Peres meeting  to proceed as planned in Cairo tomorrow. Prime Minister Rabin  and Foreign Minister Peres will hold a private meeting this  afternoon in order to decide on this issue.</p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: What to ask your adviser What qualifications should a client look for when choosing an adviser? If a potential manager gives you satisfactory answers to these questions, the chances are you will be happy. 1. What security do I get for my money? Ensure that the manager is a well-established member of a regulatory body such Fimbra or Imro. 2. Is the service suitable for my individual needs? It is pointless paying for an advisory and investment service you do not want or use. If, on the other hand, you want a complete management package, then you should listen carefully to what the potential manager asks you. He can create a proper portfolio only through probing your personal aims and circumstances thoroughly. 3. What is the likely performance of my funds going to be? You should get at least an expected percentage of growth and level of income from an investment house. In addition, check how much of your portfolio is likely to go into the investment manager's own funds and what he might invest in specialised markets. 4. How much is the whole service going to cost? Methods of charging vary considerably, with everything from fixed management fees to percentage fees and even fees linked to performance. Be on the look-out for extras such as charges for tax computations, dealing costs and valuations. 6. What can you do that I cannot do myself by using a stockbroker? Ask about the quantity and quality of the potential manager's sources and information. 7. Will you run my funds on a discretionary or an advice-only basis. 8. If using a discretionary service, will you keep me informed fully through contract notes, valuations and regular personal contact. 9. Can I withdraw my funds if necessary? To be fair to both sides, you should judge a reputable manager on a trial period of at least 15 to 18 months. It is crucial, however, that you can withdraw your own money as and when you require. 10. What other services do you offer? The capacity to take over your tax affairs, and perhaps offer guidance on insurance, school fees, banking facilities and general estate planning, could be useful. 11. Can you give me advice on alternative forms of investment. It might be rewarding for you, if required, to receive objective, informed counsel about anything ranging from investment in forestry to enterprise zones. The answers to all the above points and others, where appropriate, should be set out in a written agreement. Be sure it suits your personal wishes and circumstances.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Angola death toll increases to over 1,000 THE ANGOLAN government strengthened its hold on the capital Luanda yesterday after further fighting in which a number of senior officials of the former rebel Unita movement were feared dead or wounded. The death toll from four days of fighting in the capital and five large southern provincial cities rose to more than 1,000 yesterday, according to Angolan state radio. Reports from Luanda said fighting, shelling and mortar attacks continued in the city yesterday in contravention of a United Nations-brokered ceasefire agreement. A UN official said the accord 'does seem to have had a favourable effect. . . hostilities are reduced to small pockets.' Government forces appeared to have gained the upper hand by yesterday afternoon, after soldiers and police had mopped up areas of violent resistance from Unita forces. The fighting broke out a month after multi-party elections in which Unita was defeated. Diplomats in Luanda said the government renewed its offensive against Unita positions in the capital early yesterday morning in the suburbs of Miramar and Sao Paulo and had pounded the downtown Turismo and Tropico hotels, where Unita officials were staying. Vigilantes, armed by the government, were reported to have conducted manhunts for Unita supporters. In Washington Mr Jardo Muekalia, a senior Unita official, accused the government of going on 'an all-out offensive to cleanse Unita from the cities'. He could not confirm the reported deaths of Mr Jeremias Chitunda, vice president of Unita, and Mr Elias Salupeto Pena, a senior military official, nor the reported wounding and capture of Mr Abel Chivukuvuku, Unita's foreign affairs spokesman. Mr Muekalia, who earlier spoke with the headquarters of Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita's leader, said the situation was extremely serious but was not beyond a last-minute resolution aided by the international community. 'This could be the beginning of the civil war or the end of the civil war,' he said. 'It depends on how the international community acts now.' Ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council convened a hasty meeting to discuss the crisis.</p>

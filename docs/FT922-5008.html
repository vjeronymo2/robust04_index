			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mr Koskov's copper-bottomed business plan - One of Russia's small but growing band of entrepreneurs talks to Kenneth Gooding VLADIMIR KOSKOV is offering holidays in Spain and Lada cars to encourage people to collect the copper scrap that he says is liberally scattered across Russia. Collectors are rarely interested in roubles, he says. So student collectors can earn eight days in Spain for every half a tonne of old copper they deliver. He has also bought 100 Ladas, each to be swapped for four and a half tonnes of scrap. Mr Koskov is one of a small but growing band of Russian entrepreneurs battling a system that is proving resistant to change. Copper is central to his plans for the future. He sees the metal as a certain way of converting roubles into hard currency. But there is the little matter of obtaining export licences. He is certain his company will eventually get the licences it needs. However, the situation is complex because the old bureaucracy knows there is money to be made from the bribes for favours done when something is in demand. 'The old system bred a criminal mentality,' Mr Koskov suggests. So licences are for absurdly small amounts of copper, from 1,000 to 5,000 tonnes. The more licences to be issued, the greater the bribe opportunity. Some will be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and some by the regional authority in Ekaterinburg. The rest will be auctioned off to the highest bidder at commodity exchanges. Mr Koskov is a mild-mannered man of 40. He was head of automation at a defence equipment manufacturing establishment before starting his own business in 1988. This was a small consultancy co-operative involving seven other people from the local polytechnic and the defence plant. He had his first taste of the opportunities offered by exporting when he swapped 100 Russian guitars for two computers. The guitars were to be sold to students at Cambridge in England and Mr Koskov simply gave them to someone who was about to take off from Moscow airport to London. 'There were some problems with customs officers at Moscow,' he recalls with a smile. 'But I said, where is it written that an aircraft passenger can't take 100 guitars?' Today his Teknesis group of companies, based in Ekaterinburg, has a wide range of interests but the most important one at the moment is collecting Russia's copper scrap and having it re-refined into metal suitable for export. He says that last year Teknesis exported about 10,000 tonnes of copper (as well as 10,000 tonnes of aluminium, some tungsten and molybdenum). This year he hopes to get licences to export 75,000 tonnes of copper from Russia. Teknesis also has a deal with the Balkhash and Upper Pyshminsky refineries in Kazakstan to sell all their production, perhaps 150,000 tonnes. To put this into context, the former Soviet Union's net copper exports moved above 100,000 tonnes for the first time only in 1989. Last year, as the new Commonwealth of Independent States exported everything possible to raise desperately-needed hard currency, net exports are estimated to have reached 312,000 tonnes. Mr Koskov is storing copper in a warehouse at Le Havre, France, where it can be used as collateral for loans from the Credit Lyonaise bank as well as providing a buffer stock to ensure a smooth supply to customers. He says a quality guarantee is given by the Societe General Surveillance of Geneva. He has set up companies in France, England and Switzerland to handle his export business, which he claims now has an annual turnover of about Dollars 100m. Metal sales are organised by his London office. He describes the copper operation as 'an enabler'. It is simply a way of raising the hard currency he needs to push through ambitious plans for his business in Russia. He is using the hard currency raised to import computers and other equipment into Russia. His aim is to link the main business centres there through one or two computer head stations eventually using about 30,000 terminals. He also hopes Russia's newly-developing commodity exchanges will be linked via this system and suggests that this link should help to stabilise the prices of some goods. There tend to be gluts of goods in some parts of the republic, particularly at the ports, and severe shortages in others. Mr Koskov believes an integrated commodity exchange system would reflect the overall situation more accurately. Teknesis is also setting up business centres in, initially, five cities (Ekaterinburg, Moscow, St Petersburg, Khabarovsk and Novosibirsk) aimed particularly at western companies that would prefer to move in when all the equipment - telephones, computers, furniture and so on - is installed and up and running - Mr Koskov is even offering Renault limousines as part of a package for companies needing to ferry people to and from airports. In spite of Russia's economic problems, he hopes to sell about 1,000 of these business centres at 9m roubles each, or Dollars 65,000 or 70 tonnes of copper. He says that, once the price is paid, he can guarantee an office will be ready for occupation in 45 days. Mr Koskov also is building up his copper business in Russia. His company is supplying the Kazakhstan smelters - from a plant in Omsk - with a flotation agent, needed in the refining process. The new agent, he claims, reduces emissions of sulphur dioxide (one of the causes of acid rain) by 10 to 20 per cent. He recently started to supply the flotation agent and scrap copper to the huge Norilsk nickel-copper combine. Norilsk needs scrap for its smelting process and in return Koskov is willing to buy refined copper for 300,000 roubles a tonne instead of the 70,000 roubles the Russian state export agency would pay. He is also selling copper to a pipe producer at Revda, near Ekaterinburg, which in turn is exporting his products to France. Mr Koskov says he set up his Swiss company to manage the group's finances because the Russian banking system has virtually collapsed. According to his statement of account, the Bank for Foreign and Economic Affairs owes his companies Dollars 500,000 in hard currency. 'But the bank has no money. The state took the money.' He complains that, until recently, any person with hard currency and apparently well-off was assumed by most Russians to be a criminal, part of Russia's Mafia. That is now changing, he suggests. 'People are now beginning to realise there are good as well as bad ways of making money.' But the entrepreneurial spirit is still hard to detect in Russia. Mr Koskov says he knows of only a handful of other Russian entrepreneurs and tells an anecdote to illustrate his point. A year ago he approached the management at the defence plant where he once worked offering to help. They were not interested. But recently they called him back. 'The plant was at a standstill. The managers were just sitting there, twiddling their thumbs, waiting for something to happen.' He asked them if the plant could produce car bodies if it was given a contract. Yes, said the managers, but there was no capital and, even worse, they had to dispose of 6,000 surplus missiles. Mr Koskov had to point out that there were tons of valuable alloys, ounces of precious metal and hundreds of expensive components to be reclaimed from this missile stockpile. Many other people in Mr Koskov's position would have taken the profit and retired, perhaps to a sunnier climate. Why does he press on, combatting a system and enduring the chaos? He does not pause an instant before replying: 'It is sad for any man to see his mother dying - Russia is dying and it is very painful for me'.</p>

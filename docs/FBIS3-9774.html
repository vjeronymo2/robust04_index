			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva: "Opposition SDS on Foreign </F> Exchange Market and Government Economic Policy"]    [Text] Sofia, March 29 (BTA) -- The economic situation in  this country is rapidly deteriorating, and one of the main  reasons is the government's failure to attain its economic and  financial objectives, the National Coordinating Council (the top  leadership) of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS)  found at its meeting today. According to SDS, because of the  crisis of political confidence in the government the lev lost  nearly half its price against the U.S. dollar in the last three  weeks. As long as this crisis of political confidence is  deepening, nothing could stabilize the financial and  foreign-exchange markets, said Ivan Kostov MP of SDS, former  finance minister in two successive governments, in 1991 and 1992.    Back when the cabinet of independent economist Lyuben Berov  was voted into office at the end of 1992, SDS declared itself  against the "cabinet of independent experts" formula. Since  that time, the opposition coalition has repeatedly pressed for  early parliamentary elections and a politically committed  government.    A week ago, SDS moved at the National Assembly a question to  the government about its economic and financial policy and  declared that after it hears the reply, it would demand the  National Assembly to take a stand. "I expect parliament to  criticize the cabinet for its actions and inactions which  disrupted the country's economic system," Mr. Kostov told  reporters today. In case the majority votes down such a stand,  SDS will move yet another vote of no confidence in the cabinet.    The ex-Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), which  holds  the majority in parliament at present, takes a softer line on  the performance of the government. A week ago BSP called for  faster and more resolute measures to end speculation on the  foreign-exchange market and the lev depreciation. At the same  time, however, the Socialists' leader Zhan Videnov said that  "the foreign debt negotiations, rather than the dollar rate, are  the government's top priority now". According to the  Socialists, no personnel changes could be made now either in the  government, or in the institutions concerned with the foreign  debt negotiations.    SDS, however, believes that the cabinet has failed to reach  a  favourable agreement with the London Club creditor banks. SDS  economists argue that Poland received a better offer in  principle on a settlement of its loan. According to Ivan  Kostov, this is further confirmed by "the fact that the  foreign-exchange reserves and the expected financial grant and  loan aid from abroad will not be sufficient for the government  to attain its two goals: To close a deal with the London Club  and keep the rate of the Bulgarian currency stable". "In the  present currency market conditions, the depletion of  foreign-exchange reserves makes financial stability practically  impossible. All measures taken by the cabinet and the National  Bank of Bulgaria proved counterproductive with their influence  on the financial and foreign-exchange market. Instead of  achieving stability and halting the Bulgarian lev depreciation,  in reality we witness just the opposite. We believe the main  reason is that this government has already lost political  credibility with almost everybody in this country", Mr. Kostov  believes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Approximately 700 Palestinian prisoners, released  from Qezi'ot prison in the Negev, arrived in the Gaza Strip  today within the framework of the agreement that Israel and the  PLO signed in Cairo. Another 300 freed prisoners returned to  their homes in the West Bank. Our correspondent said all the  freed prisoners are Fatah Movement members, except two from the  Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, and two others from the  Islamic Jihad. These four prisoners pledged to support the  peace march.    Fourteen deportees, most of whom are Fatah Movement members,  returned to the territories across the Allenby bridge this  afternoon. They were accompanied by 35 of the members of their  families. These deportees are expected to join the Palestinian  teams that will run the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    Seventeen Palestinian police officers also arrived in Gaza  Strip across the Rafah crossing point today. They will join the  Palestinian Military Liaison Committee, which will coordinate  with the Israeli liaison committee on the issue of transferring  some of the Gaza Strip area that the Israeli Defense Army and  police will leave, as well as the deployment of the Palestinian  police.</p>

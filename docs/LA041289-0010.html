			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNK BOND KING VICTIM OF ENVY, LEGAL LYNCHING  </P> <P> There was once a time when the United States had a fair and just legal system  based on presumption of innocence and limits on the coercive power of  prosecutors. Those were the days before the racketeering statute known as RICO,  the ambitions of U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, the government's blackmail of  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the frame-up of its "junk bond" king, Mike  Milken.  </P> <P> According to Ralph Ingersoll, chairman of Ingersoll Publications Co., Milken's  trial is a political trial, complete with the media equivalent of a KGB  pre-trial beating and torture. Milken intends to defend himself in court, but  if he were to ask the Soviet Union for political asylum, no one could blame  him.  </P> <P> Milken, judged by his market value, is the most productive human in history. In  1987 he was paid $550 million in salary and bonuses -- enough to spark the envy  of billionaires David Rockefeller, the epitome of old, established wealth, and  Donald J. Trump, the epitome of new money. Rockefeller thought Milken's pay was  evidence of an unbalanced financial system. Trump said, "You can be happy on a  lot less money."  </P> <P> Anyone who arouses the envy of billionaires hasn't a chance with ordinary  people. That makes him an easy mark for politically ambitious prosecutors such  as Giuliani, who is expected to run for mayor of New York. Giuliani, playing on  the proclivities of ordinary people to attribute such success to Milken's greed  and fraud, decided to ruin him as a steppingstone to his own ambition.  </P> <P> Milken's other enemies include the entrenched managements of poorly run  companies, old-line Wall Street firms displaced by Drexel and Milken's genius,  and young lawyers and journalists whose education consists of being  indoctrinated to equate wealth with crime. The lawyers at the Securities and  Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice sincerely believe that  there is no honest way to make large sums of money and that a large income is  proof of "white collar" crime.  </P> <P> Milken's great crime is that he provided stockholders with a way to get rid of  managers who run corporations for their own benefit. He developed a bond market  to finance takeovers, thus putting corporate assets in the hands of more  efficient management and forcing others to clean up their acts. Milken's  activities added billions of dollars to stock values, enriching shareholders,  and that explains his high pay.  </P> <P> Yet in an unprecedented action in U.S. legal history, his firm Drexel was  blackmailed with the approval of the attorney general. To avoid being  prosecuted as a racketeer and having all its assets seized prior to trial or  conviction, Drexel had to admit (probably falsely) that it was guilty of  criminal actions, pay the government $650 million and fire Milken and withhold  from him his pay for the previous year.  </P> <P> Since it has no real case against Drexel or Milken, the government's tactics  have been to force them into a plea bargain and admission of guilt in order to  settle the case without trial. From the beginning, the U.S. attorney and the  SEC took every possible step to ruin the reputations of their victims with two  years of "leaks" and innuendoes prior to filing charges. Once charges were  filed, the government tried to keep the basis of the charges as secret as  possible from the indicted victim.  </P> <P> In a civilized land, such extraordinary breaches of legal ethics would bring  down the government.  </P></p>

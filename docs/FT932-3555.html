			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Building society in property deal talks NATIONWIDE BUILDING Society is negotiating to take a controlling stake in Quality Street, the Glasgow-based company which develops and manages private rented housing. The transaction involves restructuring Nationwide's Pounds 160m lending to Quality Street which showed a loss last year and whose balance sheet is in deficit, partly because of the fall in property values. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide, said yesterday that the building society had decided to make Quality Street its vehicle for involvement in the private rented sector, ahead of expected government measures to encourage private rent-ing. It would also put about 1,500 of its repossessed properties under Quality Street's management to be rented out. Further transfers could double Quality Street's size. Quality Street was formed in 1988 by Mr Paul Mugnaioni, formerly Glasgow's director of housing. It now manages about 3,000 properties of which it owns about 2,000 and sees itself as a 'blue-chip' private landlord. It has built far fewer homes than it hoped, however, because the returns on rented housing are not high enough to attract investors. It showed a loss of Pounds 9m in the year to March 1992, mainly because accounting standards required it to show the redemption premium on a loan from Nationwide on its profit and loss account, which also reduced its reserves. In 1992 its liabilities of Pounds 142m exceeded its assets by Pounds 6m. Nationwide took 25 per cent of Quality Street's equity when it was formed and earmarked substantial funds to finance its properties. In 1991 it sold its equity stake to Mr Mugnaioni and another director but continued to lend to it. Mr Melville-Ross said that the building society was not worried about its loans to Quality Street. He said: 'We could have left things as they were but we decided it was more sensible to take a controlling interest. The climate is changing towards renting.' The size of Nationwide's stake in Quality Street is still under negotiation but it will be more than 50 per cent.</p>

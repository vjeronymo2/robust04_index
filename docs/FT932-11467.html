			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Continental Airlines Continental Airlines' emergence from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure raises intriguing valuation questions about the airline industry. A mysterious Dollars 1.8bn intangible asset has popped up on the US carrier's reconfigured balance sheet relating to the value of its routes and slots. The item accounts for 37 per cent of the new entity's total assets. No value was ascribed to the routes before. There is nothing wrong with this from a technical accounting perspective. In the US, route allocations are tradeable commodities which can legitimately be capitalised. Three years ago United Airlines bought Pan Am's international routes into Heathrow for Dollars 400m. It treats such route acquisition costs as intangible assets and steadily depreciates them. The surprising aspect to Continental's valuation is its scale and theoretical nature. Such accounting inventions beg a string of questions about the methods employed. What happens to route values if a more aggressive competitor starts operating alongside? What would be the effect of a revision of bilateral aviation agreements? US accounting rules recognise such assets can be subject to 'permanent impairment' and should then be written down. At a practical level, though, the debate quickly veers into the farcical. For European airlines, such issues are academic because routes are not traded and thus not treated as intangible assets. Though a carrier's slots are arguably its most precious asset, this is probably just as well. If it applied the logic of the Continental valuation and the market worth suggested by the United deal, British Airways could invent a value of more than Dollars 5bn for its Heathrow slots. Sensibly it says it has no intention of doing so.</p>

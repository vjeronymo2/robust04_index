			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Letter: Retailers are victims of arbitration process, not lease terms Sir, Your graph ('Nightmare on the high street for UK retailers', October 6) shows retail rents increasing by 80 per cent more than retail sales in 1986-90, whereas throughout 1971-86 rents and sales stayed close. This overshoot of rent over sales involved a shift of resources from tenant to landlord reasonably explicable by market forces. The sales surge meant a shortage of retail premises, tenants paid high rent increases at review, equating increased demand for shops with limited supply. Had the boom continued high rents would have resulted in more shops. In recession retail sales collapsed, many shops fell empty, yet rents continued to rise in arbitrations. (Had market forces been allowed to work, rents would have fallen more than sales, allowing retail prices to fall to equate supply and demand, empty shops to reopen and recovery to start. Resources would have started to shift back from landlord to tenant.) Instead retailers suffered closure and ruin and the Retail Price Index was falsely inflated, not by market forces, but by the failure of the present arbitration set-up. Upwards-only clauses of shop leases have rarely operated in the slump, since arbitrators still award increases. Thus the arbitration set-up, not lease terms, is the main problem. Retailers, who in 1986-90 accepted an 80 per cent rent overshoot over sales, realise that a corresponding undershoot under sales cannot happen in arbitrations, and they will be forced to keep paying the inflated 1986-90 rents for at least 14 years (see Professor Burton's 'Retail Rents: Fair and Free Market'). For retail landlords a rent review means heads I win in booms, tails you lose in slumps. Reasons for unfair rent reviews include: landlords and their agents deliberately suppress or rig rental evidence in arbitrations; reviews are settled by two or three local dealers in the second-hand house market; modern valuation methods are not employed. Retailers with a residential house enjoyed both an overshoot in house price during the boom and suffered a price collapse during the slump. If their house was collateral the bank often closed their over-rented shop. For retailers in boom or slump it's heads landlord wins with high retail rents, tails I lose on house prices. Now retailers understand what is happening we will refuse to allow the arbitration scandal to continue. John Campbell, Tiddy Dols Eating House, 55 Shepherd Market, London W1Y 7HL</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi paid  an unexpected visit to the police station of El Anasser, where  he was briefed by the station chief on the difficult conditions  in which policemen carry out their mission to guarantee the  public's safety.    [Begin Sifi recording] We will look into the means  available.  God willing, we will make an effort to provide you with the  means in all fields. We will have to be realistic and bear in  mind the circumstances and the means available to the state.  We, as a government, and also the people notice that the  policemen are sacrificing their lives to defend this homeland so  that it can remain a state of law. The main thing is that this  is a noble mission that concerns the defense of one of the basic  human rights. Many people talk about human rights but we should  not forget that the main and the most crucial human right is the  right to life, and the defense of this right is a noble mission.    This mission is carried out by the police and all security  corps who have sacrificed so much for the state and for Algeria.  Algeria will not forget these sacrifices, which aim to protect  the citizens and their property and defend this nation and this  people. I must say and stress that the state, with Mr. Liamine  Zeroual at its head, is opposing this violence and will continue  to do so until the situation quiets down and things return to  normal and until stability is restored, God willing. This will  be relentless until stability and tranquillity are restored so  that we can let our people choose their representatives. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

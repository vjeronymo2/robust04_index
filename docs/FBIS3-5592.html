Reports reaching Philippine National Police (PNP) Recom  [Regional Command] 4 Director Chief Supt. Romeo O. Odi  identified the fatalities as SPO4 [expansion unknown] Richard  Villena and P02 [expansion unknown] Ruben Hutalla, and those  wounded as P03 Bienvenido Sayson and Quezon 3d Police District  Director Chief Inspector Benjamin Belarmino.    In Fort Del Pilar in Baguio City, meanwhile, Defense  Secretary Renato S. De Villa ruled out the possibility of an  extension on the three-year term of Gen. Lisandro C. Abadia who  is scheduled to retire on 12 April as Chief of Staff of the  Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).    De Villa said that the defense department will submit before  12 March the final list of senior military officers who are  candidates to become the next highest official of the AFP.  Military sources said that among those recommended were Lt. Gen.  Arturo T. Enrile, Army chief; Lt. Gen. Thelmo Cunanan, Southern  Command chief; Vice Admiral Virgilio Marcelo, Navy chief; and,  Major Gen. Alfredo Filler, presently assigned at the Department  of National Defense.    Enrile, a member of PMA [Philippine Military Academy] class  62 who played a vital role in the December 1989 failed coup  attempt, is considered the most senior among the candidates.  Cunanan, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,  is scheduled to retire on 14 April. Belarmino, who was slightly  wounded and earlier reported as missing and believed to have  been taken hostage by the rebels, reported to his superiors an  hour after the ambush later and joined PNP and military  operatives in chasing the rebels.    Also leading the government operations against the fleeing  rebels, who are described as young men and women, are Quezon PNP  Director Supt. Edmundo Dizon and Army Lt. Col. Domingo  Panganiban of the 31st Infantry Battalion of the Southern Luzon  Command (SOLCOM).</p>

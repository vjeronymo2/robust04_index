			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Swedes oppose joining EC, says poll A MAJORITY of Swedes now oppose European Community membership, according to a new poll. It found that 53 per cent would vote No if a referendum on the issue were held now, the first time that opposition has broken through the 50 per cent level. Only 30 per cent are in favour of membership. Opposition is particularly strong among women, the under-30s and blue-collar workers. The anti-EC mood has intensified during the year, with March the last time more Swedes favoured membership than opposed it. A month ago, 45 per cent were against the EC, and 35 per cent in favour. The poll's findings will alarm not only Sweden's centre-right coalition government, but also the opposition Social Democrats. Both back the country's attempt to join the EC in 1995. A binding referendum on the issue is due to take place in 1994. Meanwhile, US credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's has given a significant endorsement to recent Swedish policy initiatives by maintaining its 'AAA' rating for the country. It highlighted the country's determined defence of the krona, tough measures to reduce the budget deficit and promised support for the financial system. 'Continued wage moderation and the government's stated plans to reinforce fiscal adjustment are the key near-term factors supporting Sweden's 'AAA' rating,' the agency said.</p>

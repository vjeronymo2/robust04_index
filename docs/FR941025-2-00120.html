			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. While BSFS, in its capacity as Named Fiduciary, has ultimate investment management responsibility for the Special Assets Portfolio, it does not exercise investment management discretion over the portfolio's assets on a day-to-day basis. Rather, as contemplated by the Court Order, responsibility for the day-to-day management and supervision of the portfolio's assets has been delegated at all times to independent investment managers selected by BSFS. With respect to the Plans' investment in the Stock, such responsibility was first delegated to Sunwestern Advisors, L.P. (Sunwestern), which served as the investment manager for this investment until July 14, 1992. Effective that date, Sunwestern's responsibilities were assumed by a new investment manager, Potomac Asset Management, Inc. (Potomac), which continues to serve in that capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Potomac, a registered investment adviser founded in 1978, is owned by three principals, all of whom are analysts as well as portfolio managers. In addition to the principals, Potomac has an experienced fixed-income manager, equity manager, and corporate finance consultant. In addition to its traditional investment management of $165 million in bond and stock portfolios, Potomac maintains a corporate finance business consisting of private placement consulting and monitoring for pension funds, fair market value analysis for various clients, restructuring and financing of private companies and related activities. Potomac has had experience in managing investments by multi-employer plans in privately-held companies, similar to the situation involving the Plans' investment in the Stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Potomac represents that aggressive efforts were made by Sunwestern to sell the Plans' Stock in 1991 and 1992. These efforts were unsuccessful largely due to the age of AHL's ships and market uncertainties created by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 1990). By the time these sales efforts were discontinued in mid-1992, no bona fide offers for any price above essentially scrap value had materialized. Under OPA 1990, every single-hull tanker engaged in the domestic petroleum trade must be converted to a double-hulled tanker or it will be phased out of service beginning in 1995, depending upon its year of construction. AHL's four tankers were constructed between 1957 and 1960. Therefore, AHL must either double-hull two of the tankers before the end of 1995 and the other two by the end of 1996, or those ships will be prohibited from engaging in the domestic petroleum trade. If AHL chooses not to double-hull the ships, it will have to depend on the less consistent grain, vegetable oil, etc. trade for business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Potomac represents that, in its judgment, there has been no change in market conditions that would permit a sale of the Plans' interest in the near term, and, more importantly by year end when the exemption pursuant to the PTE 79&hyph;15 Order expires. While AHL has returned to profitability (see reps. 10 and 11, below), the twin problems that plagued prior sales efforts (see rep. 8, above) still remain and make the sale of AHL on a going concern basis, in Potomac's opinion, a virtual impossibility. The only expressions of interest that Potomac has received since becoming investment manager in 1992 have consisted of casual inquiries concerning whether AHL would sell one of its vessels at slightly below scrap value. In addition, the scrapping of AHL's ships is not feasible at the present time due to existing contractual commitments. Currently, several of AHL's ships are on extended term charter and thus, with the possible exception of a single ship, AHL could not now scrap its fleet without abrogating its contractual obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

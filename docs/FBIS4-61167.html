			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ceslovas Skarzinskas: "The Peasant Party Is </F> Emerging in Vilnius, While Farmland Is Being Ploughed in  Dzukija..."]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Last Saturday [16 April],  the Lithuanian Union of Peasants held its second congress in the  assembly hall of the Ministry of Agriculture. This is,  probably, the oldest political and social organization of  Lithuanian peasants, which will celebrate its 90th anniversary  next year. Having emerged during the czarist times, the  Lithuanian Union of Peasants was a powerful party: It  participated in the government and successfully resolved  agrarian problems.    The restored Union of Peasants currently unites 420 members.  Certainly, it is not numerous, and it almost does not stand out  among other agrarian organizations. Speaking about the period  under review at the party's congress, Professor Petras Becius,  chairman of the Lithuanian Union of Peasants, said primarily  that the assets of rural people have almost been wasted, that  weeds are growing in many fields, and that food processing  enterprises are indebted to land workers. The professor, as  well as subsequent speakers at the congress, criticized the  government which is doing little to improve the situation in  agriculture. One of the most critical speeches was delivered by  Professor Ksaveras Purvinskas. "Recently," he said, "rumors  have been spreading that Lithuania does not need agriculture,  and that the latter is supported from the budget." At the same  time, the professor provided the following figures: If the  state procured agrarian produce from peasants for world prices,  the latter would earn even 2.5 million litai per year.  Therefore, said K. Purvinskas, they would not have to beg from  the state.    It is difficult to say where such statistics come from. One  thing is clear -- the produce of the Lithuanian agriculture is  overly expensive for consumers today. It is not accidental that  food exports must be continuously increased. The government is  doing its best to protect its own land workers. The delegates  in the congress may not or do not want to know this. They  should look for ways of getting out of this quagmire. Professor  K. Purvinskas also acknowledged this. It is necessary to  upgrade the cattle stock anew and produce a larger crop. Is it  normal that in most agrarian companies the annual milk yield of  cows does not reach even 3,000 kg, or that fertile soil produces  only 20 quintals of grain [per hectare]? This used to be the  case during the first years of collective farming. [passage  omitted]    Professor K. Purvinskas termed the government's program for  developing agriculture a "program for fooling land workers."  "Peasants have no other alternative than to unite in this  party," he said in conclusion. According to the professor,  neither rightists nor leftists have yet resolved agrarian  problems.    Many contradictory ideas were voiced at the congress. For  example, the law on two-three hectare land plots was discussed  extensively. Petras Becius said in his report that the party  categorically speaks out against this law. However, Albinas  Albertynas, member of the Lithuanian Union of peasants, who  addressed the congress later, emphasized the pressing nature of  this law. People are looking forward to the legalization of  these two or three hectares. A. Albertynas berated the party  program. According to him, such a program will not lead them to  power.    In general, the congress defended the interests of  landowners. As the delegates themselves admitted, however,  presently there are about 180,000 families whose parents or  grandparents did not possess any land before 1940. Those two or  three hectares are a source of subsistence for such families.  The Peasant Party proposes that the land which these families  have been working be granted to them free of charge. However,  another clause in the program as if cuts this proposal -- in the  first place, land must be unconditionally restored to  descendants of former owners! Thus, if this occurred, 180,000  families, whose parents were landless, would not receive those  two or three hectares, because there is a shortage of land in  Lithuania. [passage omitted]    The congress of the Lithuanian Union of Peasants devoted the  most of time to the difficult situation in agriculture, which,  incidentally, is no secret to every citizen. Both rightists and  leftists were scolded for this. Thus, the party is likely to  adhere to the centrist position.    It is difficult to say how this organization, which on  Saturday changed its name into the Lithuanian Peasant Party,  will manage to attract rural people to its ranks. Will the  latter approve of its program and vote for its representatives  in the new elections? There is only one issue that bothers land  workers today -- how to sow and plant this spring. In other  words, how to survive. One could become convinced of that on  the same day of the congress.    The congress elected Seimas [parliament] deputy Albinas  Vaizmuzis, who does not belong to any faction, chairman of the  Lithuanian Peasant Party. Petras Becius, Stanislovas  Liucvaitis, and Ksaveras Purvinskas were elected his deputies.  The congress also elected the council and executive committee  of the party. [passage omitted]</p>

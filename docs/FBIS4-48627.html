			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamic associations in the country held a general  assembly at the Niamey Central Mosque this afternoon to discuss  the draft family bill. A joint communique was issued at the end  of the meeting by six Islamic associations. An excerpt of the  communique is read here by one of the officials.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Considering that the  draft family bill [words indistinct] was imposed in confusion  and obstinacy on Niger with a population of 88.7 percent  Muslims, initiated and formulated by anti-Islamic people;  considering that out of the 906 articles of the family draft  bill, 603 of them run counter to Holy Koran regulations;  convinced that the present government which was elected through  free and fair elections cannot put any impediment to the  aspirations of Muslims; convinced that there cannot be  stability, [words indistinct] prosperity, [words indistinct] we  urge all Niger Muslims, whoever they are, to mobilize themselves  and ensure the failure through legal means of all attempts to  impose this bill on the Niger people.

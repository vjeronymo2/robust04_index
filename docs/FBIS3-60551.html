			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Keld Nissen: ``AIDS Information </F> Scrutinized''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE  introduction]    [Text] Information about AIDS has come to a halt in  Frederiksborg County, according to a former project staff  member. The County Council Association will look into the  situation in the other Danish counties. The Public Health  Administration is preparing a new nationwide AIDS campaign.    The County Council Association will now look into whether  counties are providing enough information about AIDS. This  action is being taken following criticism of inadequate  information efforts in Frederiksborg County.    After the short-term so-called CEN/LOK [central/local]  campaign in the Danish counties ended, the work of informing the  public about AIDS was supposed to be continued locally in an  effort to change people's attitudes and sexual behavior in the  long term.  <H5>  No Overview </H5>   Mayor Knud Andersen (Liberal) of Bornholm County, chairman  of  the County Council Association's hospital and health committee,  has no overview of whether the long-term AIDS information work  is functioning in the counties.    ``But I intend to look into how the campaign went and also  suggest new measures from the central office if they are  needed,'' he said.    The Public Health Administration is preparing a new campaign  on HIV and AIDS for 1994.    After the Copenhagen area and Arhus County, Frederiksborg  County is the area of the country that has the most registered  patients with full-blown AIDS, currently 62.  <H5>  Lack of Initiatives </H5>   Despite this the county does not provide people with enough  information about the disease, criticized Claus Krygell, who was  coordinator of the county's CEN/LOK campaign from 1991 to 1992.    ``The short-term goals--to increase people's knowledge about  the disease--was achieved to a large extent, but the county has  had little to offer since the summer of 1992,'' Krygell said.    The chairman of the county's AIDS committee, medical officer  Jens Steensberg, admits that information activity has declined  somewhat. This is due to changes in the county's administration  where AIDS information was not given top priority.    ``But if people from outside provide ideas for activities,  funds are available for them,'' he said.    Tove Tougaard, office manager of the county social and  health  administration, expects activity to pick up in the fall and  winter. The county is planning to distribute information and set  up condom dispensers at senior high schools and vocational  schools and is also planning activities for World AIDS Day, 1  December.    In the first half of 1993 around 8,000 condoms were  distributed in connection with information activity.    Bjorn Knudsen of the Public Health Administration's AIDS  office is of the opinion that the level of county activity  differs widely.    ``But it is natural to see a drop in activity after a  campaign,'' he said.</p>

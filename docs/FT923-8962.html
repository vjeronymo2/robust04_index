			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Russian reforms win IMF backing THE International Monetary Fund and World Bank yesterday threw their weight behind the economic reform efforts of Russia's President Boris Yeltsin. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, sought to allay fears that Russia and the IMF would be unable to reach agreement on a full programme of economic reforms. The World Bank, meanwhile, approved a Dollars 600m (Pounds 314m) 'rehabilitation' loan to enable Russia to purchase much-needed imports. Mr Camdessus indicated that the Dollars 1bn 'first tranche' credit approved by the IMF's board late on Wednesday was only the first stage of a 'phased programme of collaboration'. He acknowledged some slippage in Russia's reform efforts, but hoped the IMF would be able to approve a full standby agreement with Russia by the end of this year. The timing and scale of future IMF support, however, would depend on the strength of Russia's reform programme and its financing needs. It was 'absolutely essential' that Russia achieve the ambitious fiscal targets agreed with the IMF - a sharp 11.5 percentage point reduction in the budget deficit to 5 per cent of gross domestic product during the second half of the year. He also stressed the importance of Russia achieving much firmer control of its money supply. The IMF's initial Dollars 1bn credit was primarily a recognition of Russia's 'immense efforts' and 'remarkable achievements' in the past nine months, Mr Camdessus said. The credit line, which covers the next five months, was available without fresh conditions. Mr Camdessus indicated a willingness to show flexibility in assessing Russia's progress on reforms. The IMF was engaged in a 'damage control' exercise. Its aim was to help the country avoid hyperinflation and to keep the reform effort on track. If Russia sustained the momentum of its reforms, the next stage of IMF support would be a full standby agreement involving tighter conditions than the initial 'first tranche' credit. This would then be followed by a pegging of the rouble supported by a stabilisation fund. The World Bank loan, announced yesterday, is in two parts: Dollars 250m for imports by Russia's growing commercial private sector and Dollars 350m for priority imports by the health, agriculture, transport and energy sectors. The loan has a term of 15 years including an initial five-year grace period. The US House of Representatives yesterday approved a bill authorising Dollars 1.2bn in aid to the former Soviet Union. It was part of a wider aid bill which included a Dollars 12bn US contribution to the IMF. Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev last night warned about the threat of fascist dictatorship in Russia. Speaking on BBC television he expressed alarm about the depth of the economic crisis. The country was on the brink, he said. If the slump continued the population was likely to sweep away a government which could offer it no other policies. Dictatorship was likely to follow. Speaking of his own position, he said he had promised to support the government as long as it continued on the path of democracy and reform. If it ceased to do so, he would have to think again.</p>

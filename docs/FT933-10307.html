			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Kurd rebels kill 20 in Turkey KURDISH guerrillas stopped two minibuses travelling in the south-east of Turkey yesterday and gunned down about 20 civilian passengers and wounded 10 others, agencies report from Istanbul. Gunmen of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) stopped the minibuses near Bitlis in south-east Turkey and forced all of the estimated 30 passengers out of the bus and shot them, according to the semi-official Anatolian news agency. It said the wounded were flown to the town's state hospital by helicopters. Earlier, Turkish officials said a PKK rocket attack killed eight soldiers and two state-paid village guards at a military post near Yuksekova in Hakkari province, near the Iranian border, on Tuesday night. Two other soldiers and three village guards were badly wounded in the attack. More than 6,550 people have been killed in Turkey since the PKK began its fight for an independent Kurdish state in 1984.</p>

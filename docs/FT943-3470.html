			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Dairy court battle launched The Dairy Trade Federation yesterday started moves to mount a High Court challenge to the deregulation of the milk distribution industry in England and Wales. The industry body is seeking judicial review of the establishment of Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative to succeed the Milk Marketing Board. It alleges that the new body will create an unregulated monopoly which will force up the price of milk and other dairy products. The federation said it hoped the action would lead to new safeguards for consumers. The government has agreed that the assets of the Milk Marketing Board, which has been responsible for milk distribution for the past 60 years, should be transferred to Milk Marque, and is anxious that it should come into being without any further delay. Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, yesterday called on the government to halt the deregulation scheme. He said it would inflict 'real and unnecessary damage' on the industry. He urged Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, to protect the consumer and the industry from price increases and job losses, 'all of which are a direct result of the government's own actions'.</p>

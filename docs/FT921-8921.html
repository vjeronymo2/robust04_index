			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Rise in US retail sales gives hint of recovery US RETAIL sales jumped 0.6 per cent in January while previous months' figures were revised sharply upwards, providing tentative evidence that the economy is in better shape than some analysts feared. At the same time sales figures from the leading car manufacturers for the first 10 days of February were stronger than expected, suggesting a recovery of demand in the car industry. Preliminary figures showed domestic car sales running at a 6.4m annual rate, compared with the consensus forecast of 5.8m and a 6.1m rate of sales in late January. The revised sales figures - which do not allow for inflation - indicate that retail sales were flat in November and December. That is a big improvement on previous estimates, which pointed to declines of 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent, suggesting the Christmas season was not quite as bleak as previously portrayed. On Wall Street, the stronger than expected sales figures dashed hopes of an imminent cut in interest rates. Bond prices fell sharply and the dollar gained ground against leading currencies. Shares price also fell sharply, from record highs, on fears that monetary policy would not be eased in the near future. Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York said the latest figures could lead to a significant upward revision to estimates of growth in the fourth quarter. Many analysts, however, will hesitate to place too much emphasis on the retail figures. Figures for January can give a misleading signal of underlying trends because retailers strive to clear surplus stocks after the Christmas period. Other statistics remain gloomy. Figures for industrial production in January, due out tomorrow, are likely to show a sharp decline. The January sales figures, however, showed evidence of a rebound in most sectors. Car sales rose 0.4 per cent. Overall sales were 3.9 per cent higher than in January last year, which was artificially depressed by the Gulf war.</p>

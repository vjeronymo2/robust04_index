			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IN MAXIMUM SECURITY CELL;  </P> <P> O.C. ESCAPEE GETS SPECIAL ATTENTION IN SOUTH DAKOTA  </P> <P> The Pennington County Jail here on Kansas City Street is an unassuming, white  stone structure that houses about 100 prisoners.  </P> <P> At the moment, none of the prisoners is being watched more closely than Michael  Taylor, who had been the lone escapee remaining free following a November,  1988, breakout at the Orange County Jail and is a suspect in dozens of  robberies in California and the Midwest.  </P> <P> "He is classified as a security risk," Pennington County Sheriff Don Holloway  said. "He's in a maximum-security jail cell, and he's put in restraints when  taken around the facility. We're taking special precautions."  </P> <P> Taylor, 36, was arrested Saturday in this city of 52,000 when he tried to sell  several loose diamonds at a pawnshop, where a jeweler became suspicious of  Taylor and called police. Arrested along with Taylor was a woman who law  enforcement officials say is his common-law wife, Lisa Marie Prindes, 24. Also  arrested with Taylor was a man who first gave his name to police as David Meek  but later was identified as Raymond E. Williams, 24.  </P> <P> Like Taylor, they are being held at the Pennington County Jail without bail.  They are scheduled to appear before a state magistrate today for arraignment on  charges related to aiding Taylor, who was wanted on a federal fugitive warrant.  </P> <P> A 6-year-old boy and 2-year-old girl who were traveling with Taylor and Prindes  were placed in the custody of the state Department of Social Services. Police  have said that at least one of the children was fathered by Taylor.  </P> <P> Rapid City police released few details Sunday about Taylor's activities in  South Dakota.  </P> <P> Police Lt. Doug Noyes told the Rapid City Journal on Sunday that it appears  that Taylor, Prindes and Williams had been traveling from city to city for the  last 30 to 60 days.  </P> <P> Noyes told the newspaper that Rapid City seemed to be a place where they  stopped at the end of a travel day. He would not say what time they had arrived  in town or whether they had been there overnight.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FBI Got Tip  </P> <P> After a May 7 broadcast of Fox network's "America's Most Wanted," a television  program about fugitives, the FBI received a tip that Taylor and Prindes had  Nevada driver's licenses and possibly were living in Portland, Me., FBI Agent  Bucky Cox of the agency's Orange County office said Saturday. When agents  arrived at the Portland address, however, Taylor was not there.  </P> <P> Taylor was believed traveling along Interstate 90 when he stopped in Rapid  City, which is at the base of South Dakota's Black Hills, northwest of Mt.  Rushmore.  </P> <P> Interstate 90 runs from Rapid City to Seattle, near where Taylor once lived in  a home in which police found photographs of him posing in front of posters of  the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives.  </P> <P> While local authorities remained tight-lipped about one of the bigger crime  suspects to come through their city in some time, Rapid City jewelers and  pawnshop dealers chuckled about Taylor's amateurish attempt to fence some  apparently hot stones.  </P> <P> "The reason I didn't touch it, he was in here about 1:30, (and) said he had a  buyer at 4 p.m. but he needed the money now," said Pete Skovran, owner of  Landstrom's Jewelers on "St. Joe," the local shorthand for St. Joseph Street, a  main shopping thoroughfare downtown.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Didn't Like Sound of It  </P> <P> "I didn't like the sound of it," Skovran said. "I was going to call the police,  but I was tied up at the time with a Rolex customer."  </P> <P> Skovran said the diamonds were "pretty good-sized stones," including a  pear-shaped jewel that looked to be about three-quarters of a carat.  </P> <P> "He said they were 'VS1' stones -- very slightly imperfect -- and I told him I  would determine that," Skovran said.  </P> <P> Shortly after Taylor left Skovran's shop, the jeweler got a call from Darcy  Knight, manager of the Fair Deal Pawn &amp; Gun Shop on East Boulevard. Knight  told Skovran that Taylor had been in his shop, too, and that he was going to  call the police if he returned. Skovran agreed that that was a good idea.  </P> <P> Taylor also tried to sell diamonds Saturday to Butch McKinney, owner of Best  Pawn Shop on North Street, just a few blocks from Knight's business.  </P> <P> "He come in here and showed me four diamonds," said McKinney. Unlike Knight,  though, who became suspicious because Taylor was asking so little for what  appeared to be valuable jewels, McKinney found Taylor's asking price of $2,000  about 50% too high.  </P> <P> "We lowball the heck out of 'em," McKinney said Sunday. "I didn't get a chance  to look at 'em real good. . . . But they looked too clean, pretty flawless, and  that made me nervous. . . . I think they were sapphires myself."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clumsy Attempt  </P> <P> Taylor's clumsy attempt to get some quick cash contradicts his image of a  meticulous, sophisticated jewel thief, painted by some of his alleged robbery  victims and by longtime pursuers in law enforcement.  </P> <P> Taylor was awaiting trial in Orange County Jail last November for seven Orange  County robberies, including the theft of more than $100,000 in gems from a  Huntington Beach jewelry store last year. Los Angeles police said Taylor was  connected to other robberies in Los Angeles in 1988, and he was about to face  charges in 10 of those cases when he led four other prisoners in an escape from  the roof of the jail in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The five men cut through a wire fence at the top of the jail, then rappelled  down the four-story structure with a rope made from braided sheets while one of  two guards assigned to watch the roof area was away from his post.  </P> <P> The two guards were accused of not doing their jobs and were blamed for the  jail breakout. One was fired and the other was disciplined.  </P> <P> One inmate broke his leg in the escape and was caught immediately. Three others  were back in custody within a few weeks.  </P> <P> But Taylor, who eluded authorities, is suspected of stealing $450,000 worth of  jewels from a store in the Chicago suburb of River Grove last February after  abducting the store manager from her home in west Chicago. Chicago police say  he is a suspect in a number of other robberies as well.  </P> <P> Authorities in Orange and Los Angeles counties said the jewels and gold taken  in earlier heists may total $2 million.  </P> <P> Times staff writer George Frank in Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

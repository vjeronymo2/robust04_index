			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Technology: Banana genes to be split Ice cream bananas may be on their way to Europe and North America. Red, apple and finger bananas, too. These are names of unusual short-lived varieties of the yellow fruit that last just long enough for the lucky inhabitants of the tropics to eat. The rest of us have to make do with the Cavendish variety which can survive a long journey by sea and accounts for almost all the Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) a year European Union and US banana markets. Imports of exotic banana varieties could rise if research by UK drug company Zeneca and DNA Plant Technology (DNAP) of northern California comes to fruition. The two companies announced a research collaboration this month to find a way of slowing the rate of ripening in bananas. The work will combine DNAP's genetic engineering expertise with Zeneca's knowledge of banana physiology. Bananas ripen as a result of the action of the simple chemical ethylene, which acts as a hormone in the fruit. The work will try to identify which gene is responsible for controlling the release of ethylene and turn it off. Banana aficionados may revel in their new found choice of varieties, but the real benefit is likely to be felt among growers and buyers of the Cavendish variety, according to Chris White, editor of London-based magazine Eurofruit. 'The genetically-engineered banana might be used to raise quality in regions where there are production problems. Yield could improve, too, making cultivation worthwhile in previously uneconomic areas,' he says. DNAP says that slow-ripening Cavendish bananas should also taste better and even be more nutritious. As with many fruits, bananas are harvested while immature and left to ripen in transit. With adjusted genes, they could be allowed to ripen naturally before being cut down. Consumers will have to wait until early in the next decade before reaping a new harvest from the shelves of their local shops: Zeneca says that a product is unlikely to reach supermarkets before then.</p>

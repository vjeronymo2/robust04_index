The attack occurred at 2310 on 22 February, as was reported  by Cooperativa's newscast.    According to witnesses, a terrorist unit driving two  vehicles  fired at the school, seriously wounding three officer trainees  returning to spend the night at the barracks. The three were  shot several times.    The officer trainees were identified as Nicolas Rusich  Rojas,  20, who was wounded in the thorax, left leg, and right arm;  Gonzalo Hermosilla Grisama, 21, who suffered a serious bullet  wound in the middle of the right leg and other scratches  produced by splinters; and Raul Eduardo Arellano Blanco, 21, who  was shot in the right arm, right cheek, and left leg. The three  trainees were lucky to survive.    So far no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but  police speculate that they might be members of the Lautaro  terrorist group considering their modus operandi and the type of  semiautomatic weapons used during the attack. This is the second  attack in less than 24 hours in reprisal for the transfer of 45  terrorist prisoners from the former San Miguel prison and  preventive detention center to the so-called maximum security  jail. The first attack affected a Carabineros station in Nueva  Espana, in the Paradero 22 area on Ochagavia Avenue. On this  occasion, one worker was shot. Now three prison police agents  have been seriously wounded.    However, these were not the only incidents because last  night  the terrorist group also placed a bomb in front of Socialist  Party headquarters at 36 Concha y Toro, in central-western  Santiago. A specialized police unit deactivated the bomb, which  allegedly had been placed to protest the eviction by Carabineros  of terrorist prisoners' relatives who tried to take over the  site for a couple of hours.    Carabineros Investigative Police so far have not been able  to  locate the vehicles used by the terrorists in their attack  against the prison police school. Let us recall that less than a  year ago terrorists also attacked the Prison Police Security  Directorate, on (Carmen Conde) and Lavalle Streets, also in  reprisal for the situation of these terrorist prisoners.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An important news conference was held yesterday in  Washington with the participation of Reverend Lucius Walker,  Jesse Jackson, and Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel. Listen  now to a telephone conversation between reporter Zeneida  Costales and (Yuri Guerra), collaborator in the U.S.-Cuba  friendship caravan.    [Begin recording] [Costales] First of all, we would like to  know the main points discussed at the news conference.    [(Guerra)] Three matters were the focus of the news  conference: the two Canadian contingents that traveled from  Vancouver and Montreal to the United States, the ecumenical  alliance established between the Rainbow Coalition led by Jesse  Jackson, and (IFCO), the principal organization of the Pastors  for Peace; and two additional signatures of support to Rangel's  request for an immediate end to the embargo. This is a victory  for us -- acquiring new supporters for our cause through the  U.S. Congress.    [Costales] To your knowledge, what impact has this  conference  had on the U.S. media?    [(Guerra)] This news conference was covered by National  Public Radio at the national level. As you know, Rev. Jesse  Jackson is well known in the country and worldwide. This has  enhanced the importance of the event.    [Costales] We appreciate these words by (Yuri Guerra), a  collaborator in the U.S.-Cuba friendship caravan.</p>

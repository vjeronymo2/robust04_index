			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK Company News: S Lyles loss blamed on recession RECESSION at home and abroad left S Lyles, the West Yorkshire-based spinner and dyer, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 89,000 for the year to June 30, against profits of Pounds 1.4m. With falls in home and export markets turnover was Pounds 14.5m, against Pounds 16.7m. The fall overseas meant the company could not take advantage of the devaluation of sterling, while being hit by higher costs of imported materials. Mr John Lyles, chairman, said further steps had been taken to cut costs. Thirty jobs were shed during the year. After a tax credit of Pounds 190,000 (Pounds 364,000 charge) earnings per share were 1.39p (10.66p). The company will pay a second interim dividend of 1.75p, against last year's 3.35p final, and bringing payment forward from January to November. The total is 3.3p (4.9p).</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Refund of tax MY WIFE inherited a warden-controlled retirement flat from her mother in September 1990. We valued it for probate at Pounds 90,000 but the Inland Revenue re-valued it at Pounds 95,000 and levied inheritance tax at 40 per cent. We sold the flat for Pounds 82,000 in January 1993 and are claiming a refund of tax on this difference of Pounds 12,500. Are we justified in this claim? Irrespective of whether it succeeds, can my wife use this loss of Pounds 12,500 to offset gains made on sale of shares etc? We confirm that the inheritance tax legislation enables one, in the calculation of an IHT liability, to substitute the sale proceeds for the probate value if the property is sold at a loss within three years of death. As your mother-in-law died in September 1990 and the property was sold in January 1993, the relief might be available. A refund of IHT pursuant to this relief depends upon a valid claim being made by 'the appropriate person' - in this case, the person liable for the IHT attributable to the property. For example, if the executor of the will was liable for the tax, he must make a claim. IHT on specific bequests of land in the UK is usually borne by the executors unless the will provides otherwise. For capital gains tax purposes, your wife's base cost will be the agreed probate value of Pounds 95,000. She will be able to use the capital loss of Pounds 12,500, together with the indexation allowance thereon, against capital gains realised on a subsequent disposal of capital assets.

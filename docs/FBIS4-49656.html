			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, May 8 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangsu  Province has used more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars from the  World Bank since the country resumed its legal seat in the bank  in 1980.    The majority of the loans from the World Bank went to  powering the province's economic growth in sectors including  agriculture, industry, transport, energy and education.    The province now has over 20 such projects funded by the  World Bank, which have been completed or are under construction.    Of more than one billion yuan of the total investment the  province put into water control projects, over 100 million U.S.  dollars -- or 870 million yuan worth -- came from the World Bank.    So far, a group of water conservation projects has gone into  operation and brought about good economic returns for the local  people.    Construction of another giant irrigation project backed by  the World Bank is also well on its way. When completed in 1996,  it will benefit nearly four cities and 24 counties in the  province, with an increase in grain output estimated at one  million tons yearly.    In an effort to use the waste land and waters along the  coastline, several aquatic breeding zones with high production  of shrimp and prawns have been built with loans from the World  Bank.    To support the nationwide "spark plan" launched in 1991, the  province used 65 million U.S. dollars in loans to bolster the  technological development of its township enterprises,  collectively- owned firms and other economic group companies.    To date, 47 projects in this sector have been authorized by  the World Bank, an increase in annual output value expected to  reach 2.5 billion yuan.    The World Bank also financed the construction of the  province's infrastructural projects. A highway expansion  project leading from the provincial capital Nanjing to Shanghai  opened to traffic ahead of schedule thanks to timely funds  provided by the World Bank.    To ease the transport "bottleneck", loans from the World  Bank  were also used to tackle the "Grand Canal" in southern Jiangsu  to make it more navigable. Several bridges and ship lock  projects have already been completed and put into use.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Doubts remain over MoD housing Doubts over whether the Ministry of Defence will be able to plug a Pounds 500m gap in its 1995-96 budget by privatising its housing stock are to be unresolved until next year. Mr Nicholas Soames, armed forces minister, said yesterday a decision on whether to proceed with the transfer would not be taken until 'the first part of next year'. It was 'too early to be confident that such a transfer will be possible on terms which will satisfy our requirements'. Failure to raise the money would force the MoD to look for savings elsewhere in its budget, including possible cuts in procurement plans. Two months ago it abandoned plans to privatise the Pounds 3.5bn housing stock by setting up a non-profit trust, blaming 'technical difficulties'. It appointed NatWest Markets to advise on options. Mr Soames said in a Commons written answer that the initial work undertaken by NatWest Markets had been 'productive and encouraging'. The Ministry of Defence last night confirmed that 700 jobs are to go at the Rosyth naval base. Part of the base will remain open with more than 900 jobs as a Royal Navy Support Establishment.</p>

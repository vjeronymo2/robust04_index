			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND NOW, THE GOOD WORD ABOUT MADONNA  </P> <P> Really! All this fuss over Madonna. I find her no more objectionable than any  of the other airheaded, pretentious pop stars of today (Michael Jackson, George  Michael, etc.).  </P> <P> I don't know what the woman is like personally, but I do know that when I'm in  a disco and a Madonna tune comes on, I want to dance. After all, isn't that the  point?  </P> <P> FREDERIC COOPER  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

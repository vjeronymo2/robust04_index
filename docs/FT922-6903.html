			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (14): What to eat - and where to find it - Food THIS YEAR'S pistachio crop is in, and the barrows of Eminonu are weighed down by these deliciously salty nuts. Fresh dates have arrived from Tunis in the Misir Carsi - the Egyptian market. In Pandeli's, high above the Spice Bazaar, where in Ottoman times the merchants sat watching for the grain ships to arrive from Alexandria, tourists are now eating artichokes so huge they simply discard the leaves. They then tuck into Black Sea turbot and a quince compote doused in kaymak, the clotted cream made from buffalos' milk in the Belgrade Forest nearby. As the blossom of the Judas tree falls on the slopes of Eyup, the city's cooks look forward to the new season's ingredients - 'Napoleon' cherries as big as golfballs, figs from Izmir, and the wild Ottoman strawberries which are ever harder to find. Perhaps the prize ingredient is the aubergine, which finds its way onto restaurant tables in hundreds of different guises - as 'Patlican Salatasi,' a delicious wood-smoky paste, or 'Beykoz Kebab' where it is wrapped around tender chunks of milk-fed lamb. The best-known aubergine dish is the one swimming in olive oil, called 'Imam Bayildi' which, so the story goes, caused the Imam to 'faint' it was so mouthwatering. The variety does not stop there. In winter you can find quail and woodcock, and steaming cups of sahlep, a warming drink made from dried orchid root, which they serve on the ferries. Best of all is the Lufer from the Bosphorus. Some think this fish rivals the Scottish salmon. Stambouli's will tell you it betters it. Locals eat where they always have, in the numberless small lokantas throughout the city. Businessmen still lunch at the Borsa near the old Stock Exchange at Sirkeci, or at Haci Abdullah's and Haci Salih's on Istiklar, formerly la Grande Rue de Pera. The better-heeled often go to the Divan Hotel where the Circassian chicken should not be missed. In Istanbul it will be hard to go hungry - there is always the Doner Kebab sold at every street corner or the rows of charcoal braziers underneath the Galata Bridge where grilled fish is served on bread still warm from the ovens. Turkey's food is as varied as the many subjects of its former Ottoman empire  -refined and sophisticated after 500 years of culinary indulgence. Today it is widely acknowledged as one of the world's great cuisines. The Sheraton Tower on Taksim Square was one of the first to offer traditional menus. Revan, its restaurant, is renowned, and today takes its cooks from Bolu, a town still famous for supplying chefs to the palace kitchens in Ottoman times. Even the newcomers are waking up to what local cooking offers. Swiss Otel, Kempinski and Movenpick have recently opened, and already provide a wide range of international cuisine, from Chinese to French &amp; Japanese. The race is now on to bring the glories of Ottoman cooking to their tables. Kazan at Movenpick is set to open later in the summer. A Turkish restaurant is also planned at the Swiss Otel, with its staggering view of Topkapi, the Blue Mosque and Aya Sofia to the Sea of Mamara beyond - breathtaking at sunset. Kempinski has recently restored the Ciragan Palace where Mr Joachim Schmitt, the food and beverage manager, is endeavouring to rediscover the court cuisine of Istanbul. Original recipes of the palace kitchens are being translated with the help of 90-year-old grandmothers, today the only people who can still understand the imperial Turkish. The Ciragan could not be a more authentic location. This vast and ornate 19th century palace on the Bosphorus is where Sultan Abdul Hamid II kept his unwanted brother locked up for 30 years - just about enough time to try out the recipe books.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Observer: Novel delights A visitor to the smart new Gresham Street headquarters of College Hill Associates, a London PR firm, was much taken with the fancy wallpaper in one meeting room, cunningly disguised, trompe l'oeil fashion, as book spines. The 'shelves' are adorned with classic authors like Ibsen, Dante, Shaw, Racine and Austin. Austin? Must be the little-known British linguistic philosopher J L Austin, rather than the more famous Jane Austen. Adds a touch of class to the place, doesn't it?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with correspondent Roberto Cavada, who </F> is with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on his tour of South  America, by reporter Maria Elena Alonso from Montevideo, Uruguay  -- live]    [Text] [Alonso] We know you have been flying for several  hours now, that you have made several stops, and that there are  many important things to be said. We are going to turn the time  over to you because we know you have very little time to explain  all this to our listeners.    [Cavada] Thank you. We are transmitting live from Montevideo  for the Cuban people. It is raining and cloudy here. We arrived  in Montevideo just two minutes ago. Foreign Minister Robaina was  greeted at the airport by Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio  Abreu.    The work of this tour began last night during all the  obligatory technical intermediate stops that Robaina and his  delegation made. In Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Argentina,  Roberto Robaina met with the respective Cuban ambassadors of  those countries. There was contact with the national press.  Foreign Minister Robaina was interviewed by the NACIONAL  newspaper of Caracas and by Channel 11 of Bogota.    Another significant point was his conversation with  Colombian  Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio in Bogota with whom,  according to official sources of the Cuban delegation, he  discussed bilateral relations and the speculation by the EL  TIEMPO newspaper.    I reiterate, Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina has arrived in  Montevideo. The Cuban delegation was greeted at the airport by  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu. We have confirmed that  Robaina will be meeting with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto  Lacalle within the next few hours.</p>

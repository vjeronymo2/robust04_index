The immediate objectives of the control programme, among  others include the reduction and prevention of mortality and  foetal wastage in pregnant woman by 70 per cent, mortality in  infants and children by 60 per cent, morbidity due to malaria in  pregnant women, infants and school children by 60 per cent, all  in five years.    For the same period of five years, the control programme is  expected to reduce fatality rate due to malaria by 80 per cent  in all health institutions in the Central Region and to reduce  malaria transmission by 50 per cent.    According to the Malaria Action Plan for the Central Region  1993-1997, a copy of which is available to the GRAPHIC, the  campaign will make anti-malaria drugs available and affordable  to the general population and promote their rational use.    The programme will also ensure proper treatment of pregnant  women as early as possible and make early diagnoses, prompt and  adequate treatment of malaria cases at all health centres.    ``The control programme shall increase the awareness of the  general population about the risk of malaria so as to promote  community participation in malaria control activities in the  context of Primary Health Care (PHC),'' states the action plan.    As part of the programme, the use of impregnated bed nets  will be introduced to all second cycle boarding institutions in  the region in 1994. The first phase of the programme will last  for five years and the second segment will start after the first  phase.    The control activities will start in all the 12 districts of  the region simultaneously and each district will have an  inter-sectoral committee to supervise the control programme.    The action plan prepared by Dr Richard Y. Osei, Regional  Director of Medical Services, therefore, expressed the hope that  all communities will co-operate with the eradication team to  achieve success.    In 1992, Cape Coast District recorded the highest malaria  cases of 24,484 patients representing 23.10 per cent of the  total regional recording of 102,025 malaria cases.  Awutu-Effutu-Senya district recorded the least cases of 3,010 or  2.1 per cent of the regional recording.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Roadbuilding programme set for small cuts The outcome of the long-awaited review of Britain's Pounds 23bn roads programme, due to be announced on Wednesday, is expected to show a trimming of roadbuilding schemes rather than deep cuts. Most motorway-widening schemes are set to stay largely intact in spite of fierce protests from lobbyists and backbench Tory MPs. The overall reduction in planned roadbuilding activity may be no more than 10 per cent or 15 per cent. This is unlikely to ease pressure on the department from MPs of all parties and from other government departments. Transport 2000, a pressure group, said: 'It is likely to intensify rather than quell concerns about the roads programme.' Road priorities have been under review since last August, when it became clear that the 10-year Roads for Prosperity programme, launched in 1989, was falling well behind schedule. The aim is to reduce planning blight - the adverse impact on property prices from roadbuilding announcements - and to allow the department to speed up work on the most realistic schemes. The present programme involves nearly 500 projects, including the widening of 600 miles of motorway, expanding single-carriageway trunk roads to dual carriageway and building more than 150 bypasses. It also includes upgrades of the A1 and A74 to motorway standard. The review has taken traffic forecasts into account. It is expected to confirm existing government policy to improve existing roads rather than to build new ones and to avoidupgrading radial routes in large cities. There is not expected to be any radical change in the environmental criteria applied to road schemes. The British Roads Federation said it expected the government to go ahead with motorway widening plans because of their economic importance. It said: 'We don't expect the motorway network to grow much over the next 100 years so the roads we have must have a high capacity.' The RAC said it did not expect large cuts in the roads programme but it was concerned that some bypass schemes might be dropped. Publication of the roads review is expected to coincide with the launch of the government's Highways Agency. This will take over responsibility for the road building and maintenance programme to speed up schemes and reduce costs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A delegation from  the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) is to arrive  in Hangzhou before this Saturday [30 April] to hear briefings on  the "Qiandao Lake accident" by mainland experts, according to an  announcement by Taiwan's "Mainland Working Committee of the  Executive Yuan".    Since the cause of the Qiandao Lake boat fire has come to  light, the mainland's Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Straits (ARATS) has twice invited SEF and experts  concerned to come to Zhejiang to hear briefings by mainland  specialists.    Sources from Taibei [Taipei] said that the Executive Yuan's  mainland committee and SEF agreed on going to Hangzhou after a  meeting last Saturday night.    The Qiandao Lake accident happened on March 31, when three  armed locals robbed and burned 32 people to death, including 24  Taiwanese tourists, on a pleasure boat which was cruising on  Qiandao -- or Thousand Island -- Lake in central Zhejiang  Province.</p>

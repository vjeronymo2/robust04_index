			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Audioline buys Southwestern arm AUDIOLINE, the privately-owned consumer electronics group run by Mr Harry Moss, has acquired Southwestern Bell Telecom's UK telecommunications business for an undisclosed sum. Southwestern, one of the Bell regional telephone companies in the US, began marketing its products in the UK in 1987 and has built up branded equipment sales of about Pounds 15m a year. Under licensing agreements Audioline will continue to use the BELL symbol and the Southwestern Bell Telecom and Southwestern Bell Freedom Phone brand names in marketing cordless and corded telephones, answering machines and payphones. 'The acquisition is complementary to our current business,' said Mr Moss. 'It enables us to expand product lines as well as enter new areas such as cordless phones and payphones where SBT had a strong market presence.' Audioline, which has annual sales approaching Pounds 40m claims to be the second largest telephone equipment supplier in the UK. Southwestern will focus on its growing UK cable television and telecommunications interests. It has 55,000 cable television customers.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some comments also noted the need to train employees for seasonal work during the off-season. To accommodate this need, the regulations provide an exception to the 6-month limit for up to 120 days of training following initial appointment and up to 2 weeks a year thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We did not adopt suggestions to exclude all excepted appointments from the regulatory time limits. The conditions justifying exception from competitive hiring procedures do not always dictate that appointments be limited to 1 year. In fact, the situation most commonly cited as requiring employment longer than 2 years (24 months) was for research projects. Most excepted authorities covering research positions provide for appointments in increments longer than 1 year. Such appointments are not covered by these regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Continuing Authority for Appointments Outside the Competitive Examining Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As several commenters noted, the authority to make temporary appointments for most positions using applicant supply file procedures is currently set out only in Chapter 316 of the Federal Personnel Manual. That chapter will be terminated on December 31, 1994, as part of FPM sunset. We are incorporating the authority in the revised regulations. We are also adopting an agency's suggestion to remove all grade level limitations. (The current authority does not apply to positions at GS&hyph;13 through GS&hyph;15.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We did not adopt suggestions to authorize term appointments outside the register or to permit temporary appointments to be converted to term appointments without further competition whenever the need for an employee's services exceeds original expectations. These suggestions are outside the scope of our regulatory proposal. OPM service centers may, however, continue to authorize term appointments outside registers when there are insufficient eligibles on an appropriate register. Agencies that have delegated examining authority may also elect to fill temporary and/or term positions through those registers. If the same register is used for both temporary and term appointments, applicants who would have been within reach for term appointments may be converted without further competition. We have clarified this provision in the regulations. This provision will not apply when positions are publicized and applications are solicited solely for temporary appointment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Reemployed Annuitants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have not incorporated in the regulations the authority, now contained in provisionally retained FPM Chapter 316, for unlimited extensions of temporary employment of reemployed annuitants. That authority is no longer needed. When the FPM provision was established, certain annuitants (e.g., those over age 70) could be employed only on a temporary basis. That is no longer true. Annuitants may now be employed under any type of authority_permanent, term, or temporary_that is appropriate for the job being filled. However, under 5 U.S.C. 3323, reemployed annuitants serve at the will of the agency. Therefore, agencies need not designate their appointments as temporary in order to retain flexibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (including small businesses, small organizational units, and small governmental jurisdictions) because they apply only to Federal employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Part 213 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government employees, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Part 316 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government employees. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Office of Personnel Management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James B.

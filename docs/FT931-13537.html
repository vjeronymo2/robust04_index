			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Talks over controlling stake in IMI collapse TWO YEARS of tortuous negotiations for Italy's savings banks to buy a controlling stake in IMI, the treasury-controlled financial group, have collapsed. This leaves the way open for Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank that is the largest such institution in the country, to bid for the treasury's 50 per cent stake, valued at L4,000bn (Dollars 2.73bn). The government is under pressure to obtain an early sale since the revenues were intended to form the bulk of privatisation proceeds in the 1992 budget. The deal originally envisaged Cariplo and ICCRI, the savings banks' umbrella institute, jointly acquiring the treasury's 50 per cent in IMI on an equal basis through a holding company, Fincasse. ICCRI, in view of the L2,000bn price for its 25 per cent in IMI, persuaded the treasury to make a new offer. This would have involved Cariplo and ICCRI paying L3,200bn for 42 per cent of IMI, split equally in Fincasse. ICCRI balked at the price, but the deal foundered because the savings banks were convinced that Cariplo intended to have the controlling hand  - a concern that surfaced last Wednesday, when Cariplo insisted on having the presidency of Fincasse and giving this office a double vote on the board. 'ICCRI was being asked to pay the same money but risked being treated as a passive partner,' said one banker familiar with the deal. Some also suspect that Cariplo has long wanted to bid for the entire treasury stake, which would have created Italy's third-largest banking and finance group. Mr Guido Carli, the previous treasury minister and former governor of the Bank of Italy, strongly promoted the sale of IMI to the savings banks, believing there was a natural synergy. The sale also promised to encourage the process of concentration within the fragmented network of regionally-based savings banks, of which there are around 80.</p>

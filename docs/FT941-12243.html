			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Shares sink after sacking of Polish minister Share prices fell sharply on the Warsaw stock exchange yesterday as investors reacted to the dismissal last Friday of the minister in charge of privatising the banks. Sentiment was also affected by weekend warnings from Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, finance minister in the last Solidarity-led government, that the stock market 'bubble' was about to burst. Shares of the recently privatised Bank Slaski led the declines, falling the maximum permitted 10 per cent to 6.1m zlotys yesterday. It was first quoted last week at 6.7m zlotys, 13.5 times more than its public offer price. High profits for early investors caused the political row which led to the dismissal of Mr Stefan Kawalec, deputy finance minister, and sparked off a power struggle between the governing Peasant party (PSL) and Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) over control of the banking and insurance sectors. Trading was heavy as most of the other 22 quoted companies also fell by up to 10 per cent, the daily limit. Turnover reached 4,442bn zlotys (Pounds 136m) with a record 131,784 trading orders received. Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the PSL prime minister, dismissed Mr Kawalec, against the wishes of his finance minister, Mr Marek Borowski, who has demanded an explanation in writing. Mr Borowski, a member of the SLD, the largest party in the government, said he wanted to see a report from the official audit and control body before deciding Mr Kawalec's fate. Mr Osiatynski, of the opposition Democratic Union, claimed at the weekend that the PSL was merely trying to gain control of the banking sector. 'I think the prime minister is interested in having a say on the make-up of the state bank supervisory boards, which is where the jam is,' he added. Mr Kawalec, a professional economist highly regarded by foreign bankers, entered the Finance Ministry in 1989 together with Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, a pioneer of Poland's free market reform. He is not a party politician and opposition parties believe Mr Borowski is not so much interested in saving Mr Kawalec as in ensuring that the key banking post stays under SLD control.</p>

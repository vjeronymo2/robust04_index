			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, 19 Jun (AFP) -- The entry by approximately  150 Cubans into three embassies in Havana is a "provocation by  enemies" of Cuba who could "have some sort of organization in  the country." This was said to EL PAIS, a Spanish daily, by  Carlos Lage, executive secretary of the Council of Ministers and  a close aide of Fidel Castro.    Lage, a 42-year-old pediatrician, recalls that Cuba grants  exit permits to whoever wants to travel and notes that "no one  involved in this type of incident can leave the country." The  only solution is for the refugees in the embassies "to leave  with our guarantees that there will be no reprisals against  them," he added.    Lage, who is also one of the persons responsible for Cuban  economic reforms, defended the "socialist model" and the  "fundamental" role of a planned economy, but did not reject  "openings to the private initiative" or "private work" in  certain sectors. He noted Cuba's encouragement of tourism and  foreign investments (an example of which is the sale of 49  percent of the shares of the telephone company to a Mexican  enterprise) and its transformation of state farms into  cooperatives.    Regarding an eventual political change, Lage was blunt:  "Cuba's problems are of an economic nature, and the solutions we  need are of an economic nature." "It is possible" to improve  the political system, "but not through elections aimed at  producing a multiparty system," he said.    Regarding speculation that some day he could succeed Fidel  Castro, he said: "I do not believe I am the right person."  "Besides," he explained, "here there is someone who is second in  command in the country's leadership; that is Raul Castro.  Castro's replacement is thus already known."</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Markets: The lessons of a German sideshow - London Markets THE FLAMES over Los Angeles vividly demonstrate that these days, happily, continental Europeans are somewhere in the Isthmian league of social unrest, down with the equivalents of Wivenhoe, Carshalton, or Bognor Regis. Still, though the strikes and political upsets in Germany by now look a side-show, they have direct implications for UK financial markets. The short run effects are already visible - a firming of the pound, a closing of the gap between UK and German interest rates, a relatively more favourable view of the UK as a political risk. By the end of the week, the pound was trading at DM 2.93, up only  1/2 a pfennig on the week. But the margin by which UK short-term interest rates exceed those in German had narrowed to half a percentage point, compared with 0.8 points at the start of the week; and the equivalent spread for long-term rates had closed to 1.2 percentage points, compared with nearly 2 points at the beginning of April when electoral uncertainty was at its height. A Pounds 2.5bn auction of gilts, on Wednesday, received a warm response, with investors - including some from overseas - eager to bid high for the stock. Equities failed to demonstrate a corresponding degree of enthusiasm. The FT-SE index closed the week at 2659.8, up 16.8; after the first post-election surge, on Friday April 10, it has risen only 3.3 per cent. This week's lack of enthusiasm may reflect the view that, in the longer term, the implications of the German developments are not quite so favourable. The Bundesbank - now, in effect, Britain's central bank too - is trapped between two forces. One is the need to raise interest rates still further, in the face of stubborn inflation. The second is need not to rock the boat at a time of political strains within the governing coalition in Bonn. If, as a result, the Bundesbank does nothing, the outlook for the German economy is stagflation: slow growth, persistent inflation, high interest rates. Tied to those interest rates through the ERM, the UK risks suffering similar growth consequences, though in the immediate future the return of consumers' confidence will help ensure a healthy first phase of the recovery. Equities will benefit, however, if another of the week's developments points the way to a healthier gilt market towards the end of the year. On Monday, Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, warned of a 'tight public expenditure round' in the negotiations between the treasury and the spending ministries that start start in the summer. Chancellors always say something like that at this time of year; the next phase of the softening-up process, due shortly, produces equally traditional headlines like TOUGHEST SPENDING ROUND IN YEARS, SAY MINISTERS. There are grounds for thinking, though, that this time the wolf has come. On Monday, Lamont spoke of the need to keep 'a very wary eye on the fiscal position over the medium term,' which is treasury language for spiralling deficits as far as the eye can see. If John Major is serious about aiming for low inflation and low taxes, his government has every incentive to bite the spending bullet in the first year of a new term. We will know how far Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has succeeded in doing this when the public spending white paper is published in late autumn. A serious attempt to rein back the future growth of the deficit would make the UK gilt market much more attractive; and lower gilt yields would produce a corresponding upwards revaluation of equities. All that lies ahead. In the short-term, the market has the takeover battle for Midland Bank to chew on. Or rather, it hasn't: though both Lloyds and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation are keen to buy Midland, neither of them has made a formal bid. The Hongkong Bank has issued a 59-page press release as a sort of harbinger of the offer document due by May 12, on which Schroders, its adviser, is now working hard. The price to be offered for every Midland share, says the press release, is one share in HSBC, the Hongkong Bank's London-based holding company, plus a bond valued at Pounds 1. At Friday's closing prices, that valued Midland's shares at 402p. On Tuesday, Lloyds issued a heavily qualified indication of its desire to bid. It, too, has come up with a price, one Lloyds share plus 30p for every Midland share. That values its target's shares at 437p. Meanwhile, Midland closed yesterday at 381p, up 51 per cent since the first public indications that a bid was on the way, in March, but still 19p below the lower of the two bids. There is clearly a great deal of doubt about whether the Lloyds bid will get past the competition authorities; but there is a lingering scepticism about the prospects for the Hongkong Bank bid, too. Perhaps Sir Peter Walters might remain chairman of an independent Midland after all? If so, he will have time to turn his attention to another of the week's minor trends: the growing difficulties company chairmen seem to have in controlling annual general meetings. Sir John Quinton, Barclays' chairman, was splashed with white paint immediately before the bank's agm on Thursday by an unidentified protestor. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI and one of Barclays' non-executive directors is said to have joked: 'I hope it was Dulux'. If he did, he got his come-uppance the next day: on Friday, at his own company's agm, he was electronically barracked by tape recorders hidden in environmental protestors' briefcase. Company chairman will soon be forced to adopt the motto of the Sardinian camorra: an injury to one is an injury to all.</p>

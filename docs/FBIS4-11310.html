			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 23 Apr (PL) -- Today, Patricia Gutierrez, a  guest at The Nation and the Emigrants conference being held in  this capital, said the groups of ultraconservative Cubans living  in the United States are increasingly losing their influence  over the rest of the community.    In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, the daughter of  Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, who was imprisoned in Cuba for 22 years  for conducting activities against the revolution and who later  traveled to the United States, talked about the failure of the  last-minute attempts by the aforementioned groups to recover  their lost political ground.    In this context, she even mentioned the recent spreading of  false rumors in Miami regarding the health of Cuban President  Fidel Castro and the attacks against the emigrants who are  participating in the current talks in Cuba.    Gutierrez said she was pleased to be able to personally  prove  the falsehood of these reports. She said she believes in Fidel  and in Cuba and was pleased to be on the island for the first  time because she was born and raised abroad but recognizes Cuba  as her fatherland. She noted the hospitality received since her  arrival and the positive experiences at the conference. I  believe the meeting is the first big step, she said and added  that she is willing to contribute to the fulfillment of the  nation's dreams.    In another part of the interview, she criticized U.S.  intervention in Cuban affairs and said she is opposed to the  U.S. blockade of the Caribbean island. Gutierrez said she  opposes any return to the past in Cuba, which she described as  useless. She said the group that supports that position among  the Cubans living in the United States is a majority, although  very silent at times, for fear of attacks from the recalcitrant  minority.    Proof of this -- and this is important in Miami -- is that  there were no unfavorable farewells to all those who came to the  conference in response to an invitation from the Cuban  Government, she said. I believe it is a message from those who  live there because love is always stronger than hate, she said.    Patricia Gutierrez said she supports the search for  solutions  to matters such as the simplification of immigration paperwork,  which interests those living outside of Cuba. She said she is  optimistic about the meeting's success which has gathered over  200 emigrants in the capital of her homeland.</p>

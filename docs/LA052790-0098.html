			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PSYCHIC SHOPPERS AT EXPO FIND AISLES FULL OF VISIONARIES  </P> <P> Thea-Dianne McCall had paid $5 to have her aura analyzed Saturday, and she  wanted her money's worth.  </P> <P> She handed a photograph of herself to a clairvoyant interpreter at Energy  Vision, one of hundreds of promotional booths at the Whole Life Expo, a new age  fair at the San Diego Convention Center through Monday.  </P> <P> "You're forgiving yourself for being born into a female body. You have a lot of  enthusiasm," the dark-haired interpreter said, pointing to a golden glow around  McCall's head. "There's an image of a witch here. It looks like your mother put  it there. It's affecting your self-image."  </P> <P> McCall nodded and wandered over to another interpreter, a tiny blond woman who  was complimenting a customer on her "nicely-shaped" blue aura. McCall wanted a  second opinion. She didn't get it.  </P> <P> "Uh, it's the same thing she said," said the blond, who looked suddenly tense.  </P> <P> Not to worry. Between the aromatherapy and the ecstasy breathing, the bee  pollen and the Relaxman glasses, there were dozens of tension remedies on  display in the cavernous exhibit hall. And for every peddler of diet  supplements and subliminal cassette tapes, there were 10 people eager to  believe that self-fulfillment waited at the next booth.  </P> <P> Touted as the world's largest showcase of "leading edge issues, products and  personalities," San Diego's first Whole Life Expo was more than a psychic  shopping trip. As well as lectures and panel discussions featuring such big  names in consciousness-raising as Timothy Leary and Terry Cole-Whittaker, the  Expo also attempted to address "key issues": substance abuse, environmental  degradation and financial investment.  </P> <P> "Typically, this show has concentrated on 'new age' subjects such as  metaphysics, crystals, UFO's, channeling and psychics -- but times have  changed," said Joy Jacot, the Expo's producer. "We've expanded our focus."  </P> <P> Indeed, among the 300 exhibitors, there were several booths that sold re-usable  canvass shopping bags, water purifiers and other eco-conscious products. But  mostly, the vendors seemed to be selling self-improvement -- and all the health  and optimism that comes with it.  </P> <P> There were nutrient drinks with names like Natural Drive, GreenMagma and  Megafood. There were brain synchronizers -- glasses, fitted with flashing  lights and earphones, that enhance creativity, vendors said, by emitting tones  that help the brain's right and left hemispheres work together. There was a man  who said that magnets have been known to cure cancer.  </P> <P> "With the appropriate magnet, you can kill 85% of all types of pain. The more  severe the pain, the quicker the results," said Dr. Jesse F. Partridge, a  magno-therapy expert whose booth was flanked with graphic color photographs of  a man with a large growth on his nose. After a magnet was held over his nose  for three hours a day, Partridge said, the bump went away. Partridge said he  had the pictures to prove it -- or most of them, at least.  </P> <P> "The worst one, I had to quit showing. It made the ladies sick," he said.  </P> <P> Ken Anderson, the co-owner of Mental Building Blocks, described his subliminal  cassette tapes for children as "the most lasting love gift you'll ever buy."  </P> <P> Anderson said his grandchildren listen to the tapes every night while they  sleep. On each hour-long cassette, there are 10,000 positive affirmations --  including, "I love myself. I am beautiful. I am loved. I am love." -- all set  to a rhythmic music that imitates a mother's heartbeat.  </P> <P> "If they sleep eight hours, that's 80,000 loving repetitions that goes into  their little minds," Anderson said. "It doesn't make zombies out of them. The  little buggers come out swinging."  </P> <P> Helen Pappas, a director of Mr. Bee Pollen in Newport Beach, beckoned to  passers-by with two gold antennae that bobbed on her head. Bee pollen has been  known to reduce blood pressure, correct allergies and solve sexual problems,  according to a pamphlet Pappas offered.  </P> <P> "You can live on bee pollen alone," she said, pushing a tiny spoon into a bowl  of yellow granules. "It's not only energy, but a source of well-being. We call  it the life changer."  </P> <P> Rob Potter, an associate of the Laguna Beach-based pyramid vendor Pyradyne  Inc., urged people to put pyramids on their heads.  </P> <P> "Pyramids make your brain waves go into Alpha," he said. "All our pollutions in  the air are eating up our life force, or prana. The pyramid delivers prana to  the brain. On a clean healthy planet, you wouldn't need to wear a pyramid on  your head. But . . . "  </P> <P> Potter paused, and then confided: "A lot of this technology is extraterrestrial  in nature."  </P> <P> At the booth labeled Psychic Perceptions by Joyce, Joyce Zakrajsek furiously  drew circles on a note pad as she spoke quietly to a customer. In a few  minutes, Joyce stopped scribbling, hugged the customer goodby and bit into a  breath mint.  </P> <P> "The energy point is in her hand," said her manager, Nicholas Joseph,  explaining to the next person in line why she had to wait for the next $25  channeling session. "This drains her. She needs to go charge herself."  </P> <P> Nearby, Tessa, a delicate woman in black tights, offered to unfold life's  promises via computer astrology.  </P> <P> "I need your birth-time," Tessa told a woman who was waiting to pay $25 to have  her life progression analyzed, a year at a time, using secondary progressed  planets.  </P> <P> "I only know Hawaii time," the woman said.  </P> <P> "That's no problem," said Tessa.  </P> <P> Despite the Expo's hard-sell, not everyone was sold.  </P> <P> One woman, fresh from a psychic consultation, pooh-poohed the advice she'd been  given. "I have to learn to trust men? Give me a break," she said.  </P> <P> Another man eyed a steady stream of people who took turns standing under  something called an Ion Shower, a nozzle that had no visible output at all.  </P> <P> "You should open up a booth right now, selling oceanfront property on the  moon," the man muttered. "I'll tell you, you'd make a killing."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report in the "Caucasus" column: </F> "Chechnya's Army Has Been Put on Alert. The Republic Is Ready  To Resist the Expansion of the State of Emergency Zone in  Ingushetia"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Federation Council Deputy  Valeriy Fateyev, who recently visited the zone of the  Ossetian-Ingush conflict, stated that the draft edict on  extending the state of emergency in its present shape must not  be signed under any circumstances. According to the deputy, it  is important to "neutralize" the influence of politicians who  "draft such edicts" and furthermore understand why they do this,  he stressed. Mr. Fateyev said that such an approach contradicts  the interests of the peoples of Russia and the North Caucasus  because it will undoubtedly evoke a negative reaction from  Chechnya and Ingushetia, which will aggravate the situation even  more.    The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria has already responded to  the  proposed option for stabilizing the situation in the emergency  zone. Groznyy's official statement disseminated yesterday says  that "the attempt to spread the emergency regime in the zone of  the Ossetian-Ingush conflict to these areas will be seen by  Chechnya as an act of open armed aggression." "The Chechen  Foreign Ministry regards this as interference in the republic's  internal affairs and in the event that Russian troops are  positioned here, will view this as armed aggression," Chechnya's  Foreign Minister Shamseddin Yusef stated in an interview with  INTERFAX. According to him, in this event the republic will  reserve the right to curb invasion of its territory by a foreign  army. [passage omitted]</p>

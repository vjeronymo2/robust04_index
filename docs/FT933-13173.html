			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Pole put forward to head EBRD MR Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister, was yesterday nominated as one of the candidates to succeed Mr Jacques Attali as president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The nomination of Mr Balcerowicz, who was responsible for leading Poland's 'shock therapy' transition to a market economy, came amid strong signs that the post will go to a western candidate. Nominations for the vacancy, created by Mr Attali's resignation last week after the row over lavish spending, close today. Mr Henning Christopherson, the EC economics commissioner, is thought to be the other of two candidates whose written nomination was received at the bank's London headquarters yesterday. The French government, however, has notified Mrs Anne Wibble, the Swedish finance minister and chairman of the EBRD's board of governors, of the candidacy of Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France. Mr de Larosiere is regarded as the leading contender. The French government claims wide international support for Mr de Larosiere's candidacy, although the prime target of its lobbying has been fellow EC countries. France has claimed a moral right to field the successor to Mr Attali, following its 1990 arrangement with Britain that the bank would be based in London in return for France providing the EBRD's president. Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, the Polish central bank chairman, submitted Mr Balcerowicz's nomination yesterday afternoon. She pointed out in her letter to the bank's board that no candidate from eastern or central Europe had yet been considered. Since he left the finance ministry in 1991 Mr Balcerowicz has been lecturing, although he has advised the Ukrainian and Lithuanian governments on economic reform. Although he was praised by western governments for steering Poland through the most difficult part of its economic reforms after 1989, his candidacy faces difficulty in gaining widespread support from western governments.</p>

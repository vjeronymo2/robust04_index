			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spurt in oil prices drips away  -Demand for refined products dries up OIL PRICES were slipping downwards yesterday as fears of a petrol shortage in the US receded and a short spurt of demand for gas oil in Europe evaporated. Strength in the price of refined products had pushed the crude price as high as Dollars 20 a barrel in the Brent market earlier this week. As the weather turned unseasonally cold in Europe this week, demand for heating oil rose and helped support the crude price. At the same time, the low level of gasoline stocks in the US dragged up crude in the New York market. But these were fairly shakey foundations for a price rise since underlying demand is showing few signs of picking up and any tightness in the second quarter could quickly be relieved by ample world supplies. As Europe and the US warm up from this week's cold spell, the demand which pushed heating oil prices up by Dollars 5 to Dollars 198 a tonne is disappearing as quickly as it arrived. Traders who had piled into the market to buy oil on Monday were rushing out again yesterday when North Sea Brent crude for June delivery lost much of the gain it had made earlier in the week to trade at Dollars 19.30 a barrel. Crude prices had been strengthened by the decline in the flow of oil from the North Sea because of heavy maintenance work and the discipline with which Saudi Arabia and Iran are disposing of their stocks of oil in floating storage. But most of the production disruption in the North Sea has now been reflected in the current oil price, and if output is slightly higher than expected, as some oil companies were indicating this week, prices could drop further. North Sea output is expected to be 400,000 b/d lower in April than in March at 1.5m b/d, rising again to 1.8m b/d in May. Shell said recently that by early May it hopes to boost production from its Brent pipeline, which is currently shut down for the installation of emergency shutdown valves. In addition, while Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed not to push the oil they hold in floating storage on to the market, the movement of Iranian tankers from the Bay of Cadiz off Spain this week has caused concern in the market. Traders think that Iran may be starting the sale of its oil to the US. While concern still exists in the US over the low level of petrol stocks, a steady flow of imports into the north-east is starting to erode these fears. Gasoline stocks have sunk to historically low levels in the US, but demand is also depressed. Petrol prices of around Dollars 250 a tonne for prompt delivery are almost Dollars 30 higher than futures prices which offer gasoline for delivery in August, indicating a short-term tightness in the market but not a sustained rise in demand. Demand for petrol in the US dropped by 3 per cent in the first quarter of the year, and although some pick-up is expected in the next couple of months as the nation enters its peak driving season, consumption is not expected to be higher than normal. Fears of a petrol shortage in the US lifted crude prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange to over Dollars 21 a barrel earlier this week. But as some technical buying dried up, the June futures contract slipped to Dollars 20.47 a barrel US stocks of petrol are currently some 25m barrels below the low end of the seasonal range and, at 205m barrels, are right at the minimum operating level set by the government. Imports of petrol to the US dropped significantly during the Gulf crisis when high petrol prices and strong demand in Europe sucked in deliveries that would traditionally have gone to the US. In the first quarter, gasoline imports dropped from last year's level of 360,000 b/d to 200,000 b/d. But Mr Ken Miller, a consultant at the US firm of Purvin and Gertz, believes that fears of a petrol shortage are exaggerated. 'Imports are now starting to pick up, demand remains low and refineries are increasing their output of gasoline.' European refining margins are dropping back after rising to Dollars 3 a barrel this week on the back of strong gas oil demand. The margin refiners can claim over crude oil slipped to just Dollars 1 a barrel last week from a peak of Dollars 11 in February when the Gulf war was still underway. As the strength in the market for refined products disappears, oil prices are dropping quickly. While Saudi Arabia and Iran are not flooding the market with crude from their floating stores, there is still some competitive pressure between the two which could ease prices down. The oil market is currently searching for a direction and, if that direction is not to be overwhelmingly downwards, there needs to be a substantial pick-up in demand or evidence of further production cutbacks.</p>

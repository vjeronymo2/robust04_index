			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / People: Supervisory role for Sir Dennis at the Bank The Bank of England has achieved a notable catch with the appointment of Sir Dennis Weatherstone, the retiring chairman of the US bank JP Morgan, as an independent member of the Bank's board of banking supervision. Sir Dennis will succeed Sir Peter Leslie, the former deputy chairman of Midland Bank, and serve for a five-year term. The board is responsible for overseeing the work of the Bank's supervisors in its financial stability wing. Sir Dennis, who has taken an interest in supervisory issues relating to financial derivatives in his work with the Group of Thirty senior banking executives, will be the best known of the six independent members of the board. The Bank yesterday made no secret of its delight at having attracted Sir Dennis to the board. Figures of equal weight, such as Sir David Scholey of SG Warburg, tend to sit on the Bank's governing Court rather than its supervision board. Sir Dennis, who will be 64 on his retirement from the helm of JP Morgan at the end of the year, has become a notable figure in the international debate on derivatives, leading calls for banks to self-regulate their activities. At the monthly meetings of the banking supervision board, he will have access to all supervisory reports on UK banks, as well as being able to quiz Brian Quinn, executive director for financial stability, on the department's work. The bank's supervisory department has been overhauled since being criticised over its handling of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and several new senior officers have been brought in. Sir Dennis was thought to be a possible candidate to become governor of the Bank when Eddie George was appointed. Lord Swaythling, whose term on the board expires at the end of the year, has been appointed for a further five-year term.</p>

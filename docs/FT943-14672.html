			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Rexmore shares rise as recovery continues Rexmore, the contract furnishings group, saw its share price jump 6p to 88p yesterday as a continuation of the strong recovery shown halfway was reflected at the full year stage. And Mr Michael Rosenblatt, chairman, said he was looking for a further increase in the year ahead. Group pre-tax profit for the year ended April 2 1994 came out at Pounds 1.5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 1.4m. This is the first annual profit since 1990-91 when the group achieved Pounds 1m and follows a first half profit of Pounds 688,000 (Pounds 143,000) Group turnover from continuing operations was virtually static at Pounds 32m (Pounds 31.1m). Discontinued operations produced sales of Pounds 676,000 (Pounds 8.96m) and operating losses of Pounds 70,000 (Pounds 659,000). In the group's main business - the supply of upholstery fabrics and related products - turnover rose from Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 29.6m, producing operating profits up from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2m. The pre-tax figure was struck after reduced interest charges of Pounds 247,000 (Pounds 649,000) with gearing coming down from 13.9 per cent to 7 per cent. Also charged were losses on discontinued operations and asset disposals of Pounds 313,000. Mr Rosenblatt said there had been little improvement in the group's market, but profit for the first quarter of the current year was ahead of that in the comparable period last time. The annual dividend is lifted from 1.75p to 2.5p with a final of 1.5p. Earnings per share were 9p (7.7p losses).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Communications Services spokesman </F> Jose Antonio Roche -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Let us go to Jose Antonio  Roche, of the Communications Services here in Cuba. Renzoli [not  further identified] said, privately, that wild changes are being  made here in all the nation's telephones. Good morning, Roche.    [Roche] Good morning. Well, with the objective of  reorganizing the telephone network in the city of Havana so as  to allow the possibility of increased numerical combinations, at  the telephone exchange for those numbers that begin with a seven  and have five digits, as of Friday 29 April, people will have to  add an eight to the number, giving those numbers six digits. For  example, the number 7-2020 will, as of Friday, become 78-2020.  This measure is being taken by the telephone company to  reorganize its boards [pizarras] here in the capital.    [Announcer] So, now you know.    [Roche] The phone numbers beginning with seven will, as of  the 29th, have six digits. People must now add an eight after  the initial seven.</p>

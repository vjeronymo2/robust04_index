			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / US data point to solid growth in next half year NEW government economic data yesterday showed the US economy to be gaining strength, lending weight to predictions of solid growth in the next two quarters. The Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, published yesterday, showed a rise of 0.5 per cent in September after a 0.9 per cent gain in August. The leading index, designed to predict movements in economic activity, climbed to reflect an expanding money supply and buoyant orders for consumer goods, and higher share prices and increase demands for building permits. The index fell in the first half of this year, stabilised in June and July and climbed in August and September. At the same time, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes rose by 21 per cent in September to their highest level in seven years. New home sales jumped to an annual rate of 762,000, 13 per cent higher than a year earlier. Home sales have benefited from mortgage interest rates at their lowest level in 25 years. Rates averaged 6.91 per cent in September and have since slipped a little lower. Most regions showed large increases, with sales rising 28 per cent in the south, 24 per cent in the Midwest and 15 per cent in the west. Only the northeast showed a decline in sales of 7 per cent. Last week, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes also jumped in September. Mr Ed Yardeni, economist with brokers CJ Lawrence, said this pace of home sales was probably not sustainable, and the rate would be likely to decline in October. 'Nevertheless, housing activity is clearly stronger, and will add to economic growth this quarter,' he said. Economists said both the index of leading economic indicators and the home sales statistics were consistent with forecasts for stronger growth in the second half of the year. Initial government estimates of GDP published last week showed growth in the third quarter at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent, and some economists now predict the economy will expand at a rate above 4 per cent in the fourth quarter, before subsiding in the new year. 'Our current fourth-quarter estimate is 4.2 per cent, and the risk to that number is probably on the upside,' said brokers Merrill Lynch. Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist with Economic Advisors, a Boston consulting firm, is more cautious, predicting growth of around 3.0 per cent in the fourth quarter and lower growth in the first half of next year.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Adam Hela, honored physician of Ukraine and </F> chief physician, "Kashtan" Sanatorium, Truskavtsi, and Stepan  Trokhymchuk: "Our Diseases Ride Railways"]    [Text] Misuse of our natural resources, environmental  pollution and the generally poor state of sanitation have had a  very negative impact on the health of our population. We wish to  address one such problem and bring it to the attention of the  government, ecologists, health workers and the citizenry.    Almost two million Ukrainians ride the railways every day,  representing some four percent of the population. The average  trip is 110 km and takes about three hours. Later the passenger  comes down with furunculoses, digestive disorders, headaches and  even viral hepatitis, diphtheria, dysentery or some other  infectious disease. Rarely are these conditions connected to the  railroad trip, the most popular and easily accessible form of  transportation for local and long-distance trips.    The fact is, modern railroads are a serious health hazard.  They are used for the transportation of vast quantities of solid  and liquid substances that spill along the tracks and at  railroad facilities and threaten every living thing. These  substances include coal, petroleum products, acids, alkalis,  poisons, mutagens and carcinogens. The most dangerous factors  are infectious agents that contaminate passenger cars and are  derived from human wastes that foul areas adjacent to the  railroads.    In addition to the colon bacillus, human fecal matter also  contains hundreds of other infectious agents, among them  viruses, rickettsia, streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci,  vibrios, bacilli, protozoan cysts, eggs of intestinal worms,  fungi, and so on. Many of them survive outside the human body  and pose a danger for days or weeks, and some even persist for  months and years.    In addition, unsanitary conditions in lavatories lead to the  spread of other agents via expectorations and saliva responsible  for tuberculosis, diphtheria, syphilis, typhus, and malaria.  Soviet press informed us at the end of the 80s--in connection  with the pre-perestroika and pre-glasnost amnesty of political  prisoners-- that of the almost one million prisoners in jails  and concentration camps 100,000 suffered from tuberculosis, half  of them with open cavities. On his way home from a  `re-educational' institution a single such returnee was in a  position to infect three to five other passengers.    In general, 25-50 passenger trains move along the major  corridors in a day; on some days this figure approaches 80. The  average trains consists of 15 cars with 50 passengers, or 750  passengers per train. If only one passenger uses a lavatory and  flushes 100 grams of feces, then one kilometer of the track  becomes covered with 5-10 kg of fecal matter every day, which is  equivalent to 2- 3.5 tons a year. It would take a heroic effort  to estimate the numbers of viruses, bacteria, protozoans and  fungi that accumulate along the trains, are stirred up by the  train movement, and then enter the compartments as aerosols via  windows and doors to pollute the internal air and settle on all  the surfaces. They are disseminated for distances that measure  tens of meters away from the railroad tracks, contaminating  plants, soil, ground and subsurface waters and infecting  thousands of humans.    In addition, the number of foreigners using our trains is on  the increase. Many of them are from tropical countries and serve  as carriers of disease agents to which we have no immunity and  physicians lack experience in dealing with them. This matter is  all the more serious since the general level of immunity in our  population diminished two-fold during the last half century,  particularly after the Chernobyl tragedy, rendering us more  susceptible to communicable diseases. As a result, infections  are becoming more severe than was common previously. Not only do  the train passengers suffer, but so do their families and all  who come in contact with their infected clothing, possessions,  and food.    Conductors, engineers, maintenance and service personnel are  also exposed, and have a higher morbidity than the population at  large. In fact, there are special tuberculosis sanatoria for  railroad workers.    Our bacteriologic studies at the Lviv railroad station on  passenger trains and other sites were yielded devastating  results and would have had a shocking effect if published in the  popular press.    Control of human waste is easy and inexpensive. Special  removable containers can be attached to railroad lavatories and  at the end of the trip emptied into methane tanks. The latter  produce methane fuel as a result of fermentation, while the  solid residue is transformed into high quality fertilizer.  Biotechnological processing of human waste is ecologically  sound, cost effective and socially beneficial as it protects  public health. Finally, sanitation of the railroad cars also  must be improved, including sterilization of air in lavatories  with quartz lamps. Surely our lives and health are worth such  efforts.</p>

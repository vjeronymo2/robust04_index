Cautioning against "fashionable and politically correct"  solutions to trade problems, Sir Leon distanced himself from  recent suggestions made by U.S. President Bill Clinton during  his maiden trip to Europe as head of state.    In an address to the Centre for European Policy Studies one  month after the successful conclusion of the GATT Uruguay round,  the senior British commissioner also warned the U.S. against the  use of unilateralism in trade disputes, and against  strengthening retaliatory powers under Section 301 of the U.S.  Trade Act.    "The U.S. will have to understand that it has committed  itself to the multilateral process that I have described however  tempting domestic policy considerations may be to resort to  unilateral action."    His words may irritate the Clinton administration, which has  pledged to be "even tougher" in tackling unfair trading  practices in the post-Uruguay round era. It may also raise  hackles in the U.S. Congress, which is due to consider  ratification of the Gatt accord this year.    In his speech, Sir Leon described the agreement last month  as  just as significant as the creation of the GATT itself in 1947.  It provided a new framework for open trade in services, a clear  timetable for resolution of trade disputes, significantly lower  tariffs in industrial products, and a binding agreement to  reduce subsidies and protection in farm products. "It is more  difficult for the law of the jungle to prevail," he said.    Before leaving for talks in Brussels with Mr Peter  Sutherland, director-general of GATT, Sir Leon added that it was  important to produce better offers on market access before the  February 15 deadline.    He singled out Japan as needing to improve offers on white  spirits and liqueurs, though Tokyo has countered that the EU and  U.S. deal on agriculture and offers on electronics is also  unsatisfactory.    On labour standards, Sir Leon expressed concern that it  could  lead the EU into unprofitable arguments over human rights and  could be hard to administer. He also noted that the agreements  attached to the NAFTA free-trade agreement by the U.S., Canada  and Mexico provided only for signatories to apply their own  rules rather than impose standards from the outside.</p>

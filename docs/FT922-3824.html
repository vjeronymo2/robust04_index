			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Exports lead textile recovery EXPORTS are leading a patchy recovery in the textiles and clothing industries, according to the sector's trade association. In its latest quarterly report, the Apparel, Knitting and Textiles Alliance (AKT) found that textile and clothing exports rose 9 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn in the first quarter of this year, compared with that period last year. Imports edged 2 per cent higher to Pounds 2.1bn. Domestic sales 'remained stagnant despite extensive price cutting', the AKT said. Retailers continued a cautious approach to ordering, which encouraged the manufacturers' drive for exports. Mr Colin Purvis, AKT director, said: 'We are getting better at exporting, especially to markets in southern Europe.' Clothing exports grew 10 per cent to Pounds 445m, helped by a sharp rise in sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States, albeit from a low level. The largest export market remains Ireland, with Germany and France close behind. Textile and clothing imports from the rest of the European Community rose by 16 per cent, partly counterbalanced by a 7 per cent fall in imports from the US. The AKT has not published employment levels this quarter because government estimates are 'unreliable'. Mr Purvis said Department of Employment figures overestimated employment in the industry.</p>

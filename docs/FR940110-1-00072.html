			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another option would be that where funds other than funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided under the AHP are the predominant source of financing for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an AHP-assisted rental housing project and the monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities of such other funding source are sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the project's compliance with the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP, as committed to in the AHP application, the monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement would be deemed to be fulfilled. However, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring activities of such other funding source are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to determine the project's compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the AHP, as committed to in the AHP application,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank would be required to monitor the project by conducting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections, at least on a sample basis, as determined by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank, based on the amount of the funds received by the project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the AHP, the type and complexity of the project, or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors deemed relevant by the Bank. In the alternative, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring activities of such other funding source are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to determine the project's compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the AHP, as committed to in the AHP application,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could the Bank rely on monitoring activities of the predominant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding source as long as it is monitoring for compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that are substantially similar to the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board specifically requests comments on how random sampling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be used to monitor AHP-assisted rental housing projects to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether, during the long-term period committed to in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP application, the project's units continue to be affordable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application. For example, sampling could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve monitoring a portion of AHP-assisted rental projects at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed intervals. The sampling method could be devised so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each project is monitored at least once during the long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period committed to in the AHP application. Alternatively, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sampling method might be structured so that some, but not all,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP-assisted rental projects are monitored during the long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act requires that the AHP regulation must ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP will be used only to assist projects for which adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term monitoring is available to guarantee that affordability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and other requirements of the Act are satisfied. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(C). The Board requests comments as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether it is appropriate to interpret this requirement in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner that permits monitoring to be done by sampling that could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in some AHP-assisted rental projects not being monitored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the long-term period committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Board specifically requests comments on whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there are sampling techniques that would ensure that each project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is monitored in satisfaction of the monitoring requirement in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Monitoring of special needs projects. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.14(f) of the proposed rule sets forth the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for monitoring a project that commits to meet a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> special need pursuant to proposed &sect;960.10(d)(3), either through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing units for persons with a special need or through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing a special service to occupants, as defined in the Bank's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP implementation plan.

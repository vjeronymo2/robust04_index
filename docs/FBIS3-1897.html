The participants including representatives of the United  Nations and other international organizations will also take  part in the second session of the fourth executive committee of  the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and  Development (AFPPD).    The 10th Asian parliamentarians' meeting on population and  development will be held according to a proposal made by the  executive committee of the AFPPD at its fourth meeting held in  Kuala Lumpur, capital of Malaysia, last October.    This is also the first meeting to be held in China sponsored  by the Asian Population and Development Association (APDA).    The meeting is aimed at further enhancing exchanges and  cooperation on population among parliamentarians of these  countries.    The main topics of the two-day meeting are about the issue  of  population and development and women in the 21st century --  strategy for prosperity and peace.    Zhao Dongwan, leader of the delegation of China's National  People's Congress (NPC) and chairman of the NPC Education,  Science, Culture and Public Health Committee, will address the  meeting at the opening ceremony.    Since its founding in 1982, the APDA has provided financial  aid to meetings of the AFPPD. It also sponsored nine Asian  parliamentarians' meetings on population and development, all of  which were attended by delegations from the NPC.</p>

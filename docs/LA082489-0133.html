			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: 23-YEAR EQUITY CHIEF CONFIRMS RETIREMENT  </P> <P> Rumors had been going around for months, but Edward Weston, Western Regional  director of Actors' Equity, has now officially confirmed that he will retire  from his post at the actors' union on Sept. 1, 1990 -- one week after his 65th  birthday.  </P> <P> "It would be foolish to deny it," said Weston, who played a controversial and  contradictory role in what became known last year as the "Equity Waiver Wars."  </P> <P> Weston, who was the chief designer of the 1972 Equity Waiver Plan (whereby the  union waived certain rules, though not its jurisdiction, in theaters of fewer  than 100 seats, thus freeing actors to perform and to produce themselves in  small venues) became one of the plan's chief opponents 16 years later, after he  became convinced that it was being abused.  </P> <P> A modification of the Waiver, proposed by the union's Western Advisory Board  and voted in by the Los Angeles membership, resulted last year in a lengthy and  bitter dispute between Equity and local small theater operators (many of whom  were also Equity members) who wanted the vote rescinded.  </P> <P> Allegations of improprieties, predictions of doom and gloom, and a lawsuit  eventually resulted in a mutually acceptable modified plan. But Weston took a  lot of personal abuse from unhappy Waiverites during the year-long struggle. He  acknowledged Wednesday that the badgering had influenced a decision he had  begun to make a year and a half ago.  </P> <P> "W. C. Fields said, 'It was a woman who drove me to drink and I never wrote to  thank her.' If the Waiver people did hasten my decision," Weston said, "I'd  like to thank them now.  </P> <P> "We had predicted there would be no problem (implementing the new plan) and  there isn't," he continued. "I wish it could all be put into proper  perspective. It's the least thing we do in the (Western) office, but the  enormous emphasis on the Waiver has been disruptive and has distorted  everything else we do. We cover 14 Western states."  </P> <P> Weston who is 64 today has held his current post for 23 years. Asked if he had  any interest in using his final year in office to try to enlist the  entertainment industry in helping to fund live theater, Weston said: "We're  still trying to get the film and television industries to contribute money to  our people with AIDS. They refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem. Why  would we get them to acknowledge anything else?"  </P> <P> On a personal level, Weston hopes to lead a less structured life after  retirement, he said. "I hope to travel at a more leisurely pace; I love to read  books that have nothing to do with theater; I might even go back to school to  learn French and history; I hope to continue teaching (he teaches a graduate  class in arts administration at UCLA). It's stimulating and rewarding to work  with bright young minds. It gives me a great deal of hope. It's also nice to be  Professor Weston," he quipped.  </P> <P> And he mentioned the de rigueur item for any self-respecting Hollywood  resident: "I have an idea I'd like to peddle to a movie producer. As it is now,  I don't have the time. You know the lyrics from 'On the Town,' " said this  former Broadway hoofer. " 'Where has all the time gone?/ Haven't done half the  things I want to do' . . .  </P> <P> "Mind you, I still love Equity," he said. "It's been my life for almost 40  years -- 40 next year. There's been no fight. No explosion. Just a decision to  make a change. I still think Equity is an organization that's underestimated by  its membership. Theater is a cottage industry and Equity a cottage union, but I  like it that way.  </P> <P> "What I don't want to deal with any more is hostility, especially the kind that  was so prevalent in L.A. during the last few years. I got tired of dealing with  people with little minds and big mouths. I'm not going to identify who these  people are, but if the mouth fits. . . ."  </P> <P> Asked who his successor might be, Weston said that the decision would be up to  the union's governing council in New York, adding, "Certainly I think that  George Ives (the Western office's senior business representative) is uniquely  qualified for the job."  </P> <P> (Alan Eisenberg, Equity's executive secretary stated Wednesday that he hopes to  announce a replacement by the end of the year.)  </P> <P> SPACE ANYONE?: The Mark Taper Forum's search for a third theater continues.  "We've been looking diligently for a space that would accommodate a 250- to  300-seat theater -- ideally flexible staging," said artistic director Gordon  Davidson. "Existing spaces are not really right. I'd like to find a raw space  -- an empty supermarket, a garage or a warehouse. It's costly to convert, but I  believe we'll come up with something some day."  </P> <P> The new space eventually would house the activities of Taper, Too and the  Taper's Improvisational Theatre Project (its children's theater arm). The  current Taper, Too space, Davidson said, would revert to being the Taper Lab,  one of its earlier incarnations.  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Willis limbers up for bout over Australia's budget: A look at the open season for economic plans April may prove to be the cruellest month for Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's new treasurer. Between now and early May, he must negotiate a budget which wins the backing of two minor parties, both working to fairly radical tax and social reform agendas, and yet keeps the Australian economy and the government's ambitious deficit reduction plan on course. This consultative budget process is the bequest of Mr John Dawkins, Mr Willis' predecessor, who bowed out of political life in December. Only hours before his unexpected resignation, the former treasurer completed a new system bringing forward Australia's budget date from late summer to May 10 and introducing specific pre-and post-budget negotiation periods. The Dawkins plan was a recognition of the difficulties facing Mr Paul Keating's Labor government in the Senate. Since the government lacks an outright majority in the upper house, it depends on the support of the Green party, the Australian Democrats, and one independent senator to get its measures passed. The inherent dangers became evident last summer when the minor parties baulked at tax proposals contained in the 1993-94 budget. For two months the finance bills were stalled. International investors, aware that a prolonged impasse could prompt a dissolution of parliament, took fright and the currency fell sharply. The new discursive approach was Mr Dawkins' way of preventing similar debacles, and it is Mr Willis who must put the process into action. Already, he has hit some hurdles. The minor parties prevaricated over their participation in the process and having decided they would, they duly presented lists of desired changes. The Democrats want a 'tax and spend' package. Extra revenue measures would include a minimum company tax rate of 20 per cent; a more progressive income tax system so that those earning over ADollars 70,000 (Pounds 33,500) would pay a marginal rate of 51 per cent and face a higher Medicare levy; and a 20.4 per cent withholding tax on interest payments. These revenues would then fund a near ADollars 5bn increase in expenditures, with much of the money going on social programmes - providing work for the long-term unemployed, for example - and on infrastructure projects. In many respects, the package dovetails with the demands of the Labor party caucus and with those of the powerful union movement. This seems to ensure some support within Labor's own ranks. The package also includes some corporate 'carrots' which might appeal to smaller businesses. The two Green senators are more radical still. They question the desirability of pursuing economic growth at all. 'There are very strong arguments that in high-income countries such as Australia, economic growth does not contribute to improved quality of life,' they suggest. This philosophical difference aside, the Greens' package has similarities with that of the Democrats - namely, higher taxes on top earners, a corporate tax floor, and a carbon-based energy tax. Mr Willis, perhaps wisely, has offered only sketchy information on the budget plans and has committed himself to little beyond his predecessor's deficit reduction targets. According to four-page 'fiscal framework' document which set off the negotiation process, the aim is to have the 1994-95 deficit stand at just under 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Priority measures will include help for the long-term unemployed, industry and regional development and implementation of the Native Title legislation. Government ministers have also played down the imposition of new taxes, although failing to rule out the possibility. It is true that Australia's strong economic performance in the last quarter of 1993 would seem to provide Mr Willis with some latitude. But government critics note significant lingering weaknesses. The 4 per cent GDP growth last year was largely due to an uptick in personal consumption, the continuing surge in housing expenditure, and a strong export performance. Business investment, by contrast, was flat in the final quarter and down by more than 12 per cent year-on-year. With the need to ensure that growth picks up steadily and does not result in a sudden import surge, the treasurer cannot afford measures which risk either price stability or the low interest rate regime. The big question, then, is how hard the minor parties will push the demands  -and what sticks the government can wield to keep their demands in check. Already, Mr Keating has lashed out at the 'unrepresentative' nature of the Senate, and talked of changing the system by which senators are elected. (It is currently a proportional representation system based on the country's individual states.). Such a move would be highly contentious, particularly since the Democrats are generally judged to have used their marginal power astutely. But such threats intensify pressure on the minor parties. It is heady mixture of bluff and bluster, and is likely to dominate Canberra for several months.</p>

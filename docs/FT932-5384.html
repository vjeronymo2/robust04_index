			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Ukrainian MPs urged to ratify Start 1 treaty SENIOR Ukrainian leaders yesterday urged MPs to ratify the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (Start 1) on nuclear disarmament on the first day of what is likely to be a protracted parliamentary debate of the issue. The US, which has become increasingly concerned about Kiev's failure to fulfil its pledge to ratify the arms pact, is likely to take heart from the Ukrainian leadership's strongly anti-nuclear stance and from the fact that parliament has finally begun to discuss the Start 1 agreement and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. But they could be concerned at reported remarks by Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma to a closed parliamentary session, in which he said that Ukraine should declare itself a nuclear state and temporarily keep a part of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal, according to deputies attending the meeting. Ukrainian government officials emphasised that the treaties will only be put to a vote after extensive parliamentary debate. Judging by the overwhelmingly hostile reaction of MPs to the government's position, Ukrainian officials face an uphill battle. Western leaders are worried that Ukraine's hesitation to ratify the Start 1 treaty and the associated Lisbon protocol, which would remove all nuclear weapons from Ukrainian territory, and to accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear state, could undermine the international disarmament process. 'Ukraine is acquiring an image as an unreliable partner in international relations,' Mr Anatoli Zlenko, foreign minister, told MPs, urging them to ratify the treaties. 'There is no doubt that reaction in the West will be decisive in any attempt by Ukraine to become a nuclear state,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] One of our teams, consisting of Valerie Fourniou  and Jean-Francois Hoffmann, was in Hutu country today, in the  Gisenyi area in the north of the country, where what remains of  the legal government, which fled Kigali, has taken refuge.    [Fourniou] [passage omitted] In Gisenyi, the Meridien Hotel  has become a rear base of the provisional government. All the  ministers have a room there, and to meet the prime minister we  will need to be escorted. Far from Kigali, dressed in military  fatigues and sitting in an armchair belonging to this hotel, he  will tell us that the aim of his army was never to exterminate  the Tutsis:    [Begin Jerome Bicamumpaka, identified as prime minister of  Rwandan interim government, recording] There was no deliberate  desire by the government to exterminate any ethnic group. I  think this is when people have been talking of genocide. That  there should be a war, that there should be a war that could be  described as ethnic or otherwise--this is not the first time  that such a phenomenon has been seen in the world. So there was  an ethnic clash, it is true, but there was no deliberate desire  by one group to exterminate another. [end recording]    [Fourniou] Yet, outside the hotel we found men from the  regime's militia, the Interahamwe, the ones responsible for  numerous massacres of Tutsis, the personal guard of the minister  of defense, who has also retreated to Gisenyi. At the head of  40,000 men, for him the enemy is not only the RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front] and the Tutsis:    [Begin recording] [Augustin Bizimana, identified as defense  minister of the Rwandan interim government] I am not saying that  we are just fighting the RPF. We are fighting Uganda.    [Fourniou] You consider you are at war with Uganda?    [Bizimana] With Uganda, yes. As minister of defense I can  say this quite openly. We are at war with Uganda. We know that  there is support from Belgium. We know the Americans--initially  and wrongly, they were mistaken--supported the action by the  RPF. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

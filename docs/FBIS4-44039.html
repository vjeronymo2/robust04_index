			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that the  government is trying to find rooted and lasting solutions to the  country's problems. Addressing the True Path Party's  parliamentary group, Ciller said that great advances have been  achieved in the struggle against terror. [passage omitted]    Ciller said the Turkish government will continue to support  a  just and realistic solution in Cyprus to be attained through  negotiations. Noting that the Greek Cypriot side has adopted an  intransigent attitude, Ciller added that the attitude adopted by  Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus, has proven that the Turkish Cypriot side favors peace.    Ciller recalled that the U.S. Congress will be adopting a  bill stipulating that the arms to be sent or sold to Turkey in  1995 cannot be employed for domestic security purposes and added:    [Begin Ciller recording] I view these developments in the  U.S. Congress as a great injustice against our country and  people. The U.S. Senate is actually telling us that U.S. arms  will not be employed in the struggle against the PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan], which the U.S. Administration has  explicitly described as a terror organization and whose  international links are well known. Such a condition is  tantamount to supporting terror and remaining a spectator to  attempts to divide Turkey. [end recording]    Ciller stated that the attitude of the U.S. Congress can be  linked to efforts being exerted by a group acting with prejudice  against Turkey and the Turkish people. She noted that the  government will do all it can to rectify this injustice, adding  that a delegation composed of parliamentarians and press  officials will be sent to the United States to clarify the  issue.

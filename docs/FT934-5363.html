			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Kalamazoo sustains revival with Pounds 2.5m Kalamazoo sustained its revival in the six months to September 30 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.53m, against a restated loss of Pounds 936,000 last time. Fortunes started to revive at the computer services and printing systems group in last year's second half as losses in its printing systems division were brought under control. The division made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 730,000 in the period, against a first half deficit of Pounds 1.51m. But as Kalamazoo concentrates on the expansion of its computer services business, the future of the printed systems business within the group looks doubtful. Mr Peter Harrop, the chairman, said that he did not perceive the necessity of a fire sale. During the first half, computer services contributed Pounds 21.9m to total turnover of Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 27.6m). Mr Harrop said that Kalamazoo intended, from the base of its net cash balances, to spread its computer services business across Europe. The interim dividend is raised to 0.85p (0.25p), payable from earnings of 4.2p per share.</p>

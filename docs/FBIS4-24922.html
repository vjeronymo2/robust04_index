			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 4 KYODO -- The North Korean  ambassador to China Saturday [4 June] called on the United  States to sit down to talks with the North, laying out his  government's plans to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    Ambassador Chu Chang-chun said economic sanctions against  Pyongyang would be taken as "a declaration of war" and "the DPRK  (North Korea) will survive economic sanctions and will achieve  victory in this struggle."    Chu laid out the contents of a package solution that his  government hopes to put forward if and when the third round of  talks with the U.S. takes place.    "Firstly we will accept the routine and ad hoc inspections  to  the safeguards agreement, secondly we will reenter the NPT  (Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty) and thirdly when the  (clarified) modulated reactor is replaced by the light water  reactor we will abolish the (higher) chemical laboratory," he  said.    Chu said that in the second round of talks early last summer  the U.S. offered to replace the present reactor with a light  water reactor which does not produce plutonium waste.    He further accused the U.S. of wanting to prolong its  "occupation" of South Korea by first creating the "so-called  nuclear issue" and then by refusing to supply the light water  reactor, which would end suspicions of plutonium diversion.    North Korea has special status in the NPT, Chu said, due to  the suspension of its declaration in March last year to withdraw  from the organization.    Chu also ruled out North Korean participation in a  Russian-proposed international conference, saying the nuclear  issue can be solved only through talks between the U.S. and  North Korea.    The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton has been  seeking widespread support for U.N. Security Council sanctions  against the North.    The 16-month-long standoff reached a new level last weekend  when the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear  watchdog body, said Thursday it will not be able to determine  whether North Korea has diverted nuclear material for a bomb  after Pyongyang refused agency inspectors from supervising the  refueling of its 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor a  nuclear reactor in Yongbyon.    North Korea denies allegations by the U.S., South Korea and  other Western-bloc nations that it is building nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia caves in on aluminium duties ALUMINIUM PRODUCERS braced themselves for another wave of exports from Russia after it became clear yesterday that the Russian government had caved in completely to demands from its domestic industry. Russian aluminium producers, who brought in well over Dollars 1bn of desperately-needed foreign currency in 1991, had threatened to shut down some capacity unless changes were made to export duties and other regulations imposed at the begining of this year. The Interfax news agency reported from Moscow yesterday that the Russian government had ordered 615,000 tonnes of primary aluminium 'to be set aside for export in 1992'. Aluminium exports were freed from all duty and producers no longer had to sell part of their hard currency income to the Russian central bank. This news was greeted with dismay by the western industry, particularly European producers who, through the European Commission, have been attempting to work out a formula to cut exports without damaging the Russian industry. These efforts followed last year's jump in exports from the former Soviet Union to the west to between 800,000 tonnes and 1m tonnes, effectively adding about 10 per cent to supply. Yesterday's news was 'an indication that the flood gates are about to open again', said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Although the market had been expecting something of the sort - Billiton had estimated Russian exports would be 600,000 tonnes this year - 'it shows we are in for a prolonged period of low aluminium prices when many producers will be suffering losses'. Mr MacMillan added: 'Russia will be a large net exporter of aluminium for some years'. Russia imposed a duty of 500 Ecus (Pounds 355) a tonne on aluminium exports in January but cut it four times before removing it entirely. Aluminium producers were also previously obliged to sell to the central bank 40 per cent of their hard currency earnings. Interfax said the aluminium exports would help Russia buy raw materials from the west. A barter deal with Ukraine has rescued a financially troubled, 25,000 tonnes-a-year Hungarian aluminium plant from closure, according to the MTI-Econews agency, reports Reuter from Budapest. Primary aluminium will be delivered in return for electricity at a 30 per cent discount.</p>

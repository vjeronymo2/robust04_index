			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Observer: Competition time Interesting to see whether the Bank of England breaks with tradition and advertises for a replacement for Andrew Crockett who has set off for the Bank for International Settlements. There would be no shortage of applicants. Running the international side of the Bank of England is one of the City's plum jobs. Do it well and you get yourself noticed. Sir John Stevens went on to be chairman of Morgan Grenfell and ex-Lloyds Bank chairman Sir Jeremy Morse and Sir Kit McMahon (ex-Midland Bank) both did a stint as the Bank's international troubleshooter. The smart money is on the new person being an insider. Bill Allen, head of foreign exchange operations, is a possibility. Still only 44, he is a member of Eddie's 'brat pack' - the group the governor has nurtured during his 30-year stint in Threadneedle Street. Other names being banded about are those of John Townend, 46, in charge of money markets and gilt-edged trading. Pen Kent is another runner. But don't bet on an inside job. Anthony Loehnis came from J. Henry Schroder Wagg and Crockett himself was working at the IMF when he was tapped. Hence the rumours about bicycle-riding John Odling-Smee, formerly deputy chief economic adviser at the Treasury who is head of the east European division at the International Monetary Fund. Another possibility is Goldman Sachs' economic guru Gavyn Davies. As a Goldman partner he should have stashed away enough money by now to afford to do a bit of public service.</p>

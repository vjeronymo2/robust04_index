			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> CHARTER PANEL CREATED  </P> <P> The City Council created a Charter Commission last week to explore the future  of city government and council elections.  </P> <P> The Council voted 6 to 0, with Councilman David B. Finkel abstaining, to create  a council-appointed 15-member commission that would review the nature of  council elections, look at whether the city attorney and city clerk should be  elected instead of appointed as under current rules, and consider whether the  council should be paid.  </P> <P> The council agreed that the appointments should be made after the Nov. 6 city  election, when three council seats will be decided. The commission will be  required to submit a report to the council by Dec. 31, 1991.  </P></p>

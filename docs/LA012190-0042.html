			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HALL OF FAME GAME: JUST WHO WILL ROCK 'N' ROLL TO GLORY?  </P> <P> Concerning "This Year's Hall of Famers" by Don Waller:  </P> <P> The song used in the bar scene of "The Deer Hunter" is "Can't Take My Eyes Off  You," not "My Eyes Adored You."  </P> <P> And Waller is wrong in saying it's a Four Seasons record; both the songs were  solo singles by Frankie Valli.  </P> <P> The "Deer Hunter" guys sing "I love you, baby, and if it's quite all right, I  need you, baby. . . ." Whereas "My Eyes Adored You" deals with young, young  love and wouldn't play well with drunk steel workers shooting pool. Unless they  were supposed to use the cues to smash the jukebox.  </P> <P> MATT PROIETTI  </P> <P> Crestline  </P></p>

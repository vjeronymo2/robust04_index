			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBERT HILBURN: AMERICAN 'MICHAEL' AWARDS: MORE ADVERTISING THAN ART  </P> <P> It was fitting that Diet Coke launched its high-powered George Michael ad  campaign on the American Music Awards telecast.  </P> <P> The annual pop special itself is simply one long -- very l-o-n-g -- commercial.  </P> <P> When pop stars (including Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood) weren't seen hawking  beer in conventional commercials during Monday's three-hour event, they were on  stage hyping themselves.  </P> <P> Unlike next month's Grammy Awards ceremony, where the emphasis is on artistic  achievement, the American Music Awards is simply an excuse for a television  program. No sin in that, but it does make performers look a bit silly when they  shed tears and repeatedly thank God for their trophies.  </P> <P> The "awards" are based on results of a national popularity poll conducted among  approximately 20,000 music fans -- which helps explain how Whitney Houston  could defeat Tracy Chapman for recordings in 1988 and how the "Dirty Dancing"  sound track could defeat anything.  </P> <P> If Dick Clark Productions gave out the pyramid-shaped trophies at a private  dinner, they would be lucky to have enough stars on hand to generate one good  trade publication publicity photo.  </P> <P> Because the awards are handed out on prime-time television, however, artists  scurry for seats. The lure: 60 seconds or so for the winners at the podium.  </P> <P> If that exposure isn't enticing enough, superstars can look forward to special  awards and -- crucially -- extra time.  </P> <P> Two special awards and 16 minutes of exposure were enough to lure the normally  reclusive Michael Jackson to the Shrine Auditorium stage, where another  superstar, comedian Eddie Murphy, obediently narrated a gushing  mini-documentary of Jackson's recent "Bad" tour.  </P> <P> It's not as if Jackson had to fight to get the 16 minutes and the awards. The  show's producers would have given him 26 minutes because it's a coup having  Jackson involved at all.  </P> <P> Even Murphy, whose persona is based on his ultra-confident manner, seemed  intimidated by Jackson's transcendent fame.  </P> <P> When the pop star stepped to the microphone to accept the awards, he discovered  the stand was too low. After trying to bend over awkwardly to reach the  microphone, the unnerved Jackson stepped back and asked Murphy to adjust the  stand for him.  </P> <P> Murphy moved forward like an eager stage hand before remembering that he, too,  is a star and that it wasn't his job to fix the microphone stand.  </P> <P> In Murphy's only spontaneous -- and funny -- remark, he quipped, "(Michael)  said, 'Eddie pull it up,' like I was working for him . . . and I started to do  it, too, 'Yes Michael.' "  </P> <P> Though Willie Nelson also received a special award (and 9 minutes of TV time),  the evening's co-star was the other Michael -- George Michael.  </P> <P> Ironically, Jackson's 16-minute salute served in the end to further enhance the  status of his pop rival from Great Britain.  </P> <P> The much ballyhooed Diet Coke commercial didn't have much fizz: scenes of a  matador preparing for battle juxtaposed against scenes of pop star Michael  getting ready to face his fans on stage.  </P> <P> But the English pop star's victories in three American Music Awards categories  (most popular R&amp;B album, male R&amp;B singer and male pop/rock singer) did  leave their mark.  </P> <P> Because Michael Jackson was also nominated in the two latter categories, the  message for millions of viewers was that George Michael -- despite all the  excitement of the 16 minutes of "Bad" tour footage" -- was the more popular  record-maker in 1988.  </P> <P> Equally impressive was the graceful way the young Englishman handled himself at  the podium.  </P> <P> Though his "Faith" album has sold more than 6 million copies in the United  States alone, Michael is still struggling to win credibility as an artist -- a  goal made more difficult by his former membership in the lightweight British  pop duo Wham!  </P> <P> Michael may be reading more into the awards than the voting decrees, but there  was a disarming sense of genuine humility in his remarks each time he accepted  an award.  </P> <P> "I'd just like to say that a couple of years back when I split the (duo), I  knew I had a tough job ahead of me . . . and I thought that maybe people  weren't going to give me much of a chance," he said in his final visit to the  podium.  </P> <P> "So, I'd just like to thank everybody . . . for giving me that chance and  letting me prove myself."  </P> <P> If the head-to-head competition between the two Michaels produced a true moment  of drama in an evening of unabashed self-promotion, most of the telecast was as  flat as the Diet Coke spot.  </P> <P> With the array of stars on stage (from country's Randy Travis to rap's D.J.  Jazzy Jeff), one certainly got a look at the range of commercial pop music  these days. But it was surface rather than substance.  </P> <P> Except for Guns N' Roses' defiant rendition of "Patience," the live  performances (ranging from Rick Astley and Sade to the Miami Sound Machine and  K.T. Oslin) were uneventful, and the evening's co-hosts (Kenny Rogers, Anita  Baker, Rod Stewart and Debbie Gibson) were uninspired.  </P> <P> Maybe next year the producers ought to acknowledge the program's TV-show  foundation and invite Oprah, Phil and Geraldo to co-host. That'd probably boost  ratings -- and those three certainly know the realities of television  self-promotion.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber </F> by Katalin Karcagi; place and date not given: "Hungary May  Receive Partial EU Membership"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Karcagi] In your view, to  what extent is Hungary able to make use of the help offered by  Bavaria [to East European countries in forming closer contacts  with the European Union--EU]?    [Stoiber] I will first mention management training for  Hungarian entrepreneurs held by the Munich East-West Management  Center -- the Hungarian side is making efficient use of this.  There is close cooperation in education: I am referring to the  exchange of kindergarten nurses and visits offered for teachers.  Bavaria is helping to retrain Russian teachers and to teach the  German language. [passage omitted]    [Karcagi] What are the experiences of Bavarian investors:  What difficulties should they expect?    [Stoiber] They have very good experiences. It is favorable  that the legal framework has been stabilized in Hungary. In my  view, Bavarian investors are making use of the possibilities:  Of the 3,000 German-Hungarian joint ventures, some 800 are  operating with Bavarian firms, and Siemens has created 5,000  jobs in Hungary. There are minor problems, for example, Scholler  and Audi should be paying customs duty on their deliveries  retrospectively because the regulations have been changed in the  meantime but, hopefully, this issue will now be settled.    [Karcagi] What is the Bavarian reaction to Hungary's recent  domestic political disputes, the battle over the media, the  harsh tone of the election campaign, and the extreme right-wing  statements? Has Hungary's image changed?    [Stoiber] It has not become weaker; Hungary has a favorable  image, that of a stabilizing democracy. The battles and the  dispute are concomitant with the campaign that has started.  This is normal in a democracy, and it is not my task to  interfere in domestic political issues; however, I am certain  that the polemics do not have a negative influence on Hungary's  image. According to the indications, Hungary is progressing  most consistently and is fastest on the road to democratic  renewal. The situation is much more difficult in Romania,  Bulgaria, and Slovakia.

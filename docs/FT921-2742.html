			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Broker concerned about Lonrho's debt CONCERN over Lonrho's disposal programme will be highlighted today with the publication of a note by UBS Phillips and Drew, its stockbroker, predicting that the group's net debt for the year end will remain as high as Pounds 1bn. In spite of reports by the international conglomerate that it plans to reduce its net debt from Pounds 1.1bn to about Pounds 600m, its brokers fear that without sizeable international disposals Lonrho's borrowings will not fall significantly. The report, entitled Dependent on Disposals, says Lonrho's problems are compounded by structural problems. Because less than 10 per cent of its pre-tax profits are generated in the UK it is vulnerable on the tax front with unrelieved advance corporation tax. The group needs more cash in the UK to pay interest and dividends. In a further blow to the group Phillips and Drew believes that Western Platinum, located in South Africa, is worth only half the Pounds 1bn valuation put on it by Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, in the 1990 annual report. Lonrho has a 75 per cent stake in the mine. The broker has also downgraded its profit forecast for 1992 to Pounds 150m, with earnings per share of 10p compared to 14.2p for the year to end-September 1991. Since Lonrho's results were published in January, with pre-tax profits falling by 24 per cent to Pounds 207m (Pounds 273m), the group has announced a disposals programme to significantly reduce its debt. Yet to date it has only announced two disposals, which include the sale of its UK Man truck importing business for Pounds 20m and Scottish and Universal Newspapers for Pounds 45m to Trinity International Holdings. Mr Mike Smith, conglomerate analyst at Robert Fleming Securities, said: 'Lonrho is not taking what the City is saying seriously enough: its debt is too high. And a Pounds 45m sale will not make a blind bit of difference.' Lonrho reported the sale of its 50 per cent interest in Kuhne and Nagel, the German freight forwarder, for DM340m (Pounds 118.8m) hours before its results. Phillips and Drew believe there has been too much concentration on the possible disposal of UK assets and not enough about possible disposals abroad.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RATHER HELPED FOSTER MEDIA 'MEDIOCRITY'  </P> <P> Dan Rather says when he is off the tube, "Television news and newspapers are in  danger of sinking into a miasma of mediocrity" (Newsmakers, April 10).  </P> <P> But only on little-watched PBS would you hear such a thing on air, then only by  Bill Moyers. Rather's CBS evening news will never talk about the demise and  trivialization of the mass media on prime time or any time.  </P> <P> Rather questions pollsters who say, "real people care only about entertainment,  sex and cats." But Rather has played a key role in fostering such a mind-set.  He may be a journalist, but he functions as an entertainer, to keep people  watching between the advertisements.  </P> <P> ANDREW LIBERMAN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

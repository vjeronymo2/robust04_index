			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / G3 leaders in pledge on free trade zone THE presidents of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, meeting in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, as the Group of Three, have pledged to establish a free trade zone for their 145m consumers from January 1, 1994, writes Joseph Mann from Caracas. There was some speculation in Caracas that the pact may be an effort to provide Colombia and Venezuela with a 'side door' to benefits from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The G3 presidents and the chief executives of six central American states also called for a free trade area, by July 1 1993, between G3 members and Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.</p>

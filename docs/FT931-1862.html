			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Bailiffs use buses in car dispute BAILIFFS will take buses instead of their own cars tomorrow to carry out their duties. The change will be part of a programme of industrial action. About 600 county-court bailiffs in England and Wales who are members of the Civil and Public Services Association are protesting about the compensation they receive for using their own cars in working hours. The bailiffs will use public transport to carry out orders of the court tomorrow and on Thursday. They also intend to withdraw good will and start an indefinite work to rule. The union said it was the first time bailiffs had taken industrial action over an issue directly affecting their terms and conditions. 'The action will slow down the enforcement work carried out by bailiffs,' it added. It said its bailiff members should 'not be expected to subsidise the Lord Chancellor when carrying out their authorised duties'.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Nurdin &amp; Peacock warns on sales Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash and carry specialist which is converting to trade and business warehouses, yesterday warned of difficult trading conditions and reduced sal-es. Mr Richard Fulford, chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting that sales to date in the current year were about 5 per cent down on last time. The shares reacted with a 9p fall to 200p. The chairman said that the transfer of traditional cash and carry outlets was progressing well with 26 out of 45 being converted. The remaining conversions should be completed by the end of June. However, Mr Fulford said that trading conditions for traditional customers remained difficult. This situation reflected the lack of any significant increase in customer spending, the Sunday opening of superstores and price discounting.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUR HARD-LINERS MISS THE BIG PICTURE;  </P> <P> SOVIETS: IT'S IN U.S. INTEREST TO HELP GORBACHEV, BECAUSE HE'S THE KEY TO  FREEING EASTERN EUROPE AND PUTTING COMMUNISM IN ITS GRAVE.  </P> <P> Uncharacteristically, the hard-liners have got it wrong. They are upset that  President Bush gave away the store at Malta, dubbed "the Doormat Summit" by one  critic. What happened? Bush went from interested spectator to Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's partner. He preemptively recalled all instruments of economic war  (such as punitive tariffs) against the Soviet Union. He approved its symbolic  entry into the West's economic system (observer status in the Western club of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). He gave Gorbachev and perestroika  a political blessing to match the Pope's.  </P> <P> He gave these concessions free -- before having received anything in return. No  commitment to real economic reform. No pledges of good behavior in Central  America. "Will someone tell me," asked a pained Richard Viguerie, "how it is in  the interests of the Free World to save this failed, fatally flawed system?"  </P> <P> The answer is simple: It is in the highest interest of the Free World to save,  to whatever extent we can, Gorbachev, because Gorbachev -- not the withholding  of GATT membership or squeezing the Soviets on Central America -- is the key to  burying this failed, fatally flawed system.  </P> <P> The hard-liners are missing the big picture. Their hearts are in the right  place -- ice -- but they have got the tactics wrong. The terminal phase of the  Cold War, as any war, should be focused on the center, not the periphery. The  periphery was the major battleground when the center was untouchable. No  longer.  </P> <P> It is true that the Soviets are still acting duplicitously in Central America,  still trying to hang on to Afghanistan. But these are peripheral issues. From  the point of view of strategy, we don't particularly care right now if the  Soviets insist on spending themselves dry in Havana and Kabul. We don't  particularly care if Gorbachev refuses to release prices and make the other  changes essential to reviving his economy. (In the end, what hard-liner really  wants a revived Soviet economy? So why insist on real reform?)  </P> <P> What we want is for Eastern Europe to irrevocably elude the Soviet grasp. The  Soviet empire is in collapse at the center, where it counts. Every day that  Gorbachev remains in power is another day of further collapse. Our preeminent  interest, therefore, is to help Gorbachev remain in power. He has done more for  "rollback" than John Foster Dulles could have dreamed.  </P> <P> We need a year. Within a year, Eastern Europe could be entirely out of the  Soviet reach. It might take a year for Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Hungary  to elect non-Communist governments. Imperial restoration would then require a  World War II-style reoccupation, against the resistance of perhaps four  legitimate democracies with wide popular support. In other words, imperial  restoration will be inconceivable.  </P> <P> Our immediate agenda, therefore, is to help Gorbachev buy time. Help him resist  the internal discontent that comes from empty shelves and rising inflation. If  that requires Western credits or emergency food aid, or some GATT-like  political concession to placate the Politburo, the price is cheap.  </P> <P> Now is not the time to push Gorbachev on Baltic independence, on the formal  dismantling of the Warsaw Pact, on German reunification, on economic reforms,  or even on Central American mischief-making. Our supreme interest is an  independent East Europe -- and that means the continued survival of Gorbachev  and his reforms. Everything else is secondary and, if it poses any threat to  perestroika, counterproductive.  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle complains that Gorbachev's top national-security  advisers are still hard-line. He misses the point. We are far beyond caring  about intentions. Events have outrun intentions.  </P> <P> No doubt, Gorbachev intends to make the Soviet Union a stronger, more  efficient, more formidable power, something that is not particularly in our  interest. But his actions have set in train forces that defy his control and  undermine his intentions. Gorbachev could hardly have intended to give up half  of Europe in six months. But it will soon be gone.  </P> <P> Why is Eastern Europe so central? Not only because without it the Soviet empire  becomes a shell. But because de-communization in Eastern Europe is the surest  road to the de-communization of Russia. Until a few months ago, reform in  Moscow was pushing reform in Eastern Europe. The process is now reversed.  Soviet reformers, seeing East Europe's liberation, are inspired to demand the  same at home.  </P> <P> In Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia, the Communist Party has  been stripped of its leading role. Gorbachev still hangs on to it. Last month,  however, a motion in the Supreme Soviet to reconsider the party's leading role  lost by only three votes (in a chamber of 542). Moreover, last week in the  newspaper Pravda, Gorbachev himself defended the leading role of the party as  necessary "at the present complex stage," a remarkably telling qualification.  Given Gorbachev's history, in which today's qualification becomes tomorrow's  new principle, it is conceivable that some sort of political pluralism is next.  </P> <P> Give the man time. Gorbachev represents the greatest imperial  self-transformation since Constantine converted to Christianity. These types do  not come along too often. To the extent that we can help Gorbachev, it is crazy  not to.  </P></p>

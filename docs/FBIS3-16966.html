			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Abridged" speech by Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman </F> Ivan Plyushch before delegates of the Consumer Cooperation  Congress; place and date not given: "Ukraine Is Forever, and it  Depends on Us Whether it Will Be Happy or Unhappy"]    [Text] Consumer cooperatives are serving 23 million  people, including 9 million shareholders. Their role in our  social life and economy is significant. When we say that there  is no alternative to reform, this means that the importance of  cooperatives will be constantly growing, whether we want this or  not.    I want to draw your attention to those processes that are  under way in particular in rural areas, and deny allegations by  those who claim that reform is not advancing. Here are concrete  figures. In general, the total number of cattle has  unfortunately been decreasing over recent years. Both the tempo  and the trend of the decline in the state and kolkhoz sectors  are steady, and the decrease is measured in millions of head.  However in [private] village farms, an opposite process is  under way. In 1993, the data were as follows: The total number  of cattle went up by 240,000 head, which amounts to the emerging  of a medium-sized oblast. The number of pigs increased by more  than 200,000. Converting into symbolic figures the number of  cattle and pigs raised in the private sector over the last three  years, we would receive almost a million head. Incidentally,  the increase rate was almost 13 percent in 1993.    What does this mean? If you fail to change your  infrastructure to account for these changes, an enormous  incongruity may arise. Your reform and production must be in  line with the changes and trends currently under way in Ukraine  as a whole. And instead of reducing and curtailing the scope of  your activities, you should expand it on a qualitatively new  basis of cooperation and mutually advantageous contracts.    One of the speakers at the congresses maintained that  consumer cooperation is losing authority. I think this is not  the case. The only ones to believe this are those who either  prefer not to notice changes or have not been given to realize  the actual state of things.    Yesterday, Valentin Roshchin, our guest from the Russian  Federation who is first deputy chairman of Russia's Central  Union of Consumer Cooperatives, spoke here. He pointed out: "I  hope that your congress facilitates the revival of cooperatives  in a new form." Sincerely greeting your congress, I want every  one of you to leave this hall with a deep conviction that we  should revive the cooperatives in a new form, the one dreamed  about by outstanding scientist Oleksandr Vasylyovych Chayanov.  He depicted its essence as "cooperation of cooperators." Thus,  the future belongs to you and manufacturers.    Next comes the issue of relations between consumer  cooperatives and the state. I support what I once said in an  interview with your newspaper VISTI: "Cooperatives are a state  within the state." I said this many times to people from the  agro-industrial complex and consumer cooperatives. If you do  not become a state within the state, we will not change  production relations. If we fail to do this we will also fail  to change our attitude toward work and thus, improve our living  standards.    This does not mean that you break away from the state and  become independent. Everybody depends on the state. Saying  that manufacturers, entrepreneurs, or cooperative bodies are  independent is just an invention. They are all dependent  because they all are parts of the state. The point is how  dependent they are, whether they are directly subordinated [to  the state] or they coexist on an agreement, contractual, or  other bases. I mean that consumer cooperatives should build  their relations with the state primarily on the basis of  agreements. If a state delegates some of its functions to  consumer cooperatives, this should be provided for by an  agreement and this agreement should be strictly observed. If  one party or another fails to observe this agreement, the third  branch of power -- the court -- will have to intervene, and  everything will be regulated by order of the court. I say this  not out of desire to pit consumer cooperatives against the  state, but because this is in line with Ukraine's actual laws  and the realities of a democratic state of law.    Inflation is one of the most acute problems, and one of the  speakers here has said that it has eaten up your money. Tell  me, whose money has it not eaten up in Ukraine? It has eaten up  cooperatives' money, people's savings, state enterprise,  kolkhoz, and sovkhoz assets. When inflation in a state begins  to swell, it eats up everyone's money without distinction, but  the poorest people are afflicted more than others.  Unfortunately, it happened so that the group of people with  which consumer cooperatives are dealing is the most impoverished  one.    If someone today is aiming to liquidate village stores or  introduce such reform that would ban consumer goods from  villages, this is sabotage and not reform. Those guilty of this  should be punished by administrative or other measures.    There was talk at the congress that there are attempts to  appropriate consumer cooperatives' property and privatize it.  We cannot let this happen. Cooperatives alone have the right  to manage their property. Whenever some property is privatized  in a normal economy, the state demands that 70 to 80 percent of  the previous assortment of goods, specialization, and special  features of this commercial outlet be retained. Thus, neither  privatization nor any other change in the form of ownership  should result in shortages of consumer goods in village stores.  If today it is unprofitable to ship bread to villages -- and  this is a reality -- this must not be attributed to  cooperatives. You are performing state functions and should  have an agreement with the state, which should either partially  compensate your losses or you will divide them among yourselves,  or find other mutually advantageous solutions.    You all remember the times when there was no difference  between state commerce and consumer cooperatives, aside from  better goods being shipped to state stores. Cooperatives did  not function in accordance with their charter. A legal footing  has now been created for both consumer cooperatives and other  forms of ownership. Leasing and sharing are becoming more  widespread; destatization is under way. This process will be  expanding. In developed countries, even power plants are in  private hands, but the energy system is state-run and every  power plant contributes power and heat to the system. I am not  speaking about privatizing the power system, perhaps we will  come to this in 10 years or so. The point is how to make  consumer cooperatives survive along with other economic  structures. Are cooperatives in a better situation than state  commerce or the state production sector? Their situations are  virtually analogous.    Our colleagues from Russia and Moldova spoke here. It turned  out that we have common problems and, as long as they remain  unresolved, there will be no stable ties about which some  political forces like to speculate very much. The ties have  been disrupted because payment mechanisms ceased to exist. As  early as three years ago, there were shortages of money. If  someone tells you that Ukraine abandoned the ruble zone, do not  believe him. This is being said by those politicians who find  this statement advantageous. In reality, Ukraine, along with  other republics, was thrown out of this zone, which was an  objective process. As we all know, in September 1993, some  states signed an agreement about the creation of an economic  union, but as of today, the ruble zone has been created neither  between Russia and Kazakhstan nor between Russia and Belarus.  This zone can be created solely under one condition: Either  Belarus, for example, becomes a part of Russia or the two states  unite on the same basis as EC countries are trying to, after 40  years of cooperation. We are not a unique phenomenon and no  islanders that can do whatever they want. This illusion has  afflicted severe damage on Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,  Moldova, and other republics. I think that consumer  cooperatives must be among the trailblazers in making mutually  advantageous contacts. We should not think about global  all-embracing things. Let us first establish normal relations  between our cooperatives. However, you will set up these  relations quicker, if instead of a simple exchange of goods  currently termed barter, the "blood vessel" of the  financial-credit system starts to function. Who has money for  this? Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy reported in his  speech yesterday that a 500-billion karbovantsi credit had been  earmarked for consumer cooperatives. Did you feel that? Let us  be frank -- this credit will produce no tangible effects,  because judging by the data cited here, your projects demand  more than 10 trillion. When there is no proper correlation  between products and money, no matter what politicians do, there  will either be sky-rocketing inflation (which we are  experiencing today) or a tough financial-credit policy that will  lead to a normal market, and economic correlation between money  and product supply.    We have started this work, but believe me that we cannot do  it given our ersatz currency and the inflation rate of 1993.  This year, a spark of stabilization started burning. Not a  torch yet, because what kind of stabilization is that, when  people are not being paid wages and cannot buy products?  However, this is the kind of spark that gives hope and proves  that things can be improved.    Banks have been bitterly reproached from this rostrum for  granting high-interest credits and reaping dividends. This is  also a reproach for me, because the National Bank is  subordinated to the Supreme Council. However, the Supreme  Council does not manage banks as was said here. We do not  exercise this kind of control. The National Bank is  subordinated solely to the law and depends on the Supreme  Council, only in the sense that the latter passes laws on bank  activities.    The National Bank's function is to oversee the proportion  "money -- product -- money," while the issuance of credits  belongs to commercial or departmental banks. There are voices  calling to nationalize these. However, this is not the kind of  road for us to choose. We should encourage competition between  banks. If we want to go back to the administrative-command  system and totalitarianism, then we should proclaim them state  banks. However, we cannot go back to what once existed. Thus,  we must act in such a way as to make banks have interest in  manufacturers. According to Chayanov, the nature of market  relations envisions that if someone comes and buys something,  the seller should give him an award. If a shareholder, a  farmer, or a village resident deposits his money in a bank, this  must be advantageous for him. However today, everything is the  other way around. There is just one solution, that is to put an  end to the monopoly of these banks.    What Ivan Illich Bakhchyvanzhi from Odessa Oblast told us  here, and he was not the only one to say this, means that you  are able to create your own bank within your system. It will  interact with you and other banks, and then you will get things  going. Then, the interest-increase curve will begin to decline,  because you will be able to bargain about credit interest rates,  doing this on mutually advantageous terms. It is good that you  are already laying the foundation of your bank. I know about  the agreement to allot a certain sum of state money for this  bank, so as to let you purchase small bakeries for rural areas,  about which there was talk here, freezers, and other equipment;  as well as more actively carry out reform in your sector.    Important issues, not only for consumer cooperation, have  been brought up in this hall. I am grateful that you have given  the floor to village and rayon council heads and a school  principal. Cooperative workers from different oblasts told us a  lot of interesting things. One can feel that despite tremendous  hardships, you have had good initiative on the way to the  market. These sprouts have been conditioned by life.    I am sure you can cite a lot of concrete places in which  reform in different spheres is advancing despite all the  obstacles.    Two years ago, one of the managers from Donetsk Oblast,  asked  by me why people had not been allotted land for vegetable and  collective gardening, answered with surprise: "Do you mean we  have to give them blackland?" This is some stance indeed!  People can be given slopes, ditches, and other worthless  patches of land, but by no means blackland.    However in spring, grass will grow even through asphalt. Let  me cite these figures: Over the last four years, the volume of  areas earmarked for vegetable and collective gardening has  significantly increased. What have been the results of this?  Here I have data from some oblasts. In previous years, more  than 100,000 tonnes of potatoes were shipped yearly for the  needs of Kiev residents. In 1993, 16,000 tonnes were shipped,  and now nobody knows what to do with them. The point is that  the production of potatoes by all the social groups in the  oblast has grown more than twofold. The same thing happened in  Dnepropetrovsk Oblast. Some 37,000 to 40,000 tonnes of potatoes  used to be shipped to Zaporozhye Oblast every autumn, in  accordance with the central plan. In 1993, the figure was 6,000  tonnes, and nobody in the city complained about shortages. It  turned out that potatoes grow there as well. Under the old  economic system, potatoes would not grow in southern oblasts,  but when land was given to the people, they started to grow in  both Zaporozhye and Dnepropetrovsk Oblasts. I could cite more  examples of this kind.    You have repeatedly mentioned the Law on Consumer  Cooperation  here, adopted by the Supreme Soviet. In my opinion, it is far  from ideal, but it has opened the door for you and provided a  legal footing for developing your structures. However,  commenting on that law, one senior official once said: "I have  all grounds to claim that the law on cooperation is a result of  a bribe." [words within quotation marks in Russian] You might  be perplexed to hear this phrase, but it is a reverberation of  times wept for by some people. Of course, such managers do not  like reform in consumer cooperation, because cooperative members  no longer address them with these kinds of questions: "Ivan  Petrovych, we have received five freezers, 10 suits, and 30  shirts. To whom shall we sell them?" Such managers do not care  about baby food or our other hardships.    However now, you must become the only masters of your  system.  You have held 36,000 accounting conferences on all levels, and  this congress crowns your work. Thus, you should decide how to  live and continue your work. Today, law provides a legal  footing for consumer cooperation. If you make right decisions,  people will be grateful to you; if your decisions are faulty you  feel the consequences. There exists a wise saying: "The trial  and error method is not the best one, but nothing better has  been discovered so far." One should not simply mark time; one  should move forward and make progress, stumbling. The only ones  to make no mistakes are those who do no work.    You say that your best people abandon you for commercial  structures. If you cannot create conditions like those in  commercial structures, the outflow of people will continue. You  must create conditions to make people come to you and not vice  versa. In my opinion, employees will not abandon Ivan Illich  because the conditions created in his organization grant both  good wages and supplies for village people. If you fail to do  this, you will lose your workers.    I would like to say a couple of words regarding the essence  of our political reform.    In 1990, the Supreme Council was elected and is now  completing its work. We have lived through many things over the  last four years: We have passed the Declaration of Ukrainian  Sovereignty and the Act of Independence; debunked the  administrative-command system and everything that accompanied  it; and created more or less democratic conditions. For the  first time ever, opposition has been formed in the legislature  which, according to international norms and rules, is a  necessary attribute of every parliament. Lack of opposition  amounts to monopoly on power and lack of democracy.    Over that period, we have passed more than 400 laws and 1000  resolutions. Political forces give different evaluation of  these laws on the eve of elections. Some claim that these laws  cause anarchy, while others say that they want to enter the new  legislature to rescind everything adopted by the current Supreme  Council. However, we should go to the Supreme Council to  continue the creation of a legal footing for radical reform,  modify and improve existing laws.    It depends on us whom we will elect on 27 March. After this  day, there will be no one to blame. Thus, I am addressing you  as the cadre dealing with 23 million people, including 10  million in the heart of the country. We should kneel before  these people and thank them for tolerating us.    We should tell them: Empower those whom you believe  trustworthy. This power should act and not be afraid of  anything, because it is popular, that is elected by the people.    We already have a legislative basis for village people  electing village heads, rayon residents -- rayon heads, town  residents -- town heads, oblast residents -- oblast heads, and  the entire Ukrainian nation -- the Supreme Council and the  president. Deputies of representing organs of power will also  be elected in villages, towns, rayons, and oblasts.    Thus, the legal footing for holding democratic elections has  been formed. The newly elected legislature, along with the rest  of the nation, will have to continue the development of a  democratic state. Please, believe that Ukraine is forever, and  it depends on us whether it will be happy or unhappy.</p>

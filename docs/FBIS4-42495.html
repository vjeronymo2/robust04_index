			<p>BFN     [Text] The Netherlands is prepared to contribute a million  dollars to a salvage operation for the Russian nuclear submarine  Komsomolets in order to prevent an ecological disaster. The  Komsomolets sank five years ago in the Barents Sea. It is  rusting so quickly that there is a danger of plutonium being  released from the wreckage this year.    The Netherlands has already had extensive talks with Russia  about the nature and the costs of a salvage operation. If the  two countries agree, the Dutch salvage companies Smit  Internationale and Heerema Offshore will both be involved in the  operation.</p>

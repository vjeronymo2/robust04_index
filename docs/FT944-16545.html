			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Taiwan SEC chief refuses to quit Mr Day Linin, chairman of Taiwan's securities and exchange commission, yesterday defended his handling of a stock market crisis and resisted calls to step down, Laura Tyson reports from Taipei. 'There is no need for me to resign over this affair, or take responsibility,' Mr Day told the finance committee of the Legislative Yuan, or parliament. 'I have handled the matter completely correctly, and at this stage believe no one can handle it better.' A string of share payment defaults amounting to TDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 185m) sent stock prices down 14.7 per cent last week. Mr Day said he had acted in the best interests of most investors, and denied suggestions by opposition legislators that he had sought to give advantage to certain business groups. President Lee Teng-hui yesterday denounced speculative practices in the stock market. He told the party's central standing committee the finance and justice ministries would co-operate to prosecute such activities, where appropriate. Share prices rebounded 6.03 per cent yesterday to 6495.78, encouraged by government moves to support the market.</p>

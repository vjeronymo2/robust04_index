			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' CAST PROTEST  </P> <P> Every so often, some Midwestern housewife would get all huffy about the  questionable taste of "Saturday Night Live," and that was understandable. But  when the cast gets all huffy. . . .  </P> <P> Nora Dunn, an "SNL" regular, refused to perform because controversial comedian  Andrew Dice Clay was host.  </P> <P> Singer Sinead O'Connor withdrew as a guest. What has happened to the cast's  sense of humor and tolerance?  </P> <P> I don't recall Garrett Morris protesting when Richard Pryor hosted, even though  Pryor used the "n" word in his act. I don't recall Jane Curtin refusing to  appear when Eric Idle hosted, even though Idle (in drag) made fun of women in  Monty Python skits.  </P> <P> And I don't recall anybody refusing to appear when Sam Kinison -- who blazed  the trail down which Mr. Clay now merrily skips -- hosted the show.  </P> <P> "SNL" used to be on TV comedy's cutting edge. But, if cast members are going to  get bent out of shape over things like the material of the host, then that edge  will end up about as sharp as an installment of "Donny and Marie."  </P> <P> STEVE STOLIAR, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

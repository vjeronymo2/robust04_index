			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / British prices attract foreign househunters DEPRESSED property prices and attractive exchange rates are drawing increasing numbers of foreign buyers back into the UK housing market. Estate agents say that interest in London and country house properties which began to pick up in the last year has shown a surge since sterling's devaluation last September when it left the European exchange rate mechanism. A significant proportion of purchases continues to involve buyers from the Far East seeking investment opportunities. This includes Hong Kong Chinese looking for bolt-holes ahead of 1997 when China will regain control of the colony. One Hong Kong buyer scouring Belgravia, central London, this week said that because of the difference in exchange rates she was finding prices more than 50 per cent cheaper than they were last year. She has been viewing houses priced at about Pounds 1m which were on the market a year ago at Pounds 1.6m. The rate of exchange against the US dollar when she first looked meant that she would have had to pay about Dollars 3.2m whereas today, because of the devaluation and the further fall in house prices, she only needs to find Dollars 1.45m for the same sort of property. The same conditions are also attracting European buyers, particularly Germans and Italians, and some estate agents have reported deals with eastern European buyers such as Russians and Serbs. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley say they have seen an increase of 50 per cent in foreign buyers looking for London and country houses at the top end of the market. According to its research some 64 per cent of all buyers purchasing property priced at more than Pounds 750,000 were foreign last year, against 42 per cent in 1991 and 35 per cent in 1990. In London 70 per cent of buyers were from abroad and country house sales were evenly split between UK and foreign buyers. Some 40 per cent of sales for the year were completed in the last quarter. Mr Patrick Ramsay, the partner in charge of country house sales, said that foreign interest was spread fairly evenly across the board. One effect of foreign buyers arriving in numbers was to soak up properties on the market since they had no houses to sell in the UK. However, Mr Andy Buchanan, a director of estate agent John D Wood, said the scarcity of new instructions was the worst he had experienced in 20 years in Chelsea, west London. Italian buyers, in particular, were prominent at present. 'We had three Italians in today looking at properties,' he said. Italian house purchasers still asked for confidentiality, he said, 'But it's not like the old days when I used to ring a hotel in Milan and say the bird has flown the nest to tell the buyer the sale had gone through.' John D Wood's office at Regent's Park says that South Africans are its most active foreign customers, but their preferred area is Hampstead, north London. Mr Paul Taylor, head of residential sales at Savills, said a number of Russians and Serbs had bought property at about Pounds 500,000 in Hampstead and Kensington in west London. He said that several factors were combining with exchange rates to attract buyers, including signs that the country was coming out of recession and a large stock of properties on the market. Mr Adam Leighton, manager at Benham &amp; Reeves in Hampstead, said that about 50 per cent of sales in the last quarter had been to foreign buyers. 'We have sold three properties to Russians in the last couple of months and I know that two of my competitors have had sales to Russians.' London remains the most popular centre for foreign buyers. The French in London tend to congregate in South Kensington, because of the French lycee. Germans prefer to be further west whereas house-hunting Americans head for St John's Wood or Hampstead. Ealing is popular with Japanese buyers.</p>

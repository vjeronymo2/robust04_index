			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Management: Unravelling the big risks in small print - Charles Batchelor offers tenants a word of warning / Commercial leases Four years after moving out of a small office it had leased in West London, Abercrombie &amp; Kent, a tour operator and travel agent, found itself faced with a demand from the landlord for the payment of back rent. This was not rent that Abercrombie had failed to pay but money owing from the tenant to which Abercrombie had assigned the lease after it moved out. Under British commercial property law, landlords can force long-departed tenants to make good unpaid rent owed by a more recent occupier. 'The first time we knew there was a problem was when we got a letter from the landlord's solicitor saying we were the original tenant, there was outstanding rent due and they looked forward to receiving our remittance,' says Bob Winder, finance controller. After several months of negotiations, Abercrombie succeeded in getting the rent demand reduced from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 30,000. Abercrombie, which has turnover of Pounds 22m, was able to absorb the cost - some smaller companies have gone under - but it was still 'a blow on the chin we could have done without', says Winder. Abercrombie &amp; Kent is just one of a growing number of companies to fall victim to legislation which many in the property and legal professions believe to be unfairly weighted against the tenant. Even though landlords have the right to vet any new tenant to which a departing occupant wishes to assign his lease, they accept no responsibility if the new tenant subsequently cannot pay. During the boom years of the 1980s, landlords had no difficulty finding new tenants. In the current recession, many tenants are going bust leaving unpaid rent bills and triggering clauses which allow landlords to seek redress from previous tenants. 'The recession has made this into a hot issue,' says Robert Lee, commercial property partner at solicitors Davies Arnold Cooper. 'When tenants go bust, landlords are forced to look elsewhere for their money.' The rigidity of the British commercial property market, with 25-year leases the norm, means that it is not unknown for companies to be pursued for rents 10 or 15 years after they have quit premises. Over these lengthy periods, the rent may have increased many times. One company was paying Pounds 355,000 a year in rent when it left an office block in central London. When problems arose with a subsequent tenant a few years later, it faced a demand for unpaid rent of nearly Pounds 800,000 a year. In many countries, lease periods are far shorter and there is no obligation to take on the liabilities of subsequent tenants, says Theresa Grant Peterkin, a partner in solicitors Withers. In France, leases are usually for nine years with 'breaks' at three-year intervals while in the US, five-year leases are common. The unfairness of the present system has long been recognised and a Law Commission report of 1988 suggested legislation to redress the balance. The government has so far taken no action although the Lord Chancellor's Department says it is looking closely at the report and will take it forward when other commitments permit. Under current legislation there is not even an obligation on the landlord to warn previous occupants that the present tenant is not paying rent and bills are building up. 'There is no limit on how long the landlord leaves it,' says Grant Peterkin. No matter where a business comes in the chain of tenants who have occupied a property, it may find itself the target of a claim from the landlord. David and Adrienne Jackson held the lease on a shop in Reading from which they ran a business printing motifs on sportswear and leisurewear. The Jacksons were the fourth tenants to lease the shop and two more followed before the most recent tenant ran into problems. Six years after assigning the lease to another long-departed tenant, the Jacksons say they now face a demand for Pounds 17,500 in unpaid rent. 'A lot of people don't even know these clauses exist in their leases,' says Adrienne Jackson. The Jacksons have already spent Pounds 3,000 on legal fees. But it is not just small companies which are affected and which might be forgiven for failing to read the small print of their lease agreements. Many large retail groups are also concerned at the present state of the law. Dixons, the electrical company; Oliver Group, a large footwear retailer; and W H Smith have all worked with Davies Arnold Cooper on a review of leasehold law. So what can tenants do to reduce their exposure? Property specialists suggest: When signing a new lease or when preparing to assign an existing lease to a new tenant, negotiate to remove or reduce your liability for rent once you have left the premises. It will be more difficult to win the landlord's agreement if you have an existing lease, but if the new tenant is a very solid company or is prepared to give guarantees or a pay a deposit, this may persuade him. 'Before the recession you did not stand a chance but it is easier to negotiate now,' says Grant Peterkin. Insist on a short-term lease or on a lease with 'break' clauses which would free you from further liability. Instead of assigning the lease, grant an underlease to the new tenant. You remain in control of the lease and know immediately if your sub-tenant has problems in paying his rent. 'This does not solve the problem but it mitigates it,' says Grant Peterkin. Granting an underlease does mean, however, that you must become involved in dealing with the sub-tenant. Insure yourself against liability for unpaid rents. Insurance cover for 'assignor's consequential loss' has become more popular recently, says Malcolm Jamieson of Credit and Guarantee Insurance. Premiums vary between 0.1 and 5 per cent of the sum insured, depending on the soundness of the business to which you assign your lease. Maintain a contingent liability in your accounts for the term of any lease you have held. As part of its submissions to the Law Commission review, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) argued for tenants to be released from liability 10 years after the assignment of a lease, or immediately if there was an increase in the rent because the building had been improved or its use changed. The CBI also called for an immediate release if rent was outstanding for more than one month without the landlord starting court action to recover it. If there is to be a shift in the law towards a better deal for tenants, then action needs to be taken quickly. Tenants are only now able to negotiate better leasehold terms because landlords are desperate to let their properties. Once the upturn comes, tenants will once again be dependent on the law to bolster their negotiating position.</p>

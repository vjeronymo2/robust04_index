			<p>BFN     [Text] ANAP [National Association of Small Farmers] is  analyzing its principal deficiencies. The recovery of production  in the cooperative and small farmer sectors, indispensable for  reestablishing the nation's economic equilibrium, is being  analyzed in depth at the fifth national ANAP plenum. This  meeting, presided over by Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon and  Alfredo Jordan and by ANAP President Orlando Lugo Fonte, is  evaluating solutions to the principal difficulties affecting the  nonstate sector of Cuba's agriculture.    Despite the production potential of the small farmers  cooperatives, results last year did not correspond to the amount  of land planted and the existing number of animals, and were  below expectations. Concerning tubers and vegetables, there was  an overall decrease, nationwide, and within these sectors, this  (?was more noticeable) in the agricultural-livestock production  cooperatives.    The fifth pleneum of ANAP's national committee, which is  meeting in Guira de Melena Municipality, Havana Province, set  forth the main causes of the decrease in agricultural-livestock  production. The delegates to the meeting agreed that, in  addition to the problems of the weather, shortages and the late  delivery of resources, problems of an organizational nature and  a failure to make demands also have an effect. The sales on the  free market by a number of farmers and the bartering of tubers  and other agricultural products for articles of prime necessity  are being evaluated in the light of the social disorganization  prevailing in Cuba. Several plenum participants came out against  this, and the plenum approved strengthening the work of the  cooperatives' boards of directors and once again taking up the  process of discussing pride and honor on the part of the farmers.</p>

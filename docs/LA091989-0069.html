			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LODISH REMEMBERS WOLVERINES;  </P> <P> UCLA LINEMAN HAS HOME BRAGGING RIGHTS IN MIND  </P> <P> Growing up in Birmingham, Mich., near Ann Arbor, Mike Lodish was pressured  extensively to play for the Michigan Wolverines.  </P> <P> But he never regretted enrolling at UCLA.  </P> <P> "It came down to UCLA and Michigan and I came out West for some reasons I don't  want to discuss," said Lodish, a 6-foot-3, 260-pound senior defensive tackle.  "I enjoyed the (UCLA) coaching staff, the way I was treated and I wanted to get  away from home and grow up a little bit and not have the comfort of being only  45 minutes from home."  </P> <P> Lodish said it wasn't easy to resist a personality such as Michigan Coach Bo  Schembechler.  </P> <P> "I remember him as a gut-tough, hard-nosed coach," Lodish said. "When I was  being recruited, there were five high school All-Americans coming out of  Michigan, and Michigan State got four of them. There was always the pressure on  me that you're a Michigan boy and have to play here, that you're a  Michigan-type person.  </P> <P> "When Bo Schembechler came into your house, he demanded your attention. It was  almost like it was his house, basically. He's kind of like a Woody Hayes-type  coach. But I felt UCLA was the school for me."  </P> <P> When Lodish eventually told Schembechler and his offensive coordinator, Gary  Moeller, that he was going to UCLA, they asked him to delay his decision.  </P> <P> "When I called Bo and told him I was going to UCLA, he went nuts a little bit,"  Lodish said. "He said, 'I'm coming to your house. You stay home.' So he and  Gary Moeller came to my house. Who knows? Maybe I should have gone to Michigan.  They were really on me to go to Michigan."  </P> <P> In other words, if UCLA Coach Terry Donahue is concerned about his Bruins  having enough intensity this weekend against the Wolverines, he need not worry  about Lodish, who has an agenda of his own. He has some bragging rights at home  to attend to.  </P> <P> And he wouldn't mind playing Michigan again this season . . . in the Rose Bowl  game.  </P> <P> Last season, he could only take some satisfaction in Michigan's 22-14 Rose Bowl  victory over USC.  </P> <P> "I was jumping for joy," he said. "Whenever anyone plays USC, I want USC to  lose. It made me sick losing to USC because I came out here to play in the Rose  Bowl game."  </P> <P> Lodish said that he was mentioned on Schembechler's television show as a player  who slipped away from Michigan.  </P> <P> "I don't know what he thinks of me as a football player and that doesn't  matter, but I'm sure he knows who I am," Lodish said, "and their offense is  going to know who I am."  </P> <P> The UCLA lineman recalls past recruiting days when Moeller and Schembechler  tried to persuade him that he was going 3,000 miles away from home and wouldn't  play because the California boys would be playing.  </P> <P> "That was a challenge itself," Lodish said. "They were trying to beat 'Go Blue'  into my head, but it really wasn't working.  </P> <P> "I just felt that UCLA would be a better school for me outside of football,  getting contacts in business."  </P> <P> Lodish said he became interested in UCLA when the Bruins beat the Wolverines,  24-14, in the 1983 Rose Bowl game.  </P> <P> "I remember that hit by (defensive back) Don Rogers on (quarterback) Steve  Smith in the Rose Bowl game. I thought this program is for real, that defense  is for real."  </P> <P> Although Lodish is emotionally ready for Saturday night's game, he is aware, of  course, that Michigan is a formidable opponent.  </P> <P> "We're going to have to play our best to beat them," he said. "They're an  excellent football team. They've got a tremendous attack and, being from  Michigan, I know how Bo Schembechler is. They lost (last week) and Bo  Schembechler doesn't like to lose, especially at home when he knows he could  have won. They'll be pumped up."  </P> <P> Obviously, so will Lodish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UCLA Notes  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said his team improved some in a 28-25 victory over  San Diego State Saturday night, adding: "Obviously, we have a long, long way to  go to become a good football team and improve. We have an opportunity to take a  big step this week when we play Michigan. But you have to be blind to not  realize what kind of football team they have." . . . Donahue also noted in a  Michigan press release that Coach Bo Schembechler wants to improve his team's  running game, which was shut down to some extent by Notre Dame. "I don't think  you can win in football with passing alone," Schembechler said. "And no matter  how well we pass the ball, that's not going to satisfy me until we will be able  to punch holes in the defense and run." . . . Said Donahue: "I think he meant  that for us. I take it personally."  </P> <P> Bruin injury report: Nose tackle Jon Pryor (broken thumb), tailback Shawn Wills  (sprained ankle), wide receiver Laurence Burkley (dislocated knee), defensive  back Eric Nelson (torn knee ligaments) and tailback Ricky Davis (broken thumb).  They're reportedly out of the Michigan game. "I don't think Wills will play,  but he thinks he will and, if the player thinks so, he usually does," Donahue  said. As for Pryor, a starter, Donahue says he may be out for a while.  </P> <P> Donahue said that quarterback Bret Johnson had a creditable game against San  Diego State. "His greatest asset is that he is extremely competitive," Donahue  said. "If every member of our team was as competitive, we would have a great  team. He thrives on games." . . . UCLA is off to a shaky start, losing to  Tennessee, 24-6, and coming from behind to beat San Diego State, a team that  wasn't supposed to be in UCLA's class. Said Donahue: "Michigan is one of the  top teams in the country. It's an opportunity for our team to step forward and  show our colors."  </P> <P> Schembechler announced in Ann Arbor that freshman Elvis Grbac will be the  Wolverines' starting quarterback this week. Senior starter Michael Taylor  bruised his back last Saturday in Michigan's 24-19 loss to Notre Dame. Grbac  replaced him in the third quarter and completed 17 of 21 passes for 134 yards  and two touchdowns. . . . Fullback Jarrod Bunch also will miss the UCLA game  after injuring a knee against Notre Dame. His replacement will be Leroy Hoard,  who was the most valuable player last January in Michigan's 22-14 Rose Bowl  victory over USC. Hoard, who ran for 142 yards and two touchdowns against USC,  alternated at tailback last week with Tony Boles.  </P> <P> Dean Dingman, a 6-2, 292-pound offensive guard, lost 30 pounds in the week  before the Notre Dame game because of strep throat, Schembechler said, and is  questionable for this week. . . . Gulam Khan, who had two kickoffs returned for  touchdowns by Notre Dame's Raghib Ismail, broke an arm when hit by a blocker  during Ismail's fourth-quarter runback.  </P></p>

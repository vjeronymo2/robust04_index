			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / People: Meehan moves to Mothercare Mothercare, the children's and babywear retailer that is part of the Storehouse group, is replacing its finance director. Mothercare says Paul Ryan, finance director since joining from Budgens, the supermarket chain, in 1989, has resigned from the group to pursue other interests nearer to his Leicestershire home. His replacement is Andrew Meehan, 38, who joins from Sears, where he has been finance director of the sports and leisurewear division. Meehan trained as an accountant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand and spent time at Chase Manhattan and Air Products before joining the Burton Group, where he held senior financial posts in the Top Man, Principles and Burtons chains. He joined Sears in 1987 and was finance director of Selfridges department store before moving to sports and leisurewear. Mothercare's performance has already started to improve thanks to the reform programme begun by former Storehouse chief executive David Dworkin, and being continued by his appointee Ann Iverson, Mothercare's chief executive, but the programme is less advanced than that at sister chain BHS. Meehan is expected to work closely with Iverson on strategic planning.</p>

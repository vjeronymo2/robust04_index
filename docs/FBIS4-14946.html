			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oksana Runova] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg April 6 TASS -- "It is very important  that not only Russia but also the entire Commonwealth of  Independent States should participate in the effort to solve the  problem of Nagorno-Karabakh", believes Mikhail Krotov, chief of  the secretariat of the Council of the Interparliamentary  Assembly of the CIS. "Participating in the negotiations, CIS  member-countries assume the responsibility for the decisions to  be taken, and this creates additional political guarantees that  the arrangements reached will be implemented".    A delegation of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS  countries, headed by Speaker of Kyrgyzstan Parliament Meditkhan  Sharimkulov, has just returned form the zone of the conflict.  The delegation met with leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan and  Nagorno-Karabakh. The trip was made on the decision of the  fourth plenary meeting of the assembly. The request for the  assembly to continue a peacemaking mission was made by both  sides participating in the conflict.    The plan for settlement, known as the Russian plan, although  it coincides with the CSCE plan in many aspects, has been  discussed at the negotiations. Both sides want an earlier  settlement of the conflict, but each fears that agreements can  be broken and that the opposing side may take advantage of the  ceasefire and troops disengagement, Krotov told a briefing.  Parliamentarians' purpose is to create an instrument for  reliable political guarantees and to dispel distrust.    The main purpose is to end bloodshed. At the stage of  settlement of the conflict, much depends on the executive  authorities, Krotov said. On April 15 the Council of Heads of  State and the Council of Governments of the CIS countries will  be held in Moscow, and the problem will be tackled at the level  of presidents and prime ministers. Matters of political  settlement will be considered at the subsequent stage. The role  of parliament will increase. The chief purpose of the Council  of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS at present is to  create an atmosphere favourable for negotiations, Krotov said.  This in the aim of another meeting of parliamentarians to be  held in Bishkek.</p>

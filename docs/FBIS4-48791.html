			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 27 May (AFP) -- The National Democratic  Coalition [NADECO] today renewed its ultimatum to General Sani  Abacha to hand over power to the winner of the 12 June 1993  presidential elections by 31 May.    Yoruba Chief Moshood Abiola proclaimed himself winner of the  said elections, annulled by President Ibrahim Babangida's  military government on the grounds of electoral malpractices.    In a full-page communique published in THE GUARDIAN  newspaper, NADECO which is composed of prominent figures,  retired Army officers, former ministers and state governors,  appealed to Nigerians to boycott the 28 May second round of  balloting to elect district delegates to the upcoming  constitutional conference. The constitutional conference is  scheduled to begin on 27 June in Abuja.    NADECO had earlier called for the boycott of the first round  held on 23 May. "It is obvious that the 23 May elections were a  big failure," the coalition observed.    "The massive boycott of the ward elections is a expression  of  defiance for Gen. Abacha's regime," the communique stated. The  communique was signed by NADECO Secretary General Ayo Opadokun.</p>

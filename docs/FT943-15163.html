			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Rush of business likely before summer recess Parliament's last nine sitting days before MPs disappear for their three-month summer break will bring a flurry of ministerial statements and policy documents on subjects as diverse as accruals accounting and the homeless. It is a time-honoured tradition at Westminster that the last few days of a parliamentary session are dominated by a succession of long-awaited government announcements. But this year threatens to break all records. Between today, when Mr John Major reports to MPs on the world economic summit in Naples, and July 21, when parliament's summer recess starts, at least nine significant government announcements are expected. A number of others, including a statement on parliamentary reform and a Heritage Department white paper on privacy and press freedom may also emerge. One top Whitehall mandarin likened the situation to a queue of jets waiting for a landing-berth at Heathrow airport. 'Government announcements are stacked up for the next 10 days until parliament rises,' he said. In addition to the prime minister's G7 statement and his much-flagged cabinet reshuffle which is set to be unveiled during the next 10 days, Westminster watchers are expecting: An Efficiency Unit study on the future of government research establishments. The study - to be published today by the Cabinet Office - will recommend mergers between laboratories owned by different Whitehall departments. It was launched after an earlier report found 'considerable' overcapacity and overmanning in civil service research laboratories. A white paper on the future of the civil service. To be published on Wednesday, this will propose ending centralised pay bargaining and introduce personal contracts for more than 2,000 top mandarins. Further privatisation will be predicted, with the civil service to drop from 540,000 to 500,000 over the next four years. A Treasury green paper on the shift from cash accounting to accruals accounting. Also expected around the middle of the week, this will provide detailed proposals on how the public sector presents its accounts, bringing it more in line with the private sector. A Commons statement by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, on defence cuts. Expected on Thursday, this may seal the fate of the Rosyth naval base in Scotland. However, Mr Rifkind believes he has secured a package that will not impair the work of Britain's armed forces. New regulations setting a stiffer residency test for EU nationals who say they are looking for work in the UK and seek to claim benefit in the meantime. The new rules are due to come into effect in August. A Commons statement by Sir George Young, housing minister, on the government's homelessness review. The announcement of a number of recommendations by the government's deregulation task force, including a proposal that would allow thousands of charities to escape the requirement for an annual independent examination of their accounts. The Heritage Department said yesterday its white paper on privacy and press freedom might be published during the summer recess. Shake-up of 'archaic' accounting nearer, Page 9</p>

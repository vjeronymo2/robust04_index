			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Collapse of the second Guiness Trial: 'I haven't been beaten by much in my life' - The case that brought a city financier close to breakdown IT IS the sense of incompleteness, with its implication almost of personal failure, that seems most to concern Mr Roger Seelig about the ending of his six-year ordeal arising from the notorious Guinness affair. On the eve of the end of his trial, he said: 'I think we have conducted this defence very well and it is a great disappointment to me not to be able to finish it . . . I never failed to complete a bid and I'm very disappointed to have failed to complete this. 'What I have really had to recognise is that the physical task was just too great. It is very, very hard to convey that to someone who has not had to do it. I haven't been beaten by much in my life and it is a great disappointment to find that you just can't do it. 'I really wanted an acquittal and I'm deeply disappointed at not achieving that through lack of physical stamina.' For more than four months, Mr Seelig conducted his own defence to fraud and false accounting charges. Faced with legal bills running into several hundred thousand pounds and 'the recognition that the costs are completely uncontrollable', he decided lawyers were a luxury he could no longer afford. 'The expenses are quite, quite beyond anything that any salaried employee, however successful, can possibly sustain in trials that go on for a year or more. To have been represented by a full legal team over the past two-and-a-half or more years would have cost perhaps Pounds 3m. 'My highest salary at Morgans was only Pounds 110,000 before tax, though admittedly there were bonuses. The legal aid regulations are not devised for working professionals. They look at your gross assets without taking into account your gross debts.' Had he had any idea of what he was letting himself in for by conducting his own defence? 'No. I knew it would be a considerable effort but I think I thought that one would be capable of seeing that through to the end. When I was at Morgans we really did work all the waking hours, so I thought I could cope with this. But it is different.' His typical working day would begin at 8am when he would arrive at the house of his friend Mr George Devlin. Together they would prepare for the day's hearing until it was time to leave for Southwark Crown Court. When the court day ended they would work together into the night. For much of the trial Mr Devlin, a sometime legal clerk, private investigator and property businessman, also sat in court as Mr Seelig's 'McKenzie friend' - a term arising from a case in which it was held that an unrepresented defendant could have the assistance of someone to take notes and generally help in the conduct of his case. Mr Seelig seemed surprised to be told there had been general admiration in court for the way in which he handled his defence, at least in the early stages. Had he really been as confident as he had seemed? 'No, I felt enormously nervous and apprehensive but strengthened, if you like, by the amount of preparation we had done and the feeling of being well-briefed.' It had been a month to six weeks into the trial when he started to feel the strain. Apart from the workload there had been the mental tension. 'I have not been depressed - and this is an important statement, I think - I have not been depressed at all with the way the trial was going, in fact the opposite: I believe we have been well ahead on points. That has not been part of the stress factor. What you find is it just physically gets you down. 'I was literally only putting papers down when I went to sleep. And then if I woke up in the middle of the night I would go and get them. When I woke up next morning I would get them before getting out of bed, because there isn't enough time to do it. 'Another thing is you don't get positive feedback. I used to work just as hard, in terms of hours, at Morgans, but you'd get successes along the way in the sense of you'd have a successful bid and there would be a sense of a completed job well done. This job not only wasn't complete, it seemed just to stretch endlessly. 'We started off expecting a three-month trial, then it became a four-month trial, then six months, and the last estimates were going through to March 1993, and even those were predicated on a very limited defence. 'There's a limit psychologically - it's very disturbing being in an endless tunnel.' Around the time the trial broke for Christmas he was becoming mentally and physically exhausted. He went to his GP and a consultant psychiatrist with the request that 'they find a way of strengthening me to complete the task. The defence, in my view, was going so well I believed that if I could complete it I would get the acquittal that I wanted.' Apart from the strain, had there been any specific cause for his emotional outbursts that had punctuated the trial? One factor, he believed, was a deep sense of frustration when cross-examining former colleagues. 'Perhaps if I had been a QC I would have found it easier to have attacked those people openly and roughly. 'The whole of my working life I gave to Morgans and made a significant contribution to the house. And it's a matter of deep feeling that not only were they not prepared to stand by me but they actually tried to make me a scapegoat.' When had he realised that he would be in serious trouble if the trial went on? He supposed it had been brought home to him on January 29 when he had had 'a sort of collapse' in court. I'm not a particularly emotional person. I don't think I have really cried about anything in my life and when you find that you are unable to control yourself then clearly the body is telling you something - that you've reached a point of physical and mental exhaustion. I suddenly realised it was getting worse rather than better. There was no respite from the work and it was going from bad to worse in terms of concentration and performance. It's as if you have got a mental block.' Had he expected to be arrested? 'No, I don't think I did because I think it goes back to the question of did I think I had done anything dishonest. I knew there was no question of a ha'penny of personal gain or benefit. And as I said on the day I left Morgans, I had only ever tried to do what I believed to be in the best interests of the client and the house throughout my whole career. 'This was the largest, roughest contested bid there had ever been but one had tried to operate within the framework as one understood it.' If, he added, he had been guilty of anything, it had been overzealousness rather than dishonesty. How did he see his future? 'The immediate future has to be a rest, but I have absolutely no doubt that having had a rest there will be no permanent damage in any way - indeed the doctors have indicated that. I've equally no doubt that the financial world is absolutely in my blood and in one way or another, whether as principal or consultant or whatever, I shall have to find a way of participating in it and earning a living.'</p>

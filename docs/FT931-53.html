			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Consumer confidence drop restrains Dow Wall Street LEADING US stock prices moved in a narrow trading range yesterday after sentiment was undermined by the news of a large fall in a closely watched index of consumer confidence, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.17 at 3,457.27. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 1.20 firmer at 451.97, while the American SE composite was a marginal 0.37 ahead at 419.68. Demand for technology stocks was the driving force for an advance of 5.49 to 686.25 by the Nasdaq composite index. New York SE trading volume totalled 230m shares, while rises held an advantage over declines by 1,031 to 866. There was no follow-through from Monday's solid gains, a reflection of continued uncertainty about the outlook for the US economy. That mood of uncertainty deepened after the Conference Board announced a decline in its March consumer confidence index from 68.5 per cent to 62.6 per cent. Analysts had been expecting the index to fall only slightly, and the news upset the market, which has been concerned at the recent fragility of consumer confidence in spite of the apparent strength of the economic recovery. Sentiment was also undermined by a drop in bond prices, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond back up through 6.9 per cent. Until last week, investors had hoped that bond yields would fall as low as 6.5 per cent, but since then the reversal in the bond market has dashed those hopes. Computer and technology issues were mixed. IBM, which had gained some ground in recent days on the appointment of a new chairman, weakened Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 50 in volume of more than 2.5m shares, and Digital Equipment dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 43 7/8 . Some traders speculated that renewed worries about another dividend cut from IBM were behind the selling. In contrast elsewhere in the sector, Hewlett-Packard firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 75 3/4 and Compaq added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 50 1/4 . Wal-Mart tumbled Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 1/8 in volume of 7m shares after Prudential Securities, the Wall Street brokerage house, lowered its forecast for the retailer's first-quarter net income from 21 cents a share to 19 cents. Fisher-Price plunged Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 20 1/8 in volume of 1.7m shares after the toy manufacturer announced late on Monday that it expects its first-quarter revenues to be about 15 per cent lower than last year's Dollars 146.8m. Instrument Systems rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 following a ratings upgrade from broking house Oppenheimer. Among drug stocks, Marion Merrell Dow added Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 19 1/4 , Merck rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 35 7/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson put on Dollars 2 at Dollars 42 and Pfizer advanced Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 62 1/2 . On the Nasdaq market, Commonwealth Bancshares soared Dollars 9 1/2 to Dollars 42 3/4 on news that the company had signed a definitive pact to merge with Meridian Bancorp in a Dollars 357m deal. Meridian eased Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 32 1/4 . Technology stocks were in demand, with Microsoft climbing Dollars 4 to Dollars 91 in volume of 4.4m shares and Apple appreciating Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 1/4 . Canada TORONTO ended slightly higher after brisk dealings as a surge in gold shares offset losses in most other sectors. The Toronto SE said today's volume was the sixth highest daily total on record. The TSE 300 index gained a mere 0.9 at 3,586.1 and rises narrowly led falls by 346 to 339 after volume of 66.9m shares. The gold bullion price, which rallied to finish Cdollars 4.90 an ounce higher, lifted Canadian gold shares.</p>

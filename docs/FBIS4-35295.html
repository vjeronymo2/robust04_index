			<p>BFN     [Text] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of  Representatives speaker, has stressed that what is happening in  Yemen is an internal affair that is of no concern to the UN  Security Council. He noted that if the UN Security Council is  concerned about human rights, then it should rescue the people  of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    These statements emerged in a news conference held by the  brother House of Representatives speaker in Abu Dhabi yesterday.  He explained that the Yemeni people are offering everything for  the sake of unity because it is dear and is worthy of  sacrificing lives.    Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar said Yemeni unity is  considered a foundation stone on the path of Arab unity.  Therefore, he said, any recognition of the separatists is  tantamount to hostility against the Yemeni people.    He added: Doors are open and bridges are built with all  fraternal Arab and friendly states. The door to dialogue has  not been closed with the unionists in the Socialist Party.</p>

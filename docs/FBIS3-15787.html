			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview with foreign reporters, Ukrainian  Navy Commander Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy has stated that our state  is no longer considering the possibility of transferring to  Russia the Ukrainian share of Black Sea Fleet ships as payment  of the debt for oil and gas. The Navy commander said that the  protocol signed in Massandra was a protocol of intentions. This  has never been a solution. According to Volodymyr  Bezkorovaynyy, this issue has been studied and rejected. The  transfer to Russia of our share of the fleet is no longer  discussed. Instead of this, the commander added, the two sides  agreed to set up a committee for compiling an inventory of ships  and other fleet property for their further division in  accordance with earlier agreements between the presidents of the  two states. Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy believes that the fleet  should be divided equally by the end of 1995.</p>

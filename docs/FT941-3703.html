			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: English China Clays Demerging out of building materials makes strategic sense now that English China Clays has set its sights on chemistry rather than digging holes in the ground. The exercise also usefully relieves the parent of the need to support its capital-intensive offspring during the upturn. Yet ECC has resisted the temptation to burden Camas, the demerged company, with more than its fair share of the dividend. It is touch and go whether ECC would have covered its share of the pay-out once earnings from building materials and land sales are stripped out of yesterday's full-year figures. While surplus land is being sold and capital spending is below depreciation, the cash cost of the dividend is bearable. But at the current rate of progress the land bank will be empty within two years. Neither can a sudden revival in minerals - which accounts for four-fifths of continuing turnover  -be relied upon. True, margins are now some 5 percentage points below the peak and recent price increases are an encouraging sign. If changes in paper technology depress demand for kaolin, though, rebuilding margins will be a long haul. ECC thus still needs to find earnings growth elsewhere. Calgon, the specialty chemicals company acquired last year, provides a useful first step in that direction but is too small to transform the prospects of the group. Additional critical mass might also help Calgon compete from a poor third place in the US market. After two rights issues in three years ECC has room to borrow. To justify maintaining the dividend through the downturn, it now has to spend wisely.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 13 SAPA -- Government, African  National Congress and Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] negotiating  teams emerged from nearly five hours of talks in Pretoria on  Wednesday [13 April] night to say they had a new proposal to  save the international mediation process.    The process broke down before it began on Wednesday morning  when IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi rejected the terms of  reference.    ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said after the  Pretoria  talks the IFP still wanted to engage the ANC in negotiations on  a new date for elections. He said a change of date was  impossible and it was not on the table for mediation. "That  date is sacrosanct and is not the subject of mediation," Mr  Ramaphosa said.    He left the talks for a meeting in Johannesburg with  mediators Dr Henry Kissinger and Lord Peter Carrington.    Mr Ramaphosa said the negotiators had agreed in principle on  dividing the mediation process into two phases. The first would  be a pre-mediation agreement and the second an agreement on the  implementation of the results of mediation.    Minister of Home Affairs Danie Schutte said government did  not favour changing the election date. "The very last thing we  would want to extend is the election date," Mr Schutte said. He  said the proposal put together by the negotiators appeared to be  acceptable to all the parties</p>

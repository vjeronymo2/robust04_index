			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Bankruptcy law claims first victim: Demise of worthless polluter sees break with communist economics RUSSIAN commercial history was made when Cellulose Plant No. 2 in the Archangel region was declared not worth saving because there was 'no demand for its output and it pollutes the environment'. This judgment by the local arbitration court made the state-owned plant the first to go bust under a pioneering bankruptcy law passed in April. In debt to the tune of Rbs36m, assets valued at Rbs31m were ordered shared out among state-owned creditors ranging from the local power company, Archenergo, to a local bread supplier. In southern Russia, a private food supplier called Don-Chance, which was owed Rbs2.46m for deliveries of sunflower oil, initiated bankruptcy proceedings against a private company called Diaton in the town of Volodga, whose shareholders included the local football team. Diaton, with total debts of Rbs50m, was also put into liquidation. More than a dozen cases processed so far from Archangel in the far north to Sakhalin Island in the far east, show that the law, which is vital to market reforms, is gradually being applied despite a host of obstacles to it. The court records were made available to the Financial Times yesterday. The biggest impediment to its widespread use is a dearth of qualified judges, managers and auditors to handle bankruptcy proceedings seven decades after capitalism was stamped out by the Bolshevik revolution. In communist times, when money was cheap and everything was state-owned, debts did not matter. Even after market reforms were launched in January last year, many companies continued to supply each other with goods without demanding payment. Partly as a result of tighter financial discipline being imposed by the government, that practice is now beginning to change, with many of the plaintiffs featuring power companies. But when Irkusktenergo in Siberia initiated bankruptcy proceedings against the Bratsk timber company for not paying its bills, the judge fined the plaintiff after an auditors check found the timber company had plenty of money to pay its debts. The judge said the power company should have gone to court to recover debts instead of initiating bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

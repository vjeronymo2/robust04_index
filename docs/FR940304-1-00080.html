			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department invites comment on the most appropriate methodology upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which to base the commercial discount rate and the best types and sources of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data to use in the calculation of this rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Social discount rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In identifying a discount rate that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for use in calculating benefits to the Nation as a whole, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department must consider the opportunity costs of devoting more economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources to the production and purchase of more energy-efficient appliances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fewer national resources to other alternative types of investment. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not necessary, however, to determine the characteristics of specific classes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of consumers or businesses directly impacted by the proposed standard. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these reasons, a broad measure of the average rates of return earned by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic investment throughout the United States is the most useful basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a social discount rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using this approach, the Office of Management and Budget prepared a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background on OMB's Discount Rate Guidance in November of 1992, containing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of the average annual real rate of return earned on investments made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since 1960 in nonfinancial corporations, non-corporate farm and non-farm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proprietorships, and owner-occupied housing in the United States. The results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this analysis indicated that since 1980, the annual real rate of return for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these categories of investments averaged slightly more than 7 percent, ranging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a low of about 4 percent for owner-occupied housing (which represented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 43 percent of total capital assets in 1991 of about $15 trillion) to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high of about 9 percent on non-corporate farm and non-farm capital (which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represented about 23 percent of the total). Between 1960 and 1980, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average real rate of return on capital was higher, averaging about 8.5 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the 1970's and about 11.2 percent in the 1960's. As a result of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, the Office of Management and Budget chose to designate 7 percent as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the social discount rate specified in revisions to Office of Management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget Circular A&hyph;94 issued on November 10, 1992 (57 FR 53519). In that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised circular, Office of Management and Budget established,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  discount rate guidance for benefit-cost analyses of regulatory programs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide benefits and costs to the general public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative method for deriving such social discount rate might be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad measures of the costs of financing capital investments in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. One such measure is the Federal Government's cost of borrowing or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest rate that is payable on long-term Government securities. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be the prime interest rate available to major corporate borrowers. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to derive a real discount rate from either of these measures the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant interest rate would be adjusted for inflation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to long-term Government securities as an example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nominal rates during June 1991 on Government securities maturing between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years 2000 and 2015 averaged 8.55 percent. Adjusted by long term forecasts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflation, the rate would be approximately 4 percent. Because the Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowing rate most accurately reflects the direct cost to the Government of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added investment, the Office of Management and Budget has used this approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the basis for discount rates used in evaluating Federal investments which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly affect Federal costs (such as energy efficiency investments in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal facilities). Using the prime interest rate or some combination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates to reflect non-Federal financing costs would result in somewhat higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated above, because the cost of financing additional capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investments does not reflect the full opportunity cost of shifting private  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment from one area to another, it is not considered to be a good basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for deriving discount rates. For this reason, DOE is now proposing the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a 7 percent social discount rate in National net present value calculations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although it will also perform sensitivity analyses at 4 percent and 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent. The Department seeks comment on appropriate discount rates for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Life-Cycle Cost Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another consumer issue that drew a considerable number of comments was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the suggestion that in its life-cycle cost analyses, the Department include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any additional installation and maintenance expenses that may result from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation standards.

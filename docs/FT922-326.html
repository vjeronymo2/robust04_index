			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Basic problems This is not to deny that the big Japanese manufacturers are under heavy pressure. But on a long view, those problems which can be attributed to the asset bubble seem largely transitory. Much has been made of the vast sums raised on the basis of equity warrants which must now be repaid because the warrants are worthless. But companies will issue new bonds to pay off the old, and the old bondholders will doubtless reinvest accordingly. The fact that the rate of interest will shoot up from perhaps 0.5 per cent to 6 per cent is a problem for the profit and loss account, but not for the balance sheet or the financial system in general. Again, much of the cheap money went on a huge surge in capital investment. Perhaps a third of that went on new capacity, which will be taken up as demand eventually recovers. Much of the rest went on what might be termed over-differentiation: video recorders with too many buttons, cars with too many flashing lights on the dashboard. That kind of thing was popular with Japanese consumers in the bubble years and is now out of fashion. If the fashion returns with the cycle, the manufacturers are tooled up to supply it. But there are more fundamental problems which the bursting of the bubble has merely brought forward. A remarkable number of Japan's big manufacturing sectors seem beleaguered one way or another. The auto industry is experiencing an unprecedented drop in domestic demand. In the old days, it might have offset this by increasing sales overseas. Now it not only faces trade friction: it also manufactures abroad on a huge scale already. The consumer electronics industry faces market saturation and a dearth of new products. Much is pinned on high definition television and associated gadgets: sceptics are doubtful. The construction industry has been promised huge infrastructure spending, but the long-term pressure on government spending points the other way.</p>

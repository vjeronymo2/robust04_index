			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by correspondent Jozsef Laszlo; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Laszlo] [passage omitted] Last week new and  controversial details emerged about your accident. How do you  remember it now, more than a week after your accident? What  actually happened?    [Horn] I told the police that we were traveling at about 90  km an hour. I know this precisely, because we were joking about  it just before the accident. I saw a flash in front of us on  the road but I do not remember anything more because the driver  swerved and we crashed. It is a fact that the truck did not  have any lights on; it is a fact that there was nobody in front  of us to overtake and that the road was completely dry. Thus  the circumstances would have been right -- barring something  untoward -- for us to avoid this stupid accident. [passage  omitted]    [Laszlo] The question arises whether you will accept the  nomination for prime minister.    [Horn] Well, look, it depends on my party's decision. We  decided, and it was adopted by the congress at the end of  February, that once the coalition negotiations are completed, a  special congress will make the final decision in personnel  matters. If this body, by expressing the opinion of the  membership, decides that Gyula Horn is suitable for this task,  naturally, I will not run away from the responsibility. I will  accept the responsibility. [passage omitted]    The important thing is that the future economic  decisionmakers in the cabinet should have total power. What  went on here for four years -- when the leader of the economic  decisionmaking body was changed nearly every year -- was  untenable. However, before anyone can accuse me of pushing my  party's interests, let me tell you that I have never volunteered  for any post; I was always asked. If the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] wins the elections and decides to nominate me for  prime minister, naturally I will say yes. If not, it is not the  end of the world for me.    [Laszlo] [passage omitted] The press reported earlier that  the MSZP might be willing not only to form a coalition with the  Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], but perhaps also with the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] or the Christian  Democrats. What is the situation now?    [Horn] There are no coalition negotiations under way with  any  party. I have to add, of course, that a kind of preliminary  consultation is under way. [passage omitted] We are open to  the SZDSZ. Naturally, this openness could decrease if a certain  tone or style got the upper hand within the SZDSZ, which we  would not be pleased to see.    As for Fidesz, well, it suffered a serious loss in the  elections. Unfortunately, the style of statements made by some  Fidesz leaders during the election campaign sometimes resembled  the extreme right. Under these circumstances it would be very  difficult for the MSZP to achieve an agreement with  representatives of this style.    Regarding the Christian Democrats, we said at the end of  February that we are ready to cooperate with the Christian  Democratic People's Party, to be precise, if it sheds its  extremist tendencies. Well, I do not see many signs of this  being done.    [Laszlo] MSZP leaders have often said that they do not wish  to conduct any kind of spring cleaning -- either on a large  scale or a small scale. How do you envision the running of  offices in the next tenure of government?    [Horn] The prime minister and the political state  secretaries  have to go when there is a change of government. As to whether  the administrative state secretaries will go or stay, in my mind  this is up to a personal and subjective decision. In the case  of the deputy state secretaries, their professional performance  has to be examined. These will be our guiding principles if we  are in this position. To my mind there are very many who worked  very well in the past four years.    [Laszlo] How do you envision the oft-mentioned social  consensus or agreement, in which employers, employees, and  politics would all participate?    [Horn] We have issued a letter of intent regarding the  organization of an economic and social agreement. The goal is  to create an agreement between the government and the interest  protection organizations of the employers and employees, but not  only on social issues. For example, the reform of the budget  must be started by all means, that is, the reform of the  large-scale system of distribution.    There is a need for a new privatization practice or policy.  The opportunity must be created for a new modernization  program, that is, over and above privatization something real  and genuine should take place in the modernization of the  economy. Because, contrary to all other talks, one of the facts  of the past four years is: first, modernization has not begun in  the economy. Second, productivity has declined. The recovery  of Hungarian agriculture and currency can be considered a  national issue. Naturally, on the issues of income, taxation,  social security, and the health service, agreement must be  reached in the most concrete manner, in writing and in public.  For in the next period everything must be done in public.    There is a need for the greatest degree of self-restraint on  behalf of every participant in social and political public life.  For nobody can produce a miracle here. It is impossible to  raise the standard of living suddenly from nothing and to  improve social services. However, improvement can be achieved  by a much better and much fairer distribution system.    [Laszlo] The party faced accusations earlier that a certain  section of the party is inclined to initiate some sort of  restoration. These accusations can still be heard today.    [Horn] The MSZP does not want any kind of restoration, for  example renationalization. Our goal and basic philosophy is to  create a social market economy and a market economy cannot be  built without a considerable proportion of private ownership.    The newly and legally acquired property of new owners must  not be touched. Just as the church properties must not be  touched either. Compensation: We were against it in parliament,  but now we want to finish it. We want to complete it. What the  previous government and parliament pledged must be completed.  However, it must be finished as soon as possible, as early as  in 1995. There is no chance for any kind of restoration, for  anybody who contemplates this is bound to be defeated and we do  not want to be defeated but to succeed.</p>

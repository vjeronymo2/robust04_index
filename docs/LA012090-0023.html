			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOORAY FOR THOSE WHO AMBUSH DUCKS  </P> <P> Thank you for the front-page article, "South for the Winter," on Jan. 16.  </P> <P> Although I must admit that I have never experienced the thrilling sport of  ambushing ducks from behind the bushes, I look up to macho-men like Mr.  Missildine with sheer awe.  </P> <P> After all, it takes a special kind of person to blast more than 2,000 birds in  two days, just as it takes a special kind of newspaper to feature these types  of American heroes.  </P> <P> Maybe next week you can do an article on blinding deer with high-powered  lights, then blasting them with semiautomatic rifles. How about chasing  raccoons up trees with a pack of dogs and shooting them out of the branches?  Whatever article it is, I can only hope it measures up to the standards  established by your detailed profile of those who blow ducks out of the sky.  </P> <P> By the way, cancel my subscription.  </P> <P> MICHAEL VOGT, Valencia  </P></p>

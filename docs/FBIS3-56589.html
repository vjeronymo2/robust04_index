			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis has described as  uncivilized the decision by the command of Russia's Northwestern  Army Group to authorize the use of arms for the defense of  Russian servicemen and army property on Latvian territory.    Following the incident with two Russian generals on January  10, the command of the Northwestern Army Group authorized  servicemen to shoot to kill to rebuff attempts to seize any army  facility.    Briefing newsmen on January 17, Ulmanis described the  decision as an uncivilized response to the civilized moves he  made on January 10. He reminded newsmen that action had been  taken immediately on his orders for the release of the Russian  generals, subsequent investigation and punishment of those  responsible.    Ulmanis saw the decision as provocative and a show of force.    He hoped it would have no far-reaching repercussions. He  also saw it as a signal for the Latvian authorities to show more  caution in what they choose to say or do.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 24 Jun (EFE) -- Quito newspapers published  reports today that an Ecuadoran labor leader died on Thursday  after being shot during a clash between soldiers and Aztra  company employees, who staged a demonstration to protest the  firm's privatization. The source added that two employees have  disappeared, between two and five are wounded, and about 12 have  been arrested.    Aztra sugar refinery union spokesmen say they are holding a  Canar electoral tribunal employee hostage and intend to exchange  him for the detained workers. The spokesmen say there are minors  among the detained persons.    Walter Santos, 54 years old, was shot and killed on the  fourth consecutive day of demonstrations by Aztra employees, who  are demanding payment of delayed salaries and protesting the  sale of the company, which is located approximately 400 km  southwest of Quito.    The state-owned National Financial Corporation (CFN) on  Wednesday transferred the company to a consortium of Ecuadoran  and Colombian businessmen for $100,000, less than 2 percent of  the firm's estimated value.    The workers were joined in their demonstrations by residents  of La Troncal, a town near the Aztra facilities, who also  confronted the soldiers. The soldiers are in the streets  following Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen's declaration  of a state of emergency on Tuesday due to a conflict with the  Indians.    The CFN sold 98 percent of the sugar refinery's shares for  $100,000. The mill supplies 30 percent of the sugar consumed in  Ecuador.    Up until March, each Aztra share sold for 750 sucres  ($0.40),  but unexpectedly, according to stock market sources, they were  auctioned on Wednesday for 8.55 sucres each, an act described by  the workers as "illegal, immoral, and shameful."    Quito Stock Market Director Hector Terneus admitted that  "such a broad fluctuation is not normal," but he denied the  wrongdoing denounced by workers.    "The transaction was legal because it was in accordance with  regulations governing the Ecuadoran stock market and stock  exchange," Terneus said, although other reports assert that the  state lost approximately $60 million.    Former CFN leader Guillermo Landazuri said the "symbolic"  sale proves beyond a doubt "the dishonest manner in which Sixto  Duran-Ballen's conservative administration has managed the  privatization process" by "discrediting and damaging the image  of state companies to lower their prices."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 15, BNS -- Vytautas Landsbergis,  leader of the Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition,  expressed satisfaction with Lithuanian President Algirdas  Brazauskas' speech at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council  of Europe in Strasbourg Thursday [14 April].    "Most probably it was the first time that the head of the  Lithuanian state criticized Russia's policy and leadership,"  Landsbergis told a news conference Friday.    In his words, until now, Lithuania carried out a timeserving  policy with respect to Moscow. "I now see that the leadership of  the LDLP (Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party) understands  Russia's actual policy," Landsbergis said.    The opposition leader said he is not certain that the LDLP  has decided to view things realistically, but such indications  exist.    Landsbergis said a realistic view means "to give up  "Moscowcentrism," inherited from Soviet times, when Moscow is  understood as the big center where Lithuania's fate is decided.    "Possibilities to form not a post-communist-single-party,  but  a national policy may then appear."</p>

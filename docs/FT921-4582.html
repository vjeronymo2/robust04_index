			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Heavy provisions cut Britannia profit to Pounds 64m BAD LOANS forced Britannia, the tenth largest building society, to make the heaviest provisions in its history against possible losses during 1991. Provisions were up from Pounds 7.3m in 1990 to Pounds 33.7m last year, driving the society's pre-tax profits down by 13 per cent from Pounds 73.6m to Pounds 64m. Total group assets rose by 15 per cent in 1991 to Pounds 8.5bn (Pounds 7.42bn). Britannia's savings business rose by 21.6 per cent during the year to Pounds 834.9m compared with Pounds 686.5m and the society's assets grew by a further Pounds 175.4m as a result of its merger with the Mornington Building Society. During August, the society temporarily withdrew from the commercial mortgage market. Before provisions, Britannia's profits were up by 20.7 per cent and Mr Michael Shaw, managing director, said that it had made significant progress in a severely depressed market, and improved its market share on both sides of its business. Britannia Life, the small life assurance and investment company which Britannia bought and demutualised two years ago, was said to have returned excellent results and made a better contribution to profits. In August 1991, it bought Crusader Insurance and increased its funds under management to Pounds 1.2bn.</p>

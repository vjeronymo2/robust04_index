			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Dong Huifeng (5516 2585 1496)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 18 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Today, while  meeting a delegation from the Federation of Five Plastics  Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, Chen Ziying, deputy  director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, said that the establishment of the Preliminary Working  Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region [SAR] is completely aimed at  meeting the need for Hong Kong's smooth transition, for a smooth  transfer of government power in Hong Kong, and for the  establishment of the SAR. The attitude the British side takes  toward the PWC is a touchstone for judging whether the British  side is willing to maintain Hong Kong's smooth transition and is  willing to cooperate with the Chinese side.    Chen Ziying pointed out: After the breakdown of the  Sino-British political talks, the Chinese side is still willing  to cooperate with the British side on other issues, but this is  contingent on the British side's attitude. We hope that the  British side will show sincerity and will not repeat its  practice concerning political issues in the past.    He said: Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland are situated in  the Asia-Pacific economic belt, which has recorded the fastest  development in the world. Maintaining a smooth transition for  Hong Kong is not only beneficial to the mainland and Hong Kong,  but also to other sides with economic interests in Hong Kong.  Some people in the British Hong Kong authorities always  misjudge the situation and draw erroneous conclusions. This  will just cause losses to their own interests.    He added: A distinct difference between clever people and  foolish people lies in the fact that the former do not repeat  the same mistakes they committed before. It is hoped that they  are clever now.    Chen Ziying said: The recent meetings of the political and  economic affairs groups of the PWC were quite successful.  First, the PWC members had an opportunity to listen to opinions  from people in various circles in Hong Kong. Second, the PWC's  mainland members had a chance to know more about the actual  conditions in Hong Kong. This enabled them to put forth  proposals and opinions more pertinent to the actual conditions  of Hong Kong and to the wishes of Hong Kong people. Therefore,  the other three groups of the PWC will also hold meetings in  Hong Kong next year.    When talking about the economic relationship between Hong  Kong and the mainland, Chen Ziying said that the two sides were  closely integrated with each other. For example, there are tens  of thousands of Hong Kong-funded enterprises in the Zhu Jiang  Delta area, almost all of the major new property projects in  Beijing involve Hong Kong investment, and more mainland  state-owned enterprises will be listed on the Hong Kong stock  market. All this shows that cooperation between the two sides  has been speeding up, and the scope for cooperation is expanding  with bright prospects for the future.    Finally, Chen Ziying said that Hong Kong's smooth transition  and long-term prosperity will eventually depend on Hong Kong  people themselves. Even if the British side refuses to  cooperate in the last stage of the transitional period, Hong  Kong will maintain its status as an international financial and  trade center after 1997.    Zhang Liangdong, director of the Hong Kong Economic Affairs  Department of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, attended  the meeting held at the Xindadu Hotel in Beijing.    The 42-member delegation from the Hong Kong plastics  industry  is headed by Mr. Leung Kei-yau.</p>

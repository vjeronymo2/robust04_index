			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Progress on German share front Dresdner Bank yesterday took a significant step towards realising the concept of wider share ownership by becoming the first big German corporation to announce it will split up its shares to make them more affordable. Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman, said the bank would propose to the next annual meeting that the nominal value of its shares be reduced to DM5 from DM50 each. Other companies, such as the Schering chemicals group, have said they plan to do this, but Dresdner is the first to make the move. German shares are some of the most expensive in the world. Dresdner Bank's share price yesterday stood at about DM408 (Dollars 260); adopting a nominal share denomination of DM5 that would be reduced to just over DM40. The costliest share in Germany is that of the Allianz insurance group, yesterday quoted at DM2,475. Mr Sarrazin said he hoped other German companies would take advantage of the provision in the new financial market promotion law allowing companies to cut their nominal share values. He said it was likely the DM15bn share issue by state-owned Deutsche Telekom, the German telecommunications group, in 1996 would be in the form of DM5 shares to attract a wide range of investors. 'I assume that all big companies want a wider spread in the ownership of their shares,' he added. The next six to 12 months would show how much interest there was in moving to lower denominated shares. Two recent German new issues - the Fielmann optical chain and Hanover Re, the reinsurance group - have been in DM5 nominal shares. A recent study by DG Bank concluded that a move towards DM5 nominal shares would raise the interest of private investors in equities. Compared with many other countries, investment in shares is a low proportion of total savings and investment. DG Bank said the average value of units in the DAX index of leading shares was DM570 in April. Only Switzerland, with an average price of DM1,625 was higher. US shares were quoted at an average equivalent of about DM70, with those in Tokyo at DM20 and in London at DM13.</p>

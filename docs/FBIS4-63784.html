			<p>BFN     [Text] Kyrgyzstan has already been through the first and  the most difficult stage on its way to democracy and market  economy, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev said in an interview with  INTERFAX today.    He stressed that entrepreneurship was developing in  Kyrgyzstan and that a class of entrepreneurs had appeared in the  Republic. Akayev pointed out that the larger this class the more  stable the Kyrgyz community would be.    However, Akayev admitted that the society in the Republic  was  quickly being divided into the rich and the poor. That is why  the state policy must concentrate on social security, Akayev  remarked. He announced that the World Bank would allot from $40  million to $60 million for support of the social sphere.    Akayev said that the state treasury was failing to collect  all due taxes. He considered this to be one of the main  problems in the Republic. In 1993 all taxes collected amounted  to 14 percent of GNP. "As a result we cannot pay people their  salaries and pensions and cannot finance urgent social and  economic programs, Akayev pointed out.    However, he added that Kyrgyzstan had the lowest inflation  rate in the CIS (4.9 percent in April). He said this had become  possible due to the tough monetary credit policy pursued by the  National Bank and to the support of the IMF and the World Bank.</p>

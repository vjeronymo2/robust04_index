			<p>Protection   <F P=102>   PA2505000794 Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 24 May 94 p 2a </F> <F P=103> PA2505000794 </F> <F P=104>  Panama City LA PRENSA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Quintero De Leon] </F>   [Text] Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria has asked all  of the country's lawyers and members of the Supreme Court of  Justice to establish something that was already done in 1991--to  remove secrecy protection from corporations so that offenses can  no longer be committed under this system.    His proposal was prompted by the scandal involving the  Homsany Group, which the National Bank of Panama [BNP] and the  Comptroller General's Office are accusing of stealing millions  of balboas from the BNP. "We cannot let the secrecy of  corporations serve to commit crimes," Comptroller Chen said. He  said that in this particular case his office is using a  precedent set by Panamanian law regarding corporations.    It would be up to the courts to determine if it is possible  to remove the cover of secrecy from corporations, he said.    Regarding meddling by the Comptroller General's Office in  this case, he said the office acted according to its  responsibility and the law through the Directorate for the  Recovery of State Property.    In those instances, the delegated District Attorney's Office  continues gathering evidence, which clearly proves a crime was  comitted. The Homsany Group is trying to evade justice by using  the veil of corporations.    "I hope the courts will do their work and that the  proofs--which are categorical--will be sufficient for justice to  prevail in Panama." Chen Barria described what the Homsany  Group did--using 38 companies to steal 5.6 million balboas--as  detrimental to the BNP's funds, which belong to all Panamanians.    In fact, 33 out of these 38 companies were never in  business,  but their legal representatives and those who signed as loan  debtors were employees earning between $200 and $250. "All of  this shows a duly structured and planned crime," Chen Barria  commented.    The companies involved in this crime are not operating, but  the comptroller general revealed that the Homsany Group is  running these companies under other corporations.</p>

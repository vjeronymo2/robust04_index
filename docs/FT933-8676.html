			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Romanian rail militancy Romanian train drivers yesterday vowed to step up their three-day strike following a supreme court decision declaring their action illegal, reports Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. Union leaders reacted angrily to the ruling and told the drivers to go on 'all-out strike' until demands for a 15 per cent pay rise and new pay differentials were met. The drivers had previously operated limited emergency services. The strike has brought the country's railways to a near standstill and, because of the war in the former Yugoslavia, blocked the only east-west route for international rail traffic travelling through the Balkans.</p>

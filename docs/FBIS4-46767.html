			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Khamrayev: "Opposition Leaders Once Again </F> Demanded Unity: General Makashov Offered His Services to Our  Lord"]    [Text] Unity will be finally nailed down in the end of May  by convening a "national assembly;" the State Duma will support  "our guys;" the working class, having discovered the unpaid  wages, will wake up from its hibernation and, forming a solid  union with the peasants, intelligentsia, and Barkashov's  confederates, will walk out on a general strike, the crowning of  which will be restoration of the power of the soviets and the  fall of the regime of "Judases and Pilates." This was the main  theme of the literature and arts evening held on Thursday by the  ZAVTRA newspaper at the Izmaylovo indoor complex.    The evening began with declamation of poems, spiritual  canticles, and folklore collectives' performances, which formed  an integrated musical-poetic composition and was over while the  spectators continued to fill the 4,000 floor and bleacher seats  in accordance with purchased (at 500-2,000 rubles [R] each)  tickets. The soundtrack of tolling church bells announced the  beginning of the official part, and a large group of leaders of  right and left, radical and centrist opposition, whose speeches  made up the contents of the evening, walked up to the podium.  The master of ceremonies was Aleksandr Prokhanov.    The first production number was Aleksandr Rutskoy. The  former  vice president informed viewers that the disparate forces of the  opposition have been brought together not by thirst for power  but thirst for a decent life. Mr. Rutskoy expressed his pain for  Russia, which has lost its status of world power because of  "Kozyrev and Yeltsin's foreign policy course," which Aleksandr  Vladimirovich, with an apology to the listener, called  "bastardly." Then he emphasized once again his desire to  celebrate the next 9 May under Soviet power, which, in Mr.  Rutskoy's conviction, will represent people's power in the 21st,  22d, and 23d and all subsequent centuries."    Communist Party of the Russian Federation leader Gennadiy  Zyuganov complained that over the years of reforms the  communists were left "without leaders, without money, and  without office space;" noted that "the communist idea is the  Russian idea;" and informed the audience that "we have hundreds  of newspapers, our own administrative and economic managers,"  and insistently demanded of all other leaders that they complete  mutual consultations before the end of May and convene a  "national assembly," which will work out a program of joint  action.    In the opinion of Aleksandr Nevzorov, one can clearly see  that "we definitely have a majority in the State Duma:" In the  deputy-reporter's words, three-quarters of the Duma members will  shed a tear "at the sound of the Soviet Union's national  anthem." The only ones who continue to support the enemy camp  are the "dem-schizophrenics," whose typical representative is  Gleb Yakunin.    The only woman among the speakers--nun Angelinya from  Serbia--exhorted Russia: "Wake up!" Being "God's bride," the nun  insisted on turning "the secret was between Americanism and the  Slavs, between Zionism and Orthodoxy, into an open war."    Albert Makashov brought his own unique flavor to this  evening  of literature and arts; he was introduced by Mr. Prokhanov as  the author of "Suvorov's expression": "...neither mayors, nor  sirs, nor herrs [peckers]." Drawing a historical analogy between  the October events of last year and the Kronshtadt and Tambov  rebellions, the organizer of the storming of the mayoralty and  Ostankino said no agreements on any accord with "Ye-Be-eN"  [Yeltsin's initials, which, when spelled this way, form the  Russian equivalent of "fucking"] are possible. Then, having  dashingly rapped out: "Yes to the Russian government! Yes to the  Russian economy!"--Mr. Makashov moved on to the spiritual  sphere, imparting on the audience his prayer to the Lord "to  kick out of the Kremlin the crooks, prostitutes, thieves,  cosmopolitans, and other scum." "And if you are too busy, Lord,"  he continued his tale, "then let me do it!" Albert Makashov  volunteered to give "his knowledge, his strength, and his rank"  to the leader who will be able to unite the entire opposition.  In conclusion, the general informed the audience that he "has  the honor" and "serves the Soviet Union."    Others who voiced their support for the idea of a unified  opposition with a unified ideology and one leader included Ilya  Konstantinov, Sergey Baburin, Cossack Captain Viktor Morozov,  the amnestied "minister of defense" Vladislav Achalov, the  "glorious GKChP member" Vasiliy Starodubtsev, and Ruslan  Imranovich Khasbulatov, who sent to the gathering his written  address. According to Aleksandr Prokhanov, words of solidarity  were received from Aleksandr Barkashov, who could not attend for  reason of poor health; Valeriy Zorkin, who "probably was delayed  by a traffic jam;" and others.    The final coda was delivered by Viktor Anpilov. The RCWP  [Russian Communist Workers Party] leader announced the precise  date for the all-Russia general strike--it has been moved to 21  September--and proposed to hold a "primary round of presidential  elections" by distributing among the population the list of  candidates from all opposition parties and movements. The  winner, in Mr. Anpilov's design, will become the sole candidate  from the unified opposition at the official early presidential  elections.    With this, they parted. The spectators leaving the Izmaylovo  indoor complex were offered at the door the purchase for R1,500  of ATTACK--the first issue of the first Russian nationalist  magazine with a swastika on the cover. The magazine, according  to those selling it, is intended "only for Aryans" and those "in  whom the lack of Aryan blood line is compensated for by  great-power spirit." "Black shirts" were offered a R200 discount.</p>

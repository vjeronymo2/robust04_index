			<p>SUMMARY                                      The Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU) has far outdistanced other  parties in the 27 March-10 April Ukrainian Supreme Soviet  election, based on a big win in Donetsk and Luhansk and poor  showing by the more moderate leftist parties and eastern-oriented  democratic parties competing for the same voters.  Meanwhile,  election results for Rukh appeared disappointing and other  nationalist democratic parties were almost wiped out, gathering  only a handful of seats at best.  The election will probably  exacerbate the regional split between east and west since  communists and other leftists won not a single seat in all seven  western oblasts while nationalist democrats appeared to win only  a few in the east.                                 END SUMMARY      Although one fourth of its 450 seats remain unfilled, the new  parliament has sufficient deputies to form a quorum and legally  begin sessions.  According to Central Electoral Committee  Chairman Ivan Yemets, 338 deputies were elected in the 27 March  election and 3 and 9-10 April runoffs and these form "a qualified  majority as envisaged by the constitution" (UNIAR, 13 April).  The other 111 or 112 seats were unfilled because both candidates  fell short of 50 percent in the runoffs or because insufficient  voters turned out to meet the 50 percent turnout requirement.  The biggest blocks of vacancies occurred in Kiev city (18 of the  23 seats), Krym (12), and in Dnipropetrovsk (15).  The Supreme  Soviet leadership on 12 April proposed that new elections be held  in these districts on 10 July (UNIAR, 12 April).   Success of Parties (See Note 1)      Candidates backed by or affiliated with parties won exactly half  the seats (169), according to Yemets (UNIAR, 13 April), with the  other half going to independents.  Except for the CPU, few  parties won more than a handful of seats.  Most parties-  -especially democratic parties--may dwindle or disappear or have  to combine to continue existence.      (Note 1) The following detailed results are based largely on  district-by-district results provided in daily bulletins from the  Post-Postup News Agency or in the 1-7 April Post-Postup  newspaper.      The leftists, based on the big block of CPU deputies, won over  one-third of the seats filled.  Yemets said that 86 CPU members  were elected, along with 14 for the Socialist Party of Ukraine  (SPU) and 18 for the leftist Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU),  for a total of 118 (UNIAR, 13 April).  Rukh won only 20 and the  Ukrainian Republican Party (URP) only 8, according to Yemets  (UNIAR, 13 April).  The Election-94 press center, set up to  gather election information independently of the electoral  commission because of the alleged frequent "inaccuracy" of  information from the latter (Ukrainian Weekly, 20 February 1994),  announced alternative and more detailed figures, indicating that  339 seats had been filled and giving fewer seats to leftists and  more to Rukh (UNIAR, 12 April):   bot           Leftists            Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU)         75           Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU)         12           Peasant Party of Ukraine (SelPU)         11           Labor Party                               3           Civil Congress of Ukraine                 2                 total                             103            Nationalist Democrats            Rukh                                     26           Ukrainian Republican Party (URP)          9           Union of Officers of Ukraine (SOU)        5           Democratic Party of Ukraine (DemPU)       4           Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine     2           National Rukh (the Rukh set up in              opposition to Rukh Chairman              Vyacheslav Chornovil)                  1                  total                             47            Non-nationalist Democrats            Interregional Bloc for Reforms (MBR)      6           Party of Democratic Revival of              Ukraine (PDVU)                         3           Social Democratic Party of Ukraine        2                   total                            11            Ultranationalists            Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN)  6           Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA)         3           Ukrainian Conservative Republican              Party (UKRP)                           2                     total                          11  eot      Rukh itself claimed 30 of its members were elected and listed  them in the 14 April issue of its paper Rada.  In the first  round, of the 49 seats settled, 12 had gone to the CPU, 4 to  Rukh, 2 apiece to the URP, SelPU, SPU, and KUN, and 1 to the UKRP  (Holos Ukrainy, 31 March).   Leftists      The CPU lead came out of the east, which gave the party at least  52 of its 86 or so seats, with 40 from Donetsk and Luhansk alone.  The CPU also picked up 17 in the south (Krym, Odesa, Mykolaiv,  and Kherson) and ran strong in Kirovohrad, where it took 5 of the  8 seats settled, judging from Post-Postup district figures.  Other leftist parties did much worse, but still better than  almost all democratic parties.  Most leftist party leaders ran  for election in the east or south and won, CPU First Secretary  Petro Symonenko in Donetsk, SelPU Chairman Serhiy Dovhan in  Kherson, and Labor Party Chairman Nikolay Azarov in Donetsk,  while SPU Chairman Oleksandr Moroz won in Kiev Oblast and leftist  Civil Congress Chairman Valeriy Meshcheryakov dropped out of his  race in Kharkiv after running poorly (see appendix at the end of  the article).   Nationalist Democrats      Rukh lost its chance to sweep most of Kiev city's seats because  of invalidated elections and also won relatively few seats in its  base in the west.  In the 27 March election, Rukh had run  strongest in Kiev city, where it backed the two first-round  winners, and it seemed likely to win most of Kiev city's  remaining 21 seats in the runoffs.  But only 3 seats were settled  (won by Rukh) in the runoffs, so Rukh's total includes only 5  from Kiev.  Moreover, the failure to settle most Kiev city races  is a big blow to Rukh because all candidates who failed to win in  the March election and April runoffs are barred from competing in  the new elections, and hence Rukh may lose the candidates it was  counting on in the city.  In addition, Rukh won only 19 of the  seven western oblasts' 82 seats, judging from Post-Postup's  district figures and Rukh's claims in the 14 April Rada.  Even  the 30 members claimed by Rukh in the 14 April Rada are far less  than the 49 members it had in the present Supreme Soviet when it  registered as a faction in late 1992 (Narodna Hazeta, No. 38,  October 1992).     Other nationalist democratic parties did even worse, with only a  handful of deputies for even the well-established URP and DemPU.  The URP was humiliated not only by its tiny showing (9 seats,  according to Election-94) but by the defeat of its chairman,  Mykhaylo Horyn, in its Lviv base.  DemPU won only 4 seats,  according to Election-94, although its chairman, Volodymyr  Yavorivskyy, won in a runoff in Kirovohrad (Post-Postup, 11  April).  The Christian Democratic Party of Ukraine won only 2,  according to Election-94, and its chairman, Vitaliy Zhuravskyy,  lost in a runoff in Zhytomyr (Post-Postup, 4, 11 April).     Other Democratic Parties     The non-nationalist democratic parties, expected to run strong in  the east where nationalists have little appeal, also failed  badly, losing to the CPU and other leftist parties:     -- The much-heralded Interregional Bloc for Reforms (MBR), formed  by former Premier Leonid Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet Deputy  Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov and expected to emerge as a major  centrist force, ran poorly even in its Kharkiv-Dnipropetrovsk  base.  Election-94 credited it with just 6 seats, although Post-  Postup identified 15 (6 MBR winners in Kharkiv, 3 in  Dnipropetrovsk, 3 in Mykolaiv, and 1 in Chernihiv, Kherson, and  Krym).  Kuchma won a smashing victory, with 90 percent of the  vote in his Chernihiv district (Post-Postup, 28 March), but  Hrynyov was forced into a runoff before winning a seat in his  native Kharkiv.   -- New Ukraine barely showed up in the election results.  It  apparently only elected 1 deputy--in Chernivtsi (Post-Postup, 11  April)--and hardly any candidates identifying with it even got  into the runoffs.     -- The Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine (PDVU) won only 3,  according to Election-94, and its leader Volodymyr Filenko lost  in a Kharkiv runoff (Post-Postup, 11 April).     -- The Labor Congress of Ukraine (TKU) won no seats, and its  leader Anatoliy Matviyenko was beaten running for reelection in  Vinnytsya (Post-Postup, 4 April).     -- The Party of Greens of Ukraine (PZU) did not really attempt an  organized election campaign (the 31 Green candidates were  nominated by groups, rather than by the party) and its leader  Vitaliy Kononov lost his bid for a seat (Rada, 27 March).     -- The well-financed Liberal Party of Ukraine ran many candidates  in the east (for example, fielding 11 candidates in Donetsk  city's 10 districts--Vecherniy Donetsk, 19 February) but, judging  from Post-Postup district results, won only 1 (in Donetsk).  Its  chairman, Ihor Markulov, did not even run.     Other Nationalists     Ultranationalist parties won few seats.  The least radical of  them, the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN), won the most-  -6, according to Election-94, but at least 8, according to the  Post-Postup district results (5 in Lviv, 1 or 2 in Volyn, 1 in  Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk).  Its leader, Slava Stetsko, was  disqualified from running because of lack of Ukrainian  citizenship.  The Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA) won 2 in Lviv  and 1 in Ternopil (Post-Postup district results), but its leader  Yuriy Shukhevych was defeated in Lviv.  Ukrainian Conservative  Republican Party Chairman Stepan Khmara was elected in Lviv, and,  according to Election-94, one other member of his party was  elected.  The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) won no  seats and its chairman, Mykola Slyvka, was defeated in Lviv  (Post-Postup, 28 March).  The semi-fascist Social-National Party  of Ukraine also won no seats.     Regional Patterns     The sharply contrasting voting patterns in east and west will  undoubtedly exacerbate already existing regional tensions, as the  east appeared to vote against economic reform and for closer ties  to Russia while the west backed nationalists.   East     Leftists won overwhelmingly in the east, building up big leads in  the five oblasts of this populous region which hold 152 of the  450 Supreme Soviet districts.     -- Donetsk (43 of 47 seats filled).   Communists won a smashing  victory in Donetsk, and virtually all party-affiliated candidates  elected here were leftists.  The CPU won 22 seats (4 in the first  round and 18 in the second), the SPU 3, Labor 2, SelPU 1, and  Civil Congress 1, along with one backed jointly by the CPU, SPU,  and Labor (Post-Postup, 1-7 April; Post-Postup, 11 April).  In  addition, 1 Liberal and 12 independents were elected, but no  nationalist democrats.  In 4 districts elections were invalid or  neither runoff candidate won a majority.  Although not all runoff  candidates were identified, there is no sign that any nationalist  democrats even got into the runoffs.  Even among eastern non-  nationalist democrats (MBR, Liberals) only one candidate backed  by the Liberals was elected.     -- Luhansk (23 of 25 seats filled).  The CPU won 18, with the  other 5 going to independents.  Apparently only one democrat  (nominated by Rukh and the MBR) got into the runoffs, based on  district results in the 1-7 April weekly Post-Postup and 13 April  Post-Postup news bulletin.     -- Zaporizhzhya (16 of 18 seats filled).   Communists won a  plurality of 7 seats, one on the first round and 6 on the second.  One SelPU member was also elected.  Democrats managed to elect 3  candidates on the "We" bloc ticket, plus an independent  considered close to the democrats (Post-Postup, 30 March).  Four  other independents were elected.     -- Dnipropetrovsk (19 of 34 seats filled).   In contrast to  neighboring Donetsk and Zaporizhzhya, Communists did poorly in  Dnipropetrovsk.  Only 1 CPU member was elected, versus 3 MBR, 2  Labor, 1 SPU, 1 SelPU, and 11 independents.  The independents  included bank chairmen, plant leaders, sovkhoz directors,  academics, and local politicians.  Democrats--even nationalist  democrats--managed to put up a spirited fight.  The Ukraine  democratic bloc got 11 candidates into the runoffs and Rukh got  1, but they all lost.     -- Kharkiv.  Not all of Kharkiv's.28 districts have been reported  yet, and the results show a very mixed picture.  Post-Postup on  11 April reported 6 MBR members elected, and Post-Postup district  reports for 15 districts identified 5 independents elected, 4  CPU, 3 democrats, and 2 SPU (Post-Postup, 4 April).   South     The CPU also ran ahead in the south, winning 17 seats, while  nationalist democrats won only 1.  Surprisingly, the MBR did  relatively well, even though its regional base is the east,  rather than the south.     -- Odesa (19 of 23 seats filled).  The CPU picked up 6 seats and  SelPU 2 in Odesa, while no nationalist democrats won.  Most  winners were independents (10), while 1 Social-Democrat won  (Post-Postup, 13 April).     -- Krym (11 of 23 seats filled).  The Communists (Communist Party  of Krym--KPK) won 5, independents 5, and the MBR 1 seat.  In 3 of  these races, the losers were Crimean Tatars (Medzhlis candidates)  and in one, a pro-Ukrainian ("Krym With Ukraine") candidate  (Post-Postup, 11 April).     -- Kherson (10 of 11 seats filled).  Leftists won almost all  seats (5 CPU, 1 SPU, 1 SelPU), with 2 going to independents and 1  to the MBR (Post-Postup, 13 April).  Only 2 Rukh-democratic bloc  candidates got into the runoffs, according to Post-Postup  identifications.     -- Mykolaiv (8 of 11 seats filled).  In contrast to other  southern oblasts, Communists did poorly in Mykolaiv, winning only  one seat, while the MBR won 3, the democratic bloc (Party of  Greens) 1, and independents the other 3 (Post-Postup, 11 April).      West     The western region of Ukraine filled 68 of its 82 seats, giving  virtually all to democratic candidates but only 19 specifically  to Rukh, which was expected to do better in its home base.  Among  other nationalist democrats, the URP won 7, New Wave 4, DemPU 3,  and the Christian Democratic Party 1, while the non-nationalist  democrats elected one candidate on a joint New Ukraine-Social-  Democratic Party ticket.  Among ultranationalists, KUN won 7, UNA  3, and the UKRP 1, while independents won 19.    -- Lviv (20 of 23 seats filled).  Rukh won only 5 of the 23  seats, but in the 14 April Rada also claimed independent Yevhen  Zherebetskyy as a member after the election.  Although moderates  outpolled ultranationalists in the first round--Rukh won 4,  including Zherebetskiy, and New Wave 3--compared to one apiece  for KUN and UKRP, the ultras did better than the moderates in the  runoffs, KUN winning 4 and UNA 2, while Rukh won 2, New Wave one,  and the URP one.  The total of both rounds was 11 for the  moderates and 8 for the ultras, but KUN, which won most of the  ultranationalist seats, is the least extreme of the ultras.  The  URP--the best-established Lviv party after Rukh--was almost shut  out.  No leftists at all won.   bot               Lviv's First and Second Rounds                        1st   2nd   total           Independents  0     1      1                       Moderates            Rukh         4     2      6            New Wave     3     1      4            URP          0     1      1                    Ultranationalists            KUN          1     4      5            UKRP         1     0      1            UNA          0     2      2  eot     -- Rine (8 of 10 seats filled).  Proportionally, Rukh ran best in  this district, winning exactly one half of the total seats.  URP  got 2 and an independent won 1.  Judging by Post-Postup  characterizations, 6 leftists got into the runoffs (including 2  CPU and 1 SPU) but all lost.     -- Ternopil (7 of 10 seats filled).  The URP did better in  Ternopil than in Lviv, winning 3, as did Rukh (Post-Postup, 1-7  April, Post-Postup, 11 April, Rada, 14 April).  Ultranationalists  won 2 (1 KUN, 1 UNA).     -- Ivano-Frankivsk (all 12 seats filled).  Rukh did not do well  in Ivano-Frankivsk, but neither did other parties.  As a 7 April  Post-Postup analysis argued, parties have little influence in  Ivano-Frankivsk.  Most victors were clearly democrats but not  linked to parties.  Only 2 DemPU, 1 Rukh, 1 URP, and 1 KUN  candidate were elected.     -- Zakarpattya (7 of 10 seats filled).  Parties also appeared to  play little role here.  The only winner identified with a party  was a Christian Democrat.  Ethnic politics played a bigger role.  Several Hungarian candidates got into the runoffs, but the only  one to win was in district No. 169, which was formed to have a  Hungarian majority (Post-Postup, 17-24 March).     -- Chernivtsi (6 of 8 seats filled).  Here the seats were  scattered among democrats--2 Rukh, 1 DemPU, and 1 New Ukraine-  Social-Democratic Party--plus 2 independents.     -- Volyn (7 of 9 seats filled).  Rukh claimed 2 of Volyn's 9  seats (Rada, 14 April), while 1 seat went to a candidate backed  by both KUN and URP, and 4 to independents, with 2 remaining  vacant (Post-Postup, 11 April).   Kiev City      A remarkably low turnout in the capital city left 18 of the  city's 23 district seats unfilled and ruined Rukh's hopes for a  big victory.  Rukh-backed candidates won all the seats filled--2  in the first round and 3 in the second--and Rukh had candidates  in almost all runoffs--half of whom were ahead in the runoff vote  tallies and would have won (Khreshchatyk, 13 April) if the  turnout had been sufficient.  In 5 districts neither candidate  won a majority in the runoffs, while in the rest elections were  invalidated because of the low turnout (Post-Postup, 13 April).  This was a far worse turnout than in any other area of the  country--even Krym, where many were boycotting the election,  filled almost half its seats.     The invalidation of the elections in 18 districts means Rukh has  lost all its candidates who competed in those districts, since  Ukraine's election law bars candidates who lost in earlier rounds  from running in new elections to fill those seats.  For example,  Former Defense Minister Kostyantyn Morozov, touted as a  presidential candidate by nationalist democrats, was defeated in  district No. 1 when both he and his opponent won only 45 percent  of the vote (UNIAR, 13 April) and Morozov will be ineligible to  run again anywhere in the country.   Government Leaders      Even though Supreme Soviet members are barred from holding other  jobs, many cabinet members ran for election and most won,  although usually only in runoffs.  Acting Premier Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy, although supposedly popular in Donetsk, only won in  a runoff there, and Deputy Premiers Valentyn Landyk (ITAR-TASS,  11 April) and Mykola Zhulynskyy (ITAR-TASS, 11 April) won in  runoffs, but neither Deputy Premier Vasyl Yevtukhov nor his rival  won a majority in a Dnipropetrovsk runoff (Post-Postup, 11  April).  Transport Minister Orest Klympush and Health Minister  Yuriy Spizhenko won seats in the first round, Agriculture  Minister Yuriy Karasyk, Minister of Environmental Protection  Yuriy Kostenko, Economy Minister Roman Shpek, and Industry  Minister Oleksandr Holubchenko won in runoffs.  Labor Minister  Mykhaylo Kaskevych lost in a runoff in Chernihiv (Post-Postup, 11  April).     Apparently anticipating--correctly, it turns out--that they would  be unpopular with the voters, only 188 of the present Supreme  Soviet members ran for reelection, and only 56 were reelected  (Ivan Yemets, UNIAR, 12 April).  Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan  Plyushch won easily in Chernihiv with 74 percent of the vote  (Post-Postup, 28 March), and First Deputy Chairman Vasyl  Durdinets won in Kirovohrad.  But many prominent deputies lost,  including conservative-communists Aleksandr Charodeyev in  Donetsk, Serhiy Dorohuntsov in Kiev city, and Oleksandr Kotsyuba  in Vinnytsya, and nationalist democrats Mykhaylyo Horyn in Lviv,  Ihor Hryniv in Lviv, and Dmytro Pavlychko in Cherkassy.   Outlook      With nearly one-third (103-118) of the 338-339 seats filled,  leftist parties may easily be able to attract enough independents  to swing a majority (169-170), especially since the 169 or so  independents are in many cases linked to the establishment and  probably unsympathetic to reform.  In contrast, even if democrats  form a parliamentary bloc embracing all nationalist democrats,  non-nationalist democrats, and ultranationalists, they would have  only about 70 seats, using the Election-94 figures.  While the  current Supreme Soviet has long been deadlocked over reform,  prospects in the new parliament appear even more bleak.  The  largest faction--the leftists--will actively oppose reform, while  deputies from the east will oppose both reform and Ukrainian  nationalism, and both groups have been armed with a fresh mandate  from the voters.

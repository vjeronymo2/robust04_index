			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television It is dangerously easy to forget the excellence of much of the broadcasting in Britain. The trouble is that if, in an irritated fit of economic stringency, we once abandon the system that brings these programme riches, we shall not easily - if ever - retrieve it. Tonight's television schedules are pretty unimpressive, but BBC radio provides all sorts of goodies. Live from the Albert Hall on Radio 3 there are two BBC Proms. At 7.00 Robert Zeigler conducts the Matrix Ensemble in a programme of the sort of compositions which featured so interestingly in 'Second Heimat': 20th century German music. At 10.00, with pictures on BBC1, Anthony Rooley directs the Consort of Musicke in a selection from Monteverdi's 'Sixth Book Of Madrigals'. Radio 4 starts a new series of In Business with a look at the current turmoil in shopping: the old supermarket chains under attack from price cutters, high-tech innovation and home shopping. At 9.00 on Radio 2 Lucie Skeaping's Early Music, taking town and country life as its theme, includes a little number by Purcell robustly entitled 'A Pox On You For A Fop'.</p>

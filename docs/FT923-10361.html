			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / South Korea to boost investment overseas SOUTH Korea will introduce new rules on September 1 to encourage corporate investment abroad. The total of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2bn) in direct overseas investment made by South Korea amounts to only 1.2 per cent of GNP, against 13.2 per cent for Japan, although it has grown by an annual average of 40 per cent since 1985. The government believes that increased foreign investment will improve the acquisition of technology as well as reduce the vulnerability of Korean companies to protectionism. Korean companies will be permitted to raise overseas all the capital necessary to finance foreign investments, including mergers and acquisitions, instead of being required to obtain some funds domestically. This should reduce corporate financing costs, because interest rates in South Korea are higher than those in most of its main trade partners. The financial restrictions have hampered mergers and acquisitions abroad, which amounted to only Dollars 110m last year. The government will only review applications for foreign investments exceeding Dollars 10m, up from the current limit of Dollars 2m. Investment in countries with which South Korea has no diplomatic relations will be treated the same as other nations. This is to encourage activity in China and Vietnam.</p>

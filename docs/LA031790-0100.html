			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> IT'S FIRE VS. ICE: SOONERS MEET THE TAR HEELS  </P> <P> When Oklahoma and North Carolina play today in the second round of the Midwest  Regional, it will be more than merely another NCAA tournament game between  high-profile programs. It will be a clash of cultures.  </P> <P> Oklahoma fire vs. Carolina cool, the winner advancing to the Midwest semifinals  in Dallas to face either Arkansas or Dayton, who will meet in today's other  second-round game at the University of Texas' Erwin Center.  </P> <P> If Carolina's Dean Smith is college basketball's Mr. Control, Oklahoma's Billy  Tubbs is its loosest cannon.  </P> <P> Tubbs favors junior college players and four are in his starting lineup. In 29  years at Carolina, Smith has recruited only one JC player, Bob McAdoo.  </P> <P> "They can come at you with bigger, stronger, more highly publicized players,"  Tubbs said. "I mean, you've got to be a Parade All-American to be even  considered (by North Carolina). We're outnumbered in Parade All-Americans."  </P> <P> "They rely on JC All-Americans," Smith replied. "We rely on high school  All-Americans. I prefer college All-Americans."  </P> <P> This hasn't been a normal year for the Tar Heels, who staggered into the  tournament with 12 losses -- four in their last six games -- and are the  eighth-seeded team in the Midwest.  </P> <P> North Carolina entered the tournament shooting 49.7%, its worst percentage in  19 seasons. Point guard King Rice is shooting only 40% from the floor.  </P> <P> North Carolina has a big front line and used its bulk effectively in beating  Southwest Missouri State in the first round of the tournament. The Tar Heels  will have to use it again to neutralize Oklahoma's quickness.  </P> <P> Oklahoma and Carolina have met only once, early in the 1982-83 season at a  tournament in Hawaii. The Tar Heels won, 77-69, and, as Smith remembers it,  Tubbs was miffed afterward.  </P> <P> "After the game, he said something like, 'Who do they think they are?' " Smith  said. "I didn't understand."  </P> <P> The outburst probably was merely part of the OU-against-everybody routine that  Tubbs has perfected in his 10 years at the school.  </P> <P> Perhaps trying to pull his team out of the funk that caused it to struggle  against 16th-seeded Towson State in the first round, he used Friday's news  conference to berate the media for dwelling on recent incidents involving  Skeeter Henry, the senior guard who leads the Sooners in scoring.  </P> <P> Henry, who likes to put a charge in Oklahoma fans by firing imaginary six-guns,  drew a technical for spitting on a Kansas State player during the Sooners' Jan.  16 loss to the Wildcats, and he received another technical during the Towson  State game.  </P> <P> "Hammer me. Don't hammer my damn players," Tubbs said. "They're good people.  Skeeter Henry is a good person. Talk about his classroom turnaround. Go to the  gutter or the ghettos if you want to write that other trash."  </P></p>

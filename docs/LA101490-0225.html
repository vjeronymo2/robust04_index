			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR MORTGAGE;  </P> <P> UPDATE ON REGULATORY ISSUES AND A SCAM;  </P> <P> FINANCING: HOME-EQUITY LOAN CAPS, REALTORS' LOAN SERVICE FEES RESOLVED. ALSO,  SOME GUIDELINES GIVEN TO AVOID LOAN-SERVICE FRAUD.  </P> <P> Over the past few months, we've written about a variety of issues that concern  you and your mortgage. Here's an update on two regulatory matters that we've  talked about before, and a follow-up on a real estate scam that's spreading  across the nation.  </P> <P> The first regulatory matter involves home-equity loans, those popular accounts  that let you tap the built-up appreciation in your house simply by using a  credit card or special checks.  </P> <P> Many financial institutions that make these loans have long been criticized by  some consumer groups, who say lenders don't do a good job when it comes to  explaining how the loans work.  </P> <P> The most recent flap involves "rate caps" and a lender's ability to cut off a  homeowner's credit line when the cap is reached.  </P> <P> For example, say you take out a typical adjustable-rate credit line with an  initial 10% rate.  </P> <P> The loan papers state that there's a five-point limit, or "cap," on how high  the rate can go -- meaning your loan rate can never rise above 15%, even if  inflation skyrockets in the future.  </P> <P> What the loan papers often don't tell you, however, is that the lender may have  the power to cut off your credit line if the 15% ceiling is ever reached.  </P> <P> "You might have paid hundreds or even thousands of dollars to set the line up,  but you wouldn't be able to borrow a nickel until rates went down again," said  Michelle Meier of Consumers Union, an advocacy group that says these "cut-off  clauses" are unfair.  </P> <P> The Federal Reserve Board, which governs the activities of banks, recently  issued a ruling concerning Consumers Union's complaints -- and the advocacy  group isn't happy.  </P> <P> The Fed's new ruling allows lenders to retain their ability to cut off cash  advances when the equity line's rate cap is reached.  </P> <P> However, beginning late next year, all lenders will have to state in their  equity-line documents that they have the option to cut off the homeowner's  credit line if the rate cap is reached.  </P> <P> Consumers Union is appealing a court ruling that essentially upholds the  Federal Reserve Board's decision.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Meier said, "The banks have won a battle at the expense of  consumers."  </P> <P> The second recent regulatory ruling that can affect your pocketbook concerns  fees that realtors earn when they use computerized loan systems, which can be  found in hundreds of real estate offices across the nation.  </P> <P> The systems have been touted as the "ultimate in one-stop real estate  shopping": After you have agreed to purchase a home, you simply go back to the  realtor's office, the agent turns on the computer and up pop a variety of loans  offered by one or more lenders who have put their loan information into the  computer's database.  </P> <P> Although these computerized "loan networks" can be convenient, they have drawn  fire from some bankers and mortgage brokers who don't have their loans on each  system's database.  </P> <P> These lenders say that consumers don't always understand that the loans offered  via computer represent a mere fraction of the loans that are currently  available: A borrower might be able to get a much better rate from a lender  whose loan isn't on the database.  </P> <P> In addition, many bankers complain that the fees that some realtors charge  borrowers to use the computerized systems jack up the cost of buying a home.  </P> <P> It took nearly six years of debate and study, but the U.S. Department of  Housing and Urban Development last month finally ruled that it's all right for  realtors to charge consumers for access to the systems.  </P> <P> The ruling "is a definite step in line with the way the industry is headed,"  said Norm Flynn, president of the National Assn. of Realtors.  </P> <P> "The real estate business, like everything else, is becoming more  technology-oriented. These systems can be a great service to today's home  buyers and save them a lot of time."  </P> <P> Although the ruling was praised by realtors who operate the systems, it wasn't  a total victory for sales agents -- nor a total loss for would-be borrowers.  </P> <P> Although realtors can continue collecting fees from borrowers, HUD said that  realty firms must tell the borrower that they'll be charged for the computer  service.  </P> <P> In addition, HUD hinted that it would cap the fees realtors can charge for  their loan services when it issues its final rules next year. A spokesman for  the agency said the fee would likely be limited to $200 or $300.  </P> <P> Ironically, a cap -- which government officials hope will protect consumers --  could wind up hurting borrowers in the long run. Some experts say lenders may  raise their rates in order to buy their way into the realtors' systems.  </P> <P> About two months ago, we reported that loan-servicing scams were spreading  across the country. But the problem seems to be getting worse, despite a  growing number of stories about the rip-off schemes and warnings from several  lending and consumer groups.  </P> <P> "It's a serious problem that's occurring around the country," said Warren  Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America.  </P> <P> The most recent cases have been reported in Virginia and North Carolina.  Previous reports found problems in California, Colorado and Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> The typical loan-servicing scam works like this:  </P> <P> You get an official-looking letter from a company that says it has recently  purchased your loan from the original lender, or that it is taking over the  duties of processing your monthly payments.  </P> <P> The letter says you should begin sending your payments to the new company  immediately. It might even be accompanied by a loan payment book.  </P> <P> If it is indeed a bogus company and you start sending it checks, you might be  out hundreds or even thousands of dollars before you realize that you have been  duped.  </P> <P> You'll also have to make up the back payments to your rightful lender and it  may put black marks on your credit record that will be hard to remove.  </P> <P> "It's a 'lose-lose' situation for the homeowner," Lasko sums up.  </P> <P> To reduce the chance that you'll fall victim to one of these scams, the MBA  suggests that you follow these guidelines if you get a notice that your loan is  being transferred:  </P> <P> * Make sure you get a letter from the original lender stating that the  loan-servicing duties are being assigned to another institution. You should  receive this "goodby letter" at least 15 days before the next payment is due.  </P> <P> * The letter should state the name of the new servicing company, its address  and the name and phone number of a contact person or department. It should also  specify where and when the next payment should be sent.  </P> <P> * The new servicer should send a "welcome letter" stating the same information.  If you get a welcome letter but no notice from the original lender that your  loan is being transferred, contact the original lender to verify it.  </P> <P> * Make sure that the original lender and the new loan-servicer have your  current address, and notify the new institution if your mailing address  changes. This helps to assure that you'll get any future correspondence in a  timely manner.  </P> <P> If you want to know more about loan transfers, you can order "When Your Loan is  Transferred to Another Lender -- a Consumers Guide" from the Mortgage Bankers  Assn. of America, Department 0021, Washington, D.C. 20073-0021.

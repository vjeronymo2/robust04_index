			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 2 (MENA)--Egypt is committed to its oil  production quota, amounting to 870,000 barrels per day, in spite  of the increase of Egyptian oil reserves, Oil Minister Dr. Hamdi  al-Banbi said today.    In statements made today, he said that this Egyptian policy  stems from its keenness on maintaining stability of world oil  market.    Dr. al-Banbi predicted that crude oil prices would be  markedly increased due to the increase of world consumption of  oil during the previous months.</p>

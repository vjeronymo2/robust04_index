			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Observer: Military tactics Star of the show at Nigeria's constitutional conference just opened in Abuja was former transport minister Umaru Dikko on his return from exile. The last time he made such a splash was a decade ago when the Nigerians attempted to smuggle him back from Britain after Nigeria's ruling generals had accused him of stealing public money. He had been kidnapped and was en route to his country of origin when British Customs uncovered the plot. 'I want to thank the government and people of Britain for everything they did for me,' Dikko said yesterday. Not surprising, really; they saved him from a crate worse than death.</p>

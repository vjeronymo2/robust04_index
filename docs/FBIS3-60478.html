However sad it may be, Georgia has compiled its own  statistics for this day: Sixteen persons infected with the  virus, 11 of whom are citizens of the republic.    This figure is, as yet, not high, a fact that was made  public  at the recent European regional convention of persons  coordinating the AIDS problem that was held under the aegis of  the World Health Organization in Berne, Switzerland. During the  work of the conference, doctors came to the conclusion that the  main obstacle to the spread of AIDS in our republic (and,  incidentally, this is characteristic of almost all the republics  of the former Soviet Union) was the highly effective work of the  epidemic surveillance service; it has not been possible to  achieve this in the United States or in other foreign countries  where the number of AIDS cases is huge. The compulsory  screening of persons infected with the virus and those who have  been in contact with them is viewed as a violation of human  rights in these countries and, consequently, in the struggle  against the disease, emphasis is given in the main to  large-scale anti-AIDS propaganda.    "In our country, the screening and control of those carrying  the virus are also not compulsory," said Tengiz Tsertsvadze,  senior doctor at the Republican AIDS and Immunodeficiency  Center, who represented Georgia at the conference in Berne.  "While their number is still not high, we manage to maintain  close contact with them and convince them of the expediency of  undergoing individual screening, though on a voluntary basis."    "In general, we consider the present practice abroad to be  too liberal and feel that it could do more harm than good. In  spite of the extremely unfavorable working conditions, we are,  at the moment, succeeding in preventing the occurrence of new  cases and in maintaining the epidemic at a comparatively low  level."    "Nevertheless, all this does not mean that we should be  complacent and do nothing more. The forecast given by experts  is very alarming: Unless radical measures are taken immediately  in the struggle against AIDS in Georgia, the number of cases  will reach 20,000 by 2000 and several hundred thousand by 2010."    "There are two principal factors that will contribute to the  spread of the disease in this country: Drug addiction, which is  already acquiring terrifying proportions, and the dire shortage  of disposable syringes and other medical instruments and the  means to sterilize them."    "Speaking of radical measures, I mean by this, first and  foremost, the creation of a material and technical base and  necessary conditions for normalizing the work of anti-AIDS  services, in particular our center, which is, at the moment, the  only one in Georgia that is concerned with this problem. It is  essential that we have here, in the center, all those  specialists who can take care of precisely those persons who  have the AIDS virus."    "If, in 1990, we were able to screen 400,000 persons, this  year, we have managed to screen only 105,000 on account of the  fact that there has been no money to purchase test kits. We  hardly have enough even for blood donors. Correspondingly, it  is probable that the figure for the number of persons infected  with the AIDS virus is inaccurate and there are more than those  who have been registered."    "We should copy the experience of the West regarding  large-scale anti-AIDS propaganda and public health education  among the population. Those powerful [publicity] campaigns,  which are conducted there in all the mass media and which are  supported by sponsors, charitable organizations, and public  figures, including those carrying the AIDS virus, are shaping  social awareness and thereby creating a big barrier to the  spread of the disease."    "We hope that our mass media will help us, particularly  television. Meanwhile, in this respect, the one thing that we  have been able to create ourselves in our center is a department  for preventive measures against AIDS that will be in contact  with the mass media."</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Unions seek to block loss of Swan Hunter projects NATIONAL OFFICIALS of shipbuilding unions will be asked this week to back a call for shipyard workers throughout the UK to refuse to work on three Type 23 frigates if they are moved from Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter. The motion was unanimously backed on Saturday at a Carlisle meeting of shop stewards from all UK shipyards except Southampton-based Vosper Thornycroft. Union leaders from Swan Hunter, which went into receivership 10 days ago after a helicopter carrier order went to rival consortium VSEL/Kvaerner, said the Vosper stewards had send a message supporting the motion. Swan Hunter union officials expect the motion, proposed by Mr Jim McFall, chairman of the shipyard negotiating committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, to be endorsed by the committee when it meets on Wednesday. Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne and Blyth CSEU chairman, said yesterday: 'If endorsed it will be adopted as official policy of their unions.' If the frigates are removed - a move Swans unions have pledged to prevent - workers wherever they were sent would be balloted after union lawyers had scrutinised the motion. Some Swan Hunter workers, demoralised by uncertainty and poor alternative job prospects, doubt they can count on solidarity from other yards. Mr George Cook, a boilermaker, said as he left Swans on Friday: 'If it's going to save their jobs, they'll work on them. It's a horrible situation, it's look after number one. That's Tory Britain now.' But Mr Brennan insisted: 'I'm sure the overwhelming majority won't touch that job with a bargepole.' Fitting out the frigates is vital to Swan's survival as a shipbuilder. It would provide work until late 1994, giving the company the chance to bid for other contracts and secure a buyer as a going concern. The Ministry of Defence has given no undertaking that work can continue on the frigates beyond this Friday.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Bond yields on the Tokyo market rose to a one-month high of 4.77 per cent last week on expectations of higher short-term money market rates. The Bank of Japan's neutral stance on the money markets at a time when the current reserve maintenance period ends this week and US interest rates are expected to rise, discouraged traders, prompting profit-taking. Market participants will continue to focus on the Bank of Japan's money market manoeuvrings this week. The central bank may try to limit a rise in the overnight call rate if the stock market remains sluggish ahead of the October 27 Japan Tobacco flotation. Financial officials have become increasingly concerned over the listing, and are expected to support stock market volumes. However, economic data due this week, including machinery orders for August, and the government's official assessment of the economy, due at the end of the week, are likely to confirm the ongoing recovery, and may create turmoil on the bond market. Bankers are also worried about a rise in short-term interest rates since the short-term prime rate, the lending rate to first-tier clients, is tied to three-month certificate of deposit rates, which firmed last week. Banks are reluctant to raise lending rates when demand for funds among companies is still weak.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (4): Businesslike but not a business - Will competition with the private sector lead to less public funding? The Women's Royal Voluntary Service this week became the first voluntary organisation to win the prestigious national category of the National Training Awards. Announcing its success, the charity said that it had 'beaten off stiff competition from the commercial sector' to gain the award. Competition from the commercial sector was also part of the stimulus for the WRVS's investment in training - voluntary organisations and private companies are both seeking to take over welfare services under contract to public authorities, and this is forcing charities to examine the quality and efficiency of their services. The WRVS is Britain's largest voluntary organisation. With 140,000 volunteers - one in 200 of the adult population - it is bigger than the Army. Its volunteers, who, in spite of the charity's name, include men, are familiar figures running hospital shops, delivering meals on wheels and assisting at emergencies. The financial environment in which such voluntary activity takes place, however, has changed dramatically during the 1990s. Managers of National Health Service trust hospitals, under pressure to generate extra money from non-medical activities, today view hospital shops as potential sources of income. In some big hospitals, this has led to commercial retailers or facilities management companies taking over shop activities that were once left to volunteers. Last year's community care reforms, designed to shift funding from residential care to support in people's own homes, are turning meals on wheels and home help services into more businesslike activities which, in some areas, are attracting the interest of the private sector. In the face of this more competitive market, the WRVS is restructuring and modernising under Mr Gerry Burton, a chartered accountant brought in as the charity's first full-time chief executive. He inherited an organisation which, among a series of other activities, runs 1,100 shops in 800 hospitals and delivers 15m meals on wheels a year. 'Our hospital shops turn over Pounds 21m, and we donate Pounds 3m a year back to the hospitals,' he says. 'But in the current climate of income generation, hospital managers are asking if a better return on shops is possible, so we are responding positively by improving shop design and product mix.' It is a similar story with meals on wheels. Some local authorities have entered into contracts with frozen food companies to deliver meals on a weekly, rather than daily, basis. Mr Burton has reacted by moving the WRVS and its bulk-buying power into the frozen food market - it won the National Training Award for a food hygiene training course for 66,000 volunteers. But, the WRVS says, it can offer a more humane service than commercial competitors by arranging for its volunteers to maintain contact with housebound people between weekly food deliveries. Mr Burton says he is not afraid of commercial competition. 'We do not have the big wage bills of commercial organisations, we are not taxed on profits and we do not need to pay dividends. So, provided we are well organised, we should be able to withstand competition.' But the success of the voluntary sector in winning and keeping public contracts depends on a further, more imponderable, question - will volunteers continue to give time to charities that are in businesslike competition with the private sector to provide publicly financed services? Mr Burton believes they will. 'Being efficient is not the same as being commercial. Our volunteers are concerned to ensure that they are able to offer the proper quality of caring service that people require. We are improving our training facilities to make the work of volunteers increasingly valuable and satisfying.' Another important question is whether charities, with their tradition of voluntary effort, will be adequately rewarded under public sector contracts. Warnings from a number of local authorities last month, that their community care budgets had run low only two-thirds of the way through the financial year, have revived charity managers' concerns in this area. A survey by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations last month showed that charities received Pounds 672m in local authority grants and fees in 1993-94, an increase of Pounds 84m on the previous year. The growth reflects the effects of increased contracting with the voluntary sector as a result of last year's community care reforms. The NCVO says, however, that, in spite of the additional Pounds 84m, charities are still subsidising community care services; and that the 1993-94 increase in spending on care services was accompanied by a Pounds 7m reduction in local authority funding for the voluntary sector in other sectors such as education. Charity managers are particularly worried by suggestions in the survey that some councils might expect them to subsidise community care services, although local authority leaders deny that there is any concerted policy of trying to do this. A total of 38 per cent of councils taking part said the willingness of voluntary organisations to subsidise contract prices with income from other sources, such as donations, would be a very important factor in encouraging them to use charities rather than private-sector providers; a further 42 per cent regarded it as fairly important.</p>

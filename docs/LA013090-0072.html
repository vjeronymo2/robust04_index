			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Boeing Co.: The Seattle-based aerospace firm's 1989 net income rose 58% over  the previous year to $973 million.  </P> <P> Revenue jumped 19.5% to $20.3 billion. The 1989 results include $298 million  attributable to an accounting change for income taxes. Fourth-quarter sales  remained essentially flat at $4.8 billion, but earnings tumbled 55% to $77  million. The company said the 48-day strike by the International Assn. of  Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers caused delivery delays, cutting  fourth-quarter sales by about $2 billion. The company also cited  higher-than-anticipated lump-sum wage payments and strike disruption costs.  </P></p>

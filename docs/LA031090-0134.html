			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. ORDERED TO PAY RETIREES FOR INSURANCE  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Friday ordered Orange County to pay what could amount to  $50 million to thousands of retired county workers who were forced to pay more  for their medical insurance after the county stopped contributing to the  coverage in 1979.  </P> <P> The decision caps a five-year legal battle between the county and the Orange  County Employees Assn., which argued that discontinuing medical insurance  contributions violated gov  </P> <P> ernment regulations.  </P> <P> County officials reached Friday declined to comment on the judgment, saying  they had not yet seen the ruling. A private attorney represented the county in  the case and he could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In his 15-page ruling, Judge Claude M. Owens agreed with the association and  ordered the Board of Supervisors to pay back the retirees and approve "a health  benefit plan or plans that comply with the provisions" of government codes.  </P> <P> Owens said the exact amount of the refund, the number of people affected by the  ruling and the method of paying the refunds must still be decided before any  money is received by retirees. The attorney for the employees association said  up to 46,000 retirees could be affected.  </P> <P> If the association and county cannot agree on a new benefit plan or on payment  of damages, the matter will go before the court again for another hearing.  </P> <P> Richard S. Rockwell, attorney for the employees association, hailed the ruling  as significant because other counties in the state have also discontinued  insurance payments on behalf of retirees.  </P> <P> Rockwell also said Orange County's decision to halt payments for retirees  forced some of them to go without insurance because they could not make the  payments. "There were people being cut loose," he said.  </P> <P> The case hinged on the interpretation of an obscure Government Code section  dealing with medical benefits.  </P> <P> Association attorneys argued that the statute required that counties offer the  same coverage to retirees as it does to current employees.  </P> <P> Owens agreed with the association, saying it is the board's duty "to approve  health benefits plans that have the same coverage for retirees that is  available to active county employees and at no increase in cost to retirees  over the cost to active employees."  </P> <P> Owens rejected arguments forwarded by the county's attorneys that portions of  the statute are "permissive" and that the meaning of certain key phrases in the  code are unclear.  </P> <P> For nearly 11 years, Orange County paid all or part of health insurance  premiums for retired county employees.  </P> <P> Then, in 1979, the Board of Supervisors voted to stop making payments, agreeing  with a staff recommendation that the payments were "not an effective  expenditure of benefit dollars," according to court records.  </P> <P> Officials at the time said county contributions, which amounted to between $22  and $44 per retiree, were "not a vested right but rather (are) subject to the  annual discretion" of the county.  </P> <P> They also noted that county employees "have a stronger and more beneficial  retirement program than most private sector retirees" even without the medical  insurance contributions.  </P> <P> County Counsel Adrian Kuyper said a private attorney handled the case because  of the possible conflict of interest that could arise with county employees  handling a case that deals with their own health benefits. He identified that  attorney as Santa Ana lawyer Ken Smart.  </P> <P> It was not known what action the county would take next or whether an appeal  was likely.  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, contacted at home, had not been informed of the  judge's decision, but he acknowledged that the ruling could be a blow to the  county.  </P> <P> "Of course, $50 million is one tremendous liability," Riley said.  </P> <P> Owens said in his ruling that estimates varied as to how much the county owed  retirees, noting that figures as low as $12 million and as high as $50 million  were used in the trial.  </P> <P> However, the judge rejected the county's contention that the expense involved  in paying the retirees should exempt the county from having to make a full  payment.  </P> <P> "Although this argument would evoke considerable sympathy in the hearts of many  taxpayers, the law bars such consideration as an excuse for non-compliance with  the law," Owens stated in his ruling.  </P></p>

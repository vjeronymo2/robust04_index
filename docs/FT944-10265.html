			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Observer: Buy one or stop me Strawberry ripple and tutti-frutti blocked traffic outside the mother of parliaments yesterday - 45 ice cream vendors protested against legislation allowing the confiscation of their vans for alleged illegal street trading. Ray Fionda - not a flavour but vice-chairman of the Association of Mobile Ice Cream Traders - believes his members are suffering from legislation more suited to drug traffickers. 'Confiscating a van which costs Pounds 45,000 is over the top,' he says. Sounds like a case for the Department of Transport's cones hotline.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Ropner improves 22% despite mixed showing Ropner yesterday announced a 22 per cent expansion in interim profits despite a mixed performance by its property investment, engineering and shipping activities. On turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 12m, the pre-tax line for the six months to June 30 rose to Pounds 1.99m, against Pounds 1.63m. Mr Jeremy Ropner, chairman, warned, however, that it would be 'unrealistic to expect the second half to show the same degree of improvement'. The property division performed well, he said, reflecting improved values at the start of the year. Two properties were sold for Pounds 3.03m, some Pounds 660,000 above book value. The shipping side, which currently manages seven bulk carriers, lifted profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 899,000. A dull spot was engineering, where demand had been irregular. 'We have suffered from significant fluctuations and have had to make some hard decisions,' Mr Ropner said. The interim dividend is held at 3.5p on capital increased following the enfranchisement of the A capital. Earnings per share were 5.2p (4.2p).</p>

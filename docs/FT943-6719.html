			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Broadcasters' political 'dependency' attacked Broadcasting organisations are becoming too dependent on the government and their ability to call politicians to account is being dangerously eroded, Mr Greg Dyke, former chief executive of London Weekend Television, said last night. The broadcasting legislation passed by the Thatcher government was still having its effect, he said. 'Although the threats to the political freedom of broadcasters today are less obvious, they are there and, more seriously, have been institutionalised.' Mr Dyke was giving the James MacTaggart memorial lecture, which traditionally opens the Edinburgh international television festival. Mr Dyke said he had two main concerns. The first was that in commercial broadcasting the delicate balance of being both a business and a broadcaster was in danger of being too dominated by business. Secondly, and more importantly, he feared the relationship between broadcasters and government was becoming a dependent one, 'with broadcasters constantly wanting favours and legislative action from government - a position which is largely of government's making, and as a result gives government far too much power in the relationship'. Mr Dyke said that partly because of the inadequacies of the 1990 Broadcasting Act and partly because of the business ambitions of some of the ITV companies, the larger ITV groups were always wanting something from government - such as changes in ownership rules or reductions in the amount they paid the government for their licences. 'This, I would suggest, is a potential threat to a politically free broadcasting system and potentially gives enormous power to the government of the day,' he said. Mr Dyke, who has made it clear that he is a Labour supporter, suggested that any future Labour government should immediately set up a government commission to look at broadcasting. He said possible reforms included new ways of appointing the chairman and governors of the BBC and the chairman and members of the Independent Television Commission and a guaranteed income for the BBC over the 10 years of its royal charter. He also suggested that, to avoid the growing tension between some sorts of journalism and the business interests of commercial broadcasters, two boards should be considered for broadcasting organisations, one business and one broadcasting.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Accountancy Column: Time to put more theory into practice - Sunjay Kakar argues that accountancy graduates are better equipped to act as decision-makers The credibility of chartered accountants to act as decision-makers and make professional judgments is being called into question because many have not been trained in the subject and lack a detailed knowledge of accountancy theory. Those who have studied accountancy as an academic subject argue that qualified accountants from other disciplines do not seem to understand the thought processes behind the current debates in the profession and are impeding progress. An accountant with a 'relevant' (accounting) degree cites the Current Cost Accounting debate during the 1980s. 'In my experience the contribution of accountancy graduates to this debate was potentially much greater than that of non-relevant graduates because they had studied accountancy as an academic discipline in its own right,' he says. 'Accountancy graduates could understand the theoretical process behind the debate because, for example, they had studied capital maintenance as a concept instead of how it was treated in the accounts.' Academics are in a position to inform the debates taking place in the profession on a wide range of ideas including finance, corporate governance, auditing, accounting standards and management accounting. Professor David Hatherly of the department of accounting at the University of Edinburgh, says: 'There remains a problem for improving standards if the professional membership, at least in England and Wales, has been under-exposed to academic ideas, research results and debate on issues and choices. 'The current cost debate is one possible example of how the debate did not move forward, in part at least due to a lack of understanding of income theory on the part of practitioners.' Do chartered accountants in England and Wales develop their understanding of the conceptual framework while studying for the professional exams? Jon Boyle, a consultant at Robert Walters Associates, the financial recruitment firm, who trained with Arthur Andersen after studying a non-relevant degree, thinks not. 'You do not need to study accountancy theory to pass the chartered accountancy professional exams,' he says. 'Whilst studying I was never once asked for an academic approach. There was a genuine thrust towards making the accountancy studies more practical and, in order to pass the exams under time constraints, students do not have any time to talk about accountancy theory.' The size of the potential problem can be seen from the student entry statistics from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The proportion of accountancy - or 'relevant' - graduates in the annual in-take has remained stable at only 19 or 20 per cent for the last seven years. That contrasts with the position elsewhere. At the Scottish Institute, Professor Ian Marrian, deputy secretary and director of education, says that 80 per cent of its students are accountancy graduates. Professor Niall Lothian, junior vice-president of the institute, says there is a greater feeling within the business community in Scotland that chartered accountants should be accountancy graduates because it gives them a far greater conceptual understanding when thinking through difficult issues. 'The fact that we are faced with a heavily regulated profession has been largely brought about by accountants' failure to understand the conceptual framework of their own discipline,' he says. 'Students need to have a basic minimum understanding of the conceptual framework, but I question where this understanding is coming from if it is not taught as part of a university degree course in accountancy.' Daniella Acker, a lecturer in accounting at the University of Bristol, suggests that chartered accountants who are non-relevant graduates tend to have a narrow understanding of accountancy theory. 'Accountants who are non-relevant graduates have a basic understanding of accounting concepts, but perhaps not the wider and deeper conceptual issues involved,' she says. The lack of understanding of accountancy theory in England and Wales raises a question mark over the professional judgment of many chartered accountants. Professor Lothian says that accountants who do not have a degree in accountancy are 'driven to look up the cookbook of instructions rather than think through the issues.' Professor Hatherly says that the need for accountants and auditors to stand back and judge whether financial statements give a true and fair view is becoming ever more important and ever more difficult. 'This is a judgment which requires a theoretical perspective because it requires knowledge and experience of business and accounting rules, but above all as an understanding of how financial statements get over the important aspects of financial position and performance,' he says. He stresses the need for a profession 'sure of its own thought process and not seeking refuge in rules.' Mr Boyle says that whenever a complex situation arises, accountants and auditors attempt to apply the rules as they currently stand. 'But this does not mean that they research the theory behind the rules,' he says. Many chartered accountants point out that they do not need to understand accountancy theory. They argue that they usually refer to a firm's technical department which is best placed to understand the theory because it deals with complex technical issues. But Professor Lothian says that this is 'a betrayal of the concept of the profession'. He asks: 'Would a patient consult a doctor who had to ask a technical partner to make a diagnosis?'. Not everyone is convinced. Emile Woolf, technical partner at Kingston Smith, says that accountants in practice do not need to be excessively concerned with theory. 'Practitioners are not aware of any commercial disadvantage in an ignorance of the theoretical framework underlying routine accounting and auditing work,' he says. 'Most can get on perfectly well and cost-effectively, without continuously referring back to accountancy theory.' Ken Wild, technical partner at Touche Ross, says: 'There are many chartered accountants with a relevant degree who often spend too much time concerned with technicalities. They should stand back and ask themselves whether they are actually communicating.' Allan Cook, technical director of the Accounting Standards Board, takes a different view. He points out that in the past a lack of knowledge of accountancy theory did not harm anyone. But now, with the increasing complexities of the financial and commercial environment, it is important that there should be general agreement on the basic ideas underlying accounting standards. 'Developing markets have brought about financial engineering techniques which were not available before,' he says. 'To challenge these we need a clear understanding of the principles on which our accounting rules are founded.' Accountancy theory might be likened to driving a car. The purpose of the theory is to build a better engine to drive the car more effectively. Sometimes accountants spend too much time looking under the bonnet without actually driving anywhere.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Intrum expands to Pounds 7.5m INTRUM Justitia, the debt collector, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 6.81m to Pounds 7.47m in the six months to June 30, flattered by the previous period's heavier interest payments and other charges. Turnover rose to Pounds 41.7m (Pounds 41.6m) with the release of a provision a year ago disguising an increase on continuing operations and acquisitions from Pounds 40.3m to Pounds 41.7m. Operating profits fell to Pounds 7.82m (Pounds 8.07m). The company said that allowing for exceptional items and a change in the treatment of goodwill, pre-tax profit rose 16.7 per cent, operating profit was up 10 per cent and turnover grew 3.5 per cent. Mr Bo Goranson, chief executive of the Netherlands-based but London-listed company, said: 'We have produced a nice profit but we are in our own recession. When normal companies go into recession they decrease their business and the outcome at the end is that we get fewer debt collections.' He added: 'But we see a light in the tunnel. We have already signs in the UK that there is a recovery particularly for us, the increase in consumer borrowing, the car industry picking up.' The board declared an increased gross interim dividend of 1.1p (1p) out of earnings per share of 5.2p (4.6p restated).</p>

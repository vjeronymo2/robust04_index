			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Personal View: Why the EMS deserves an early burial The current turmoil in the currency markets and the broader crisis of rising unemployment in Europe is the most striking evidence yet that European monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements are profoundly counter-productive. By far the most important factor responsible for this debacle is the Bundesbank's policy of high interest rates, combined with certain features of the European Monetary System which have forced other member countries to follow suit: these include the mobility of capital across member countries and the fact that central banks have interpreted the rules of the exchange rate mechanism to require not only the maintenance of fixed exchange rates but also the avoidance of parity adjustments. The result of high interest rates across Europe has been that unemployment has risen to record levels. Governments have done little but seek a variety of excuses for the loss of jobs. It looks as if the 1930s are being re-enacted. Then, it was felt to be imperative to hang on to gold at any price: today the feeling is to hang on to the D-Mark. It is not useful to spend too much time allocating blame - on a Bundesbank that fights inflation of 'only' 4 per cent, on EMS member countries such as France, which opts for a hard currency at the price of an entirely unwarranted recession, or on a country like Spain, which believes that being in Europe means being a member of the ERM. In our view, the essential issue is for the EMS countries to shift priorities, putting unemployment at the top of the list and recognising that much labour can be reabsorbed through reflationary policies, beginning with a sharp cut in interest rates. Of course, countries would have to accept the depressing implications that such a move would have on their exchange rate with the D-Mark, without committing their reserves in an attempt to support the current parity. This means they must be prepared to see their exchange rates fall below their lower limits, and hence face ejection from the ERM. Ideally it might be hoped that France would take the initiative by slashing interest rates and letting the franc float. Other European countries, including Belgium and Spain, would follow. At this point two possible scenarios are conceivable: the first is that, faced with the prospect of a sharp loss in competitiveness, Germany would limit the damage by cutting interest rates. Within just a few weeks the long-awaited cut in European interest rates would have materialised. Second, the Bundesbank would refuse to cut rates beyond another token amount, and then Germany would be left alone in the ERM (thereby floating too). This would mean the end of the EMS as presently constituted. But this should not be a cause for regret. To be sure, there was a time when the ERM, with fixed parities and Bundesbank leadership, performed a very useful function. But in their quest for moderate inflation, countries adopted an unwavering D-Mark peg, which is now becoming a problem. There is no reason to equate yielding on existing ERM parities with sacrificing the entire anti-inflationary effort of the 1980s. France has no inflation problem - unlike Germany. France can, therefore, afford to do without the recession which the Bundesbank feels it must impose on Germany. Spain has a phenomenal unemployment problem which should be the immediate focus of attention, not a currency peg that is killing growth and prosperity. Some might bemoan the ensuing incapacitation of the EMS as a rude shock to the dream of European unity. But such a concern is unwarranted. First, the central element of the European Community is the set of common market institutions, and these should and would remain in place even if the EMS were temporarily impaired. Second, the existing European monetary system is already in tatters. Thus, leaving the present system would only acknowledge a truth that many in Europe refuse to face. Forsaking the present arrangements is the only way to move quickly towards a new European monetary system in which a crisis such as the current one cannot be repeated.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "More Firms To List Stock Abroad"] </F>   [Text] More domestic enterprises are expected to be listed  on overseas securities exchanges this year in a move to draw  more foreign capitals into China.    Most will appear on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, said Zhu  Li, a spokesman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission  (CSRC).    The others will be listed on US securities exchanges or in  other countries.    These large State-owned enterprises will mainly come from  the  field of energy, transportation and telecommunications.    Some of them need capitals to conduct technical renovation,  he said, To attract overseas investors, they must be profitable  and have promising development potentiality.    Zhu said new overseas-listed firms this year would not issue  A shares in the domestic securities market.    This is not expected to result in too much pressure on the  domestic market, which has been complaining about the  over-expansion of listed firms.    China last year chose nine companies to be listed on the  Hong  Kong exchange.    To date, six companies are actually listed on the Hong Kong  exchange. They are Shanghai Petrochemical, Qingdao Brewery,  Guangzhou Shipyard, Beiren Printing Machinery, Kunming Machine  Tool, and Maanshan Iron and Steel.    Another three are expected to be listed on the overseas  market during the first half of this year. They are Dongfang  Electric Company, Tianjin Bohai Chemical, and Jiangsu Yizheng  Chemicals.    The overseas listing of domestic firms is an effective way  to  raise foreign capital, it helps Chinese firms transform their  operations into real shareholding firms .    Before they enter the international market, domestic firms  have to change their accounting system to meet international  standards.    And they usually get help from foreign banks, securities  firms, law firms and accounting firms.    To ensure smooth sailing of the new overseas listings, CSRC  and Hong Kong Stock Exchange will jointly sponsor a seminar in  Wuhan, Hubei Province, on Wednesday.    Some related institutions will introduce the procedures of  listing in Hong Kong. And the already-listed firms will explain  their experiences.    Earlier this month, CSRC Chairman Liu Hongru and the head of  he Hong Kong exchange went to he United States and Britain to  talk about the Hong Kong and mainland securities market.    In another development, CSRC yesterday published a circular  to standardize the annual financial reports of listed companies.</p>

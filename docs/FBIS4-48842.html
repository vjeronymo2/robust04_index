			<p>BFN     [Text] In Kigali, arms still dictate the law. However,  there is some relative hope now for securing an end to the  current nightmare. Finally, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF],  which has been marching down on Kigali, has accepted to resume  talks with its enemies. RPF spokesman Jean-Baptiste Gawumba  speaks on the issue.    [Begin recording] [Gawumba] We have always maintained that  we  agree to negotiate with the government Armed Forces in order to  stop the massacres. Right from the beginning our standpoint was  made known not only to the international community but also to  the government forces themselves. Some conditions were set to  ensure the success of the negotiations with the government  forces. So, this is not the first time that we are accepting to  negotiate with the government forces to get them to put an end  to the massacre of the people. However, we do not think we are  making this condition -- stopping the massacres -- a  prerequisite for negotiations .    [Unidentified correspondent] Zaire's President Mobutu has  recommended the demilitarization of Kigali, the Rwandan capital.    [Gawumba] Look, I believe we said we belong to a country  that  enjoys national sovereignty. We do not believe that the  proposal of demilitarized areas can be imposed. As far as we  are concerned, we cannot accept the proposed demilitarization of  either the airport or RPF-controlled areas. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Emily von Sydow/FINSKA NOTISBYRAN: "EU Subsidy </F> for Agriculture 3 Billion More Than Expected"]    [Text] Brussels -- In the debate on Finland's national  support package for agriculture almost 3 billion markkas from  the European Union's [EU] agricultural budget has "disappeared"  in the calculations. This money is to compensate farmers for  the fall in agricultural prices and means that the agricultural  subsidy for 1995 from the EU to Finland is 7 billion and not 4  billion markkas.    This means that the Finnish taxpayers' additional  contribution for 1995 to farmers will be 1 billion and not 4  billion markkas -- the figure that has been mentioned hitherto.  This has been confirmed by Finnish agricultural experts in  Brussels.    The package that resulted from the membership negotiations  contains a provision that for four years Finland will receive  738 million ECU's (a little over 4.7 billion markkas) from the  EU's so-called agrobudgetary package. It is this money that is  to compensate farmers for the fall in prices (a 50-percent fall  in prices for agricultural products from the first day of  membership).    The other candidate countries with a high level of  agricultural subsidies also received similar compensation.  Sweden also received money under this same heading, despite the  fact that it has already adjusted its prices to the EU level.  This is a scarcely disguised budget rebate.    The calculation of the national support package is very  complicated and Prime Minister Esko Aho, who yesterday visited  Brussels, had his work cut out to explain the need for the  package to EU Commission President Jacques Delors and Belgian  Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene.    "We met with the reaction we expected. The Commission will  have to undertake a swift investigation of the package, so that  we can have its conclusions in good time before the referendum.  On this we are agreed," Aho said after his meeting with Delors,  not going into any details about what Delors' reaction actually  was.    Aho said at least that he had not encountered any  "insurmountable" difficulties for Finland's national  agricultural support package.    "There is bound to be pretty thorough discussion of some  points, but the fundamental outlines of the support package will  probably remain unchanged," Aho said.    He refused to say what details in the package the Commission  is expected to take an especially careful look at.    The Commission will scrutinize the national support package  to see whether it conflicts with the EU's rules. The most  important thing from the Commission's viewpoint is whether the  subsidies for farmers and the food industry can be considered to  distort competition. This would anger farmers in the other  member nations.    One of Aho's main arguments for the national subsidy package  is that Finland's farmers receive less support than EU farmers  in Central Europe, since the most important part of the EU's  agricultural subsidy is related to production. The greater  production, the bigger the contribution from the EU, and this  would leave Finland's relatively low-production farmers with  smaller contributions.    The Commission has been critical that Finland has made  available so little information about the package in the period  in which it had been prepared.    "We could not negotiate with the EU before the decisions on  the package were made at home, and in my view we have given the  EU good advance information," Aho said before the meeting.    Aho fears that the strongly critical discussion at home in  Finland could threaten the package's acceptance by the EU, and  said that he thinks that the whole discussion has been derailed.    On the subject of next week's confidence vote, Aho said that  it will decide whether Finnish EU membership has any future.  Without the national subsidy package there is no chance, he  said.    "The Eduskunta decided two years ago that Finland should  apply for EU membership on the present base. If the Eduskunta  does not consider that it is defensible, I do not think that  there is any other point of departure from which Finland could  become a member of the EU," Aho said.    Asked whether he considers it important that Pertti  Salolainen should remain in the government, Aho replied "yes."    The delicate subject of Delors' successor was also debated  over lunch with the Belgian prime minister. Dehaene himself is  the French-German favorite for Delors' successor.    "Dehaene and I have a number of divergent views, about  federalism in Europe (decisions at central level rather than in  individual countries), for example, but Dehaene seems to be a  pragmatic federalist and would probably not be a bad choice for  president of the Commission," Aho said.    The prime minister also said that he does not want to mix  together a possible election to the European Parliament and  Finland's Eduskunta elections in March next year.    "It is better that the Euroelections take place at the same  time as the local elections," Aho said.</p>

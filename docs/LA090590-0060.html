			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ POSTAL NUMBERS SET UP FOR DETAINEES  </P> <P> Iraq announced Tuesday three post office box numbers where relatives and  friends can send letters to detained foreigners.  </P> <P> State-run Baghdad Radio said the "foreign guests" can receive mail via the  "mail boxes of peace." The addresses are P.O. Box 39090, P.O. Box 50300 and  P.O. Box 50285, all in Baghdad, Iraq.  </P> <P> However, the U.S. Postal Service last week suspended service to Iraq and  Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, citing difficulties in transportation. A postal service  spokesman in Washington could not immediately say if or how letters sent to the  Iraqi post office boxes could be delivered.  </P></p>

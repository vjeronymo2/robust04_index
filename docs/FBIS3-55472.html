In the southern part  of the front, where the Azerbaijani troops managed to break  though the defense line, the situation has somewhat stabilized.  Positional fighting is taking place here. The situation at the  northwestern border of Nagorno-Karabakh and in Kelbadzhar Rayon  remains relatively calm.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> MEDIATED EASTERN AIR-UNION TALKS BREAK DOWN  </P> <P> Federally mediated talks between Eastern Airlines and its largest union  apparently broke off today, the company said.  </P> <P> "I confirm that at this point (negotiations halted)," Eastern spokesman Robin  Matell said. "Right now we are assessing what is happening.  </P> <P> "I don't want to give any positions at this point."  </P> <P> Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan wasn't immediately available  for comment today, nor were National Mediation Board Chairman Walter Wallace  and mediator Harry Bickford, who was joined by Wallace for talks beginning last  Friday at the Sheraton Hotel in Key Largo, Fla.  </P> <P> The Eastern-Machinists negotiations went into federal mediation nearly one year  ago after direct negotiations stalemated. Wallace joined Bickford in an effort  to get the talks moving, but sources speaking on condition of anonymity said  there had been virtually no progress during the lengthy weekend sessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cooling-Off Period  </P> <P> Eastern has been pressing for federal declaration of an impasse, which would  begin a 30-day cooling-off period. After the 30 days, the union could strike  and the company could impose its own work conditions.  </P> <P> Eastern said that only the pressure of a deadline, which the mediators have  refused to set, will get the negotiations moving. The union has claimed that  Eastern wants to provoke a strike so it can try to break it and bust the union.  </P> <P> Eastern put out a bulletin to its employees Sunday reporting that the  Machinists' lead negotiator had walked out. William Scheri, the national  Machinists' union airline chief negotiator, had participated for the first time  in the Eastern mediation last weekend, but left Key Largo on Sunday.  </P> <P> "Mr. Scheri's sudden departure after the Wallace announcement of 'no deadline'  for these talks reinforces our previously stated belief that the IAM will not  take the talks seriously until the NMB starts the 30-day cooling-off period,"  the company bulletin said.  </P> <P> However, the mediators said they had been informed earlier that Scheri planned  to participate only through the weekend before returning to Washington  headquarters of the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.  </P> <P> The two sides, who last met in intense mediation in July, have been about $200  million apart. The Machinists, representing 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers  and other ground service workers, or more than one-fourth of Eastern's  employees, were seeking $50 million for raises.  </P> <P> Eastern was asking $150 million in concessions, mostly from the non-mechanics.  </P></p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Protection sought for Japanese police THE Japanese government was last night attempting to head off pressure to withdraw police officers from peacekeeping duties in Cambodia after the killing of an officer in an ambush last week, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Mr Keijiro Murata, home affairs minister, will today call for the unarmed Japanese police officers to be given greater protection or be withdrawn to Phnom Penh. Mr Murata arrived in Phomn Phen yesterday for talks with the United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia over the safety of Japanese personnel. Untac has so far refused to accede to Japanese government demands to withdraw the police to safer areas, on the grounds that this would be preferential treatment. The issue is highly sensitive for the Japanese government because the despatch of peacekeepers to Cambodia was presented as a symbol of Japan's commitment to play a wider role in UN affairs. Japan has sent 600 military personnel and 75 police officers.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / King Milosevic rises from the ashes of Yugoslavia: Laura Silber finds ultra-nationalism on the increase THE re-election of Mr Slobodan Milosevic as president of Serbia, followed by the vote of no confidence against Mr Milan Panic, the prime minister, reaffirms Mr Milosevic as the most powerful politician in what remains of Yugoslavia. Mr Milosevic's grip on Serbian politics has tightened partly because his defiance of the West has increased his support. Top echelons of the Yugoslav army, which previously supported the Yugoslav federation under Mr Panic and President Dobrica Cosic, now support Mr Milosevic - seen as the single person most responsible for the war in Bosnia. At the same time, the Serbian political scene has become polarised between ultra-nationalists, on one side, and the weak democratic opposition, on the other. The extremist Serbian Radical Party, under Mr Vojislav Seselj, is expected to form a ruling coalition with the Socialists (the renamed Communists). DEPOS, the opposition coalition, won a few seats in Serbia's parliament. Mr Seselj, commander of a private militia and named by the US as a suspected war criminal, has indicated he is vying for a key ministerial position. It is unlikely Mr Milosevic will hand over the interior or information ministries, his two pillars of power. Mr Seselj, for his part, has called for the arrest of Mr Panic, a Belgrade-born California millionaire, for betraying Serbia. The victory of Serbian ultra-nationalists also marked the eclipse of hope for democratic reform among liberal Yugoslavs. Foreign election observers, who left before the count was finished a week later, said the vote was riddled with irregularities. Opposition leaders point to the discrepancy between the parliamentary and local election races, where opposition parties made a stronger showing. The opposition in Belgrade, a stronghold for the democratic movement, now talk about fleeing the republic. Shocked by the surge of ultra-nationalism, many speak of the danger of civil war in Serbia itself. This could involve the ethnic minorities, which comprise one third of Serbia's 9.8m population. But the ethnic minorities are divided. Pro-independence Albanians from the southern Serbian province of Kosovo, and most Moslems from Sandzak, which straddles Serbia and its ally Montenegro, boycotted the general elections. The re-election of Mr Milosevic appears to raise their chances of independence from Serbia, boosted by a letter last week from US President George Bush to Mr Milosevic in which he warned that the US would intervene if violence were to spread to Kosovo. The 300,000-strong ethnic Hungarian community in Vojvodina, the northern Serbian province, voted, but for ethnic Hungarian parties. Smaller ethnic groups in Serbia, such as Slovaks and Croats, now believe the election results will lead to ethnic cleansing in Serbia itself. The elections signalled the end of Mr Cosic - a well-known writer - as a political force in Serbia. His plea for compromise, was rejected by most voters. His future as president is unclear. If Mr Cosic stays as leader of the reconstituted but unrecognised Yugoslavia, his role as a negotiator in Geneva on the former Yugoslavia comes into question because he appears to lack the influence to assert his will over Serbian leaders. Mr Cosic, regarded as the spiritual father of all Serbs, had appealed for Mr Milosevic to step down. But in his address to the nation at the weekend, a self-confident Mr Milosevic appeared firmly in control. Remaining defiant of the West, he declared Serbia will never bow to the will of the international community.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Observer: Fed rumour mill fed The decision by the US central bank on when to begin tightening monetary policy will probably have a greater impact on the progress of the domestic economy than any single pronouncement from the White House. So it will be with some care that President Clinton goes about the search for a replacement for Federal Reserve governor Wayne Angell, whose term expires at the end of January. His departure opens up the way for the first Democratic nominee since the Carter years and the administration will be after a heavyweight economist capable of challenging articulate Republican appointees such as David Mullins and Lawrence Lindsey, not to mention chairman Alan Greenspan. One possibility is Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist currently serving as Laura Tyson's deputy at the Council of Economic Advisers. Ben Friedman, a Harvard professor and critic of Fed policies in the 1980s, is another academic reputedly in the running. But with white males filling the 12 regional presidencies and six of the seven governorships, the Fed is under fire from Congress for failing to promote women and minorities, so it is perhaps time for the president to exercise greater imagination. Alicia Munnell, assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury, is thought to be keen on the job, even if it carries less executive responsibility. A former research director of the Boston Fed, she knows the system well. Or Clinton could try Alice Rivlin, who is understood to be less than happy as Leon Panetta's deputy at the Office of Management and Budget. Rivlin's speciality is fiscal policy, but it is not hard to imagine her laying down the law on interest rates.</p>

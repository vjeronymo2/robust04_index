			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Waste recycling on the boards RUSSIAN wheat chaff and Georgian cotton stalks could form the basis of a thriving industry in the Soviet Union to turn waste agricultural matter into composite boards. Compak Systems of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, is to supply five process plants to the Soviet Union which can produce the panels from fibrous waste which are produced as a by-product of a variety of crops, including rice, wheat, oil rape seed or sugar cane. The waste material is chopped and mixed with a specially formulated resin binder, and the cocktail then formed and heated. The boards, which are between 4mm-20mm thick, can be used to replace particle board or plywood. Compak Systems: UK, 0482 28650.</p>

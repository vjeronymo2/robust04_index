			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / BNFL will set up decommission fund BNFL, the nuclear fuel reprocessing company, is to set up a special fund to cover decommissioning and other long-term liabilities. It has earmarked Pounds 1bn as an initial contribution. The company disclosed its decision yesterday as it published its submission to the government's nuclear review. It follows criticism from nuclear industry opponents who say BNFL and other companies are putting decommissioning plans at risk by investing funds meant for that purpose in other nuclear projects. BNFL said it had decided independently that the fund would ensure that the 'necessary financial resources will be available when liabilities become due many years into the future'. Provided ministers approve the company's plans, the government would hold the fund. A newly created BNFL subsidiary would have access to the fund and would take over responsibility for Pounds 10bn of current and future nuclear liabilities arising at its sites. It would have 30 staff. BNFL strongly opposes a proposal by the Atomic Energy Authority that one company manage all the nuclear industry's liabilities. Mr John Guinness, BNFL chairman, said this would create a large bureaucracy and his company preferred a competitive approach. In its review submission, BNFL says privatisation is an issue for government but it seeks 'avoidance of bureaucratic interference and double guessing of the company's commercial judgment'. The submission makes no judgment about pleas by Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear for privatisation. However, Mr Guinness said yesterday that his company supported their view that privatisation would provide a much better opportunity for building new power stations. BNFL wants nuclear power stations to be built. It says there are 'no credible alternatives to take nuclear power's place if global energy requirements, environmental targets, energy conservation and sustainable development policies are to be achieved'. The company calls for a 'level playing field across the energy industry which fully reflects environmental costs'. In a joint submission to the review, electricity unions said that UK dependency on gas for electricity generation could rise to 90 per cent by the year 2020 if no new power stations were built using other fuels. The unions call for the government to authorise the construction of Sizewell C, a planned 2,500MW nuclear station on the Suffolk coast, through a partnership between the private and public sectors. The unions oppose privatisation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report from the Public Relations  Office in Mae Hong Son Province, four Thai fishermen were  ambushed while illegally fishing in the Pai River inside Burmese  territory. Police authorities at Nam Phiang Din village rescued  the only survivor and his long-tail boat. The fisherman,  identified as Min, was seriously injured and later sent to  Sisangwan Hospital. Min told the police that he and three  colleagues of the Thai Yai ethnic group were ambushed by an  unknown group of armed men at about 2300 on the night of 16 June  while fishing in the Pai River inside Burma about 10 km from the  Thai border. Min was the only one aboard the long-tailed boat  when the ambush took place so he managed to flee the site back  to Thailand. He believes that his three colleagues were  probably shot dead. Any attempt to retrieve the bodies of the  three fishermen will be reported later.</p>

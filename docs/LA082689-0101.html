			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GROSSMAN READY TO START EARNING PAY;  </P> <P> BUT HOW MUCH HE'LL MAKE WORKING FOR CHARGERS IS DISPUTED  </P> <P> After a 34-day holdout, free-spirited rookie Burt Grossman was just happy to be  at the Friday press conference in which the Chargers announced they had signed  him.  </P> <P> He even joked about his contract, saying, "I've got to check my account and see  if it's as much as I made at Pitt. If it is, I'm happy."  </P> <P> "Just kidding," he added after a short pause.  </P> <P> But just who was kidding whom about how much money Grossman will get from the  Chargers was still unclear at the end of the day.  </P> <P> There was more than one discrepancy between the dollar numbers reported by the  Chargers to the NFL and the numbers being discussed by Grossman sources.  </P> <P> According to an agent for another 1989 No. 1 draft pick -- who said he obtained  his figures through the NFL Management Council, which gets its information  directly from the league -- Grossman's contract is worth $2.885 million over  five years, the fifth being an option year.  </P> <P> Grossman's agent, Cleveland attorney Robert Jackson, wouldn't speak on the  record about how much the Chargers will pay. But he disputed the agent's  Management Council numbers.  </P> <P> A source close to Grossman contended his contract was worth $3.01 million over  five years.  </P> <P> So, you ask, what's $125,000 among friends? Grossman, the Chargers' probable  starter at right end and the first defensive lineman picked in the draft, is  going to be a rich man either way.  </P> <P> True enough. But this summer, Grossman made a show of firing agent Richard  Woods and hiring Jackson. Jackson, a former attorney for the Securities and  Exchange Commission during the Kennedy Administration, had never represented a  first-round NFL player before Grossman.  </P> <P> When asked about the option year of Grossman's contract, Jackson said  Grossman's base salary would be 110% of the fourth year if there were no  renegotiation. But according to Plan B adopted by the owners, any option year  of a contract in which the player will earn more than $250,000 is only worth  100% of the previous year's base salary.  </P> <P> "Grossman got clobbered," said the other agent.  </P> <P> Gil Brandt, the Cowboys' former vice-president of personnel development,  assisted Jackson in the negotiations with the Chargers that lasted virtually  around the clock Wednesday and Thursday.  </P> <P> What is undisputed is Grossman's signing bonus ($950,000) and his base salaries  for 1989 ($250,000) and 1990 ($300,000). Grossman also will receive roster  bonuses (deferred one year) of $50,000 each of his first two years.  </P> <P> Depending upon whom you believe, he will make either $350,000 or $375,000 in  base salary in 1991 and either $400,000 or $450,000 in 1992. His roster bonuses  in 1991 and 1992 are $30,000. He will get $75,000 ($30,000 deferred) in bonuses  for 1993.  </P> <P> There were two triggers for Grossman's arrival. First were the recent signings  of Steeler running back Tim Worley and Phoenix linebacker Eric Hill. Worley,  Grossman and Hill were the seventh, eighth and 10th players selected in the  first round last spring. When Jackson and the Chargers found out what Worley  and Hill had received, it was easier to agree on what Grossman was worth.  </P> <P> Second, there was the performance of the Charger defense in three exhibition  games. Defensive coordinator Ron Lynn's unit has allowed just one long  touchdown drive during that period.  </P> <P> "That's why I had to sign quick," Grossman said. "I didn't have any holding  ground any more. My bargaining chips were starting to fall away."  </P> <P> Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations, praised  Jackson's negotiating style and issued a challenge to Grossman based on  Grossman's track record for public self-confidence.  </P> <P> "Burt Grossman is one player I believe fully understands that the easiest thing  he is going to do over the course of his career here is to put his name on the  line," Ortmayer said. "Now he's going to get tested for what's real. And that's  to prove that he can help make this football team win."  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning was extremely upset with the official who called Dan  Rosado for holding late in the fourth quarter of his team's 17-14 loss to the  defending world champion 49ers Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The penalty stopped a Charger drive in San Francisco territory and forced them  to attempt a 53-yard field goal that fell short.  </P> <P> The next day, Henning said he still wasn't happy with the call but would not  file a formal complaint with the league. The NFL asks for reports from its head  coaches on officiating crews after each game.  </P> <P> "I ceased filing reports, personally, about four years ago," Henning said.  </P> <P> He prefers, he said, to have an occasional conversation with Jack Reader, the  league's assistant supervisor of officials. One of Henning's assistants files  the weekly report.  </P> <P> "I don't do that (file reports) the way I did at one time because I don't see  much fruition there," Henning said.  </P> <P> Henning said he would prefer the league to change its approach on officiating.  Specifically, he said, he wishes officials would only call the penalties that  are obvious. It would help speed up the game and make for more consistency  between different officiating crews, he said.  </P> <P> "When there's a question, and it's close, I don't think they should ever throw  the flag," Henning said. "If you want to look, you can probably find some  misdoings on every play. I'd like to see those guys (the officials) be  somewhere between 95 and 100% (correct). If you only pull the flag when you're  sure, then you're going to have a high percentage. If I was to grade them on  the ones they don't see, there's not one in the league who will make 50%."  </P> <P> Henning said the holding call on Rosado that negated a first down run by Marion  Butts didn't show up on the Chargers' game films.  </P> <P> For years, Bear Coach Mike Ditka and his quarterback, Jim McMahon, differed on  what McMahon should do when McMahon's receivers were covered and the defense  flushed him out of the pocket.  </P> <P> McMahon preferred to run for as many yards as he could, and that was one reason  he was injured so often. Ditka preferred McMahon to slide in front of defenders  rather than take a direct hit.  </P> <P> In his one rush against the 49ers Wednesday, McMahon chose to slide. The next  day, Henning said he and McMahon hadn't discussed the subject yet.  </P> <P> When they do?  </P> <P> "I would prefer," Henning said, "for him to do things in this order: Complete  the pass; throw the ball on the margin of error side; if the pocket opens up  inside, escape inside; if the pocket opens up outside, escape outside, and  again complete the pass or throw it on the margin of error side or throw it  away.  </P> <P> "And if he decides to take it upfield, to be prudent. I mean if you need 25  yards and you're being headed at nine, being prudent would be to slide. If you  need nine yards, and you're being headed at eight, being prudent would not be  to slide."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations, said he had not  heard from running back Gary Anderson's agent Friday. On Thursday, Ortmayer  countered an Aug. 14 contract proposal from Peter Johnson, who represents  Anderson, one of two unsigned Charger free agents remaining. The other is  defensive lineman Joe Phillips. Ortmayer said there was nothing new to report  on him either. . . . The Charger receivers already have noticed the difference  between the "touch" passes of Jim McMahon and the tight spirals thrown by  rookie Billy Joe Tolliver. "McMahon and David Archer have a softer ball," said  rookie Dana Brinson. "Billy Joe's is, like, very hard."  </P> <P> </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL  </P> <P> Please wake him when Burt starts acting weird.

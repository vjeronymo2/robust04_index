			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- Radio Voice of America  Monday aired an article on the situation of the Korean peninsula.    The radio said that more than 40 years have passed since the  Korean war ceased in July 1953, but huge Armed Forces of the  belligerent parties are standing opposed to each other along the  Military Demarcation Line on the Korean peninsula, with no peace  agreement signed to completely end the state of war.    Noting that the international dispute over "full nuclear  inspection" is facing the most grave crisis in which such a  fabulous price as a second Korean war would have to be paid, the  radio asked: Can the North Korean Army "be defeated" in this war?    Recalling that the United States has deployed Patriot  missiles in South Korea and is reinforcing arms equipment of  latest types and keeping the U.S. troops present in South Korea  and the South Korean puppet army on the keen alert, the radio  said: But we must remember that the Korean peninsula is not  the Balkan peninsula and that, unlike Iraq, a vast desert area,  80 percent of it is covered with mountains, and the North Korean  Army the United States would deal with is a special army  different from other adversaries in the past.    The radio said one must not forget that President Kim  Il-song, the elder statesman who has dealt with the United  States and Japan for a long time, and supreme commander of the  Army Kim Chong-il lead the North Korean Armed Forces and people.    Noting that today the U.S. military is finding itself in the  toughest spot over this problem, the radio said nobody has  indicated a solution to it and days are going by in vexation.</p>

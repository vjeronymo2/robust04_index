			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Australian Government says it has seen no  evidence to support allegations of a second massacre by  Indonesian forces in the East Timor capital, Dili, in November  1991. The foreign minister, Gareth Evans, said there was no  evidence to justify anything like the claim made by the  Australian journalist, John Pilger.    Mr. Pilger's television documentary on East Timor, which is  to be screened in Europe this week, claims that in addition to  as many as 90 or more people killed by Indonesian security  forces at Dili's Santa Cruz Cemetery those captured at the scene  and wounded people taken to hospital were themselves  subsequently murdered.    Speaking on Australian commercial television, Senator Evans  said there was no evidence to support such an allegation. The  Australian foreign minister said he placed less value on the  report because of Mr. Pilger's record of distorted  sensationalism mixed with sentiment. Senator Evans said there  were still uncertainties about what happened and how many people  were missing and dead as a result of the Dili incident. But he  said there were a number of eye- witnesses at the hospital and  cemetery who denied Mr. Pilger's claims of a second massacre.</p>

I went to see it, and was very much impressed by all this classic  footage Bruce Ricker had put together with Count Basie and other musicians of  the Kansas City era.  </P> <P> "I contacted Bruce and asked if he'd be interested in my helping with the  distribution. I got Warner Bros. to release it in France and other places where  it had never been seen. Later on, Bruce came to me and said, 'We have this  astounding material on Thelonious Monk; would you like to see it?'  </P> <P> "I had never seen Monk in person, but of course I knew his records and had  followed him through those same years of which Bird was a part. I liked what I  saw so much that when it turned out Bruce and Charlotte Zwerin needed  financing, I went to Warren Lieberfarb, who's the head of Warner Home Video,  and told him I thought this was a worthy project."  </P> <P> Eastwood became executive producer of the project, and Warners came up with  $400,000 to purchase the footage and to pay for the music rights.  </P> <P> The result: a poignant new 90-minute film about the legendary pianist and  composer. Already a hit in New York, where it has been running for eight weeks,  "Straight No Chaser" opened Friday at the AMC Century City 14.  </P> <P> Thelonious Monk was a brilliant, eccentric and enigmatic figure who worked only  sporadically and whose best known tunes were all written in the 1940s (" 'Round  Midnight," "Well You Needn't," "Ruby My Dear," "Straight No Chaser"). In 1964,  he enjoyed his 15 minutes of fame with a portrait on the cover of Time  magazine.  </P> <P> The film, which inexplicably neglects to make use of the title tune, brings the  man and his music into sharp focus, from live performances to poignant comments  by his son and others about his frustrations, his international successes, and  his bouts of deep depression and hospitalization.  </P> <P> Since Monk's death Feb. 17, 1982 -- at the end of a decade of near-total  retirement and seclusion -- there has been a flood of recordings of his tunes  by other artists, along with countless reissues of his own albums. With such  honors as an international piano competition named for him and a conservatory  for jazz studies under his name now in the planning stages, Monk, like Charlie  Parker, is more fully recognized posthumously than he ever was in his lifetime.  </P> <P> "I began thinking about the Monk film when he was still alive," said Charlotte  Zwerin, who directed the film and co-produced it with Bruce Ricker. "I didn't  realize how ill he was in those last years. But then there was a lucky  accident. In 1981, Bruce Ricker bumped into Christian Blackwood, who mentioned  that he and his brother Michael had all this early footage on Monk. Bruce was  shocked. He called me, and we started trying to raise money for this project."  </P> <P> A music lover since childhood, Zwerin collaborated with Albert Maysles and  Susan Froemke on "Horowitz Plays Mozart" and recently on "Jessye Norman Sings  Carmen." She co-directed the acclaimed feature length documentary "Gimme  Shelter" which examined the Rolling Stones' 1969 concert at Altamont. A few  years ago, during a stint at NBC, Zwerin produced a 20-minute film called  "Woody Herman, Road Father."  </P> <P> "I had just finished making 'The Last of the Blue Devils,' about Kansas City  jazz," Ricker said, "when I found out that in 1967 and '68 the Blackwood  brothers had followed Monk around on the road for six months, in the studios,  at home and in various cities, for a German documentary. They shot 14 hours of  film and edited it down for a cinema verite special on West German television.  It was shown just once in Germany and had been lying around unused and  forgotten ever since. I worked out an agreement with Christian and Michael,  then brought Charlotte into the picture."  </P> <P> The search for funding was an arduous problem that began in 1983. The National  Endowment for the Arts came through with a $50,000 grant in 1985, but more  money was needed. There were unexpected difficulties, one of which was the  discovery that the Monk family had sold the rights to the name for a film  called "Music in Monk Time," in which Monk did not take part.  </P> <P> To the Blackwoods' documentary material was added a series of interviews with  Monk's longtime saxophonist Charlie Rouse; with his personal manager, Harry  Colomby, his road manager, Bob Jones, and with the Baroness Nica de  Koenigswarter, the wealthy patron in whose home in Weehawken, N.J. Monk spent  the last decade of his life (but wife Nellie Monk visited him there often and  was with him when he died).  </P> <P> "This is an instance of something done by people who had their heart and soul  in it, and when that happens, you know they're going to give it their best  shot," said Eastwood. "They did a fine job and it was fun for me to be  involved."  </P> <P> One of the very few faults in the movie is its failure to seek out from other  musicians who worked with Monk and knew him well, most notably Art Blakey, Milt  Jackson and Sonny Rollins.  </P> <P> Nellie Monk, anguished over the death in 1984 of her 30-year-old daughter, was  reluctant to be involved with making the film and did not want to be  interviewed; however, she trusted her son, Thelonious Monk Jr., to take care of  the family's interests in the movie.  </P> <P> The younger Monk, a 39-year-old drummer who worked with his father from 1970  until his final public appearance in 1976, wound up becoming a moving force  behind the picture. "Charlotte and Bruce did a bang-up job," he said. "I told  them a lot of things that I and my mom would like to see in it, and they put  everything in the proper perspective.  </P> <P> "This film will provide a great opportunity, particularly for people who never  saw Thelonious. He always inspired people; now he can continue to inspire them,  even though he's not here."  </P></p>

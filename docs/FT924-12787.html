			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / US banks 'face profit risk when rates rise' US banks may not be over their credit woes yet and could see current profitability disappear when interest rates rise, according to the acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the federal bank regulatory agency, Reuter reports from Boston. 'Given the problems in certain real estate markets, I don't think you are out of the woods yet,' Mr Stephen Steinbrink told bankers at the American Bankers' Association annual meeting at the weekend. He also warned that when interest rates rose, some banks could find themselves in trouble. 'We are all delighted to see increased bank earnings. I'm concerned about the source,' Mr Steinbrink said. A substantial source of earnings came from the decline in interest rates and widened spreads. 'If rates climb, you all may find it difficult to maintain current levels of profitability. Even worse, if you don't take precautions now, you could find yourself caught in an interest rate squeeze.' He added it was too soon to see how the banking reform bill passed in 1991 would affect banks, as many of the bill's provisions had not yet become effective. On December 19 the bill's rule to close banks whose capital falls below 2 per cent will become law.</p>

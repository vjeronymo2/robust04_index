			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ART COLLECTION WITHOUT A COUNTRY;  </P> <P> ART: TOURING EXHIBIT MAY HOLD THE ONLY KUWAIT MUSEUM TREASURES TO HAVE SURVIVED  THE INVASION.  </P> <P> Art experts in the United States and Europe fear that one of the world's most  renowned collections of Islamic art may have been destroyed or looted by Iraqi  forces occupying Kuwait.  </P> <P> Information about the fate of the Kuwait National Museum's 20,000-item Dar al  Athar al Islamiyyah collection is, like much of the news out of the ravaged  country, sketchy at best.  </P> <P> Officials at the Iraqi embassies in Washington and London say they have no  knowledge of the fate of the museum.  </P> <P> But officials of the Kuwait government and the curator of the collection say  the bulk of the artworks may not have survived the Aug. 2 Iraqi takeover. The  invasion, ironically, came just two weeks after a small fraction of the art  collection was shipped out of Kuwait for a European and American tour that  opened Aug. 6 at Leningrad's famed Hermitage.  </P> <P> "Everything valuable has been taken from the museum. Everything has been  looted," said an angry Ali al Sabah, the press representative at the Kuwait  Embassy in Washington,  </P> <P> Al Sabah said he learned of the collection's fate from unidentified witnesses  in Kuwait. Officials at the Kuwait Embassy in London could not confirm their  Washington colleague's report.  </P> <P> "We have read in the Arabic newspapers that his highness, the Emir of Kuwait,  sent a telegram about the destruction to an Islamic conference," said Ghada  Qaddumi, curator of the Dar al Athar al Islamiyyah. "The emir said that  everything was sacked and pillaged, even banks, schools, hospitals and the Dar  al Athar al Islamiyyah. It makes me very, very sad, of course. I don't want to  believe it."  </P> <P> Qaddumi, who studied at Harvard, was away from Kuwait on vacation when the  invasion hit. She was reached in Cyprus.  </P> <P> The Islamic art collection, which spans 13 centuries, was amassed by Sheik  Nasser Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah and his wife, Sheika Hussa, beginning 15 years  ago.  </P> <P> Although the collection is widely admired, some in the Islamic art field  believe that its fame has been, to some degree, bought. The sheik and sheika  have flown in scholars from around the world to see the collection in Kuwait  City and they sponsored several book-length publications written about it.  </P> <P> The new tour of 114 objects from the collection was being looked upon as a  chance for the Kuwaitis to prove that the Dar al Athar al Islamiyyah could  stand on its own merits.  </P> <P> The pieces now in Leningrad were selected by Esin Atil, a historian of Islamic  art at the Sackler and Freer galleries, which are part of the Smithsonian  Institution in Washington.  </P> <P> "Some of the items I would have liked to have included were just too fragile, I  thought, to go out on tour for a year and a half," said Atil. "There were  others that would have been wonderful to include, but I did not think it was  right to take all the best objects from the museum for that length of time."  </P> <P> The pieces on tour are now the only ones known to be safe. They are scheduled  to next go to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore in December for a two-month  stay and then move on to Ft Worth, Tex., Atlanta, St. Louis and Richmond, Va.  before going on to Europe. There are no plans for them to come to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In the wake of the invasion, however, there is some question as to whether the  exhibition will make it to the United States. After the invasion, President  Bush froze all Kuwaiti assets in this country, and tour officials want to be  sure the collection will not be seized by customs agents when it arrives.  </P> <P> Several sources said that at the time of the invasion, Sheika Hussa, who is the  daughter of a former emir, was visiting her children at their schools in  Europe. Sheik Nasser, who is the nephew of the current emir, was in Kuwait but  managed to escape to Saudi Arabia. They are reportedly staying at their London  home, awaiting the birth of their fourth child.  </P> <P> In a forward written to a book on the collection, Sheik Nasser said he first  became interested in Islamic art as a boy when he was sent to school in  Jerusalem. His Oxford-educated wife, however, was the driving force behind the  collection. As a couple, they bought their first piece -- a 14th-Century Mamluk  enamel-worked glass bottle -- in London in 1975.  </P> <P> The couple gathered objects from a wide variety of countries and regions,  including a rare type of Safari medallion carpet from 15th-Century Iran, an  8th-Century carved niche from Syria and the oldest astrolabe in existence. In  addition, they acquired impressive holdings of illuminated manuscripts, richly  colored-glass pieces, ornate metal boxes, paintings, geometrically patterned  ceramic tiles, jewelry and thousands of gold coins.  </P> <P> Sheik Nasser, who is a businessman involved with banking, real estate and  trading companies, also bought a 10% interest in Christie's art auction house.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s the couple hired Egyptian architect Hassan Fathi to design a  museum to house the collection. But government officials proposed instead a  building at the Kuwait National Museum complex. Designed in 1958 and completed  in 1981, the complex comprises four buildings and a planetarium overlooking the  gulf.  </P> <P> Sheik Nasser and Sheika Hussa agreed to make a permanent loan of their  collection to the museum, and she became its director. The museum formally  opened in 1983.  </P> <P> Although there is considerable concern about the collection in art circles,  there is some optimism about its fate. There is also some doubt that the Iraqis  would pillage such an important resource.  </P> <P> British art conservator Kirsty Norman was in Kuwait helping to oversee the  packing of the objects that went to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "The last time I saw the museum was on Aug. 31," said Norman from her home in  London, "when I drove past it. It didn't look as if it had been damaged or  disturbed in any way. Everything looked quiet.  </P> <P> Norman was originally scheduled to leave Kuwait on Aug. 2, the day of the  invasion. She did not get out until Sept. 8.  </P> <P> She said that she had been told by officials at the London office of Gulf  International, which oversees many of the sheik's businesses, that they, too,  were in the dark about the fate of the collection.  </P> <P> Repeated requests to interview Gulf International officials went unanswered.  </P> <P> "Reports of a museum being pillaged by an invading army are not at all  uncommon," said Thomas Lentz, curator of Islamic art at the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art. "The country being invaded might use these reports to help  gather sympathy for its cause.  </P> <P> "Sometimes the reports do turn out to be true, and sometimes not."  </P> <P> The majority of Islamic art scholars, while eager for news of the collection,  have taken a wait-and-see attitude. "I can do nothing but worry," said tour  curator Atil.  </P> <P> "It would be a tragedy if a collection like this, which was carefully chosen to  include all regions, all periods and all types and techniques, was gone," Atil  said. "There is no way to put a dollar amount on the collection, but that is  not the important part, anyway. The loss would have to be measured in terms of  culture and scholarship."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ARTWORKS IN A STATE OF UNCERTAINTY  </P> <P> A collection of treasured Islamic art may have been looted or destroyed in the  Iraqi takeover of Kuwait. But two weeks before the invasion, a handful of works  were shipped out of the country for a European and American tour. Officials at  the Iraqi embassies in Washington and London maintain that they have no  knowledge of the fate of the museum or specific works. The works below,  however, were in the Kuwait National Museum at the time of the invasion.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In a commentary today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH  discusses the regional tour U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher will make soon in order to activate and promote the  peace process since it has been stalled by Israel's intransigent  policy.    AL-THAWRAH says: No doubt, the success of Christopher's new  tour depends on the new things he carries. In other words, his  tour depends on effecting the required change in the Israeli  position on the peace process in a way that makes this position  fully serious and committed to promoting this process and  securing its objective in terms of a just and comprehensive  peace.    The paper notes that the peace process is now facing a  difficult impasse due to Israel's insistence on rejecting peace  according to the bases set for it in both the Madrid formula and  its international terms of reference, and also due to Israel's  attempt to replace the principle of a comprehensive solution  with separate deals and partial solutions that would enable  Israel to perpetuate its occupation of the Arab territories.    AL-THAWRAH also notes the four regional tours that  Christopher has made in one and a half years. None of these  tours achieved its objective in terms of promoting the peace  process and realizing the required breakthrough. The paper  adds: The failure of the U.S. efforts is entirely due to Israel  and its policy which rejects peace.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Thus, the pressing task for the  U.S. secretary during his next tour is to address Israel with  new language that is primarily based on tangible political and  material pressures in a way that will force Israel comply with  international legitimacy, respond to the U.S. efforts, and meet  the peace requirements without delay or hesitation.    In another commentary on the same topic, AL-THAWRAH says:  The success of the efforts by the head of U.S. diplomacy during  his new mission depends primarily on the ideas and proposals  that Secretary Christopher will carry and whether they promote  the peace process and rectify its course according to the bases  and terms of reference of the Madrid conference. Christopher's  mission also depends on the possibility of changing the Israeli  position, which is still far from the requirements and  conditions of a just peace.    AL-THAWRAH urges the U.S. Administration to compel Israel,  by  all means of pressure, to comply with the resolutions of  international legitimacy and acknowledge the Arab territories  and rights because this is only the road to peace.</p>

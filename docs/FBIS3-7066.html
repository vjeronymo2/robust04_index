"Japan will be remembered as an irresponsible country  in future (if it does not implement sanctions)," Saito told a  lecture meeing attended by more than 100 defense experts and  business people.    The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) decided March  21 to refer Pyongyang's refusal of full inspections of its  nuclear facilities to the UN Security Council. Saito said Japan  believes the Security Council will adopt a resolution next week  calling on Pyongyang to accept full inspections of its nuclear  facilities by the IAEA.    Japan will implement sanctions in line with the UN  resolution  within the framework of the war-renouncing Constitution, Saito  said, adding that it will amend legislation, if necessary.    "It is the only way for Japan to take. Otherwise, Japan will  not be able to dodge accusations that it is an irresponsible  country," Saito said.    He said Japan hopes North Korea will retract its refusal to  allow the IAEA to carry out full inspections.    He said China, a close ally of Pyongyang, wants the United  States, South Korea and other countries concerned to resolve the  issue through patient dialogue with North Korea. But Saito said  "Japan does not think it is good to spend a long time."</p>

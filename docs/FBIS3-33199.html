The text of the communique, to which AFP has gained access,  stressed that the delegates of the Zapatist National Liberation  Army (EZLN) will not go to "beg for charity or to pick up the  leftovers that fall from the full tables of the powerful" at the  meeting with the commissioner for peace, to be held on 21  February.    The Zapatists said their demands are good for all Mexicans,  "for us, the smallest in these lands, those without faces or  history, those armed only with truth and fire, those who come  from the night and the mountains."    The communique, issued on 16 February in the mountains of  the  southern Mexican state of Chiapas, advises that "if lies again  return to the mouths of the powerful, our voice of fire will  speak again (...) Right now the mouths of our rifles our quiet  so we may speak the truth for all."    Commissioner Manuel Camacho and mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz  reported today that the first meeting between the government and  the rebels will begin on 21 February at the cathedral in San  Cristobal, but they did not disclose the topics to be discussed  or the expected duration of the meeting.    The rebel message, signed by "Subcommander Marcos," stated  that "our delegates, disregarding the risk to their lives, will  go to the established place and will represent, with honor and  truthfulness, the thoughts and hearts of the men who walk with  the truth."    The rebels ended by saying that at the dialogue they will  seek "to find a fair and dignified political solution to the  current conflict, so "the many deaths are not in vain and so  truth will return to our land."    Subcommander Marcos stated that he does not know whether he  will attend the meeting with the commissioner but said that the  points stated in the communique are, "in general, the position  the EZLN will take at the dialogue."</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P raises rating of Chase Manhattan debt STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the credit information agency, yesterday raised its ratings on Chase Manhattan following the New York banking group's sale of Dollars 649m of new shares, writes Martin Dickson. S&amp;P raised the rating on Chase's senior debt from triple-B-plus to single-A-minus. Two other agencies, Fitch and Duff &amp; Phelps, also raised their ratings on the bank. Chase announced on Thursday that its offering of 22m shares, first announced in April, had been priced at Dollars 29.50 a share. That was substantially below the Dollars 750m the bank hoped to raise in April.</p>

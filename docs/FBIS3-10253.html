			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During a Parliament in the Workplace held at the  industrial area of the Efrain Alfonso Agroindustrial Complex  [CAI] in Ranchuelo Municipality, Villa Clara Province, the  workers came out in favor of stable and high grinding, a  decisive factor for economic efficiency. The event was chaired  by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers  Federation. It was reported that one of the factors affecting  efficiency is the high rate, 37 percent, of foreign matter in  the cane supplied by the Osvaldo Herrera facility. The cane  sometimes has rocks, chaff, and sprouts in it, which interfere  with a good grinding rate when the process has to be stopped to  eliminate them.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Analyzing the  economic  problems at our factory, as the comrades rightly said: This is a  serious one -- because, aside from stable grinding, in order for  a mill to be efficient and seek to economize, the other thing  that must be kept in mind is the quality of the raw material. We  cannot make sugar without quality raw material, cannot make it  of good quality, and that (?affects) efficiency.    This is the problem of the quality of the raw material that  has been confronted here in Cuba for years -- more so in some  years than in others. This year, at this mill, that has been  significant, because the truth is that the raw material has come  from that collection center in very poor condition in terms of  the amount of foreign materials.    It is true that the management here and the union and the  party have met many times. They have held municipal meetings,  provincial level meetings, and every possible meeting.    Now, (?what should we do)? If we want to repair the economy  and be economical and move ahead, after you discuss the same  problem twice with the same comrades, you need to take measures:  Hello, comrade, I am not going to discuss this with you today;  that amount of foreign matter must be reduced. I will come back  tomorrow to discuss it. Perhaps they may discuss it a third  time, but the fourth time we have to take urgent measures: Well,  buddy, I am sending the cane back. I am returning it. Clean it  up and when you bring it here clean, I will grind it. Why?  Because then, we begin to argue that the (?raw material) is bad  but no measures are taken. Thus, those comrades believe that  things will always go that way, that people will just talk, and  then this is what happens.    I think that in order to be efficient, aside from any  discussions there may be, concrete measures must be taken with  the comrades who are committing the violations; otherwise they  become habitual. A time comes when they get used to the [word  indistinct], to hearing us, or whatever comrades go there, say  to them: That is not right. However, since they know things are  not going to go any further, they know that...[rephrases]  perhaps they have become accustomed to the idea that no measures  are going to be taken, so they continue doing it and we continue  receiving it. We reach a point where, by having accepted it from  them, and by [word indistinct] we are committing the same  mistake, the same sin against the economy. [end recording]    At the workers assembly held at the Efrain Alfonso CAI,  Pedro  Ross Leal expressed interest in the situation at the complex as  regards outstanding accounts from other organizations; he  explained the significance of not complying with this indicator,  and its significance to the national economy. The workers also  advocated the expeditious arrival of cane to the mill, which at  times takes over 36 hours. This reduces its quality and results  in less sugar.    Strong statements were made about the causes, consequences,  and possible measures to be taken to solve the national  financial imbalance. Debate focused on the all-out war against  the black market, the lack of control, and the pilfering of  resources from state organizations.    Likewise, the workers supported the confiscation of goods  attained illegally, and deregulating and increasing prices of  nonessential products, among other issues which will help to  streamline national finances.</p>

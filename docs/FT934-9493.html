			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: China Light turns in 12% rise for year CHINA Light &amp; Power, one of the stocks on the Hong Kong market most favoured by foreign investors, yesterday produced slightly worse-than-expected full-year results when it posted a 12 per cent growth in net profit to HKDollars 3.5bn (USDollars 2.2bn) from HKDollars 3.2bn in 1992. Profit was struck on a 10 per cent rise in turnover, to HKDollars 14.7bn from HKDollars 13.4bn. A final dividend of HK 42 cents a share was declared, making HKDollars 1.20 for the year - a rise of 15.4 per cent. A bonus 1-for-5 scrip issue was also made. Analysts said the market had been expecting a rise in earnings of around 14 per cent, and that yesterday's results were 'a little duller than expected'. They said next year's earnings would benefit from property developments in the pipeline. China Light said its sales of electricity to China have been affected by the austerity measures introduced by the Chinese government to cool the mainland's economy. Total sales for the year amounted to 25,598m KW - up 10 per cent on last year's - but the rate of increase in sales in the coming year was expected to be lower.</p>

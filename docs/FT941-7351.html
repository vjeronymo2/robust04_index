			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Major to make offer to Sinn Fein Mr John Major will today make a fresh appeal to republican leaders to embrace the Northern Ireland peace process, offering Sinn Fein a full place in political life in return for an end to IRA violence. In a carefully worded message on the eve of Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin, the prime minister will attempt to tip the debate within the republican movement in favour of accepting the Downing Street declaration. In today's Irish News, the Belfast-based nationalist newspaper, Mr Major is expected to offer the most detailed exposition to date of the way ahead for republicans once the joint declaration has been accepted. He was backed yesterday by a call from Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, for republican acceptance of the declaration. Mr Reynolds urged Sinn Fein to adopt a policy of non-coercion of Ulster's Protestants. He said: 'What the peace declaration offers is a future free of coercion, British or Irish, loyalist or republican. That is the huge psychological step that we are asking not just republicans, but everyone, to take.' It also emerged yesterday that Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister, is ready to begin more detailed discussions with the province's constitutional parties. Mr Ancram expects within days to start exploring the parties' reaction to the checklist of ideas drawn up earlier this month by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. The talks are to run alongside discussions between officials in London and Dublin on proposals for a new political settlement. Ministers hope for progress on both elements of the talks process by the next Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference on March 10. Against a background of mounting unionist hostility towards the direction of the UK-Irish political initiative, the Ulster Unionists - the province's largest party - will on Monday publish its proposals for a settlement. These will focus mainly on a devolved government for Ulster. Although a definitive Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street declaration is not expected to emerge from the conference, due to a stand-off between Sinn Fein and the UK over the issue of 'clarification', Dublin has in effect pointed to a way in which the deadlock might be broken. Mr Reynolds referred positively to a recent article by Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, stating that Protestants in the province should not be coerced into a united Ireland. If the Sinn Fein conference were to make 'a clear endorsement of a policy of non-coercion' of the unionists, this would represent 'an immense step forward', Mr Reynolds said.</p>

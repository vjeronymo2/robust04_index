			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Telebras to invite private investment Telebras, Brazil's government-controlled telecommunications group, has launched a programme to attract private-sector investment to the industry. However, the move will not change Telebras's monopoly position, which is guaranteed by the constitution. The company, which has a backlog of about 10m telephone lines, is being forced to relax its hold on the system because of a capital investment crisis caused largely by government-imposed limits. This year's Dollars 3bn investment budget should be doubled to cope with demand, according to analysts. Under a new partnership programme, announced on Tuesday, the private sector will be able to install lines and networks, leasing them to Telebras's regional subsidiaries. According to analysts, the installations will be turned over to Telebras when the leasing period has expired.</p>

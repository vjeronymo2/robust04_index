			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African sugar cane crop at 9-year low SOUTH AFRICA'S sugar cane growers produced a drought-hit 1992-1993 crop of 1.507m tonnes, the worst since 1984, industry officials said yesterday, reports Reuter from Johannesburg. The South African Sugar Association, which markets the country's sugar output, said the effects of the severe drought last year could affect the 1993-1994 crop. Cane in the fields suffered from 'green drought phenomenon', said Mr Chris Fitzgerald, spokesman for the association. 'It looks nice outside but inside there is no growth,' he explained. He said the 1992-1993 crop was 'slightly better' than the 1.377m tonnes produced in the disastrous 1983-1984 season.</p>

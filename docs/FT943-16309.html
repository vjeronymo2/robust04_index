			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Own goals keep the underdog in the game - David Wighton analyses Lasmo's winning strategy As the City takes stock of Lasmo's victory over the bid from Enterprise Oil last week, merchant bankers have been reaching for sporting metaphors. 'If you'd asked me at the start, I'd have put more money on a Briton winning Wimbledon,' said one. 'It was like Greece taking the World Cup,' suggested another. All agreed it was one of the most unexpected results to a big takeover battle for years. And most agreed it was lost by Enterprise more than won by Lasmo. 'Lasmo started off Love-40 down, but Enterprise served three double faults,' said one independent investment banker. He argues that the first was the original terms of the bid, which involved a new class of Enterprise shares and warrants but no cash. 'That smacked of over-confidence. The bid showed how a good defence can quickly undermine the view of a good company and its paper.' Enterprise went into the bid with as high a standing in the City as Lasmo's was low. Yet the Lasmo defence managed to raise questions about its record, particularly with its attack on Enterprise's accounting policies, and undermined its share price. A leading merchant banker said: 'Enterprise appeared unprepared for the attack. Their advisers should have anticipated what the Lasmo accountants would say and prepared a proper response.' To be fair, Enterprise was rushed into unveiling the bid by Lasmo's rights issue and the Takeover Panel, and the outcome shows how difficult it is to recover from a bad start. But independent observers believe it made a fundamental mistake by not offering any element of cash from the start. 'I would never advise a client to go into a hostile bid with none of its offer underwritten for cash at all.' The Enterprise camp argues that the initial bid was only an opening shot, and that to underwrite it would have handed fees to the City for nothing. As for the decision not to have any of the improved offer underwritten, there is some disagreement whether Warburg, Enterprise's lead adviser, tried and failed or never tried at all. Either way there is general agreement that the lack of cash was a deciding factor. 'Share-for-share offers are very difficult since improving the terms for the target's shareholders harms the bidder's shareholders. You have to have a very compelling commercial argument. Enterprise didn't, or at least didn't manage to get it across.' This is in contrast to the UK's last big hostile bid - Granada's successful takeover of LWT - where there was both a convincing industrial case and cash. Perhaps the main lesson for other all paper bids is how tricky buying shares in the market can be. The Takeover Code allows a bidder to buy up to 10 per cent of the target's shares at a price not more than the value of the paper offer. The rule is a case where the Code allows the principle of equal treatment of shareholders to be relaxed, but the reaction of institutions shows how cherished this principle is. The institutions felt that the way Enterprise's advisers handled the purchases was particularly unfair, although within the rules. However it is unlikely that those that were not favoured rejected the bid out of pique and more probable that Warburg unfortunately bought from institutions that were going to accept anyway. Whatever the truth, there is a growing feeling that the 10 per cent rule is unsatisfactory and that the Takeover Panel may review its operation in practice. Although Warburg has come in for serious criticism, it can point to one successful innovation in the bid. For the first time a UK company made a hostile share offer available to the target's US investors. Hostile bids involving the issue of shares are almost unheard of in the US because the new shares have first to be registered with the SEC, a long and public process. Assisted by Davis, Polk and Wardwell, the New York law firm, Warburg managed to compress into two weeks a process that usually takes at least two months, persuading the SEC to review its registration statement in private. The effort was worthwhile, with almost half Lasmo's US investors, who accounted for 21 per cent of the shares, accepting the offer. But the bid is likely to remembered less for this neat bit of footwork than for the series of own goals. Enterprise and its advisers will be hoping the City is more forgiving than Colombian football fans.</p>

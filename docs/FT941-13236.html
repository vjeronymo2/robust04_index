			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Cocoa gains trimmed - Market Report A late bout of selling trimmed back COCOA prices yesterday after another abortive attempt to break through upside resistance. 'The market may yet move higher,' said one trader, 'but at the moment it doesn't seem to have any real life to it.' Selling from one US trade house in particular was noted as the London Commodity Exchange's May futures position retreated from its early peak of Pounds 924 a tonne to close at Dollars 916, up Dollars 4 on the day. The COFFEE market had made a promising beginning, the March breaking through initial resistance at Dollars 1,200 a tonne, in buying possibly linked to interest from some of the smaller funds, traders said. But profit taking eroded the gains and by the close the price was down Dollars 8 on the day at Dollars 1,184 a tonne. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM was helped by late commission house buying, encouraged by underlying support above Dollars 1,200 a tonne for three moths metal. The market was also aided by caution ahead of Friday's deadline for producing nations to agree a pact on curbing production. Final business was at Dollars 1,210, up Dollars 17.

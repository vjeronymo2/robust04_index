			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (8): The elite from outside - Business and the Welsh One of the things which puzzles visitors to Wales is why so few people whom they meet running small businesses or tourist facilities are Welsh. The fact that newcomers have so evidently prospered in Wales in recent years suggests the opportunities are there, but the low profile of the Welsh, and in particular the country's 500,000 Welsh speakers, suggests the locals are not taking advantage of them. This apparent lack of entrepreneurialism - in both language communities - has been the subject of academic research in recent years and is behind the formation of Menter a Busnes (Enterprise and Business) which has a brief to help Welsh speakers to develop their economic potential and so bring renewed economic vitality to parts of Wales where unemployment and migration of young people remain high. Their Protestant background should perhaps have predisposed the Welsh to enterprise, but historians believe other, less favourable influences have been at work. Though Wales was among the most industrialised parts of the world in the 18th and 19th centuries, the pattern of land ownership resulted in a largely non-Welsh elite controlling, and deriving most of the benefits from, mineral extraction. This, Mr Merfyn Jones of University of Wales, Bangor, points out, prevented the emergence of an indigenous entrepreneurial class. Social mobility among Welsh people has until comparatively recently been associated not with business but with learning - education, the law, medicine and the church. The dominance of two industries in the Welsh economy - iron and steel, and coal - and their eventual state control after the war added a further dimension, encouraging many Welsh people to see the public sector as offering the best career prospects. M a B has done its own probing which has analysed this legacy. Its study of 80 Welsh businesses - 40 run by Welsh-speakers and 20 each by English-speaking Welsh people and newcomers, spread across four small towns  -has found significant differences in the types of business in which the groups are represented and, indeed, in the personalities of those running them, with the biggest differences occurring between the Welsh-speakers and the newcomers. On the whole, Welsh-speakers tended to be traditional in their approach to business, reluctant to take on extensive borrowing, and anxious to keep activities within safe and stable boundaries. Product ranges were conservative, with changes often customer-driven, and prices were set in line with competitors. Because customers were often known, there was a willingness to advance credit. The newcomers, partly because many were starting up in a new area where they had few contacts, found they had to be more innovative. This was manifested in a willingness to borrow, a reluctance to extend credit, and a much more aggressive approach to marketing and product pricing. The Welsh-speakers were also less self-confident and more anxious, and tended to see their business in subjective terms. 'Non-Welsh speakers feel that it is possible to improve their business by adding to their education or by going on courses. Welsh speakers blame the weaknesses of the business on their own personal shortcomings,' Mr Hywel Evans, director of M a B, observes. With this evidence to hand and using detailed census information on Welsh job characteristics, M a B has devised programmes to change attitudes and get more Welsh people to think about going into business. After only five years, there are signs that subtle changes are being achieved. The Welsh language broadcast media have been encouraged to feature business more prominently in their programmes, and by focusing on successes to create positive role models as an antidote to the previously negative images of business and business people. Welsh language course material suitable for use from primary through to further education has been devised, and community groups have been encouraged through a business game, Chwylbro] to make business issues a natural topic of discussion. The signs, according to Professor Phil Cooke, of University of Wales, Cardiff, are that a turnround in attitudes has begun. Studies undertaken for M a B in 1993 by Beaufort Research showed Welsh speakers had become more aware of successful business role models and thought of Wales more positively as a business location. In addition, the Welsh language had come to be seen by both language groups as offering business advantages. Other positive signs have emerged, including greater interest among Welsh businessmen and women in banding together to exploit opportunities. In Gwynedd the Welsh-language market has created a strong print sector but this was under threat from English printers willing to compete for local - and even Welsh language - trade. Rather than retreat, as might have happened in the past, the Welsh companies are coming together to mount their own joint marketing venture. Another indication of the new self-confidence of Welsh speakers in business has been the emergence in Cardiff of a business group working in professional services. The group, Cwlwm Busnes Caerdydd a'r Cylch, has a mailing list of more than 300 members who meet regularly throughout the year. One of the prime movers, Mr Dafydd Hampson-Jones, director of Celtic Henderson Crosthwaite in Cardiff, part of Bank of Yokohama-owned Guinness Mahon, offers investment advice through the medium of Welsh - making it necessary to invent a new range of terms (such as breingyfrannau di-fuddran or zero dividend preference shares). He recently placed what is probably the first bilingual tombstone advertisement for a share placing involving a north Wales TV production company, and estimates 25 per cent of his company's private client business is conducted through the medium of Welsh.</p>

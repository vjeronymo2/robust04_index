			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Air France presents recovery plans to unions Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, yesterday revealed proposals to stem losses at the state-owned airline and set a target of matching the performance of Lufthansa, its German rival, by 1997. The proposals, which come two months after a recovery programme was abandoned in the face of a bitter strike by employees, have been presented to the airline's 14 union groups. A final document will be discussed with company employees in January and February. Mr Blanc, who took over as chairman following the resignation of Mr Bernard Attali, the architect of the previous recovery plan, painted a grim picture of the group's financial and operating performance. His response involves cost-cutting, plans to increase productivity, and the prospect of allocating shares to employees in return for pay cuts. Mr Blanc told employees that Air France would report losses of about FFr7.5bn (Pounds 862m) this year and would have debts of FFr36bn at the end of December, compared with about FFr26bn last year. 'Air France does not earn enough, spends too much, and its productivity is inferior to its competitors,' he said. 'The situation requires a rapid change in methods and morale - a supersonic acceleration.' Air France, which is due to be privatised, has set a target of a 10 per cent increase in productivity for each of the next three years. Operating costs would be cut by 7 per cent a year and staff costs by 10 per cent each year for the next three years. Mr Blanc wants to use voluntary means, such as early retirement, to cut staff numbers by 2,100 from the current level of just under 63,000. The airline's higher-paid employees will also be offered shares in the airline in 1997 in return for voluntary pay cuts. Mr Blanc said it could involve 'a significant part of the company's capital'. The national carrier also said it had to reform its rigid bureaucracy and inflexible work practices, cited as among the main causes of its high costs and losses. On transatlantic flights, for example, Air France said it spent FFr117 for every FFr100 received. Mr Blanc described the situation as 'grave, but not irreversible'. Lufthansa was chosen as a target because it was a similar size and faced similar social costs and conditions.</p>

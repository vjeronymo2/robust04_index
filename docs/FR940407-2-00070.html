			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Introduction and Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The purpose of this program announcement is to announce the availability of Fiscal Year 1994 financial assistance to promote the goal of environmental regulatory enhancement for American Indians and Alaska Natives through the planning, development and implementation of projects that advance tribal capacity to perform environmental regulatory functions. Funds will be awarded under section 803(d) of the Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2991 et seq.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Congress has enacted statutes for the purpose of protecting the environment. Several of these statutes provide a role for Indian tribes. In addition, tribes may also regulate the environment pursuant to their own laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite this increasing environmental responsibility and growing awareness of environmental issues on Indian lands, there has been a lack of resources available to tribes to develop tribal environmental programs that are responsive to tribal needs. In many cases, this lack of resources has resulted in a delay in action on the part of the tribes. Some of the critical issues identified by tribes before congressional committees include: the need for assistance to train professional staff to monitor and enforce tribal environmental programs; the lack of adequate data for tribes to develop environmental statutes and establish environmental quality standards; and the resources to conduct studies to identify sources of pollution and the ability to determine the impact on existing environmental quality. As a result, Congress enacted Public Law 101&hyph;408 to strengthen tribal governments through building capacity within the tribes to identify, plan, develop, and implement environmental programs in a manner that is consistent with tribal culture. ANA is to support these activities on a government-to-government basis in a way that acknowledges tribal sovereignty and is consistent with tribal culture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis against the evaluation criteria in this announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Administration for Native Americans believes that responsibility for achieving environmental regulatory enhancement rests with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and with the leadership of Native American groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Progress toward the goal of environmental regulatory enhancement would include the strengthening of tribal environmental laws, providing for the training and education of those employees responsible for ensuring compliance with and enforcement of these laws, and the development of programs to conduct compliance and enforcement functions. Other functions leading toward enhancing local regulatory capacity include, but are not limited to: environmental assessments, development and use of environmental laboratories, and development of court systems for enforcement of tribal and Federal environmental laws. Ultimate success in this program will be realized when the applicant's desired level of environmental quality is acquired and maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administration for Native Americans bases its policies on three interrelated goals:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Governance:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To assist tribal and village governments, Native American institutions, and local leadership to exercise local control and decision-making over their resources, including environmental resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Economic Development:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To foster the development of stable, diversified local economies and economic activities which will provide jobs and promote economic well-being, consistent with environmental protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Social Development:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To support local access to, control of, and coordination of services and programs (including pollution prevention activities) which safeguard the health and well-being of people and the tribal environment, provide support services and training so people can work and which are essential to a thriving and self-sufficient community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To achieve these goals, ANA supports tribal and village governments, and other Native American organizations, in their efforts to develop and implement community-based, long-term governance, social and economic development strategies (SEDS)_strategies that promote the goal of self-sufficiency in local communities. These basic ANA goals also form the basis for this environmental program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SEDS policy supports ANA's goals and is based on two fundamental principles:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The local community and its leadership are responsible for determining goals, setting priorities, and planning and implementing programs aimed at achieving those goals. The unique mix of socio-economic, political, and cultural factors in each community makes local self-determination necessary. The local community is in the best position to apply its own cultural, political, and socio-economic values to its long-term strategies and programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Economics, governance, and social development are interrelated. Development in one area should be balanced with development in the others in order to move toward self-sufficiency. Consequently, comprehensive development strategies should address all aspects of the governmental, economic, and social infrastructures (including those for environmental protection) needed to promote self-sufficient communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

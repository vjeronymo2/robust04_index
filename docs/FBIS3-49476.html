Moczulski proposed that Poland should rather take care of  its  own Armed Forces. According to Moczulski, Poland's policy  related to the NATO membership has focused on reaching certain  propagandist goals. It produced no positive results in the past  several years but halted the country's defence preparations.    "One should have at least rebuilt the army to make it  capable  of counteracting threats we may encounter," Moczulski said.</p>

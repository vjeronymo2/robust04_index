Halifax said prices rose just 0.2 per cent on average to Pounds 63,563, the second consecutive monthly increase announced by the society, which had reported price falls in April and May. Nationwide said that prices had risen 1.8 per cent last month, the biggest monthly rise since May 1991 and following a 0.7 per cent fall in June. Halifax said that the recovery in the housing market remains very weak and the possibility of further monthly price falls remains. Negative equity, page V</p>

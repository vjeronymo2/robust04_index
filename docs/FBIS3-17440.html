However, it has become clear since the war that  Russia has made advances in the development of high-tech weapons  at a much faster pace than predicted. Sources well versed in  international military affairs said: "One of Russia's aims is  to obtain foreign currency through the export of high-tech  weapons." They also noted that "more fundamentally, the aim is  to build up the Army with the long-term in view." The comments  are a warning that if Western nations, currently enjoying the  post-Cold War peace, neglect research and development, it is  possible their high-tech weapons technology will be behind that  of Russia 10 years from now.    Among Russia's high-tech weapons is the "SU-34 air fighter,"  dubbed "Russia's miracle," which has been a source of surprise  for military analysts in Western nations. The aircraft, which  can fly a distance of up to 4,000 km without the need to use  reserve fuel, is equipped with a system which makes it possible  for the aircraft to skim over terrain and make observations in  the way a cruise missile can.    A big difference between the SU-34 and conventional Russian  military aircraft lies in its "comfort." The cockpit of the  SU-34, which is covered with 17-mm-thick bullet-proof glass, is  equipped with an air conditioner, a microwave oven, and a  toilet. The cockpit is so large that a pilot can stand up and  do exercises inside it. It is said that even after flying a  distance of 1,000 kilometers, the pilot of an SU-34 feels no  fatigue and can immediately go into combat operation.    There is also an SU-35 air fighter, which is capable of  carrying out the "cobra" maneuver in which the aircraft climbs  while flying in circles. Western nations have no aircraft  superior to the SU-35, and it is suspected their best planes  would lose out in a dogfight against the SU-35.    Russia is also expected to put FST-2 and FST-3 tanks into  practical use in the late nineties.    These tanks carry either a 135-mm or 145-mm gun, larger than  the (120-mm) gun carried by Western tanks. It is said that  because these tanks are made of "advanced armor plate" such as a  ceramic complex armor plate and electromagnetic armor plate,  Western tank shells would not be able to penetrate them.    Russia is also currently improving and modernizing its SS-25  strategic nuclear missile. It is also developing the SS-X-26  and SS-X-27 missiles. Among Russian-made missiles, the AAML  air-to-air missile has drawn much attention because of its long  400 km range. In comparison, U.S. Phoenix missile has a range of  only 150 km, the longest among comparable U.S. missiles. With  the AAML Russia can attack weapons such as airborne warning and  control system (AWACS) aircraft, a key command device, from a  distance out of firing range.    Russian research and development of high-tech weapons covers  a wide area. In addition to the aforementioned weapons, it is  also energetically developing helicopters, armored vehicles, and  firearms. During the period 1991 and 1993, Russia developed 14  new pieces of equipment in nine different weaponry areas. It is  said Russia is currently developing about 30 kinds of new weapon  over more than 12 areas.    It is believed that following the collapse of the former  Soviet Union, Russia, with the help of Western nations, promoted  the conversion of the defense industry to civilian production in  preparation for a shift toward a market economy. Nevertheless,  Russia has made advances in weapons development. A military  expert believes that "because it cannot produce good civilian  products, Russia is gradually going back to the development of  weapons, which is its strength." He said it should also be  noted that "even in the current political and economic  confusion, the Russian Army is steadily preparing for 10 years  from now."</p>

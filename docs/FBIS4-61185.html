			<p>BFN     [Text] The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev left for  Brussels this afternoon to take part in the discussion of NATO's  Partnership for Peace program. The head of the Azerbaijani  state will sign a document in the capital of Belgium on the our  republic's adherence to this program. Membership in such a  program will play an important role in Azerbaijan's  rapprochement with the Western countries, and will create wider  possibilities to make use of NATO's prestige and influence for  the peaceful resolution of the conflict [with Armenia] through  talks.    Before leaving for Brussels, the Azerbaijani president spoke  to reporters on the aim of his visit.    [Begin Aliyev recording] I will sign the document. This is  the main purpose of my visit. In addition to that, many  business circles in Brussels want to meet with me. I will meet  with businessmen to solve the economic problems. This is  because, as you know, Belgium is the center of European Economic  Community. I will also discuss how this economic union could  assist Azerbaijan. This is the main aim of my visit.    Undoubtedly, the current situation in Azerbaijan, the  ongoing  war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the continuing  aggression by Armenia against Azerbaijan -- these attacks are  continuing even today -- will be explained both at NATO  headquarters and during my other contacts. I will hold talks on  these issues and will set out Azerbaijan's policies.    The Armenian Armed Forces have been unceasingly attacking  Azerbaijani territory since 10 April, despite the fact that they  are suffering heavy losses. The Azerbaijani Armed Forces are  causing them major losses. Despite that, they are still  pressing ahead with their attacks, and they are not launching  these attacks alone. I think that there are many forces helping  them.    We want to stop the shooting. We have already issued  statements to this effect. We agreed to sign the cease-fire  agreement sponsored and proposed by Russia's Foreign and Defense  Ministries on 28 April. However, the Armenian side has not  agreed to this. In the meantime, a large CSCE group has visited  Azerbaijan headed by Mr. Mosberg. This delegation also included  U.S. generals and representatives of Russia, Italy, and other  CSCE countries. Mr. Mosberg held extensive talks with me. He  then visited Daghlyk-Karabakh's [Nagorno-Karabakh] Khankendi  [Stepanakert], and Yerevan. He returned to Baku for talks with  me. They too put forward a draft cease-fire agreement. I  agreed to that draft agreement too. However, when they returned  to Yerevan and talked with Armenian President Ter-Petrosyan, he  and the Armenian leadership did not agree to sign this agreement  for the time being, and declared that at present they are not  ready for a cessation of hostilities on the pretext that a  special mechanism should be prepared to oversee a cease-fire.    We too know that a special mechanism is needed to ensure and  supervise the cease-fire. However, this mechanism could be  created after the establishment of a cease-fire. It will serve  neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan if we now sit and work on a  mechanism while the fighting continues and people get killed on  both sides. Mr. Mosberg phoned us from Yerevan informing us  that the Armenian side did not agree with this, and therefore  his delegation returned to Vienna.    This is the situation for now. The Armenians are continuing  their attacks, and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces are retaliating.  The Armenian attacks have been repulsed in some sectors and  their military goals have been blocked. They have withdrawn and  suffered many losses. Despite this, the war is continuing.    We are not for war. I again declare today that we favor the  establishment of a cease-fire. However, the Armenian side does  not agree to this. We will pursue our peace-loving policy.  [end recording]    The Azerbaijani president was seen off at Bina airport by  Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet; Prime  Minister Suret Guseynov; Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of  the Supreme Soviet; deputy prime ministers, ministers, heads of  the state enterprises and law enforcement organs.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> HEALTH INSURERS PLANNING DOUBLE-DIGIT RATE HIKES  </P> <P> California health insurers are planning double-digit premium increases in 1990,  putting renewed pressure on employers to either trim coverage or pass the added  cost along to their workers.  </P> <P> The giant Kaiser Foundation Health Plans has announced its largest increases in  basic rates since 1980: 19.6% for the Northern California region and 17.5% for  the Southern California region. Kaiser is the nation's largest health  maintenance organization and by far the dominant HMO in California, with about  4.5 million members, more than half of the California market.  </P> <P> Blue Cross of California is planning a 20% increase for individual members. Its  rate hike for group coverage may be even higher, but spokesmen declined to  discuss that issue. Some other so-called "fee for service" insurers are  expected to implement rate increases of up to 30%.  </P> <P> The unusual factor behind Kaiser's rate increase is that the HMO is growing  "extremely rapidly," said Dr. Michael J. Martin, the San Francisco-based  director of project development for Mercer-Meidinger Hansen Inc., a benefits  consulting firm. Kaiser operates its own clinics and hospitals. Its increased  enrollment is forcing it to build more facilities.  </P> <P> Last year Kaiser Northern California raised rates 12.9% and the Southern  California region had a rate hike of 9.6%. Those increases were lower than  those of most other HMOs last year.  </P> <P> Even with the whopping rate increases in 1990, Kaiser will remain the  lowest-cost HMO in California and most of the nation, Martin said.  </P> <P> Generally, HMO rate increases are expected to be in the range of 15% -- about  the same as the rate hike in 1989, said Russell Nash, a consultant on health  care and insurance for McKinsey &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. Cypress-based  Pacificare, which has about 400,000 members in Southern California, said it  expects to raise rates in the range of 14% to 18%. The rate of increase will  vary with different employer groups, depending on the ages of group members,  the geographic spread of the group and the benefits received, said Michael  Lombardi, Pacificare's vice president for marketing.  </P> <P> Maxicare Health Plans Inc., with about 150,000 members in Southern California,  expects to raise rates in the range of 17%, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Maxicare, once the nation's largest for-profit HMO, filed for Chapter 11  bankruptcy protection last March. The company recently won agreement from its  creditors on a plan of reorganization and is expected to ask for the approval  of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana next month.  </P> <P> About the only good news is that the 1990 increases for some HMOs will be lower  than they were this year when organizations felt "an incredible need to play  catch-up ball," said Charlie Schetter, a health care consultant with McKinsey  &amp; Co. Some rates increased 25% to 30% in 1989 as HMOs tried to make up for  the highly competitive years in the mid-1980s when they elected not to raise  rates, or to keep increases very low, for fear of losing business.  </P> <P> Lynda C. Badum, an associate with Fringe Benefit Planning of Newport Beach,  said she expects that some of the smaller HMOs in California will still be  playing catch-up in 1990 with increases higher than 20%. Small plans, like  Metropolitan Life Insurance's HMO, "started at much lower rates and are now  going higher to make up," she said.  </P> <P> Among the reasons that HMOs are continuing to raise rates is that they "are  becoming more popular and are taking on a more diverse risk," Badum said,  explaining that more HMOs are getting older members who are sicker and cost  more to serve.  </P> <P> Kaiser's Northern California region gained 126,000 members in 1988, bringing  total membership to about 2.3 million, said Bob Hughes, Kaiser's spokesman for  that region. It expects to add about the same number this year, he said. The  increased membership has forced the region to speed up its 10-year,  $3.5-billion plan to build more facilities, he said. General inflation in  medical costs has also contributed to the strain.  </P> <P> "We have also made a concerted effort to improve our services. We are  increasing our ratio of physicians to members," Hughes said.  </P> <P> The recruitment of physicians in itself is costly, said Janice Fowler-Seib,  spokeswoman for Kaiser's 2.2-million member Southern California region. The  region has added about 700 doctors in the last two years and expects that it  will need another 500 in 1990. "That is the equivalent of three medical school  graduating classes. There is a tremendous expense in recruiting competent  physicians and we need medical support staff," she added.  </P> <P> Kaiser has taken steps to control its growth in recent years. It no longer  accepts individual members and has stopped advertising in some areas.  </P> <P> In a sense, Kaiser is a victim of its own success. It is gaining members,  health care consultants say, because of its history of stability during a  troubled period for HMOs and because of its low cost. Next year, Kaiser's rates  will still be about 13% to 15% below its HMO competitors, Hughes said.  </P> <P> Despite troubles in the industry, HMOs remain popular, health care consultants  said, because their cost and rate increases have been less than those of  indemnity -- fee for service -- insurers, who allow members to choose their own  doctors and pay the bills after a certain deductible.  </P> <P> While some experts expect indemnity insurers to increase rates by 20% or more  again in 1990, a dissenting opinion came from McKinsey &amp; Co.'s Nash, who  said he expects most indemnity insurance rate hikes to be less than 20%,  because the profitability of most insurers has improved in the last two years.  </P> <P> Nash said he thinks the employers will react to the increased rates in several  ways, including more aggressively negotiating for lower rates and studying more  closely the factors that are driving up their particular premium costs and  fine-tuning their plans as a result. For example, if employers find that  offering drug and alcohol abuse recovery programs are driving up costs, they  may redesign those plans.  </P> <P> "They will also be asking employees to make trade-offs. If you want to have  full access to providers instead of staying within the network (of specifically  designated doctors and other providers) you will have to pay more," Nash said.  Employers may continue to ask workers to pay more of the premium, he added.  </P></p>

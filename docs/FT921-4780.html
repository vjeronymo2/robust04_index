			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Winning Somex bidder pulls out THE winning bidder for the Mexican bank Somex, which was privatised on Sunday, has pulled out of the deal after key investors baulked at paying the agreed price of Dollars 846m for nearly 82 per cent of the bank. The move will not surprise too many observers of the Mexican banking scene. The purchase price had been widely described as too high. It represented 29 times last year's earnings and was 4.6 times the bank's book value. Mr Eduardo Creel, who headed the winning financial group, said some of his investors had shown 'doubts with respect to the reasonableness of the bid presented,' and his group would thus not make the first payment due on the bank. Mr Creel and his team thus forfeits its deposit of 50,000m pesos (Dollars 16.1m). The finance ministry has awarded Somex to the second highest bidder, investors from the brokerage Invermexico, who had offered Dollars 605m for 81.62 per cent of the bank, 21 times earnings, and 3.3 times book value. In the past nine months the government has sold 12 banks in auctions for 30.75bn pesos at an average of 21 times historic earnings.</p>

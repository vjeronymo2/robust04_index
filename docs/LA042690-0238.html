			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHINESE PEASANTS KIDNAPED ON ARRIVAL AT KENNEDY AIRPORT  </P> <P> Seven Chinese peasants who had just arrived in the United States to study  organic farming were kidnaped at Kennedy Airport by screaming Asian men who  forced them into a car and sped off, authorities said today.  </P> <P> The peasants were among a group of 16 Chinese nationals from a 19-hour flight  to New York from Beijing with a stop in San Francisco aboard Air China Flight  981.  </P> <P> The group was met at the airport by Molly Aitken, president of the World Energy  Foundation based in Athol, Mass., which is sponsoring the farming program.  </P> <P> At the arrivals terminal, Aitken said she watched in horror as seven of the  peasants were confronted by three or four men, who screamed as they hustled the  confused Chinese into a car.  </P> <P> Aitken said she had been warned by a U.S. consular official in China that  Chinese are often abducted and forced to work as slave labor in New York's  Chinatown, but a law enforcement official at JFK expressed skepticism.  </P> <P> "It's never happened here before," Port Authority Detective Sgt. Herman McAuley  said.  </P> <P> McAuley said local police and the FBI are treating the incident as a kidnaping.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (CNS) -- Vice Premier of the State  Council of China Mr Li Lanqing made an inspection tour in Wuhan,  capital of Hubei Province from May 28 to June 2 to investigate  development of the Dong Feng Automobile Manufacturing  Corporation there, saying a big problem facing the automobile  industry in China was its decentralized layout resulting in a  number of "small but all inclusive" enterprises and repetition  of establishment of such enterprises at a low level, thus it was  difficult for China's automobile industry to participate in the  international competition in terms of quality, production cost  and technology. The automobile industry in the country should  concentrate in producing a number of backbone enterprises to  meet the international challenge and competition.    China has listed its automobile industry as one of the  pillar  industries of the country. Facing the grim situation of  re-entry GATT, the State Council has enacted the new industrial  policy for the automobile industry and the relevant document  will be published in not far distant future. According to the  document, the Dong Feng Automobile Manufacturing Corporation,  the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory, the Shanghai  Automobile Manufacturing Factory and the Tianjin Automobile  Manufacturing Factory have become the four biggest car  manufacturing bases in the country. Support should be given to  certain key enterprises in the improvement of their economic  performance by bettering management so as to speed up their  development.    Mr Li asked the Dong Feng Automobile Manufacturing  Corporation to increase its production capacity of Fu Kang-XZ  car, which was co-produced with the Citron Group of France, to a  size of annual output of 150,000 cars, increasing the rate of  product indigenization and reducing production costs while  guaranteeing quality of products.    There are now more than 120 automobile manufacturing  factories in the Mainland, most of which are considered by Mr Li  as "repetition at a low level". At a cross-road of co-existence  of opportunities and challenge, Mr Li said China's automobile  industry must solve the problem of "small size, decentralized  layout and disorder in production" in a bid to develop backbone  enterprises which have ability of technological development,  ability of production in a large scale and perfect marketing and  service network.    Mr Li made it clear that China would not approve the  establishment of any new automobile manufacturing factory  including joint ventures in the coming years but would welcome  foreign businessmen to develop, research and produce on a large  size automobile accessories for the purpose of export.</p>

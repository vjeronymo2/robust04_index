			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent possible with available funds, the commission will for qualified small operators who request assistance: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Select and pay a qualified public or private entity to perform the activities described under [NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)] including: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. A determination of the probable hydrologic consequences of the mining and reclamation operations both on and off the proposed permit area according to section 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The preparation of a statement of the results of test borings or core samplings according to section 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;06. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, as amended, NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1) (a) and (b) will provide coverage of all program services detailed in North Dakota's statute at NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State proposal is substantively similar to its Federal counterpart regulations at 30 CFR 795.9 (a), (b), (b)(1) and (b)(2), as revised on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 28136), with one exception. While the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 795.9 (b)(1) through (b)(6) specifically identify each activity that may be funded pursuant to SOAP, the State proposal specifically identifies only two activities that may be funded by SOAP. However, as noted above, the State proposal does encompass all activities described under proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2). The activities described under proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2), in turn, correspond to the activities described in the Federal program at sections 507 (c)(1)(A) through (c)(1)(F) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 795.9 (b)(1) through (b)(6). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule notice for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Director finds that proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;02(1) (a) and (b) are no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the corresponding Federal regulations. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> c. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2), Small Operator Assistance_Eligibility for Assistance (Introductory Text) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota proposed to revise the introductory text of NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2) by increasing the amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants from one hundred thousand tons [90,718.47 metric tons] to three hundred thousand tons [272,155.41 metric tons]. The proposed change would make NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2) consistent with proposed statutory changes to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37 (see ``Amendment XVIII'' dated April 21, 1993, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1), as well as the requirements of SMCRA at section 507(c)(1) and the recently revised Federal counterpart regulation at 30 CFR 795.6(2). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) Therefore, the Director is approving proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(2) (introductory text). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> d. NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5), Small Operator Assistance_Eligibility for Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota proposed to create new NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) to provide that an applicant is eligible for SOAP assistance if, among other things: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [The applicant] will be required to pay reclamation fees under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;87; 91 Stat. 445; U.S.C. 1201  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) is meant to implement the statutory provision of NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(5) (see ``Amendment XVIII'' dated April 21, 1993, administrative record No. ND&hyph;Q&hyph;1). (For a discussion of the proposed statutory provision, see the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> North Dakota's proposed limitation of SOAP assistance to operators required to pay reclamation fees under SMCRA does not render NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) inconsistent with SMCRA because section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA only requires that SOAP assistance be made available to a qualified ``coal surface mining operator.'' As discussed in the additional final rule for North Dakota published elsewhere in this issue, the operators who will be deemed ineligible for SOAP assistance under the North Dakota proposal would not qualify for such assistance under SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director notes that there is a typographical error in the SMCRA citation given in proposed NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5). That is, the reference to ``U.S.C. 1201  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' should be `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  U.S.C. 1201  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' North Dakota's Attorney General, in a legal opinion dated October 1, 1993, and included with this proposed amendment, noted the typographical error, but stated that the reference to the United States Code at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) should read ``30 U.S.C. 120 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  et seq.'' OSM notes that the correct reference to SMCRA should be ``30 U.S.C. 120 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Director finds North Dakota's proposed rule at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;29&hyph;03(5) is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Director is approving it with the understanding that North Dakota will revise the aforementioned typographical error so that the correct citation to SMCRA is referenced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> e.

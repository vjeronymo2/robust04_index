			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONETIME RESORT BECOMES HOME TO SCIENTISTS, ARTISTS;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOODS: PEOPLE CAME TO NORTHEAST ALTADENA FOR THE MOUNTAINS. THEY STAYED  BECAUSE OF THE FRIENDLINESS OF ITS RESIDENTS.  </P> <P> In 1907, the first merchant to open for business in Northeast Altadena was  picketed for several days by homeowners indignant at the idea of a grocery  store in their rustic neighborhood.  </P> <P> These days, the shops and eateries on the site of that original venture on  North Lake Avenue, the Model Grocery Co., seem to receive a warmer reception  from residents, who treat them as a folksy community hub.  </P> <P> At the Park Bench Deli, despite the distracting aromas when co-owner Tudor  Lance cooks corned beef, members of the nearby Theosophical Society can be  heard talking philosophy.  </P> <P> And occasionally, Lance's 10-year-old daughter, Elisabeth, visits with diners  in their booths. "I want people to feel at home here," Lance said.  </P> <P> Down at the Fox's Restaurant, meanwhile, the interplay between waitresses and  customers touches on topics ranging from hairdos to basketball. The coffee  shop's homespun decor includes wooden plaques inscribed with words of wisdom  such as, The flavor of onions is improved by adding steak.  </P> <P> Owners Lorraine and Ken Bertonneau have lived in the neighborhood for years.  "We looked extensively in other areas, and concluded that everything we want is  right here: peace and quiet, friendliness and wonderful neighbors, but mainly  -- the mountains," Lorraine Bertonneau said.  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Mountains loom above Altadena, an 8.8-square-mile  unincorporated county area with about 40,000 residents.  </P> <P> Northeast Altadena, with an estimated 7,328 residents, was once called  "Altadena Heights."  </P> <P> Historians say it became a verdant mountain resort before the turn of the  century, when wealthy people from Canada and the East Coast built winter homes,  enjoying golf at the Altadena Country Club, just south of Mendocino Street.  </P> <P> The Woodbury Brothers -- John and Frederick, of Marshalltown, Iowa -- could be  considered Altadena's town fathers. In 1880, they acquired more than 900 acres  of what was then considered wasteland at the north end of Rancho San Pasqual.  </P> <P> The Woodbury subdivision was laid out in 1887 by the Pasadena Improvement Co. A  portion of it extended past Lake Avenue into Northeast Altadena.  </P> <P> Eastward, in the central section, Lafayette S. Porter, a Chicago banker, and  his mother, Hannah H. Porter, bought two adjoining parcels of land in 1883.  When Porter sold the property in 1912, his home, at 2672 Porter Ave., was  razed. Later, Edward Munroe built a two-story stucco house on the site.  </P> <P> In the 1920s, according to Altadena Heritage chairman Tim Gregory, Boulder Road  was developed as a single tract. By this time, Altadena was attracting  scientists, professionals and more than a sprinkling of artists and writers.  </P> <P> The short, boulder-lined street of about 30 homes drew such a disproportionate  share of creative people that it's considered a neighborhood unto itself.  </P> <P> Probably the most noted of its residents was the late Richard P. Feynman, the  iconoclastic Nobel Prize-winning physicist from Caltech. Feynman, who was also  an artist and writer, died in 1988, and his wife, Gwyneth, died in January.  </P> <P> The couple's two-story, Spanish-style home is now owned by their two children,  Carl, 28, and Michelle, 21, a photography student at the Art Center College of  Design in Pasadena. Both were raised in the house, and Michelle Feynman, who  still occupies it, says she intends to stay.  </P> <P> She wrote about the house in a book of home photos she compiled:  </P> <P> "Following my mother's death, I came to realize that I still have a parent of  sorts. This house, made of wood and stone and metal, has a spirit. . . . It is  no longer just a house."  </P> <P> Up the street, past a couple of small adobe houses amid other grand homes,  boulders are used architecturally as part of the base of an English Tudor house  with dormer windows.  </P> <P> Built as a fishing retreat in 1920 by Thelma and Howard Edgcomb, it was the  first house on the street.  </P> <P> In front of the house, a small stream was created and stocked with fish.  </P> <P> Its current owner is a Pasadena art dealer. To reach the front door, a visitor  must step up and down large rocks and cross a small, ivy-covered bridge. The  bridge spans the pool of a fountain that flows among flowers and pebbles.  </P> <P> Lillias Jones, 70, a former actress, gives voice lessons in the 40-foot living  room of a 4,000-square-foot Mediterranean house next door. She's also honorary  secretary of the Gilbert and Sullivan Society and allows members to play her  two baby grand pianos when they meet there.  </P> <P> Northeast Altadena's easternmost tract extended from Allen Avenue to Eaton  Canyon. It was bought by William Allen in 1879, after he came to America from  England. He named it the Sphinx Ranch. (He had spent 23 years in Egypt, as a  broker.)  </P> <P> Allen paid $7.50 an acre for the 502-acre ranch. In 1925, subdivisions were  sold to real estate agents for $1,800 an acre.  </P> <P> At Allen Avenue and Mendocino Street stands the imposing Balian House, owned by  George Balian, an ice cream manufacturer. Each Christmas, he decorates the  exterior of the Mediterranean mansion with what appears to be millions of  lights, an attraction for visitors on tour buses.  </P> <P> Eaton Canyon, with its waterfalls and gaping gorges, defines the area's eastern  boundary. Naturalist John Muir daringly inched his way up to the peak that now  bears his name.  </P> <P>  But most Northeast residents take their pleasure in more sedate ways, enjoying  their neighborhood -- and neighbors.  </P> <P> "It's what the world should be," said deli co-owner Lance. "It's integrated,  and people live together nicely."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CLOSEUP: Northeast Altadena  </P> <P> POPULATION  </P> <P> Total: (1990 est.) 7,328  </P> <P> 1980-90 change: +16.9%  </P> <P> Median Age: 39.3  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> Latino: 6.3%  </P> <P> Other: 6.7%  </P> <P> Black: 21.6%  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 65.4%  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $23,441  </P> <P> Median household: $64,762  </P> <P> Average household: $60,063  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> More than $150,000: 2.6%  </P> <P> $100,000-$149,999: 13.1%  </P> <P> $75,000-$99,999: 17.4%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 28.5%  </P> <P> $40,000-49,999: 12.4%  </P> <P> $25,000-39,999: 12.0%  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 14.1%  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Muhammad Abu-Khudayr and Zaki Abu-al-Halawah] </F>   [Excerpts] Jerusalem -- Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the  Palestinian delegation to the bilateral talks in Washington and  head of the elections committee, has stressed that it is not  possible to hold elections for the Palestinian national  authority before total agreement is reached on the interim stage.    In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, 'Urayqat ruled out  the possibility of holding elections for the coming authority  before the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho  and their redeployment in the rest of the occupied territories  and before the Israeli Civil Administration is dissolved.    'Urayqat disclosed that the date for these elections has  been  set for 15 October instead of July. He added: Any snag in the  talks will lead to further delay. [passage omitted]    'Urayqat noted that the elections will be conducted under  the  patronage of the United Nations and the participation of the  European Community, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, Canada,  the United States, Russia, Egypt, and Jordan.    On the cost of these elections, 'Urayqat said: We cannot  itemize the expenses, but we are talking about training and  equipment that might cost more than $44 million.    'Urayqat affirmed that during the talks, the Palestinian  side  proposed that the elected council comprise 100 members and  insisted on this, because that is an internal Palestinian matter  and no one has the right to object to it. [passage omitted]    'Urayqat emphasized that there were no lists of Palestinian  voters and that it was impossible to hold a census before two  years. He said: Therefore, we have officially asked Israel to  hand us the population lists of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip,  and East Jerusalem. Israel has agreed, in principle, to do so.    'Urayqat added: After receiving the lists, we will verify  them. Then election cards will be distributed to everyone in his  own district, including the residents of East Jerusalem who will  participate in the elections both as voters and candidates like  other residents of the occupied territories.    As for the diaspora Palestinians, 'Urayqat said that the  Oslo  accord stipulates that the displaced persons listed in the 1967  census cannot participate in the elections for practical reasons  which will not deprive them of their future status.    In conclusion, 'Urayqat said that the 100 members elected to  the self-rule council will automatically become members of the  Palestine National Council.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 3 (XINHUA) -- China's foreign  exchange markets were generally quiet on the first trading day  today after the decade-old dual-track exchange rate system was  scrapped on January first.    Early in the morning the specialized banks screened the  market rates of renminbi against major foreign currencies --  posted by the central bank, the People's Bank of China.    Smooth trading was reported on China's major foreign  exchange  swap centers. At the Shanghai center, the country's leading  indicator, one U.S. dollar was traded at 8.7 renminbi yuan,  with the total trading volume for the day hitting 16 million  dollars.    That was approximately parallel to the level of the last  trading day of last year, observers here said.    A bank official, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the  specialized banks will mainly adopt the benchmark exchange rates  announced by the central bank before an inter-bank foreign  exchange market is established.    Observers here noted that the exchange markets keeping their  orderly operation demonstrates a good start for the introduction  of a floating market rate. This, to a great extent, has  benefitted from China's progressive reform of its foreign  exchange system over the past few years.    The government has been eager to limit the scope of the use  of the official exchange rate. Up to the end of last year  China's swap centers offered more than 85 percent of the total  foreign exchange needed for the country's imports and exports.    This laid the foundation for the shift toward the new,  market- oriented system.    Meanwhile, as most of the macro-regulatory measures  introduced by the central government over the economy in July  1993 are still in place, and especially as the authorities have  repeatedly pledged to stabilize the exchange rate, the balance  between demand and supply of foreign currencies achieved since  last July will not be changed in the short term.    Steps to protect the vested interests of localities,  enterprises and individuals are considered to be another factor  in helping stabilize the market.    This consideration is crystallized in such measures as  allowing enterprises to use foreign exchange accumulated under  the old system and declaring that foreign exchange certificates  (FEC) can be used for payments with their value unchanged until  they are gradually withdrawn by banks.    However, most experts here agree that it will be some time  before enterprises, the general public and the banks get used to  the unified exchange rate system.    Over the next few weeks or months most of them will probably  take a wait-and-see attitude, and will inevitably adjust their  behavior to the new environment, gradually, the experts assume.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Coffee prices bounced on the London Futures and Options Exchange yesterday, helped by gains in the New York market, where the smaller than expected number of first day notices for physical deliveries against the expiring March position prompted short covering and helped to narrow nearby discounts. But London dealers thought the rally, which took the May robustas position up Dollars 14 to Dollars 863 a tonne, still down Dollars 25 on the week, was likely to be short-lived as plentiful supplies were available. On the London Metal Exchange the slide in aluminium prices was resumed after short-covering prompted an early rally. The cash position closed at Dollars 1,266.50 a tonne, taking the fall on the week to Dollars 30.50 a tonne. Nickel prices rallied in the afternoon but still finished marginally lower on the day. Dealers said the rally, which followed early falls on commission house selling, was encouraged by talk of possible Chinese buying interest. The copper market recovered some of Wednesday's fall and the cash quotation closed Pounds 8 up at Pounds 1,262 a tonne, helped by gains in New York. Dealers said the market seemed poised for another attempt at breaking upside resistance around Dollars 2,230 a tonne for three months metal, about Dollars 2 above yesterday's close.

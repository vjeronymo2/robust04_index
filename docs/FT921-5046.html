			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Britain and US weigh new sanctions against Iraq BRITAIN and the US are exploring a range of new sanctions to take against Iraq, including seizure of frozen overseas assets, if Baghdad fails to comply with United Nations resolutions demanding elimination of its weapons and nuclear programmes. Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, repeated yesterday the Gulf war allies had not ruled out a military strike against Iraqi installations and said 'strong pressure' was building against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The allies are determined that Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime minister, should be left in no doubt during his visit to the UN next week that fresh measures will be taken against Iraq unless it is more forthcoming with details of its weapons and nuclear programmes and more diligent in destroying what UN inspectors in the country find. Although the allies will continue hinting that this might include a military strike, officials stress that every other possible action would be examined before such a course is taken.</p>

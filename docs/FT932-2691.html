			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: SA group bids for Hungary's largest brewer SOUTH AFRICAN Breweries (SAB), South Africa's largest consumer goods company, emerged yesterday as the preferred bidder for Kobanyai Sorgyar, Hungary's largest and oldest brewery. SAB has won the right to exclusive negotiations for four weeks to acquire state-owned Kobanyai Sorgyar, the State Property Agency (SPA), Hungary's privatisation authority, announced yesterday. An SPA decision to name a leading bidder generally determines the outcome of a transaction. Under discussion is a controlling stake - in excess of 75 per cent - in Kobanyai Sorgyar. Privatisation advisers estimate the total value of the transaction at more than Dollars 100m. The planned investment includes the purchase price, a capital injection and the funding of development over five years. The total has surpassed the Hungarian authorities' most optimistic expectations. The sale of Kobanyai is one of the largest Hungarian privatisations so far this year, and if successful, SAB will become the largest South African investor in eastern Europe. SAB is the world's seventh largest brewer, but the planned Hungarian acquisition marks its first significant foray into Europe. The South African brewer's sales are concentrated in the home market, which it dominates, and expansion was until recently hampered by South Africa's international isolation. SAB's 10 breweries manufacture 99 per cent of South Africa's beer and, according to the 1992 annual report, it exports to 47 countries. In the year to March, SAB made attributable profits of R825m (Dollars 258m), of which R541m came from the beer division. Mr Meyer Kahn, SAB chairman, has often stressed that the company understood developing markets, and this was where any offshore activity would be targeted. However, the group continues to be secretive about its offshore activities, saying it is not in the interests of shareholders to divulge details. Kobanyai Sorgyar's market share of about 35 per cent and annual sales of about 3.5m hectolitres make it the largest Hungarian beer producer. The company made Ft296m (Dollars 3.4m) profits after tax in 1992 on revenues of Ft7.6bn. But it was also the most indebted in the sector and technically backward, Hungarian officials say. The identification of a buyer for Kobanyai Sorgyar almost completes the privatisation of Hungary's brewing industry. The SPA is expected within the next two weeks to announce a preferred bidder for another brewer, Pannonia Sorgyar. Of Hungary's seven breweries, Brau of Austria has acquired two, while Interbrew of Belgium, Heineken of the Netherlands and the management of Nagykanizsai Sorgyar have each taken control of one. Investors already present in the market were barred from the tender for Kobanyai.</p>

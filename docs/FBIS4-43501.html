			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`pt'-signed report: "Schulte Calls For Expansion of </F> Decisionmaking Rights"]    [Text] An investments program, a reconstruction program for  eastern Germany, the introduction of a state industrial and  scientific policy, and greater decisionmaking powers are some of  the things Dieter Schulte, new chief of the German Trade Union  Federation [DGB], called for in his inaugural speech.    The government has disregarded the trade unions' earlier  readiness to share the burden of problems, said Schulte. "Now  is the time for the strong to carry more than the weak, now is  the time to finance out of the coffers what has too long been  financed out of the pockets of employees," he said. "The social  sphere cannot be cut any further."    Schulte criticized the Social Democratic Party of Germany's  [SPD] announcement that it would investigate all social  benefits. "I doubt whether it is a good idea for the SPD to seek  agreement with the community of employers. After all, the SPD  needs the votes of employees," he said. He warned the Christian  Democratic Union against letting itself be dragged into a  maelstrom of radical market forces.    Schulte reiterated his call for new rules governing the  management of assets in the eastern laender and for a  reconstruction program for that part of the country. He  demanded an investment program involving economic growth and  increased employment, and priority for public and private  investments. A coordinated state industrial and scientific  policy is a prerequisite for an ecological and economic renewal  of the industrial society, he said.    "To reduce mass unemployment, which the trade unions still  consider to be the cancerous tumor of a modern industrial  society, it is essential to wage an educational campaign to  improve the qualifications of workers and to share available  jobs by shortening working hours," said Schulte. "Part-time  work only stands a chance of success if a return to full-time  work is possible and pensions are guaranteed."    Schulte countered the corporate concepts of lean production  and lean management [preceding five words in English] with a  call for greater voting rights by employees at all levels.  "Employees should have greater rights to reach decisions  concerning working time and conditions," said Schulte.</p>

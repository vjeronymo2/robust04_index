			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Italians win plant order for Belarus FILTECO, an Italian specialist producer of textile machinery, has won a Dollars 125m (Pounds 69m) contract to build a turnkey plant for nylon fibres and carpets in Belarus, part of the former Soviet Union. The contract will raise by 50 per cent the output of nylon fibres at P O Chimvolokno Grodno, the biggest nylon fibres producer in the ex-Soviet Union. The company makes about 40,000 tonnes of nylon fibres a year, for carpets, tyres and other industrial products. Output involved in the first Dollars 26m tranche of the deal is already under way, with payment under a combination of cash and goods. A downpayment has already been made in hard currency, while the balance is to be covered by supplies of Belarus products, to be sold by Filteco. According to Filteco, the goods concerned, principally fertilisers and polymers, have been pre-sold, allowing production for the entire contract to go ahead, and avoiding the need for export credit guarantees from the Italian authorities. Completion of the first tranche is due by July 1993, with the whole project expected to be completed within five years.</p>

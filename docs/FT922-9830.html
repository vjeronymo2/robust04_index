			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Management: How the new-style hard centre was made more digestible There is plenty in Nestle's reorganisation from which other companies can learn, even if at first sight the company appears to its competitors at Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble, Philip Morris and so on to be doing little that is original - 'stepping cautiously into the 1980s', as one wag puts it. Nestle's critics are right that the abandonment of functionalism was well overdue; it survived so long only because it was such an enshrined part of Nestle's custom and practice. In the 1980s Helmut Maucher, the group's redoubtable chairman and chief executive, sometimes appeared to share the exaggerated view of some business academics that really good managers can make almost any structure work. Only in 1989 did he and his top colleagues finally become so frustrated with the old structure that they called in McKinsey, the management consultancy, to advise them how to streamline it. In terms of organisational theory, the previous structure was considerably more complex than the 'one single, clear line of power' that Maucher has always believed in. It was either three- or four-dimensional, depending on how you depict it. A 4-D picture is probably appropriate, given the way in which two headquarters groups (strong functions and weak 'product management') tussled with each other for influence over the organisation's geographic side. The latter, in turn, actually consisted not of one line of power, but of two uneasy partners: regions and countries, which also often tussled with each other. Nestle's new structure is two-dimensional, with the product divisions on one side and, on the other, regional units with much-enhanced influence over the countries. In the context of the food industry, which still needs to be ultra-responsive to differences in local market habits and demands, this change is almost as significant as the more dramatic-looking structural shifts of multinationals in other industries. With a higher proportion of global products than Nestle, ICI, US General Electric and others have felt able recently to abandon their messy two-dimensional matrices in favour of simpler, virtually one-dimensional, structures. In such companies, regional or global businesses now have clear priority (are 'prime', in ICI-speak), while the geographic dimension holds sway only over services and perhaps some aspects of sales and marketing. All the same, there is manifest pressure within Nestle, as at its competitors, to create as many cross-border products as possible. Hence, in part, this spring's nomination for the first time of a chief operating officer to serve immediately under Helmut Maucher, with special responsibility for food.</p>

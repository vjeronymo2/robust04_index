			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Tesco increases offer to win battle for Wm Low Tesco, the UK's second-biggest food retailer, yesterday struck a knock-out blow in the takeover battle for William Low, the Scottish supermarket group, with an increased offer of 360p a share. Tesco's new offer, which values the Scottish chain at Pounds 247.4m, persuaded rival J Sainsbury to pull out of the contest. Sainsbury bid 305p a share last week, valuing Wm Low at Pounds 210m. Tesco's bid yesterday was 60 per cent more than its original bid three weeks ago which valued Wm Low at Pounds 154m, and 18 per cent more than Sainsbury's. Mr James Millar, Wm Low's chairman, said he regretted that the company was losing its independence but was 'delighted' with the value placed on it by Tesco's offer. The board was likely to meet today to vote on a formal recommendation to shareholders. Wm Low's shares ended 23p up at 359p  - having touched 368p before Sainsbury's withdrawal  - more than twice the 169p they stood at before Tesco's original bid. Sainsbury was steady at 419p, but Tesco closed down 5 1/2 p at 237 1/2 p, amid fears of the acquisition's impact on its earnings. Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco chairman, denied Tesco had been pushed into paying too much. He said the acquisition would have a 'negligible impact' on earnings per share in the current year, and a positive impact in future. 'We have looked at this business for a very long time. We are confident we can make a very good return from its stores,' he said. He added that analysts who had suggested a bid above 350p would dilute earnings had underestimated how much Tesco could improve the performance of Wm Low. 'We are very encouraged by the stores we already have in Scotland, which trade above the company average,' he said. Mr David Quarmby, joint managing director of Sainsbury, said Sainsbury's bid of 305p a share had been a 'full and fair offer' and the group was not prepared to go higher even though it still believed it was in the best position to maximise Wm Low's potential. 'We do not believe we could have achieved a return that would be acceptable to Sainsbury's shareholders at (the 360p) price,' he said. He added that the failure of Sainsbury's bid would not affect its plans to build stores in Scotland. It had five stores in the pipeline in addition to four already operating there. Tesco's revised offer is 360p in cash for each Wm Low share, and 169p for each convertible preference share, with a share alternative available. It will assume Pounds 50m of Wm Low's debt. The acquisition will increase Tesco's share of the Scottish market from 7 per cent to 13 per cent. Tesco plans to spend Pounds 35m on refurbishing Wm Low's 57 stores in Scotland and northern England  - operating 45 Scottish stores as Tesco Scotland. Significant job losses are likely among the 300 staff at Wm Low's head office, which will be closed. The takeover is subject to approval from the Office of Fair Trading, and some MPs were yesterday demanding that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission should investigate its effect on the Scottish economy. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said if the MMC was 'not prepared to block the bid, they should be looking for assurances from Tesco that they will continue to purchase at least as much produce as William Low from Scottish suppliers'.

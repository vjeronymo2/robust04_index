			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Investors vent their spleen on Tiphook IT WAS not the easiest of days for Mr Robert Montague, executive chairman of Tiphook, the container leasing group which has in recent months been bearer of huge quantities of grief to its investors. He yesterday obtained the approval of shareholders for an increase in Tiphook's borrowing limits, which the loss-making group needs while it renegotiates new covenants with its bankers. But in spite of confirming that he would split his role with a chief executive, the flamboyant founder of the group discovered that a few shareholders were determined to vent their spleen on the board, which has seen the group's market value drop by 66 per cent since March. The meeting got off to a sticky start when Mr Montague asked if he could take as read the sole resolution before the meeting, which increased the group's borrowing limit to Pounds 1.3bn, equivalent to six times shareholders' funds. One shareholder insisted that the resolution be read out 'because I'm not sure members of this board can tell a million from a trillion'. The task fell to Mr Nicholas Smith, Tiphook's company secretary. Perhaps predictably, he stumbled over the 10-figure number. 'Thank you, sir, you've confirmed my point,' said the shareholder, with grim satisfaction. The chairman's difficulty arose as he said he had been advised by Freshfields, the group's lawyers, that he was restricted in what he could tell the meeting. He could give the shareholders no assurance their stake would not be diluted by any refinancing, nor give any new information about the group's borrowing or trading. The same shareholder berated the chairman for sheltering behind the advice of his lawyers: 'You're throwing stones at us from behind a brick wall.' Mr Montague said it would not be in the interests of either shareholders or the company to give out more information until the resolution had been passed and the support of the bankers secured. But he promised to inform shareholders of any further developments as soon as possible. Another shareholder suggested the board should take large cuts in salary to share the same pain as the shareholders. Mr Montague, who last year earned Pounds 851,000, said directors had promised at last month's agm to take pay cuts.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Swift offers price cuts and rebate Swift, the electronic network owned by 2,000 banks, yesterday responded to growing competition to handle cross-border payments by announcing a 20 per cent rebate for its customers this year, and a 16 per cent price cut for 1994. Swift, which passes payment and settlement messages between banks over an electronic network run from Brussels, said the price cuts would save customers BFr1.5bn next year and reduce the minimum message tariff to BFr6. The price cuts come at the end of a year in which several consortia of banks have disclosed plans to provide customers with cheaper and faster cross-border payments. Visa, the credit card group, is piloting a new system. Mr Leonard Schrank, Swift's chief executive, said it was cutting prices because it faced increasing competition. Mr Schrank said Swift was facing competition not only from some of its member banks but from card companies and European telecommunication companies. 'We will not be the lowest cost producer, but we will lower,' he said. Swift was founded in 1973 to transfer to an electronic network standard bank transactions which had been carried out by telex and other methods until then. It comprises both a data network, and a standard method of communicating. The number of electronic messages carried by Swift this year rose by 12 per cent, partly because of the turbulence in currency markets. The network provides foreign exchange matching and netting among settlement services. Some competitors have argued that Swift charges too much for data transfer because its cost base is excessive. The network employs 1,100 people in 93 countries. Among the systems now competing to transfer small payments across borders is Ibos, the system run by Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander, Credit Commercial de France and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal.</p>

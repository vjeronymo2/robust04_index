According to reliable  information, it seems that the war option chosen by Alija  Izetbegovic has no support among the Muslim population in that  part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have learned from reliable  sources that the Center of Security Services has done an  analysis of the political and military situation in the area,  concluding that the process of making Tesanj independent  following the model of west Bosnia and Velika Kladusa is under  way. The analysis, made by Semsudin Mehmedovic, coordinator of  the Center of Security Services, has warned the authorities in  Sarajevo that the appearance of "a new Fikret Abdic" was  possible in the Tesanj area. Semsudin Mehmedovic and his  Security Service, naturally, blame the Croats for this process.  However, things are much simpler.    Namely, the War Presidency of the Municipal Assembly of  Tesanj refused to carry out the order of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency concerning the unconditional placing of all HVO  [Croatian Defense Council] units active in the areas controlled  by Muslim political and military forces under the command of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. The War Presidency of the Tesanj  commune issued the following statement:    "On the territory of Usora and Tesanj the Croats and Muslims  have fought against the same enemy since the beginning of the  war. The result of this fighting is fully defended territory.  So far there have been no conflicts between our two peoples.  The Presidency believes that these relations should remain the  same in the future, since that is the only guarantee and token  for the survival of both peoples in this area.... The civilian  and military bodies, as well as members of both peoples consider  the implementation of the decision of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency pointless. Any attempt to implement this decision by  force would result in conflict with incalculable consequences  for the population, and probably in the loss of the free  territory, which has been defended at the cost of a great number  of lives. With all due respect for the importance and possible  consequences of the decision of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, the War Presidency of the Tesanj commune has decided  not to implement the decision on this territory..."    Therefore, the matter simply concerns the fact that the  political leadership of the Tesanj commune believes that the HVO  and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army troops should continue to work  together, but that an integration of the HVO in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army would be politically and militarily  inopportune.    In the analysis made by the Center of Security Services and  signed by Semsudin Mehmedovic, this decision of the War  Presidency is being interpreted as a subversive activity --  carried out primarily by the Croats, but also by some military  and political structures of the so-called Serb republic.  Mehmedovic does not substantiate such statements in the  analysis, but instead merely provides a catalogue of accusations.    Ekrem Ajanovic, regional representative in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, also joined the action of  disrupting the unity of the Muslims and Croats in the Tesanj  area and the surrounding territory. On the basis of the alleged  approval of Alija Izetbegovic, he formed a committee for  negotiations between the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs, but this  committee submitted to the Center of Security Services a list of  Croats to be arrested, and if this was not possible, killed.  They were HVO representatives who, from October to December,  participated in political negotiations between Muslims, Croats,  and Serbs in this area. The result of all this is the absurd  situation in which the Tesanj area is being defended by joint  forces of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, while they  are continuously being attacked by Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units  that want to implement Alija Izetbegovic's fundamentalist  policies. All efforts to create disunity between the Muslims  and Croats living in the Tesanj area have, fortunately, been  unsuccessful. Evidently there is an increasing number of  Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina who realize how damaging Alija  Izetbegovic's policies are, and who want to do everything to end  the war as soon as possible, along with the Croats, and continue  to live in peace and understanding.</p>

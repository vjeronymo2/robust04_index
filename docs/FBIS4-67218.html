			<p>Proposal   <F P=102>   94WD0315A Copenhagen BERLINGSKE AFTEN in Danish 18-24 Mar 94  p 5 </F>  <F P=103> 94WD0315A </F> <F P=104>  Copenhagen BERLINGSKE AFTEN </F> <F P=105>  Danish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Egon Balsby: "Political Compromise and No Money: </F> Drug Initiative--Same Old Stuff"]    [Excerpts] This is compromise at its lowest common  denominator!    That is the vein in which the government's recently  announced  drug law proposal was received. Three ministers labored months  to produce an initiative that had been expected to supersede the  present failed drug policy.    But: "It is hardly a revolution, closer to an expansion of  the previous approach," said Per Kalund, chairman of the County  Council Association. Even so, he is willing to go along with it  because the counties will play a central role in the new  structure. Among other things, they will supervise the whole  methadone treatment program.    In contrast, the Physicians' Association was very critical  of  the plan. Chairman Torben Pedersen pointed out the plan's  inadequate economic basis:    "It is clear from the proposal that the government does not  have any intention of allocating the necessary funding for an  approach that could improve the lot of drug addicts."    Instead, the government has tossed the ball to the counties  and local government. The most concrete item in the proposal is  a change in the law that guarantees that the district in which a  drug addict resides will pay a portion of the treatment when the  county deems treatment is necessary.    "All things being equal, a change in the law could  facilitate  an expansion of treatment programs and ensure more uniform  treatment throughout the country," said Kalund.    He stressed, however, that an expansion of this kind would  necessarily require additional financing, either through an  increased general appropriation or higher county and local taxes.    But the government intends for the improvements to be made  without an increase in public expenditure. [passage omitted]    According to the proposal, the problems drug addicts  experience will be solved by expanding overnight shelter  facilities. These have been drastically cut in recent years, but  now they will be tried again.    At the same time, it is suggested that local authorities set  up cooperative-type living arrangements along with various types  of day centers that would offer addicts support on a daily basis.    Otherwise, both the goals and the methods for combating the  ongoing battle against drugs is virtually identical to the  present policy.    The government would like to step up prevention through new  informational campaigns. The proposal also stresses the  necessity for more intensive research in this field.    It is the government's basic intention to aim at prevention  and treatment at the expense of law enforcement. Nevertheless it  is clear from the proposal that police activity will be  maintained at its present level. This means that the police will  continue to rake in the major share of the resources available  to drug abatement programs.    The numerous objections to police crackdown policy  verbalized  by prominent Danish experts such as High Court Judge Hans Henrik  Brydsensholt, Public Prosecutor Erik Merlung, as well as by a  number of other thoughtful people, did not in the end make the  slightest dent in the politicians' mind-set. The proposal backed  off from any consideration of liberalization.    The proposal states this very clearly: "No spokesman for  legalization has been able to present a cohesive and viable  alternative to the present law enforcement policy. To the  contrary, there are solid arguments for rejecting this  alternative." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENURE AND 'DEADWOOD' AT UC  </P> <P> Bravo for a splendid analysis of teaching and research in our two university  systems ("UC Tenure: A Forest of Deadwood," Opinion, Aug. 13, by Jack Miles).  Having taught at both San Diego State University and UCLA, I know that your  facts are right and I concur wholeheartedly in your evaluation of the problem,  except that I do not think that we need to refer to teachers who do not publish  as deadwood. the attack should not be directed towards them. Not everyone is  capable of lifelong research and most of us accept the benefits of our  situation. The fault lies with the university administration, which tolerates  this use of taxpayers' money.  </P> <P> In 1974, I and a colleague at SDSU got a California law enacted that required  that comparative data on the money spent per student in the UC and CSUC systems  be presented to legislators. Before that, the striking difference in funding  had been obscured by accounting techniques. Unfortunately, the passage of the  law coincided with a downturn in funding. Moreover, Chancellor Glenn Dumke had  no taste for fighting for his students. Disparities exist not only in the  teaching load of the faculty but also in the counseling benefits for students.  At that time the San Diego Union ran a story about a straight-A student at SDSU  who was not accepted at a single medical school. Their reporter discovered that  the student had had no help preparing his medical school applications while  UCSD students 10 miles North of him not only got counseling on how to take the  exams, but could participate in mock interviews as well.  </P> <P> Again, my congratulations to you for a splendid article.  </P> <P> JOYCE APPLEBY  </P> <P> Professor of History, UCLA  </P></p>

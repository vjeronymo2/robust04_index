			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Export agency 'overpaid Pounds 83m' in debt recoveries The Export Credits Guarantee Department, the UK export credit insurance agency, has overpaid exporters by Pounds 83m since 1975, says a report by the National Audit Office. News of the report emerged in a written reply by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to a parliamentary question. Mr Heseltine said the government did not intend to recover these overpayments 'given the complexity of this issue and the difficulty and cost of establishing the case for recovering these excess payments'. The overpayments, discovered in a review of the department's information technology systems, were due to the different treatment of supplier credit insurance policies - which insure UK exporters against non-payment by overseas purchasers - by the ECGD's London and Cardiff offices. Both offices issued policies insuring between 90 per cent and 95 per cent of any loss but often paying a lower percentage of any loss, as claims were paid after deductions for expenses saved. There were differences, however, in the way recoveries made by the ECGD from the original debtors were allocated to policyholders. While the London office retained the full 90 per cent to 95 per cent of any recovery, the Cardiff office allocated recoveries to policyholders in the ratio in which the exporter and the department had borne the original loss. 'On that basis Cardiff had paid out moneys to policyholders in excess of their contractual entitlement,' says the report. Recoveries will now be allocated according to the stricter criteria. The report has prompted criticism from the Labour party. Mr Stuart Bell, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said Mr Heseltine had had to make a judgment 'between the interests of the taxpayer and the exporter'.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Main supporters of British athletics withdraw sponsorship A run for their money: Dairy Crest and McVities, two of the main supporters of British athletics, have withdrawn from sponsorship within weeks of each other, Bethan Hutton writes. Dairy Crest said it was delighted with the increase in public awareness it had achieved through athletics sponsorship - with its name appearing on such famous chests as that of sprinter Linford Christie, above. The decision was made because of the recession and a change in marketing objectives. McVities cited the same reasons for its withdrawal. A third big sponsor, ParcelForce, withdrew last year. Tony Ward, an official of the British Athletic Federation, said: 'The recession has finally caught up with us.' However, he added that a new three-year sponsorship package with TSB, the banking group, had recently been agreed while others were due to be announced soon. Mr Ian Muir, Institute of Sports Sponsorship chairman, said companies were becoming more professional about sponsorship and seeking to meet specific marketing objectives.</p>

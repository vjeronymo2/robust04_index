			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Czech church expects no miracles in talks AS THE Czech Roman Catholic Church prepares to open talks with the government on the restitution of property nationalised by the Communists after 1948, Father Miloslav Fiala is optimistic. 'I think we will find an acceptable compromise,' he says. But after four decades of communism, Fr Fiala, spokesman for the Czech Episcopal Conference, evidently does not expect miracles in the negotiations later this month on the return of its former earthly goods. 'Opposition (to restitution) has been relatively strong, and we must be prepared for a compromise,' says Fr Fiala. 'The Church has to realise that it will not obtain all the properties nationalised in 1948.' The amount of property involved is considerable, with land representing about 1 per cent of all land in the Czech Republic. Some politicians have suggested the Church is being greedy in wanting all the land back, and they say restitution should be limited to what is needed for the Church's liturgical activities. Before the Communists took over in 1948 the Catholic Church owned about 169,000 ha of forests, 46,000 ha of agricultural land, 1,000ha of rivers, lakes and reservoirs, 1,419 ha of gardens and parks, and 3,024 buildings, including educational facilities and workshops. No one knows the property's value at today's prices, though some estimates suggest it could be worth Kcs 60bn (Dollars 2bn). Prague's cathedral is still in state hands. Although the churches themselves fell under state control, they were not formally nationalised. In 1991 the Church won back some monasteries. Fr Fiala says opposition to full restitution, which was the Church's original objective, has come not only from left-wing politicians and parties, but also from within the liberal parties established after the 1989 revolution that ended communism. The issue has divided the four-party government coalition led by the liberal free-market Civic Democratic party (ODS). The ODS wants to limit restitution to property directly held by the state, and excluding commercial interests. Fr Fiala argues the church must have an income to exist and to do its work. 'We have practically nothing,' he says, apart from revenue from educational activities, proceeds from small parcels of land returned to monasteries in 1990-91, and support from religious orders abroad. Income from forestry alone could provide about Kcs50m - Kcs70m annually. Last week, Prague Archbishop Miloslav Vlk said restitution of Church property was not 'the most important reason why the Church is here'. The Church had been without property for 40 years and could continue that way if necessary, but the property would ensure its independence and enable it to fulfil its 'special role' in society.</p>

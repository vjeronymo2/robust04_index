It is once again violence of a  political-ethnic character. The 13 members of the National  Security Council who have just been appointed by the Burundian  head of state, Cyprien Ntaryamira, have a lot to do. Gerard  Furazima reports from Bujumbura.    [Begin Furazima recording] Three people have died in the  area  of Nyakabiga. This is the toll of the tragedy which took place  in the evening of 14 March when a group of still unidentified  people launched a grenade attack on a house at about 0100. The  house caught fire and was still burning early this morning. The  fire brigade managed to extinguish the fire, but there was  extensive damage.    This violence of a political-ethnic character has produced  victims among the Hutu majority ethnic group as well as the  Tutsi minority. The phenomenon of ethnicization of popular  areas like Kamenge and Kinama in the north of the capital, which  are invaded day after day by Hutu looters, is increasing. To  the south, Nyakabiga and Musaga are more and more inhabited by  Tutsis. Fear and insecurity prevail within the remaining  families in all these areas where their respective ethnic group  members become scarce.    A grenade thrown last night in a bar in Musaga in the south  of the capital resulted in one person seriously wounded. In any  case, the 13 members of the National Security Council, just  appointed by President Cyprien Ntaryamira today, have a lot to  do. Will they manage to stop the diabolical spiral of violence  in Burundi since the murder on 21 October 1993 of Mr. Melchior  Ndadaye, the democratically elected president? This is a great  challenge for them. [end recording]</p>

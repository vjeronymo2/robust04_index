			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Vote dispute threatens EU expansion The European Union's planned move from 12 to 16 member states faced collapse last night, as a result of the British and Spanish refusal to countenance any dilution of their voting rights in an expanded Europe. Talks at foreign minister level broke up in disarray in Brussels, although the hard bargaining will resume next Tuesday. While the EU states were deadlocked on voting rights, they were however within an ace of agreeing with Norway on its entry terms. Sweden, Finland and Austria concluded their membership negotiations with the EU last week. But none of the four newcomers can join by January 1995, as planned, unless the voting rights issue is cleared - along with other hurdles such as referendums in the applicant countries. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany which has emerged as the main champion of the EU enlargement, blamed the UK for the impasse on votes. He also warned Spain that Germany would block an increase in EU aid for southern member states after 1995 if Madrid rejected Norway's entry because Oslo would not allow it to catch more cod in Norwegian waters. German and Dutch officials warned that prospects for EU enlargement were slipping away. The European Parliament has to decide by tomorrow whether to proceed with its approval of terms for newcomers to join. It has said it will not approve enlargement if the British and Spanish line on votes triumphs. Senior EU officials were vitriolic about the UK government. They accused it of mollifying anti-European factions in the Conservative party even though it said EU enlargement was at the top of its European agenda. 'They want to reintroduce the (national) veto by the back door,' one EU ambassador said. Britain and Spain insist on retaining the existing 23 votes needed to block EU legislation - currently out of 76 votes distributed among the 12 member states roughly according to their size. Their partners want to shift the 'blocking minority' to 27 votes, to maintain the same percentage formula in a Europe of 16 sharing 90 votes. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, proposed a compromise of moving to 27, plus a committee to study vote distribution before the EU's constitutional review in 1996. The committee would consider British, Spanish, Italian and German wishes for a closer link between votes and population size. A senior British official said: 'I can assure you there will be no settlement except on British terms.' Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, said: 'If there is no solution to this problem, we will not unfortunately be able to celebrate what we all want - enlargement.' Amid this test of negotiating nerve, the EU and Norway looked close to resolving the difficulty over Spanish insistence on recovering 'historic rights' to 7,000 tonnes of Norwegian cod in the face of Oslo's refusal to concede a single extra fish. A Commission formula, which both Madrid and Oslo were prepared to consider, in effect recycles fish quotas Norway conceded when it joined the European Economic Area free trade zone.

These activities should be designed to increase the reach, effectiveness, and impact of HIV prevention efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This announcement continues the HIV/AIDS prevention collaboration between CDC and national organizations that was initiated in 1989 under Announcement 904, Cooperative Agreements for National Organizations and Consortiums to Develop and Implement Effective AIDS Information, Education, and Programs among Constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A cooperative agreement is a legal agreement between CDC and the recipient in which CDC provides financial and other assistance to, and has significant Federal programmatic involvement with, the recipient throughout the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Nation's HIV/AIDS prevention efforts to succeed, they must be focused on preventing and reducing behaviors that place individuals at risk for HIV infection. Among the significant behavioral objectives necessary for preventing HIV transmission, CDC has adopted the following three related to sexual behavior:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Young people who are not engaging in any form of sexual activity will maintain this behavior.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sexually active people who use condoms consistently and correctly or are in a relationship with a mutually faithful relationship with an uninfected partner will maintain these behaviors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sexually active people who are not in a mutually faithful relationship with an uninfected partner will refrain from sexual activity, choose nonpenetrative sex, or use condoms consistently and correctly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These objectives cannot be met without the understanding, participation, and support of key sectors of the American public. Coordination, collaboration, and communication between and among all sectors are crucial for successful HIV prevention. These sectors include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Public <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  (e.g., health, social services, and education agencies);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Voluntary <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  (e.g., civic, social, health and health services, and youth-serving organizations that deliver education and community services to the public);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Professional and academic, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  the health communications/behavioral and social science and social marketing disciplines that must provide a scientific basis for developing, implementing, refining, and evaluating HIV prevention efforts to ensure effective, behavior-focused HIV interventions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Religious;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

These include the Prevention Marketing Initiative (PMI) and the Business and Labor Workplace HIV/AIDS Programs. Specific information regarding these two initiatives is included within the application package. To support these and other initiatives there is a need to build the capacity of the sectors addressed in this program announcement to strengthen HIV prevention efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CDC has a number of other HIV-related grant programs. This cooperative agreement targeting national organizations is intended to complement these other programs and to include organizations essential for the development of a comprehensive national HIV prevention program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.

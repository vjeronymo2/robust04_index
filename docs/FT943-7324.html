			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Post office closure claims rejected The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters yesterday denied that government plans to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce to the private sector would lead inevitably to the closure of many post offices. Mr Colin Baker, the federation's general secretary, said that there was 'no evidence whatsoever' that the sale would result in widespread closures. His statement came as the Labour party released the results of a survey of 500 of the country's 19,000 local postmasters and postmistresses. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the people who ran post office branches believed by a majority of five to one that the government would be wrong to break up the organisation. By a majority of three to one they thought privatisation would force more small post offices to close, he said. Mr Baker said the federation was concerned about 'blatant scaremongering stories of massive sub-office closures' and felt it vital that such rumours should be scotched. But he acknowledged that the organisation, which represents Britain's sub-postmasters and postmistresses, had concerns about separating the parts of the system. He said there were still 'many questions' to be answered arising from this year's government green paper, relating particularly to automation and the future size of the post office network. Mr Cook said that post office users did not want to see the organisation sold off as a private business. Referring to a tour he had made recently of British post offices, he said he had not met such universal hostility to a government plan since the poll tax. In an attempt to engender misgivings about the government's proposals among Conservative MPs nursing shaky majorities, he said opposition was 'as strong in Tory Kent as in Labour Tyneside'. Mr John Roberts, chairman of Post Office Counters, said that the post offices network was not at risk, adding that the Post Office warmly welcomed the government's pledge that the link between a privatised Royal Mail and post offices would be guaranteed in law.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Russia may cut tax to curb vodka deaths Russian officials are debating whether to reduce excise duties on domestic vodka as part of an attempt to curb consumption of bootleg products and low-quality imports which are believed to be responsible for a sharp rise in deaths from alcohol poisoning. According to industry representatives, domestic vodka producers have experienced a 'catastrophic decline' in sales this year as their products had been undercut by cheaper imports, especially from Germany and Poland, and bootlegged alcohol, which evades taxes. Fashionable high-quality western vodkas, such as Absolut and Smirnoff, have also captured market share, and sales of these would also be hit if a change to the duty system favours local producers. The government is considering raising tariffs on imported liquors, as well as imposing quotas on alcohol imports from other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States - although this would run against the grain of recent trade talks. Domestic vodka producers have called for a reduction in excise duty from 85 per cent to 75 per cent following a cut from 90 per cent earlier this year. They argue that this would produce higher sales of legally produced liquor, reducing the death rate from poisoning and increasing the government's overall tax revenue. However, such a move would stimulate concerns about total levels of alcohol consumption. A report from the health ministry, presented yesterday to ministers at a meeting of the commission on economic problems, estimated the death rate from alcohol had almost doubled in a year. The commission discussed means of tackling the problem - including lowering excise duties to encourage drinkers to buy safer liquor from approved producers - and promised to produce concrete solutions within 10 days. But the finance ministry expressed anxiety that a lowering of excise duties would damage budget revenues from alcohol, which account for a significant proportion of the government's income. According to health ministry figures, an average of seven to eight people per 100,000 died from alcoholic poisoning between 1986-89. That had risen sharply to 18 per 100,000 by 1992 but climbed to 37 per 100,000 in the first half of 1994. In some regions in the northern territories the death rate has been more than one in 1,000 this year. The government is likely to order a crackdown on illegal manufacturers which are producing lethal ethylene-based liquor. The government commission heard that one illegal still in the Sverdlovsk region had produced 5m decalitres of dangerous moonshine.</p>

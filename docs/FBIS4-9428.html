			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Djordje Milosevic] </F>   [Text] Moscow, April 26 (TANJUG) -- After quite a few  sharp, unexpected and contradictory statements, Moscow has  finally agreed to what it has until recently energetically  opposed -- to a use of force in the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The turnabout which many found quite unexpected, came to  light in a statement by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev last  Saturday. He described the NATO threat of air strikes against  the Bosnian Serbs as an adequate response at the United Nations'  request. Kozyrev condemned the Serbs, using the words that would  be used by Washington, Bonn, some Arab capitals or people  showing open resentment towards the Serbs.    Less than a day before, his view was completely different.  It was then that he told reporters that the NATO decision to  launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions might prompt  the conflict to escalate.    He said that the NATO military option was not the best  solution. He added that the air strikes decision would clash  even with the broadest interpretation of the U.N. resolution and  could alter the character of U.N. operations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The following day Kozyrev's statements were different  altogether. All of a sudden, NATO air strikes were utterly in  keeping with the U.N. resolution and did not change the  character of U.N. operations.    Political and diplomatic inconsistency had begun earlier,  when Kozyrev's deputy Vitaliy Churkin at Moscow airport raised  an outrageous hue and cry against the Serb side alone. He made  no mention of the Moslem share of the blame, to which he had  often referred in the past.    Moscow analysts believe that NATO air strikes against  Bosnian  Serb positions should have been announced first and then given  the green light.    There is a difference in views between Russia's army and  political-diplomatic leadership. Defence Minister Pavel Grachev  at a press conference in Moscow has said that he simply cannot  unilaterally blame the Serb side for the difficult situation  around Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia.    "We have at our disposal complete information on the  situation in this region of the former Yugoslavia," Grachev  said, obviously making it clear that the information possessed  by the army leadership differed from that launched daily to  serve the interests of the world power wielders. Grachev  qualified NATO and U.N. decision as imprudent and maintained  that the air strikes should be abandoned.    A sudden swerve in Russia's diplomacy is followed by a  well-orchestrated campaign to bring Russia in line with the West  regarding the Bosnian conflict.    Analysts say that the situation now was the same as two  years  ago when Russia had done its best to make the imposition of the  sanctions against Yugoslavia seen as absolutely justified.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 8 Feb -- A UNIAN correspondent has learned  that new proposals regarding the division of the Black Sea Fleet  have been prepared at Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. Compared  to previous plans for resolving this issue, as well as the  "sale" of the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet to decrease  Kiev's debt for energy-carriers and granting the Russian side  rights to a long- term lease of the Sevastopol naval base and  virtually all of the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure, these  proposals envisage Russian laws in force on the territory, which  is leased. The proposals have been prepared for the meeting  between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia, which Boris  Yeltsin requested of Leonid Kravchuk in a personal letter on 15  January 1994.</p>

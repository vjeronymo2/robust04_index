			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / 3i rebels poised to seek a stronger voice DIRECTORS of companies from all over the UK will attend a meeting in Birmingham today to set up a national club for clients of 3i, the venture capital company owned by the Bank of England and the clearing banks. About 100 people are expected to attend. The group, consisting of some of the 4,000 companies in 3i's investment portfolio, is seeking a stronger voice in the organisation. The originators of the club, Mr John Garrod, founder, chairman and managing director of Tyne and Wear-based engineering company Rite-Vent, and Mr Roy Stabler, his financial director, are concerned that the planned flotation of 3i may mean the long-term interests of its customers are sacrificed. 'It's a battle between the interests of shareholders' short-termism and the pace at which the soul and heart, their customers, want to run their businesses', says Mr Garrod. Yesterday it became clear that Rite-Vent is involved in a legal dispute with 3i. It issued a writ last year against now-defunct 3i Consultants, claiming damages and alleging negligence as result of work carried out in the mid 1980s. 3i said yesterday it did not feel Rite-Vent was the right sponsor for the club because of the legal proceedings. A request from Mr Alan Wheatley, chairman of 3i, for two 3i representatives and a secretary to be admitted to the meeting was refused. Mr Garrod also declined Mr Wheatley's request to send him the letters he has received from 3i customers in response to the club proposal. Mr Garrod says 250 of the 300 received from 1,000 companies contacted support the club's formation, and a number express dissatisfaction with 3i. If today's meeting agrees to the club's creation, it will then decide its objectives. Proposals include a place on the 3i board, an ombudsman and complaints clearing house and a generous share-purchase scheme for existing clients when the flotation of 3i goes ahead. The flotation was postponed earlier this year, and was expected to have a market capitalisation of up to Pounds 1.2bn. 3i, which has no formal representation for client companies, says it believes its branch network already provides good communications. It adds that if companies wish to form a club it is happy to co-operate.</p>

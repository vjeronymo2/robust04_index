			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Stefan Hrcka: "Deputies `On Strike' Again; </F> Parliament Passed Environmental Impact Assessment Law"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--As on 28 April, yesterday  opposition deputies went "on strike" again and boycotted the  vote on supplementing the Slovak Television Council. Because  even some coalition deputies were not present in parliament, the  legislative body did not have a quorum. Ludovit Cernak (National  Democratic Party-New Alternative), who chaired the session,  therefore declared yesterday's third day of the 30th meeting of  the National Council of the Slovak Republic closed at noon,  shortly after 1200.    At the outset of yesterday's session, before 0930, the  deputies started discussing the government-sponsored draft law  on environmental impact assessment, which has been in  preparation for over two years. In putting forward the bill,  Minister of Environment Juraj Hrasko stressed that it is fully  compatible with comparable legislation in member countries of  the European Union and other economically advanced countries of  the world. [passage omitted] Parliament approved the bill with  the proviso that it will go into effect on 1 July 1994. [passage  omitted]    The National Council then approved, for the second time, the  amendment to the law on arbitration proceedings in international  trade relations and the execution of arbitration decisions,  which had been returned to parliament by the president. The  amendment, which will go into effect on 1 June 1994, changes the  name of the law and extends its applicability to domestic trade,  as well. The deputies then elected Frantisek Javorsky  (Christian Democratic Movement) as member of the special  parliamentary body for supervising the activity of the Slovak  Information Service. (He replaces Ladislav Pittner, who has  become the minister of the interior.) Parliament also  acknowledged the resignation of Peter Papan from the Slovak  Television Council. A secret vote was held, in which parliament  was to elect three new members of the Slovak Television Council  to replace members who resigned. The vote was invalid, however,  because only 65 deputies participated in it and not the required  50 percent plus one majority of deputies. [passage omitted]  Ludovit Cernak therefore declared the deliberations closed. He  also said that parliament did not have a quorum because deputies  for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak  National Party did not present themselves, even though they were  present. The parliament meeting will continue on Wednesday [4  May].</p>

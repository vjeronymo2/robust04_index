Max Baucus, Democratic chairman of the  Senate Subcommittee on International Trade, and John Danforth,  the ranking Republican on the panel, jointly submitted  legislation to seek a permanent revival of the so-called "Super  301" trade law.    While seeking legislation to revive the "Super 301" measure  on a permanent basis, Baucus also urged President Bill Clinton  to enforce "Super 301" by presidential order.    "It is time for the United States to demonstrate the courage  to back its convictions with action," Baucus said in a statement.    The "Super 301" provision requires the administration to  annually identify the most closed foreign markets and impose  trade sanctions if negotiations do not resolve the problem.  First enacted in 1988, the original "Super 301" provision  expired in 1990.    The Clinton administration has expressed support for the  "Super 301" measure.    White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Tuesday the  Clinton administration is "still reviewing options" to cope with  the collapsed framework trade talks with Japan, including  possible reinstatement of the Super 301 trade authority.    Clinton failed to resolve the trade dispute with Japan at a  summit meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in  Washington on February 11.    The Japanese Government is working on a fresh package of  market-opening measures which officials in Tokyo hope will ease  the strain in bilateral trade ties with the U.S.    Some Japanese diplomats in Washington, however, appear  skeptical whether the trade measures contemplated in Tokyo,  including deregulation and import promotion, would be  far-reaching enough to satisfy U.S. demands. "I don't think it  is sufficient," a Japanese diplomatic source said.    The source said the U.S. seems determined to set "objective  criteria" to monitor progress in the openness of the Japanese  market.    The Japanese Government has rejected the U.S. demands as  equivalent to "numerical targets" for boosting U.S. market  shares in Japan.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Aer Lingus losses top IPounds 190m MR Bernie Cahill, chairman of Aer Lingus, Ireland's troubled state-run airline, described the past year as the 'most traumatic in its 57-year history' in announcing a pre-tax loss of IPounds 190.7m (Pounds 183m) yesterday. The losses for the year to March 31 underline the urgent need for the group to implement its rescue plan  - stalled in negotiations with trade unions  - if the airline is to survive. The previous year's pre-tax loss was limited to IPounds 3.1m. On turnover of IPounds 817m, Aer Lingus suffered underlying operating losses of IPounds 22.9m, in the core air transport division, compared with a loss of IPounds 16.2m in 1991-92. Exceptional charges totalled IPounds 143.6m, made up of IPounds 99.8m restructuring costs and IPounds 43.9m to cover the total write-off of the airline's shareholding in GPA, the Shannon-based aircraft leasing company. Mr Cahill said that the scale of the trading losses coupled with the weakening of the balance sheet 'raised serious questions about the future of the group'. Gearing at the end of March stood at 533 per cent, up from 109 per cent two years ago. As net debt is IPounds 540m, this implies the group has shareholders' funds of only some IPounds 100m. The company is losing about IPounds 1.2m per week and is seeking to cut IPounds 50m from annual operating costs of about IPounds 600m. Management and unions, however, have been unable to agree on either the nature or the scale of the restructuring plan. The Irish Labour Relations Commission is acting as arbitrator, but if agreement is not reached by October 31, the company has said it will proceed anyway. A voluntary redundancy scheme to shed 1,280 of the 5,500 workforce has attracted only 900 acceptances. The company has said that only 314 of these can be released without serious changes in working practices, describing this issue as central. A proposed equity injection of IPounds 175m by the government  - and EC approval of it  - is conditional on a viable rescue plan being implemented. Without the capital injection, it is unlikely that the airline's bankers will be willing to extend further credit.</p>

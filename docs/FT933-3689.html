			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: The shanty town fundamentalists - Hamas and other groups will lead Palestinian objections to Arafat's pact with Israel A SEA of bobbing girls wearing white embroidered Jahabs - Islamic head scarves - pours into the pot-holed, sewage-ridden streets of Khan Younis, a dirty shanty town in the Gaza Strip. In the midday heat, beneath their blue and white striped uniforms, the schoolgirls wear dark trousers down to their ankles. They are the only picturesque sight in the dreary and impoverished town, a stronghold of Islamic fundamentalist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad which reject peace with Israel and could violently threaten the peace agreement to be signed in Washington today. Although it is impossible to estimate accurately their strength, experts say Islamic fundamentalists and supporters of other Palestinian organisations which reject the agreement command support among about 40 per cent of Gaza's 780,000 residents. Their support in the West Bank is estimated at 20-25 per cent. Their emotional nationalistic rhetoric, appeal to Islamic conviction and considerable potential for violence present the Palestine Liberation Organisation, poised to take control of Gaza, with a formidable challenge. Much will depend on how the PLO and, more important, Mr Yassir Arafat's Fatah faction deal with the rejections on assuming power. Any crackdown on Islamic fundamentalist dissent will raise the prospect of serious inter- Palestinian conflict. Graffiti staining almost all the walls of Khan Younis proclaims solidarity with the martyrs of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrilla movement in Lebanon and claims credit for the deaths of Israeli soldiers in the occupied territories. The residents of Khan Younis are also proud that theirs is the home town of Mr Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, the leader of the 415 Islamic activists deported by Israel to Lebanon last December. Over the years Gaza has become a deeply Islamic society. It is rare to see a woman in the street who is not covered head to toe. Alcohol is strictly prohibited. Smoking in public is frowned on. Most Gazans say they are proud to live a life based on the strict principles of the Koran. Of all the 'rejectionist groups' opposed to the peace agreement, the strongest is the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, an acronym which literally means zeal. Az a-Din al-Kassam, Hamas' poorly equipped military wing, is named after a Palestinian martyr who launched a Jihad - holy war - against British imperialism and Jewish settlement in Palestine in the 1930s. Hamas' charter calls for the annihilation of the Jewish state by armed struggle, the liberation of the entire Islamic lands of Palestine and the establishment of an Islamic state based on Sharia Koranic law. Since the announcement of the peace agreement Hamas, a secretive underground organisation, has strongly condemned the accord, saying it falls far short of Palestinian demands for statehood, a right of return for Palestinian refugees and control over occupied Arab east Jerusalem - site of the Dome of the Rock mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine. Their leaflets accuse Mr Arafat of 'conniving with the Zionist enemy in a conspiracy' against the Palestinian people. They have mounted demonstrations across the West Bank and Gaza Strip but so far they have ruled out violence against the PLO or the possibility of civil war. 'The youth want to fight but it is not the policy of Hamas,' says a lecturer at the Islamic University of Gaza. 'There will not be a civil war among Palestinian because for now we accept dialogue and democracy. The leadership will make the decisions according to Sharia and the soldiers of Hamas will follow instructions.' Hamas is waiting to see how the agreement will be implemented and received. The Islamic Jihad movement in Palestine, closely aligned to Hamas, has gone further. Mr Fatehi Shukaki, its exiled commander, said last week the accord was 'against the Koran, against Islamic law. . . We will continue our struggle through intifada (Palestinian uprising), through armed struggle and through other means.' Other rejectionist groups have called for Mr Arafat's head. Hamas has been growing in strength over the past decade - thriving in Gaza's impoverished refugee camps and among youths discontented with corruption in the PLO exiled leadership and with lack of progress in the peace talks. At first the organisation was tolerated by Israel as a counterweight to Fatah, but was later banned and went underground. It has drawn its greatest support from a programme of Islamic education and welfare run by its social wing, the Islamic Society. This distributes alms to the poor and runs nine kindergartens. Mr Mash Harawi, who works at the Islamic society school in Nassir, is proud of the school's Islamic programme. 'There is an Islamic solution to everything. The Koran is the message to man to solve all his problems,' he says, standing in front of a painting which shows the Koran rising above Mecca, Medina, the Dome of the Rock and a pile of Bibles and Jewish Torahs. Children learn reading, writing and Islam. Behind the school is an Islamic court, equipped with a wooden gavel, where a panel of Islamic scholars, lawyers and community leaders hear and resolve family problems and disputes over inheritance and commerce. Despite Hamas' welfare programme Fatah has kept political control, winning large majorities in elections to professional associations. The only body controlled by Hamas is the Islamic University association. Many Hamas leaders know they have a lot to lose by confronting Fatah. Without a strong Arab country behind them, it would be difficult to mount a united challenge. They are also strongly wedded to the democratic principles embedded in many Islamic fundamentalist movements. Mr Abdul-Rahman Hamad, one of the most senior Fatah leaders in Gaza, says: 'We will not use force against Hamas and they will either lose their support or participate in elections, which means they accept the agreement.' If Mr Hamad is right Hamas, like the Moslem Brotherhood in Egypt, could emerge as an acceptable political party. However, if Fatah hardliners pursue threats to repress Hamas, a violent backlash will be inevitable. 'If Fatah decides to act like the Algerian regime and suppress dissent there will be violent conflict,' says Mr Martin Klaimer, an expert on Islamic fundamentalism at Tel Aviv University. 'But the conditions are not there for full-scale civil war. It will more likely take the form of clashes and assassinations.'</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> CITY REVENUES FALL $712,000 FOR YEAR  </P> <P> City revenues in Oxnard are down $712,000 this year because the city is  receiving less money from motor vehicle registration fees, hotel taxes and  fines to drunk drivers, according to a quarterly budget review.  </P> <P> But city officials said the shortfall is such a small percentage of the  $59-million city budget that the city will not be forced to make any spending  cuts.  </P> <P> Most of the shortfall will be made up by budget savings over the past nine  months.  </P> <P> Aside from the revenue shortfall, expenditures and revenues are close to their  expected targets, said Management and Budget Director Bill Mayer. "It's a good  sign," he said.  </P> <P> The budget review report, which covers July 1, 1989, to March 1, 1990, will be  discussed by the City Council today. The city now has $4.2 million in budget  reserves.  </P> <P> Next year's budget outlook, which is set for adoption by the end of June, is  less optimistic. City Manager David Mora has warned that if the voters do not  adopt a 5% utility users tax on June 5, the city will have to consider $2.7  million in budget cuts.  </P> <P> Among the cuts being considered are the elimination of police and firefighter  positions and the closure of a youth boxing center, a museum, a library and a  day camp.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] leader, said in Maputo today that there was a  suggestion to train half the number of troops for the future  Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, FADM, instead of the 30,000 men  stipulated in the Rome Accord.    The Renamo leader said he had discussed the matter with  President Joaquim Chissano this morning. The two men discussed  the peace process, among other things. Dhlakama backed the  idea, saying that so far not even a quarter of the men have been  trained yet because there are neither good conditions in  training camps nor financing.    Dhlakama said that countries like Italy had offered to make  available instructors, military equipment, and financing, as  well as to rehabilitate the training camps, but approval of the  idea will depend on the technical proposals to be advanced by  government and Renamo generals.</p>

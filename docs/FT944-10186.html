			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Highlands Gold shares worth ADollars 38m sold Stockbroker County NatWest said it had completed transactions totalling 28m shares, or 5 per cent, in Papua New Guinea gold miner Highlands Gold at ADollars 1.38 a share, Reuter reports from Sydney. The broker would not, however, disclose the buyer or the seller of the Highlands shares, which were worth ADollars 38.64m (USDollars 29.2m). MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals group which owns 65 per cent of Highlands, said it was not behind the transaction. MIM has sold most of its equity investments over the past 12 months as part of a strategy of putting all assets under review. Highlands shares closed 3 cents lower at ADollars 1.45, on a turnover of 29.03m, on the Australian Stock Exchange.</p>

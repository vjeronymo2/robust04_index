			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Leading Article: London's forum IT IS easy to be gloomy about Britain's capital city. Long-term indicators of stress persist: rising crime, homelessness, deficient public transport and poor state schools are the most obvious. To them, the recession has added the echoing canyons of the property crash and a pervasive shabbiness. The sunnier side of the street is that as the UK economy revives, London is more competitive. Lower office rents mean fewer corporate emigrants to the regions; the capital's long population slide has been arrested. It may be too much to hope for a revival of manufacturing, but London's service economy, in finance, telecommunications, air transport, tourism, culture, the media and other 'knowledge' industries, has every chance to prosper. One aim of London Forum, the government-initiated, business-led body launched yesterday, is to draw attention to this more optimistic aspect. It will focus upon the twin tasks of attracting more visitors and more investment to London, working closely with London First, a business-led agency set up last year to think strategically about that which London Forum will promote. Anyone with a stake in London will wish these two bodies well. If they can think clearly and express themselves effectively, they will deserve to influence policy. What they cannot alter is the fact that London lacks a strategic tier of government, save that conducted behind closed doors in Whitehall. Although the government has raised the profile of its London policymaking, notably by installing a minister for London transport, the running fiasco of the capital's attempts to define and prioritise transport infrastructure plans, from the Channel Tunnel link to CrossRail, scarcely commends it as a model of effective, let alone open, governance. The danger is that a government unwilling to think strategically itself is sponsoring one overlapping business-led agency after another, a route which can only lead to frustration and mutual recrimination. For example, if London Forum is to lead the way on inward investment, what is the role of London's nine Training and Enterprise Councils, which certainly think they have that role? But then, Tecs were the government's bright business 'partnership' idea of distant 1990.</p>

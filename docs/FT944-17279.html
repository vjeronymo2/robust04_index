			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Brazil's left-wing presidential candidate brushes off defeat Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, defeated in Brazil's presidential elections on Monday, yesterday said his left-wing Workers Party (PT) had been strengthened by the election and would continue its push for greater social reforms. 'We may have lost the election, but we have not lost our task,' he said. Mr da Silva appears to have been easily defeated in the presidential race by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former finance minister and social democrat politician. With more than half the votes counted, Mr Cardoso has 54 per cent compared to Mr da Silva's 26 per cent. Mr Cardoso claimed victory on Thursday but Mr da Silva said he would not formally admit defeat until all the votes are counted, not likely before next week. Mr da Silva, a former metalworker who has helped turn the PT into Latin America's biggest left-wing political party, said he had not yet decided about his own future. This is his second defeat in presidential elections and, although only 47, it is unclear whether he wants to compete again. Despite Mr da Silva's defeat, the PT has done well in separate elections for governors and Congress. The party is likely to elect its first state governor in the state of Espirito Santo and the party's number of senators could increase from 1 to at least 4. Some politicians have called for a broad alliance of parties to support Mr Cardoso and tackle Brazil's economic and social problems. But Mr da Silva said he thought 'personally it is very difficult' for the PT to co-operate since Mr Cardoso was already allied with right-wing forces opposed to the PT. The PT also called for a reform of the media, which strongly backed Mr Cardoso. Mr da Silva said groups like Mr Roberto Marinho's Globo, which controls Brazil's biggest TV broadcaster as well as newspapers and radio stations, were too powerful.</p>

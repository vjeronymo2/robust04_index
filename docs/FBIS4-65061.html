			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "Bosnia: Toward a Ministerial Meeting </F> on Friday"]    [Text] Luxembourg, 9 May (BELGA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher convened a high-level meeting for Friday [13  May] in Geneva of the study group on the former Yugoslavia,  which includes the United States, Russia, the United Nations,  and the European Union (EU), Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques  Poos announced Monday in Luxembourg.    According to Willy Claes, his Belgian counterpart, it seems  that this meeting is to be held at the ministerial level in  order to study action to be taken in the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Mr. Poos, who made a statement at the end of a Council of  Ministers meeting of the Western European Union (WEU), hoped  that this meeting would revive the negotiations and contribute  to "defining a common position among the United States, Russia,  and the EU" to "reduce to nothing the hopes" of those who aim to  profit from the division of the international community to make  territorial gains, a clear reference to the Bosnian Serbs.    According to Mr. Claes, the EU should be represented in  Geneva by its troika (the past, present, and future presidents  of the Council of Ministers, namely Belgium, Greece, and  Germany) and by the two countries which have permanent seats in  the UN Security Council (namely France and Great Britain).    While emphasizing that the main parties involved in the  Yugoslav conflict had to demonstrate their political will to  jointly reach a cease-fire, "an essential condition for a peace  agreement," Mr. Claes had questions about the goals and the  final outcome of this meeting.    Cautiously making a number of carefully phrased remarks  regarding the meeting, Mr. Claes did not rule out its lasting  until Saturday, if necessary, to include a meeting of the  countries which are providing troops for the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Japanese trust bank to close two overseas offices NIPPON Trust Bank, a medium-sized Japanese trust bank, is to close its representative offices in New York and London later this year. It will be the first Japanese bank to fold its international network, a move which could prompt similar decisions by other banks. In sharp contrast to the Japanese banks' aggressive international expansion of the late 1980s, they have refocused on their domestic market. The banks now favour business with established Japanese blue chip companies rather than overseas groups. While the banks are burdened with increasing bad loans caused by sharp falls in the Japanese stock and property markets, they have been slow to respond to hard times - unlike the Japanese brokers which have implemented rationalisation programmes. Leading brokers, such as Nomura and Daiwa, are reshuffling their overseas operations, while smaller houses, such as Takagi Securities and Kaisei Securities, have withdrawn from overseas operations.</p>

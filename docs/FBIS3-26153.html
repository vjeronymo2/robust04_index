What are the advantages of  implementing the new taxation system? How great an impact will  it have on foreign-funded enterprises? With all these questions  in mind, I interviewed Xu Yongfu, senior researcher in the  economic research department of the Bank of China's Hong Kong  and Macao Management Office.  <H5>  The Two Old Taxation Systems Have Their Own Shortcomings </H5>   Xu Yongfu said that in the past, China implemented "one  country, two taxation systems." That is, speaking in terms of  circulation tax, for foreign-funded enterprises a unified  industrial and commercial tax was levied; and for enterprises  set up with domestic funds, since 1984, a number of taxes such  as value added tax [VAT], product tax, and business tax have  been levied, leading to different tax burdens on foreign-funded  and domestic-funded enterprises. The abovementioned two  taxation systems have their own shortcomings. For example, the  unified industrial and commercial tax was implemented as early  as 1958. At that time, the enterprises' productive ability and  technological levels were relatively low and, although the tax  included 108 tax items and 141 tax rates, it still failed to  include many commodities. In particular, since China began to  import foreign funds in large amounts, many new commodities  could not be found among the tax items, to the extent that some  special rules had to be established for them but this lacked  adequate legal basis. As for the VAT which is levied on  domestic-funded enterprises, it is levied only in the production  domain and not in others; this is not in accordance with the  prevailing international practice and is not conducive to the  mass and professional style of social production. Nor is it  adapted to the adjustment of investment structure and the needs  of economic development.  <H3>  The New Taxation System Will Not Have a Great Impact on  Foreign- Funded Enterprises </H3>   "Implementation of the new circulation tax seems to have  some  effect on foreign-funded enterprises but actually the effect  will not be great," Xu Yongfu explained. The old unified  industrial and commercial tax had a tax rate ranging from 1.5 to  69 percent, generally it was 5 to 10 percent, whereas within the  new circulation tax, the tax rate for a majority of tax items  falling into VAT is 17 percent; the tax rate of consumption tax  ranges from 3 to 45 percent; and the tax rate of business tax  ranges from 3 to 5 percent. Judged superficially, the new  taxation system will cause some foreign-funded enterprises to  pay additional taxes. However, in reality, after the  implementation of the new taxation system in China, the overall  revenue will not increase but, in concrete terms, different  enterprises will experience different conditions.    Xu Yongfu thought that within the new taxation system, the  business tax will not have a great impact on foreign-funded  enterprises and that the consumption tax is mainly targeted on  expensive consumer goods, which in the past were also subject to  a higher tax rate under the unified industrial and commercial  tax. Therefore the impact will not be great. What will be  affected most perhaps will be VAT.  <H3>  VAT Has a Direct Bearing on the Tax Burdens on  Foreign-Funded Enterprises </H3>   Xu Yongfu said that the ratio of effect on the tax burdens  on  foreign-funded enterprises caused by VAT which is within the new  circulation tax, is 40:30:30, that is, 40 percent of these  enterprises will see their tax burdens remain unchanged, 30  percent of them will experience an increase, and 30 percent will  have a decrease.    He said that the unified industrial and commercial tax which  was collected from foreign-funded enterprises in the past, was  levied on various links such as imports, production, and sales  and the tax collection method was to take the tax-included price  as the tax base and this increased the tax burden. Although VAT  under the new taxation system is also levied on various links,  the tax levied on a former link can be calculated with relation  to VAT on a latter link for a reduction. Therefore, under the  unified industrial and commercial tax, even if a certain  enterprise enjoys a tax rate which is lower than 17 percent, due  to taxes levied on various links, the tax burden on the  enterprise might be higher than the 17 percent relating to VAT.  <H5>  It Can Help China To Rejoin GATT </H5>   Xu Yongfu said that the purpose of standardizing the  circulation tax for foreign-funded and domestic-funded  enterprises in China is to conform to the prevailing  international practice.    He said that GATT demands its signatories give  foreign-funded  enterprises the treatment enjoyed by their citizens and this  includes duties and rights. In the area of duties,  foreign-funded enterprises must shoulder tax burdens identical  to the ones shouldered by domestic-funded enterprises; in the  area of rights, restrictions on the business of foreign-funded  enterprises must be lifted, step by step, and more opportunities  must be provided for them. For example, we restricted  foreign-funded banks from operating renminbi business in the  past and one of the reasons was that the tax burdens on  foreign-funded and domestic-funded banks were different.    Xu Yongfu pointed out that, in general, implementation of  the  new system of circulation tax in China will not cause a heavier  tax burden on foreign-funded enterprises. On the contrary, VAT  stipulates that all the exports are free from tax and this will  lighten the tax load of the foreign firms which have set up  factories on the mainland. He also stressed that China will  implement the new company tax regulations this year but this is  mainly to standardize the income tax rates for enterprises of  different nature in the country and will not affect the  preferential tax policy enjoyed by foreign-funded enterprises.  Inside the special economic zones and the development zones,  foreign firms will still be able to enjoy the preferential 15  percent income tax policy as well as the favorable "two waivers  and three reductions" which they have enjoyed up to now.</p>

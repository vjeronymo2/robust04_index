			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 7/6/1994 -- "The visit of the  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel to the districts densely  inhabited by Gagauzians to learn about the economic, social, and  political problems of the south of the republic will not affect  the relations of cooperation and friendship between the Gagauz  republic and the Moldovan Dniester republic established  according a bilateral agreement," stated Stepan Topal, president  of the self-proclaimed Gagauz republic, at a press conference  held last evening in Comrat. "Though the political situation of  Gagauzia and Dniester differ, we will maintain the relations  with this region and with all countries that support us. While  the major states promote a large policy, we, Gagauzians, accept  the foreign support and have the chance to develop strongly in  the next 5-10 years. To prosper, Gagauzians need a  sociopolitical stability in the region, which we hope will be  achieved in the near future with the adoption by the Moldovan  Parliament of the spectral juridical status." Referring to the  $35 million credit offered by Turkey to Moldova, Topal said that  there already exist concrete projects for its utilization. It  is stipulated that $32 million will be allocated for water  supply to the southern districts of Moldova, and the remaining  $3 million for the creation of the respective infrastructure.  Referring to Suleyman Demirel's opinion on the Gagauz problem,  Stepan Topal stated that: "The President of Turkey has  emphasized that this is a Moldovan internal affair. Suleyman  Demirel is satisfied with the fact that his visit to Moldova  laid the foundation to the settlement of this problem."  According to Topal, Comrat is absolutely sure of the fact that  "Turkey considers Gagauzia a means of penetrating the markets of  Moldova, the Ukraine and Russia."</p>

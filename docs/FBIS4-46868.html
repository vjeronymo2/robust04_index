Pakhomov is quoted in UKRAYINA MOLODA]    [Text] Yuriy Mykolayovych, our State has entered the  next stage of its transformation. This time this stage is  related to elections of the new Parliament which, one hopes,  will approve a new Government, and the latter will be pulling  the reform cart further. However, who these people will be and  whereto they will be pulling is a problem with a lot of  unknowns. At least one does not want the cart to be pulled in  all directions, which has been the case so far, so as a result  the cart has been oscillating rather than moving. But apparently  the blessed moment has arrived when one can "stop and look back"  to understand where we have found ourselves and where we are  going.    - First of all I would like to say that everything is going  as planned.    - ?..    - Well, this is a special plan that no particular person  approved, but according to the plan everything is happening as  irreversibly as a certain plant grows out of a certain seed and  a different plant grows out of a different seed. January 1,  1992, the Rubicon had been crossed, and objectively inherent  processes began unwinding...    - In other words, you mean price liberalization.    - Yes, and as far as the implementation of this project is  concerned I cannot even give the garland to anybody in Ukraine  or in the CIS. And not because the project had no adherents.  Quite the opposite, it hardly had any opponents. And those who  understood that the project was ruinous to Ukraine were more  realistic than Don Quixote and did not take to fighting  windmills. The more so that the "windmills" were portraying  these folks almost as enemies of the people or at best as  conservatives. And as far as the project we have been  implementing in recent years - one cannot even call it an  International Monetary Fund project. It is a version of one of  IMF directions. This model has its peculiarities. It was  developed for certain debtor countries in Latin America -  countries that don't have a highly developed industry, science  and education. Then big capital buys up their mineral resources  and land, and rapid development begins. The land's wealth slips  away, while financing -somebody else's capital - comes in. And  the country is surely, if not for good, trapped in debt bondage,  and the people become impoverished. Still, in undeveloped  countries this model has rather limited capability of  destruction, moreover, there is development, albeit one-sided.  But the story is different when such a model is thrown over a  country with a highly developed technical basis and high  scientific potential - the model's destructive force increases  substantially and yields terrible results. Liberalization, which  the model envisages as the most important task, begets  wide-scale inflation and with it the reign of momentary and loss  of strategic interest. Science, state-of-the-art technology,  basic education - they are all rejected as unnecessary and are  rapidly destroyed. This especially happens in countries where  the State sector rules and the production and technological  space is deformed.    The main thing is the model has not brought prosperity to  any  country that adopted it. They are all debtors, all of them  experience, one way or another, recession and lose their  education and S&amp;T potential (if any).    There is an entire history of countries' resistance to this  model. In particular, Japan has blossomed not due to but in  spite of this model. Southeast Asia countries, South Korea,  Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, and now Malaysia also  have rejected this model. And at the time so did the post-WWII  Europe. Unlike us, the maximalists, the 1917 people ("we will  burn to the ground, and then..."), the wise Europe did not allow  price liberalization for 10 to 15 years. The free market pricing  mechanism only began working as the necessary conditions were  being created, first of all mastering and widening the range of  competitiveness of their industrial and agricultural products,  although under the Common Market conditions new restrictions on  all of this were imposed. A prominent reformer Erhard (FRG) had  started not only with a monetary reform, but also with  directives. Acting a "Soviet way" he renewed severed contacts  and by directives forced economic mechanisms to spin. There was  planning there - at a macroeconomic level. And only when  everything had been spinning did the economy begin transition to  the market regulation mode, and only then were prices freed up.    By the way, in Japan almost until recently rice had been  distributed on a plan basis. Price liberalization began in 1984.  And this was accompanied by strict regulation and monopolization  of major industries. Powerful corporations, with the State  standing above them like a cat above a mouse. This is how they  had shot forth - under State protection, by concentration of  effort and prevention of chaos.    One of Ukraine's, as well as Russia's, peculiarities is an  ugly structural and production space. Prices and the entire  financial mechanism had been "fitted" to this ugliness and  deformed accordingly. The balance demanded correction, but via  technical modernization rather than via prices. And as far as  "freeing up" prices, under those conditions these measures,  being just the start, could only produce an explosive effect and  ruin the economy. First one should have evened out the  proportion of heavy and light industries, of MIC  [military-industrial complex] and "civil" sectors (the MIC is an  immovable rock that can wreck any reform). One should have  gotten rid of multiple production structures which included  everything - from archaic structures of the late 19th century to  supermodern technologies the world did not even suspect existed.  In other words, our economic structure first should have had to  undergo internal transformation through pre-market structural  changes, whereas the freeing up of prices resulted in paralysis  of the economy. Hence the crisis of payments, clots, the  recession, barter and other distortions.    And now we cannot do what we could and should have done  before. There can be a way out, but one must use different  methods - surgical ones.    - It was not our initiative to start price  liberalization. So did we have a choice and was the Government  able to actually correct anything under these conditions?    - The foundation for adopting this destructive for us model  had been laid as early as during the M.S. Gorbachev time. It is  then that the criminogenic revolution had begun and economic  power shifted from the State to a legalized shadow economy. It  is then that the wave of liberal market euphoria had risen, and  the people were told to expect a miracle from completely  unlimited economic freedom. Ideas of statehood and its decisive  role in the transition to market were rejected. Instead of ideas  of State renewal and market transformations slogans "The less of  the State the better" were reigning. And we finally had found  ourselves in a wild stream of market chaos. This was not a  confession of modernity but rather of the passing archaic  market. And those who looked innovative were in essence  conservatives. Because the modern market is an integral  combination of market and State forces.    - So what is one to do now - loose heart? "Don't waste  your effort, buddy..."?    - Well, first of all every wild stream has an end. But, as  long as it is carrying us, the faster the better. And the more  market mechanisms we adapt for the economy the better hope there  is that the necessary critical mass will be created in  individual places. But there are things that have to be subdued.  For instance, prices in the production sector will not stabilize  on their own - they depend on technological skewness. Their  explosive movement is not leading to an emergence of motives for  improving the situation in the economy.    At present prices in the consumer sphere have been stopped  using a purely monetary method. But at what price? No credit had  been extended, so no payments were made - and prices stopped.    - Are you against monetary methods?    - I am against excessive reliance on them. Besides, their  action here is fairly limited to the consumption sphere while  the sources of inflation are in production. There is a certain  hierarchy of tasks and methodology for achieving them. Here is  an example. First of all one must stop hyperinflation. And not  in the consumption sphere but in the huge ocean of State  facilities where expenses are increasing unceasingly, taking  prices with them. Nothing can be done here by using direct  regulation and command economy methods.    It is necessary to form a new type of self-organization that  would combine market centralism and market self-regulation.  Market centralism is not just a certain action by the State.  This is also centralization using financial institutions, as  well as regulation of the economy on the part of transnational  companies, industrial-financial groups, syndicates, corporations  etc., which, by using their internal mechanisms and because of  complex hierarchy and synchronous interaction, affect processes  of price stabilization along complex technological chains.    I have no doubt that in the end the very mechanisms of  market  centralization combined with market self-regulation will  facilitate successful implementation of those individual  anti-inflation measures that at present under the market chaos  conditions have no effect.    - So who will personify this strong authority? The  President? The Verkhovna Rada? The Prime Minister?    - He who controls executive structures. If it is the  Cabinet,  then not a pocket-size one but a Cabinet that has complete  authority to tame the situation.    - Similar to the authority Kuchma had a year ago?    - Maybe even greater.    - And an Erhard-like person at the helm?    - The further down we fall the more chances there are such a  person will emerge. Despair always begets new ideas and new  leaders. So far there has been mainly demand for populists and  destroyers... Among the creators of the new way there was no  strong reformer, both in terms of ideas and strong character, as  well as experience. I especially regret that we did not "recall"  from Moscow Yuriy Yaremenko of Ukrainian extraction. As far as I  am concerned he had no match within the former Union. Even  Shatalin, a whimsical egoist, even he considered him a  first-class figure of unattainable stature.    - So how should such a person act?    - First alternate centralist economic and purely market  decrees on inflation quenching measures.    Then the long-term mechanism of gradual straightening of  structural and technological deformations and transition to  market regulation comes into action. I would also like to  caution our reformers against their belief that free prices will  regulate everything by themselves. This too is ancient archaism  and ignorance. At work in the world are mechanisms of market  decentralization that cover entire industries and industry  complexes. General Motors, as well as well-known German  companies are multi-industry structures that include thousands  of enterprises. Within chains of technological links, each  depending on another, everybody who is ahead holds in check the  trend to increase prices exhibited by the one who is ahead of  him [per original]. This is how mutual regulation works.  Competition, as well as a fight for profits are concentrated at  end points of long technological chains. There are companies  that represent industries of the entire world, not just of their  countries. In these companies competition works in the end  product at the world scene.    - What do you think: will we have our house in order in  about ten years?    - It will happen sooner. What is destined to rise will rise  as if it has been leavened. World capital immediately supports a  rising country. It becomes extremely profitable for investment.  We should only take the right steps.</p>

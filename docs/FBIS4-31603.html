			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by E.M.: "Who Invests in Poland and How?"] </F>   [Text] Toward the end of 1992, the number of joint ventures  registered in Poland exceeded 10,000. Of this total, 5,740  provided financial reports, meaning that they actually operated.  In reality, however, that number was higher because companies  with fewer than five employees are exempt from the duty of  reporting. The sum total of the capital invested amounted to  $1.4 billion, compared with $490 million toward the end of 1991.    The foreign investors are led by the Americans, who invested  altogether $933 million by the end of 1992, mostly in the form  of large investments averaging $23 million per company, as  compared with an average of $246,000 per company for foreign  investments as a whole. Next to the Americans were Italian  investors ($270 million total), followed by transnational  corporations and international financial institutions, and,  last, by investors from Germany, Austria, the Netherlands,  France, Great Britain, Sweden, and Belgium.    The Italians led in boldness of investment projects--their  investment plans envisage an additional $1 billion. The  Americans, too, plan to invest about $1 billion. Eighty percent  of all foreign investments in Poland derive from the 10  countries named above. Noteworthy is the unusually low level of  investment by Japanese companies in Poland.    In the subsector structure of foreign investments,  industrial  enterprises rank foremost, accounting for 64 percent of all  capital invested; they were followed by trade (17 percent),  transportation (3.7 percent), and construction (3.2 percent). In  1992, the proportion of foreign investments in transportation  and construction decreased, but in trade it increased.  Approximately $400 million in foreign capital has been invested  in the electrical-machinery industry.    As in the case of the countries of origin of capital  investment, the geographical distribution of investment sites is  markedly uneven. Most investments are concentrated in seven or  eight voivodships, chiefly in the Warsaw (30 percent), Poznan,  Gdansk, Szczecin, Katowice, Koszalin, and Torun voivodships. In  comparison, the proportion of investments in such [eastern]  voivodships as Tarnobrzeg, Chelm, Zamosc, Przemysl, Krosno, and  many others was negligible.    Such are some of the data provided in the fourth regular  report of the Institute for Business Cycles and Foreign Trade  Prices (IKC), authored by Dr. J. Biskup and Dr. W. Burzynski.  According to them, that report deals with only some aspects of  the situation in 1993 owing to the absence of the data needed  for a comprehensive analysis of the operations of joint  ventures. Such an analysis will be presented in the next report,  to be published this coming summer. In comparison with its  previous issues, the report presented does, however, contain  some new elements. It is a compendium of data on all of the  major foreign companies operating in Poland and, in its final  part, presents figures on the growth of direct foreign  investments in the world and their role in the world economy.  This serves to evaluate the significance of foreign capital to  the growth of the Polish economy against a broader background.    The IKC report discusses in some detail the laws governing  foreign investments and specifies the legal acts concerned,  which can be of practical importance to potential investors. It  also contains many specific data on the operations and financial  status of companies. The aggregate value of the projects  launched by joint ventures amounted to somewhat more than 4  trillion zlotys [Z]. Investments worth more than Z20 billion  each were undertaken by 53 companies,those worth Z10-20 billion  each by 43 companies, and those of less than Z500 million by 792  companies. As much as 79 percent of the companies engaged in no  investment projects at all. Joint ventures contracted in 1992  bank loans totaling Z21.6 trillion, or nearly four times as much  as in 1991. Of that total, more than half were in the form of  foreign credits. The overall sales volume of these companies  exceeded Z145 trillion, with the domestic market accounting for  most (72 percent) of the sales. Exports accounted for 26  percent. Industrial enterprises handled 70 percent of the sales  of their own products and services, followed by construction  enterprises, with 6.4 percent, and transportation and trading  enterprises, with 4.4. percent.    In 1992, joint ventures employed altogether 230,000  people--i.e., about 2 percent of total employment in Poland. A  year previously they had employed fewer than 120,000 people.    The Ministry of Internal Affairs considered 1,126 requests  from foreigners for the purchase of real estate, of which it  approved 876 (including 518 requests from physical persons) and  declined 112. In Warsaw Voivodship, 64 hectares of land were  sold to foreigners, in Szczecin Voivodship 39, in Poznan  Voivodship 29, in Tarnow Voivodship 19, in the Nowy Sad and  Zielona Gora voivodships 18 each, in Opole Voivodship 15, and in  the Wroclaw and Katowice voivodships 11 each.    Particularly interesting aspects of the report concern the  findings of studies of the incentives and disincentives for  foreign companies as regards investing in Poland. The biggest  incentive for investing is the prospects for economic growth and  the size of the market. Another consideration is the agreements  concluded by Poland concerning the establishment of free-trade  zones. On the other hand, foreign investors ascribed relatively  little importance to the evolving political situation in this  country. (However, following the recent elections [in which the  postcommunists won] and in view of the ongoing political  donnybrook, this may change.)    It turns out that bureaucratic barriers are probably the  strongest disincentive for investing in our country. Civil  servants often simply shy away from making final decisions. In  addition, the quality of our managerial personnel elicits doubt.  Other negative considerations include the underdevelopment of  the economic infrastructure, the frequent revisions of the tax  system, and the fatal--in the eyes of foreign  entrepreneurs--tariff policy.</p>

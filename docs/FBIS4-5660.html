			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 KYODO -- Japanese local  governments' international contributions are mainly oriented to  Asian countries in such fields as technical assistance and  trainee programs, a Home Affairs Ministry survey revealed  Wednesday [13 April].    The survey was conducted last fall on Japan's 47 prefectures  and the 12 ordinance-designated cities.    Of the 59 local governments surveyed, nine said they are  "very active" and another 40 said they are "active" in  contributing abroad, ministry officials said.    Among types of contribution under consideration, 51 local  governments said acceptance of trainees takes priority and 44  respondents said dispatch of experts has precedence, the  officials said.    Financial assistance and material aid had only low  priorities, they said.    Allowing for plural answers, a total of 85 local governments  cited Asia as the region they want to help, they said. Of  these, 40 respondents would make contributions to their sister  cities, 26 to regions needing technical know-how, 20 to areas  where there are many residents of Japanese origin and 28 to  China, they said.    About fields where local governments can make contributions,  46 said agricultural techniques, 41 said industrial techniques  and 37 said health and welfare, they said. Other responses  included fishery techniques, forestry techniques and prevention  of pollution.    Nineteen local governments said they have some knowledge of  what foreign countries need but 39 respondents said they have  insufficient knowledge.    Thirty-one said the purpose of such contributions is to  activate the prefecture or the city, 25 to contribute to world  peace and 12 to educate staff, they said.</p>

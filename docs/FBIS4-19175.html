			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl  referred to the increasing importance of the United Nations in  peacekeeping and the solution of conflicts in the world in a  talk with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today.  Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel announced in Bonn this  evening that the two sides agreed that efforts to solve the  conflicts in the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia must be  resolutely continued.    Kohl and Butrus-Ghali assessed the recent UN-sponsored NATO  operations against Serb positions in Bosnia as "necessary" and  "appropriate." These were in accordance with the relevant UN  Security Council resolution. The two sides spoke in favor of  energetically continuing the peace process with the inclusion of  the United States and Russia.    Kohl underlined Germany's readiness to assume responsibility  in the United Nations as a permanent member of the Security  Council in the future. Ghali confirmed that the transfer of the  UN volunteer program to Bonn is envisaged as the first step.  Kohl underlined the German Government's offer to have other UN  bodies located in Bonn.    Eberhard Brecht, deputy foreign policy spokesman for the  Social Democratic Party [SPD], admitted in a statement that  Germany is still "not up to the international community's  expectations of our country." The Social Democrats share the UN  secretary general's view that Germany's commitment to the United  Nations still does not match its performance in the various  political spheres. The SPD supports the demand made of the  German Government by Butrus-Ghali for "a high level of  commitment in all the organization's activities," Brecht said.</p>

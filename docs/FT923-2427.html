			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Calor depressed by reorganisation costs THE MILDER weather and restructuring costs were blamed by Calor Group, the bottled gas company, for a 65 per cent fall in profits for the half-year to June 30. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 32.7m) were struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 6m) to cover redundancies and the write down of stock. The number of employees was reduced by another 800 to some 2,200. Several board changes are to take place at the behest of SHV, the biggest shareholder. The Dutch investment company owns 46.2 per cent of the stock. Mr Folkert Schukken is to relinquish his role as chief executive on January 1 in favour of Mr Howard Robinson, currently managing director of Calor Gas. Mr Schukken is to oversee SHV's world-wide liquefied petroleum gas operations; he will remain on Calor's board as non-executive deputy chairman. In the longer term, Mr Michael Davies, chairman, expects to relinquish that post in favour of one of SHV's board members. Mr Alistair Pate, finance director, said: 'The moves underline SHV's de facto control and their intent to get legal control as soon as possible.' Sales fell by 23 per cent to Pounds 165m (Pounds 214m) because of reduced tonnage of gas supplied and lower selling prices. Group operating profit fell to Pounds 27m (Pounds 40.1m). Mr Hamish Macpherson, treasurer, said that while the core gas business performed satisfactorily, costs associated with the development of new businesses rose substantially. The air separation businesses suffered operating losses of Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 300,000) associated with technical and marketing costs. Pam Gas, the joint venture with SHV, lost Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 200,000) reflecting start-up management costs. Borrowings stand at Pounds 15m and are expected to rise to about Pounds 20m by the end of the year. Earnings per share fell from 13.3p to 4.1p. The interim dividend is maintained at 6p.</p>

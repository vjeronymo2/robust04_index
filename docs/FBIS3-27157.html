"We have accepted to reorganize our country into different  units now in order to try and make a comprise," Silajdzic said  during a photo session before talking with U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher.    For his part, Christopher said they would discuss the  "reasonable requirements of Bosnia for a settlement that would  get international approval, international acceptance."    Silajdzic praised the NATO ultimatum because "it restores  the  balance of powers in Bosnia."    "We believe that after this NATO ultimatum, nothing will be  the same in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said. "Where there is  balance of powers, there is peace."    Washington has been sympathetic to the Bosnian Government,  which is mainly comprised of Muslims, as the grieved side in the  22-month bloody war in the former Yugoslav republic that left up  to 40,000 people dead.    Russia, another major player in the Bosnian peace process,  is  pressuring Washington to exert its influence with the Muslims to  accept a peace settlement.    However, Christopher emphasized, Washington "continues to  feel that there should be no coercion on Bosnia, that we will  not impose a settlement on them."    While praising Russia's contribution to the Bosnian Serbs'  agreement to move away or put under UN control of all their  heavy weapons in Sarajevo, Christopher repeated his belief that  it was mainly the NATO ultimatum that did the trick.    "The principal responsibility for the good results achieved  in Sarajevo has to be attributed to the resolve and  determination of NATO," Christopher said.    Silajdzic will stay in Washington until Friday [25 February]  before leaving for New York. He would also meet with  congressional leaders in the coming days.</p>

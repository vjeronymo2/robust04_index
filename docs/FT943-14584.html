			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Gatt caught in Congress crossfire - A look at the threat to US ratification of Uruguay Round It is hard to tell friend from foe as months of back-biting have eroded the bipartisan majority in Congress which has long supported liberalised trade. When an agreement was struck among the members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last December, there seemed to be few hindrances to its approval in the US this year, beyond a busy congressional schedule. There was then no hint of the highly charged partisanship and the soaring level of distrust that now surrounds the question. The test comes today as legislation approving the Uruguay Round deal gets its first inspection today in the key House Ways and Means committee. The perception that President Bill Clinton stumbled at the Group of Seven meeting in Naples, where his plan for further trade negotiations was rejected, has fuelled Republican hopes of gains in the House of Representatives in the elections in November. The administration has been scrambling for months to find the Dollars 13bn or Dollars 14bn needed for passage. Although most economists say the deal will stimulate business and ultimately increase tax revenues, arcane and controversial budget rules require that either new fees be imposed or programmes cut to compensate for the expected loss in tariff revenue over the next five years. Congress can waive the budget rules and in ordinary times would. Current posturing has Republicans such as Minority whip Newt Gingrich calling for a waiver and insisting that no new taxes would be acceptable. Democrats, uneasy about presidential vulnerability and fearing that support of a waiver would make them subject to charges of big spending, have come up with a number of funding proposals, all of which have been demolished by lobbyists representing the various interest groups. Senator Pat Moynihan, chairman of the Senate Finance committee, fumed on the Senate floor earlier this week, accusing fellow Democrats at the White House of 'leaks, distortions and innuendos'. The focus of his ire was a line which appeared in the Wall Street Journal saying that White House aides were worried that Congress would not have time 'to get to the world trade pact this year'. It was the administration which had failed to submit a funding proposal, the senator said. It was the administration which encumbered the implementing legislation with a controversial request for new 'fast track' authority to negotiate more free trade deals which Congress cannot amend. He threatened to delay the proceedings unless the White House this week formally delivered a funding proposal. A funding proposal is in fact now nearly complete, although as one Senate staffer predicted: 'The cuts won't be real because the losses aren't real.' One of its more ludicrous features is the raising of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 3bn by more quickly voiding uncashed welfare and food stamp payments. The odds are still in favour of passage of the implementing legislation this year, but obstacles remain. Hoping to proceed with trade negotiations with Chile and other Latin American countries, the administration has included in the implementing legis-lation a request for new 'fast track' negotiating authority. Republicans and business groups are in open rebellion because the administration has vowed to include negotiation of labour and environmental standards in all future trade pacts. Many Democrats say they will oppose a fast-track provision if mention of labour and environment is dropped from the fast-track language. The administration may have to drop the fast-track request, although it will be much more difficult to get later on. Worries about potential loss of US sovereignty by the new World Trade Organisation are being skilfully exploited on the left by Ralph Nader's Public Citizen and on the right by two former right-wing presidential candidates, Mr Pat Buchanan, the television commentator, and Mr Pat Robertson, a television preacher. Their latest contribution to congressional chaos is an amendment - not expected to pass - requiring a 90-day delay in the proceedings so a panel of experts can study the sovereignty concerns. The administration had nursed the hope that the Gatt legislation could be got out of the way next month to make way for the really difficult task - healthcare. First, it will need the effective intervention of President Clinton, who sinking in the polls, badly needs a new victory.</p>

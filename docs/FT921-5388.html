			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Kenyan mothers' protest stopped RIOT police clubbed four women unconscious and fired shots into the air in Nairobi's central Uhuru (Independence) Park to disperse a group of women hunger-strikers and several hundred supporters, Reuter reports from Nairobi. Witnesses said police waded into the group of about 50 women - many of them mothers of prisoners - who began a hunger strike on Friday with an appeal to Mr Amos Wako, the attorney-general, to release 52 people they say are in jail for political offences. AP adds: New US development aid to Kenya has ended under US legislation which halts all but food aid to countries six months late on loan payments.</p>

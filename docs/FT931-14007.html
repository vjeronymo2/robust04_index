			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Solicitors' profits sink to 10-year low PROFITS of solicitors' firms in England and Wales fell last year to their lowest level for 10 years according to the annual survey of law firm performance carried out by the Centre for Interfirm Comparison. The centre said prospects for this year appeared little better. Profits of provincial firms were particularly badly hit. Typical profits per partner for provincial firms fell from Pounds 25,000 in 1991 to Pounds 11,000 last year, after deduction of a notional salary of Pounds 35,000. On this basis 30 per cent (1,813) of the 6,046 provincial firms in England and Wales were loss-making last year compared with only 7.5 per cent in 1991. Of the provincial firms in the study in 1991 and 1992, two thirds were less profitable in 1992 including all the firms in the south-east. London firms fared better. Typical profits per partner last year were Pounds 90,000, after deduction of Pounds 50,000 notional salary, compared with more than Pounds 100,000 two years ago. Among provincial firms the steady fall in profit margins of the past three years had previously been offset by better productivity. That did not happen last year, the centre said. In 1990 the typical profit margin for a provincial firm was 15 per cent; in 1991 it was 12 per cent and last year it fell to 5 per cent. Overall, provincial firms enjoyed an 11 per cent increase in revenue last year but 25 per cent of such firms experienced a fall in revenue. Litigation was the fastest growing type of work but commercial work was the most profitable. Staff costs rose from 53 per cent to 58 per cent of revenue. Accommodation costs and operating costs have also risen to 10 per cent and 27 per cent of revenue respectively. The average level of profitability of London firms fell slightly last year. Profit margins stabilised at 19 per cent of revenue - the same as in 1991 and revenue per head was also constant at Pounds 60,000.</p>

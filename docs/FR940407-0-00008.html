			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SBA notes that the size standards for certain industries have either been established by statute or prohibited by statute from change until after September 30, 1996. Thus, the size standards for these industries will remain at their current levels and will not be increased for inflation in this final rule. Title VII of Public Law 100&hyph;656, 102 Stat. 3853, 3889, established the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program to test the competitiveness of small business on Federal procurements. That program generally prohibits a change in size standards before September 30, 1996 for the Construction industries (SIC codes 1521&hyph;1799); the Engineering, Architecture, Surveying and Mapmaking industries (SIC codes 8711, 8712, 8713, and part of SIC code 7389); and the Refuse Systems and Related Services industries (SIC code 4953). A footnote is being added to the size standard for SIC code 7389, Business Services, Not Elsewhere Classified, to comply with this statutory mandate to retain the $3.5 million size standard for any surveying and mapping activities which may be included in this industry. The description of this industry in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987 includes some surveying and mapping activities not included in SIC code 8713, Surveying Services. This footnote was not part of the proposed rule due to an oversight as to the full impact of this statutory requirement. However, the SBA is bound by statutory direction to retain the existing $3.5 million size standard for surveying and mapping services whether included in SIC code 8713 or SIC code 7389. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program generally requires the size standards of certain industries to remain unchanged until 1996, the size standards relating to two of the three industries in the engineering category may now be revised as a result of recent legislation. Section 850 of Public Law 103&hyph;160, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994, 107 Stat. 1547, 1726, signed into law on November 30, 1993, modified the application of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program as to SIC code 8711, Engineering Services, to make clear that the subdivisions of Standard Industrial Classification code 8711 for (A) engineering services-military and aerospace equipment and military weapons; and (B) engineering services-marine engineering and naval architecture are not part of the Program and modifications to those size standards could be made by the SBA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recognition of this statutory change, this final rule gives an inflationary adjustment to the size standards for engineering services for Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons, raising it from $13.5 million to $20.0 million in average annual receipts, and to the size standard for engineering services related to Marine Engineering and Naval Architecture, raising it from $9.0 million to $13.5 million in average annual receipts. Although the proposed rule did not contain a similar proposal, it clearly stated that SBA intended to increase all receipt-based size standards by inflation except where SBA was constrained from doing so by law. At the time of the publication of the proposed rule on September 2, 1993, SBA interpreted the requirements relating to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program as prohibiting size standard increases in these two subdivisions of SIC code 8711. The size standards that are adopted in this final rule reflect the release of these size standards from statutory constraints and adjustments for inflation which, over time, has eroded the real value of these industries' size standards similar to other industries' size standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other statutory provision which constrains SBA from making inflationary adjustments for certain industries is Section 18016 of the Comprehensive Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986, Public Law 99&hyph;272, 100 Stat. 82, 371, which amended SBA's authority regarding the setting of size standards contained in section 3(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632(a). Specifically, pursuant to section 3(a) of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 99&hyph;272, an agricultural enterprise shall be deemed to be a small business concern if, including its affiliates, it has annual receipts not in excess of $500,000. SBA has complied with that requirement by retaining the size standard for both Agricultural Production-Crops (SIC codes 0111&hyph;0191), and Livestock and Animal Specialties (SIC codes 0212&hyph;0291, except SIC code 0211 and 0252) at $500,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments to Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the September 2, 1993 proposed rule, SBA received a total of one-hundred and thirty-five comments. A thorough review of these comments revealed that out of the one-hundred and thirty-five comments received, ninety seven were supportive (71.9%), with over fifty commenters citing the inflation adjustment of size standards as a reason for supporting the proposal. In addition, about forty commenters generally supported the simplification of size standards, but did not specifically agree or disagree with the SBA's proposed system for simplification. This general support for simplification was not, however, the primary focus of any comment. A general supporting statement was usually followed or preceded by a comment regarding some other specific aspect of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remaining thirty-eight comments included twenty-five which were non-supportive (18.5%) of the proposal, mainly opposing the proposed size standard for the travel agencies industry. Thirteen comments discussed only issues not included within the proposed rule. SBA's evaluation of the public comments yielded the following noteworthy issues: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

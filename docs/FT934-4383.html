			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (8): Eyes firmly set on the future - Electronics and Telecoms The past few years have been a period of corporate soul-searching for Japan's electronics companies. Not only has the country's economic slowdown brought some of the world's largest and strongest electronic manufacturing companies a third year of falling profits, but the changes in the business environment have also, in many cases, derailed their plans for the future. Consumer electronics makers have been weakened by a marked reversal in consumer sentiment. The lack of consumer interest is hurting their ability to promote the next generation of products they had been hoping would make up for the saturation of markets for their traditional profit earners, such as video tape recorders and CD players. High definition TV sets, which many consumer electronics makers had hoped would take off as prices came down, have been a commercial flop in the face of a lack of programmes and a new-found penny-pinching trend among consumers. New electronic gizmos, such as MiniDiscs - the miniature, recordable discs positioned as the latest-generation portable audio system - and digital compact cassettes, have not been the blockbusters they would need to be to make up for the fall in revenues from conventional audio-visual sales. Mr Norio Ohga, president of Sony, points to strong demand for his company's navigation systems - which at more than Y200,000 a piece are not exactly a bargain - to illustrate the point that consumers are still buying products they really want. However, as one company after another reports huge falls in profits, it is difficult to shake off the perception that consumer electronics makers have lost touch with their market. In response to a question about the most crucial tasks facing Matsushita, Mr Motoi Matsuda, a director and member of the board, conceded recently that the company needed to go back to its roots of providing consumers with products that they wanted. 'The fact that our profitability is falling is a sign that we are not contributing enough to society,' Mr Matsuda said. 'We are losing our raison d'etre.' Meanwhile, Japan's computer makers are also facing a turning point. After years of growing profits sustained by a protected domestic market, Japanese PC makers are facing serious foreign competition in their home territory for the first time. The spread of a bilingual operating system called DOS-V that was developed by IBM, and the arrival of Compaq and Dell on the scene, have shaken the Japanese PC makers out of their cosy existence. This had allowed companies to cling on to a captive audience and carve up the domestic market among themselves by selling proprietary systems that were incompatible with each other and with any other systems outside of Japan. The introduction of low-cost machines into Japan by US PC makers last autumn triggered a price war that damaged the profitability of high-cost Japanese makers and shattered the myth in Japan that computers were by necessity expensive products. One year later, most Japanese PC makers have joined the IBM camp and introduced IBM-compatible machines, opening the door to fundamental change in the Japanese PC market. As the consumer electronics and computer industries look to the future for growth, they share a common problem - income from traditional profit earners is on the downtrend. At the same time, they have been hampered by a poor business environment in Japan from charging forth into what is expected to be the most promising new markets for the industries in future - portable communications and multimedia. Historical and cultural circumstance, as well as bureaucratic regulation, have obstructed the development of conditions which are essential for the growth of those two markets. For example, the market for mobile communications is still relatively small in Japan. Although Japan has the largest market after the US, with 1.7m subscribers, penetration is low with only one per cent of Japanese using mobile phones compared with 3 per cent in the UK. The low penetration of mobile phones is attributed to circumstances such as the spread of public pay phones and the acute lack of airwaves in urban areas, as well as to obstructive regulatory moves by the authorities. The high cost of subscribing to a mobile phone service, which is blamed for the slow penetration in Japan, is in part a result of the need to apply to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry for price reductions. So, while competition in the industry is severe, 'prices do not fall according to market forces,' says an official at DoCoMo, the mobile phones subsidiary of NTT. Handset manufacturers in the electronics and consumer electronics industries have also been hampered - by the market's slow growth and by bureaucratic meddling - in the development of their handset businesses. So far, handsets have only been allowed to be sold by the operators which buy their handsets from the manufacturers on an original equipment manufacture basis and sell them under their own brand. Next spring, when the sale of handsets is deregulated, competition among makers is expected to reduce prices and spur subscription to services. Personal handyphones are another market that is expected to grow in future. But here again the regulatory grip of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications could have unfortunate consequences for the growth of the industry. The ministry is considering which companies to allow into the new market and could end up hampering competition as it did in the mobile phones market. Meanwhile, in the area of multimedia, which is the convergence of computing power and telecommunications to bring a greater amount of information to more places more speedily, Japan lacks the advanced telecommunications infrastructure which is a precondition for the successful application of multimedia. For one thing, cable TV, which is expected to be a big carrier of multimedia services, such as video on demand and interactive TV, has not been very successful in Japan. Again, circumstances such as the wide availability of terrestrial programming in Japan and bureaucratic regulation are blamed for the slow growth of cable TV. Japanese company executives also confess to a lack of ideas about how the new technologies could be used by consumers. While US companies dream up information super-highways and 100-channel programming, Japanese electronics makers wonder out loud what use all the extra communications ability might serve. 'It is still not clear what multimedia is,' says Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice-president of Matsushita. What is clear, nevertheless, is that if and when the golden age of mobile communications and multimedia do come, Japanese electronics companies have their eyes firmly set on providing the hardware and key technologies that will be crucial to make those services a practical reality. To that end they are pumping their resources into key technologies such as liquid crystal displays, long-lasting batteries and advanced memory chips, which will play a growing part in portable communications and, eventually, multimedia as well.</p>

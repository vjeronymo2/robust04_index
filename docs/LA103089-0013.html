			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATRIOTS EDGE COLTS IN OVERTIME, 23-20;  </P> <P> NEW ENGLAND: DAVIS KICKS 51-YARD FIELD GOAL AFTER MISSING 46 YARDER IN  REGULATION.  </P> <P> New England kicker Greg Davis knew how to make up for his missed 46-yard field  goal at the end of regulation play against the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.  </P> <P> Just move him back five yards.  </P> <P> Davis kicked a 51-yarder at 9:57 of overtime, lifting the Patriots to a 23-20  win.  </P> <P> "Believe it or not, longer field goals are easier," said Davis, who signed with  the Patriots as a free agent this year. "There's no pressure on 50-yard field  goals. You are a lot more comfortable, especially in a dome because there are  no weather conditions to worry about.  </P> <P> "I felt coming into this game, it was going to come down to this, either  (Indianapolis kicker) Dean Biasucci or myself to win it."  </P> <P> It was the third straight game between the AFC East rivals that was decided in  the closing seconds. Last year, at New England, quarterback Doug Flutie scored  on a 13-yard run with 23 seconds to go for a 21-17 win by the Patriots.  </P> <P> Then, in the rematch at the Hoosier Dome, a 28-yard field goal by Biasucci with  2:22 to go and a miss by Jason Staurovsky at the gun gave the Colts a 24-21  victory.  </P> <P> Sunday's victory lifted the Patriots to 3-5. Indianapolis is 4-4.  </P> <P> "I didn't hesitate to go for the field goal," New England Coach Raymond Berry  said of the fourth-and-two situation. "I thought he could put it through."  </P> <P> The field goal was set up on a disputed pass reception by Sammy Martin at the  New England 36-yard line. The game replay official said he couldn't determine  conclusively that Martin caught the ball out of bounds, so he had to go with  the call on the field.  </P> <P> Indianapolis Coach Ron Meyer saw it differently. Had it been ruled incomplete,  it would have forced New England to punt from its eight.  </P> <P> "It was right in front of me. I saw it. But I'm not allowed to comment on it,"  Meyer said. "Obviously, you know my feelings."  </P> <P> New England quarterback Steve Grogan said he didn't know it was completed.  </P> <P> "It was an awful throw but a great catch," he said. "I just threw it in the  general vicinity and hoped he would get it. Someone hit me, and when I rolled  up, I saw their bench screaming 'Out of bounds.' I really couldn't see what the  official had indicated."  </P> <P> Grogan, the third New England starter this season, passed for 355 yards. He  completed 28 of 46 passes, both career highs.  </P> <P> "There's no question, he just played magnificently for the better part of the  game," Meyer said of Grogan, 36. "His receivers made some good catches, and he  had the ball right on target."  </P> <P> The Patriots started the winning drive from their 12 after an Indianapolis  punt. Grogan was driven back to his four on a sack, but completed three  consecutive passes, including the 28-yarder to Martin, to bring the Patriots to  the 44.  </P> <P> Five straight runs took New England to the Indianapolis 33. Grogan recovered a  fumble on the snap for a one-yard loss before Davis hit the winning field goal.  </P> <P> Davis hit field goals of 47 yards in the first quarter and 48 in the final  period.  </P></p>

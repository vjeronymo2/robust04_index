			<p>BFN     [Text] Augsburg, Germany, May 20 (AFP) -- German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl criticised the courts in an interview  published Friday [20 May] for failing to use the full force of  the law against people guilty of criminal violence.    But he refused to lay the blame solely on extreme-right  supporters, adding that "all form of extremism is shameful for  our country."    His comments in the AUGSBURGER ALLGEMEINEN followed  incidents  last week in Magdeburg when a crowd of skinheads and other  youths chased a group of Africans through the town. In the  ensuing clashes five people were injured, all Germans.    Kohl said he had "so often been to funerals of victims of  the  extreme Left that I refuse to put the problem down solely to  violence by the Right."    "We must combat energetically all forms of violence," he  said.    Kohl said he was not opposed to tightening the law but he  said "the courts often hand down the lightest sentences."    The 49 people arrested after the Magdeburg clashes were  later  released by police.</p>

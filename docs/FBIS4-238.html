			<p>BFN     [Text] East London April 5 SAPA -- South African Defence  Force [SADF] troops deployed in Ciskei are unlikely to be  withdrawn before the general election, according to the  commanding officer for the region Brig Toon Slabbert. SADF  troops poured into the homeland on March 24 in a massive show of  force and seized key installations following Ciskei military  leader Brig Oupa Gqozo's decision to relinquish power.    At the time fears were expressed that elements within the  Ciskei Defence Force [CDF] did not fully support the  Transitional Execitive Council's decision to install an interim  administration and wanted to return Brig Gqozo to office.    Brig Slabbert said on Tuesday that while the situation in  Ciskei had calmed down, it was not yet "sufficiently stabilised"  for him to consider withdrawing troops. "Most probably we are  still going to be here until the election."    He said his first responsibility was to ensure all CDF  weapons were accounted for and that the troops were brought  under control. An "audit" to establish what, if any, weapons  were missing from CDF company armouries was almost complete, he  said.    Brig Slabbert said joint patrols had been instituted last  Thursday, with SADF troops and members of 1 Ciskei Battalion  each taking an area of responsibility. However, South African  troops were still in control of government installations.    The mechanised units from Bloemfontein and the Army Battle  School at Lohatla in the Northern Cape, which spearheaded the  SADF advance into Ciskei, were withdrawn on Sunday and replaced  by an armoured force from Eastern Province Command, he said.</p>

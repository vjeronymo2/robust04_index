			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Dollars 142m phone deal for Puerto Rico Telefonica de Espana, a Spanish telephone company, is to purchase 80 per cent of the Puerto Rican government's holding in the island's long-distance carrier for Dollars 141.6m, writes Canute James from Kingston. The contract was agreed between Telefonica Internacional de Espana, a subsidiary of Telefonica de Espana, and Telefonica Larga Distancia, owned by the Puerto Rican administration. The Spanish company says it will invest another Dollars 50m in the Puerto Rican venture to upgrade its facilities. The US Federal Communications Commission will have to approve the sale, as Telefonica de Espana's purchase breaches regulations prohibiting foreign companies from owning more than 40 per cent of any US telephone company. The purchase represents Telefonica de Espana's second venture in the Puerto Rican telecommunications industry. The company already owns 40 per cent of Telefonica Hispanoamerica, which manufactures telephones and other equipment on the island. Telefonica de Espana, also has investments in Argentina, Chile and Venezuela.</p>

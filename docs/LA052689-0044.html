			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL PROS RETURN HOME FOR $75,000 VENICE OPEN TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> After playing more than a third of the professional beach volleyball season in  such unlikely locales as Dallas, Phoenix and New Orleans, the tour returns home  this weekend for the $75,000 Venice Open.  </P> <P> Once a strictly Southern California phenomenon offering its top players little  more than sun and status, the professional beach volleyball tour now consists  of 29 tournaments with $1.9 million in prize money. The winning two-man team  will divide $17,250 in the Venice Open, which begins at 8:30 a.m. Saturday and  ends with the championship match at 3 p.m. Sunday on the sand north of Venice  Pier.  </P> <P> The growth on the sport began with the formation in 1983 of the Assn. of  Volleyball Professionals, which brought wealthy sponsors, big money and  national cable television coverage to the beach. And the tour has brought the  beach -- by the truckload -- to landlocked cities whose only previous exposure  to the game had been soft drink and beer commercials.  </P> <P> "We've played in horrendous dirt, construction sand, some far from ideal  circumstances," said Mike Dodd, who with his partner, Tim Hovland, form the  leading team in the AVP money rankings. Both have earned $58,000 to date,  winning three tournaments.  </P> <P> Although Dodd says Southern California "has the best crowds, the best beaches  and is the best place to play in the world," the 6-foot-4 El Segundo resident,  who learned the game on the hallowed sands of Manhattan Beach, sees value in  the long trips to Cleveland, Milwaukee and Rochester, N.Y.  </P> <P> "We see ourselves as pioneers, taking our sport all over the country," Dodd  said. "It's really unbelievable. When we go to a new site, the first year the  crowd will be sparse. Then the next year, the same people will be back, they've  told their friends and there will be a bigger crowd. The big payoff is watching  the excitement grow in an area that had never seen the game before."  </P> <P> Going into the Venice Open, Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos, last year's  champions and the most successful team in beach volleyball history, are even  with Dodd-Hovland in tournament victories (three) but trail in the money  rankings with $45,687 each.  </P> <P> Karch Kiraly is also back on the beach after taking last summer off to play for  the U.S. Olympic team.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] Another round of Russian-Estonian talks, round 16,  ended this week. This is how the head of the Russian  delegation, special envoy Vasiliy Svirin, assessed its results:    [Begin Svirin recording] We note with satisfaction that by  joint efforts we managed to achieve substantial progress in the  work on the draft treaty on the withdrawal of the Russian troops  and conditions of their temporary stay on the territory of the  Estonian Republic. At the beginning of this round there were  fundamental disagreements with regard to five articles of this  treaty. In the course of our work we managed to resolve  disagreements on four articles. All this gives us grounds to  say that the troop withdrawal treaty can be initialled by the  delegations in the very near future. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Breakthrough in Canadian unity negotiations CANADA'S political leaders have made a breakthrough in national unity talks by agreeing on far-reaching changes in the composition of the two houses of parliament. The deal, which balances equal representation for all 10 provinces in a reformed Senate with a guaranteed percentage of seats for Quebec in an enlarged House of Commons, has brightened the mood at the constitutional conference in Ottawa, now in its fourth day. Participants have cautioned, however, that several emotive issues remain in negotiations between Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister, leaders of the 10 provinces and two Arctic territories, and aboriginal groups. These include the definition and enforcement of aboriginal self-government, Quebec's demand for wider powers over some matters now under federal jurisdiction, and Mr Mulroney's insistence on a stronger mechanism to force provinces to lower non-tariff trade barriers. The talks are likely to conclude, in success or failure, by the end of next week. Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, must formulate a question in early September for the national unity referendum which the province is to hold in October. Besides, Canadians of all political persuasions are impatient to put the long constitutional wrangle behind them. The agreement on parliamentary reform represents a characteristically Canadian compromise. Quebec, which views itself as the guardian of one of Canada's two founding language groups, would be guaranteed 25 per cent of the Commons seats, roughly equal to its share of Canada's population. Western and Atlantic provinces would have the same number of seats in the revamped Senate as Quebec and Ontario, the most powerful and populous province. The Senate would have limited veto powers, but its influence would be enhanced by converting the present appointed chamber to one largely elected. Hard-line Quebec nationalists quickly denounced the agreement as a sell-out by Mr Bourassa. But the province's two biggest newspapers indicated both drawbacks and advantages. Canada's inflation rate accelerated slightly to 1.3 per cent in the year to July, from a 30-year low of 1.1 per cent in June, Statistics Canada said yesterday. The low inflation rate, with progress at the constitutional talks, has spurred forecasts that Canadian banks will soon lower their prime lending rate from 6.5 per cent.</p>

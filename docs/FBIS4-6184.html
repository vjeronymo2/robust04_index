			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and U.S.  negotiators agreed Tuesday that North Korea should act as soon  as possible in allowing additional nuclear inspections to meet  an early-May deadline.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, at a working luncheon with  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, stressed that  the immediate task is getting Pyongyang to agree to further  checks by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The two sides agreed that the ball is in Pyongyang's court,  predicting that a reaction will come soon since the celebrations  for supreme leader Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday have just ended.    IAEA Director-General Hans Blix is due to report to the U.N.  Security Council on North Korea's nuclear program in early May,  and officials here say that unlike previous monitoring  activities, this deadline doesn't allow for much leeway.    "A couple of weeks is the most we can give North Korea next  month," said one official on condition of anonymity. "Either  Pyongyang accepts the IAEA team by then or faces U.N. action."    "There isn't much time," he emphasized.    Han and Gallucci stressed the importance of inter-Korean  dialogue in defusing the nuclear crisis and promised to work  together for successful talks between the two Koreas, the  officials said.</p>

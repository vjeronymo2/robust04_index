			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Lincoln House buys Medallion Lincoln House, the USM-quoted home furnish-ings group, yesterday announced the purchase of Medallion Upholstery, largely funded by a placing and open offer to raise Pounds 7.4m net. Lincoln is paying up to Pounds 8.2m for Medallion, 50 per cent of whose turnover is represented by exports to continental Europe. Mr Anthony Robinson, Medallion's chairman and 50 per cent shareholder, will receive Pounds 1m in Lincoln shares at the placing price of 36p as part of the consideration for his stake. On completion, he will join Lincoln's board. In view of the size of the deal, Lincoln intends to apply for a full listing. Yesterday, the shares were suspended at 37p, but dealings are expected to resume on August 3. Under the placing and offer, Lincoln is to issue 12.14m placing shares and 10.09m offer shares on a 2-for-5 basis at 36p. As a result, the share capital will almost double. Lincoln also said it intended to consolidate every 150 ordinary shares of 10p into one new Pounds 15 share; each new share would be subdivided into 75 new ordinary shares of 20p each. It is also proposed to change the company's name to Wyefield Group.</p>

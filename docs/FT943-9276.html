			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Watchdog clears travel operators The Office of Fair Trading yesterday cleared the package travel industry of anti-competitive behaviour and said no formal action was needed. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said consumers had a wide choice of competitively priced holidays in spite of ownership links between big tour operators and travel agents. He said the links did not prevent smaller companies from selling their holidays. Sir Bryan added: 'Vertical integration may make it more difficult for newcomers to enter the market, but there is no evidence at the moment that any of the leading operators with agency links have been able to insulate themselves from competition.' He was concerned that customers might not be aware of links between travel agents and operators, and urged companies to make customers aware of such links. The findings were welcomed by Thomson and Airtours, the two largest operators. Thomson owns Lunn Poly, the largest travel retail chain. Airtours owns Going Places, the second largest. Both said their branches already carried signs explaining their links with the operators which owned them. The Association of Independent Tour Operators attacked the findings. Ms Sue Ockwell, chief executive, said: 'It's bad news for independent tour operators and travel agents and that, in turn, means it's bad for the public. 'When you go into a travel agent you expect a choice, you expect independent travel advice and you don't get that from the big companies. The OFT have just sat back and said they find that acceptable.' Sir Bryan said, however, that the watchdog had examined the practices about which small companies had complained. These included the payment of discriminatory rates of commission to different travel agents, the refusal by some agents to carry the brochures of certain tour operators, and agents promoting their parent companies' holidays. Sir Bryan said he had paid particular attention to Thomson and Lunn Poly. He said the central issue was 'whether any such practices significantly damaged the ability to compete fairly of independent travel agencies or operators who do not hold shares in travel agencies.' He added: 'Bearing in mind the relatively large number of tour operators and travel agents and the evidence of vigorous competition, I do not consider the allegations of anti-competitive behaviour to be substantiated.'</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> Commended for their anti-drug stand at City Hall, a trio of pizza-chomping  cartoon idols declared the members of the Los Angeles City Council to be  honorary Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The sewer-dwelling Heroes on the Half Shell handed out turtle masks to the  council members while intoning their traditional "Cowabunga" yell.  </P> <P> Where were these guys when the city's sewer system was overloaded?  </P> <P> A 27-year-old card player hit the jackpot the other day at the Bicycle Club in  Bell Gardens. She had a baby.  </P> <P> Security officer Al Rodriguez, responding to a report of a fainting at the  Asian poker card table, assisted the expectant mother with her breathing  techniques while awaiting the paramedics. Hung Duong, a card dealer, helped  out.  </P> <P> Before the ambulance could arrive, she gave birth to a 7-pound, 8-ounce boy in  the club's VIP parking lot.  </P> <P> A Bicycle Club spokesman said that the new mother had been on a winning streak  when her labor began.  </P> <P> The suggestion of a ferry service along the Los Angeles River doesn't look  promising. Nor does the proposal for flatbed trucks to ferry groups of  motorists down the freeways.  </P> <P> But the chances are better for some of the other 1,000-odd (and not so odd)  ideas submitted to RTD Board President Nick Patsaouras over the past several  months. They're part of "People Movin' L.A. in the 1990s," his invitation to  the public to offer traffic solutions.  </P> <P> "One suggestion was to allow people to take their bicycles on the Blue Line and  that's doable," Patsaouras said. "We're working on that right now. And I love  the idea of having an artist portray, on the side of the bus, which community  that bus is coming from. It creates pride in that area."  </P> <P> He even saw possibilities for a suggestion to reduce gawkers by shielding  accident scenes from the view of motorists with drapes.  </P> <P> "I understand this method is used in Japan," Patsaouras said.  </P> <P> A ton of pumpkin-cinnamon ice cream, headed for American troops in Saudi  Arabia, arrived at Long Beach Naval Station on Wednesday, courtesy of  McConnell's Fine Ice Creams.  </P> <P> The company called the shipment: "Dessert Shield."  </P> <P> Stephen Cannell Productions, which makes TV shows, has entered a float in the  Hollywood Christmas Parade on Sunday. It will depict people watching TV.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> A decade before he became world famous, Detroit-born aviator Charles Lindbergh  attended Redondo Beach High for one semester during a brief stopover in the  area by his family.  </P></p>

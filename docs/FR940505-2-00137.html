(Fisher-Price) of East Aurora, New York, determined that some of its child safety seats failed to comply with the flammability requirements of 49 CFR 571.213, ``Child Restraint Systems,'' Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573. Fisher-Price also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.) on the basis that the noncompliance was inconsequential as it related to motor vehicle safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of receipt of the petition was published on November 9, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 59511). This notice denies the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph S5.7 of FMVSS No. 213 states that ``[e]ach material used in a child restraint system shall conform to the requirements of S4 of FMVSS No. 302 (571.302).'' Paragraph S4.3(a) of FMVSS No. 302 states that ``[w]hen tested in accordance with S5, material described in S4.1 and S4.2 shall not burn, nor transmit a flame front across its surface, at a rate of more than 4 inches per minute.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period of January 1988 through the present, Fisher-Price produced approximately 3.3 million child restraint seats with shoulder belt webbing that might not comply with the flammability requirements of FMVSS No. 213.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Fisher-Price webbing restraint system is manufactured in three phases. First, raw webbing is manufactured by AlliedSignal in Knoxville, Tennessee. Second, the raw webbing is sent to another AlliedSignal plant located in Mexico, which cuts the webbing to length and attaches the buckles. Finally, the webbing/buckle assemblies are sent to Jones and Vining, Inc., in Lewiston, Maine, which attaches them to the ``T-Shield,'' a soft, molded polyurethane cushion. A foam molding process is used to attach the T-Shield to the webbing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA took two samples of the harness webbing from a Fisher-Price child safety seat and had them tested by the Detroit Testing Laboratory. The two samples of webbing burned at rates of 4.4 and 4.7 inches per minute, thus failing the test specified in FMVSS No. 213. (NHTSA notes that there was an additional failure on retest of 4.9 inches. These tests formed the basis of agency investigation NCI 3270). When the agency informed Fisher-Price of the test failures, Fisher-Price conducted further tests on the webbing, both in its raw state and in its molded state. AlliedSignal conducted FMVSS No. 302 compliance tests for Fisher-Price on webbing which had gone through the molding process at Jones and Vining (hereinafter ``molded webbing''). On April 12, 1993 and May 10, 1993, eleven samples which were tested either self-extinguished or had burn rates from 1.84 to 2.91 inches per minute, thus complying with the standard. On August 19, 1993, AlliedSignal tested seven raw webbing samples, all of which either did not ignite or self extinguished, resulting in a burn rate of zero, and twelve molded webbing samples, yielding burn rates of 2.0 to 5.8 inches per minute. (NHTSA notes a slight inaccuracy in the petition. Data supplied during the course of the investigation indicate that the lowest burn rate rounded to the nearest tenth was 3.0 inches, rather than 2.0).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fisher-Price supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following rationale, as well as webbing test photographs, test data, a videotape of the tests, and the professional resumes of two fire experts which are available for review in the NHTSA docket. In addition, Fisher-Price met with NHTSA officials to reemphasize some of the points that it presented in its petition. A record of this meeting is contained in the NHTSA docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fisher-Price commissioned two fire experts, James H. Shanley, Jr., P.E., a licensed fire protection engineer, and Patrick M. Kennedy, an experienced fire investigator, to conduct a study to assess the impact on motor vehicle safety of the noncompliance. The study consisted of conducting tests to compare the webbing with typical children's clothing, to compare the webbing with other interior elements of a typical motor vehicle, to search available literature and databases for instances where the webbing in a child safety seat contributed to a fire, and to determine whether the noncompliance would have an impact on an individual's ability to evacuate a burning motor vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the tests which compared the burn rates and ignition temperatures of typical children's clothing to that of the noncompliant webbing, the first test, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D1929, ``Standard Test Method for Ignition Properties of Plastics,'' was to determine ignition temperatures. The ignition temperature of the molded webbing was 796 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; Fahrenheit (F), ignition temperature of a 100 percent cotton ``T'' shirt was 571 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F, and ignition temperature of 50 percent cotton/50 percent polyester sweatpants was 676 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. The study concluded that the molded webbing is ``manifestly more resistant to ignition than typical children's clothing.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second test, 16 CFR 1610 or ASTM D1230, ``Standard Test Method for the Flammability of Apparel Textiles,'' was to determine the relative flammability of each of the three above-mentioned materials. This test determines the time it takes the sample to burn a distance of five inches while suspended at a 45 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; angle. In this test, the molded webbing took 13.51 times longer to burn than is allowed by the standard. Further, the ``T'' shirt and the sweatpants burned at rates that were three and 2.2 times faster, respectively, than the molded webbing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

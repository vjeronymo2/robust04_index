			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: DOWNEY;  </P> <P> DRUG EDUCATION PROJECT EXPANDED TO 8TH GRADE  </P> <P> The Downey City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved the expansion of the  Drug Abuse Resistance &amp; Education (DARE) program to middle schools  throughout the Downey Unified School District. It will go into effect in  September.  </P> <P> So far, the DARE program has been geared to fifth-graders, providing  information on drug misuse, alternatives and ways to promote self-esteem.  </P> <P> The expansion will double the number of students involved, to more than 2,000  fifth- and eighth-graders.  </P> <P> "I think the program is effective," said Robert Cosgrove, administrator of  curriculum and instruction for Downey schools. The prevailing attitude among  students who witness the program is drugs are "not a smart thing to do," he  said.  </P> <P> The Downey Police Department is adding another officer to the program, now  represented by Cynthia Billings. The estimated cost for the additional officer,  who will assist Billings in advance of the fall semester, is $50,000. "There is  only one way to stop drug traffic and that is to steal its customers," said  Mayor Robert Cormack, who views DARE as a method to improve students' life and  life expectancy.  </P></p>

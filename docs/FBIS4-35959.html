			<p>BFN     [Text] The Iraqi and Jordanian Interior Ministries today  signed an agreement for joint cooperation in the technical and  administrative fields. The agreement was signed by Interior  Minister Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan for Iraq and by his counterpart  Salamah Hammad for Jordan.    During the signing ceremony, Interior Minister Watban  Ibrahim  al-Hasan voiced happiness and satisfaction over the march of  brotherly ties between Iraq and Jordan, as demonstrated by the  joint programs and plans that were achieved during the talks.  The interior minister called on the Jordanian and Iraqi peoples  to continue their efforts on the path of struggle and to rally  behind their leaders to defend the Arab nation's' sovereignty  and unity and foil all conspiratorial imperialist and Zionist  schemes in the region.    Jordanian Interior Minister Salamah Hammad noted  satisfaction  in visiting his second country, Iraq, and signing the bilateral  cooperation agreement. He also said he was pleased with the  comprehensive progress in building and reconstruction he saw in  Iraq, as well as the unity and cohesion among the Iraqis and  their support for their wise leader, Saddam Husayn, in  confronting the unjust blockade imposed on them and foiling the  schemes and threats aimed at infringing on their steadfastness  and heroic defiance.    The minister reaffirmed Jordan's firm position in support of  Iraq, and underlined the inevitability of the triumph of  goodness and right, represented by Iraq under President Saddam  Husayn's leadership.    The signing ceremony was attended by a number of officials  from the two Interior Ministries and the Jordanian ambassador in  Baghdad.</p>

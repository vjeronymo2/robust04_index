			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Silver prices recoil after bull run - Market Report SILVER prices recoiled at the London bullion market yesterday after the recent bull run as traders came to the conclusion that hopes of breaching the Dollars 6 a troy ounce resistance level for spot metal were premature. The spot price closed at 567.5 cents, down 9.5, and other precious metals moved lower in sympathy. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices retreated in sluggish conditions and dealers suggested further losses were possible. The three months price closed at Dollars 1,936.50 a tonne, down Dollars 22. ALUMINIUM prices were more resilient as the market's fundamental's were seen to be improving. London Commodity Exchange COCOA market, although the May position dropped back below Pounds 900 a tonne, was at least comforted by the fact that further aggressive selling did not emerge in New York in the afternoon. May seemed content to hover around the Pounds 890, last trading Pounds 13 down at Pounds 892.

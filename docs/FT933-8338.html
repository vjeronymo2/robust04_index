			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Slovakia minority alters line of protest ETHNIC Hungarians in southern Slovakia, who blocked traffic last week in protest over a ban on bilingual road signs, erected signs on Monday with large question marks replacing the name of their village, Reuter reports from Bratislava. Villagers in Marcelova replaced signs bearing its Hungarian name, Marcelhaza, with signs featuring giant question marks 'as another form of protest', Mr Laszlo Sooky, the Marcelova mayor, said. The dispute is the latest in a string of minority rights squabbles between Slovakia's ethnic Hungarians, numbering about 600,000, and the Slovak government. The villagers are angry at a government order giving towns until the end of July to take down bilingual road signs. Mr Sooky said the question- marks would remain until parliament reconvened in September and debated the issue. Last month, the Slovak cabinet approve a bill legalising the official use of Hungarian first and family names.</p>

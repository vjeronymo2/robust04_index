			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo reshuffles managers following Girolami move Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals company, has announced yet another management reshuffle. The moves follow the decision by Sir Paul Girolami, chairman, to hand over executive responsibilities to Sir Richard Sykes, deputy chairman and chief executive, last month and cease being a non-executive director in September. Sir Richard, who was research and development director until last year, is passing responsibility for R&amp;D to Dr Franz Humer, chief operating officer. Dr Humer will also have responsibility for the technical directorate, mostly manufacturing and quality assurance, and Latin America. Mr Neil Maidment, who controls the Asian-Pacific, African and Middle East markets will take over some European markets from Dr Humer. Mr Robert Ingram will have responsibility for north America and Mr Hiroshi Konishi for Japan. All will report directly to Sir Richard. Sir Mark Richmond remains director of research, and Dr Goran Ando, stays as director of group development and product strategy, but both report to Dr Humer.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Council finance rules to be eased The government is to relax rules governing the handling of local authority capital assets in a move that may foreshadow further steps to loosen Whitehall's grip on local government finances. Ministers are expected to act soon to change regulations dictating the proportion of newly acquired capital assets which local authorities must use to redeem outstanding debts. The likely move follows consultations between the government and local authorities on perceived obstacles to partnerships with the private sector.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Hopes fade for early deal on HK airport HOPES for an early agreement on financial arrangements for Hong Kong's HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds 11.6bn) airport and related projects collapsed yesterday when China accused the Hong Kong government of 'intimidation' and misleading the colony and the international community about the project. Chen Zuo'er, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office of the State Council, said Sir David Ford, the colony's chief secretary, and Mr K Y Yeung, its treasury secretary, had 'wantonly' disclosed the content of recent Sino-British talks on the airport's financing. His intervention follows comments made this week by Jiang Zemin, secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party, who reportedly accused Britain of complicating talks about airport finance. Addressing a seminar last Friday Sir David and Mr Yeung outlined China's concerns about some details of the financial package. These included the deferral of dividends by two public corporations responsible for the project and measures to provide them with more finance in the event of difficulties. Britain and China have been in discussions for the past three months about the airport. Although they appear to be about finance, Hong Kong and British officials believe that China - which is concerned about political developments in the colony - is using the issue to exercise leverage over Mr Chris Patten, the colony's new governor. It now seems likely that, in the absence of a Chinese back down, Beijing will withhold its approval for the finance until the autumn when Mr Patten is due to open the local legislature and outline his plans for the government. If the project is delayed this long it is unlikely that Britain will be able to complete the airport before June 1997, as agreed between the prime ministers of Britain and China last September.</p>

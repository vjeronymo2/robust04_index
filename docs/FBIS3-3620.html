			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 4 (XINHUA)-- China's capital city  Beijing intends to attract more foreign investment to boost its  booming infrastructure construction, according to Mayor Li Qiyan.    Li made this remark at a recent municipal foreign economic  and trade meeting.    He said that the current international and domestic  situation  helps pave the way for further use of foreign funds, but a  better environment for such investment is badly needed.    As world consortiums, financiers and transnational firms  have  kept pouring into Beijing to seek opportunities since the  beginning of the year, the emphasis of the work should be placed  on creating favorable conditions for foreign investment and  cooperation, he said.    In the first month of this year, the number of the  newly-built companies with over 10 million U.S. dollars  investment each reached 20. The biggest of them were two real  estate corporations, each having a total investment of 60  million U.S. dollars.    And by the end of January the municipal government had  approved 7,783 foreign-funded firms and directly used more than  10.71 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds.    Explaining the reason for promoting the role of foreign  investment, Deputy Mayor Lu Yucheng said that the drive will  focus on encouraging the attraction of more foreign funds, the  setting up of more businesses, more project construction and  more profits earned this year.    Lu also said that the majority of the foreign funds will be  guided into the construction of urban infrastructure facilities  and development zones of various kinds, as well as into the  mainstay industries such as automobiles, electronics and  building materials.    In addition, he said, full use should be made of world trade  information networks to provide more information services for  both investors and those who need investment.    And the drawing up of laws and regulations concerning  foreign  economic trade and co-operation should be strengthened to  protect the foreign businessmen's legal rights and interests in  China.    Administrative formalities should be simplified and work  efficiency should be improved in order to provide a coordinated  servicing process.    In 1994 the city will pour more funds into the construction  of major projects such as the capital's subways, expressways and  power plants.    The construction of first-class economic and technology  development zones will also be stepped up through Sino-foreign  co-operation.    Lu also said that Beijing is now probing for ways to  establish Sino-foreign shareholding companies.    For this reason, the companies that are already listed are  encouraged to issue B and H shares, and the financial  institutions to issue bonds abroad, while infrastructure  projects will try the BOT (building, operation and transfer)  channel.</p>

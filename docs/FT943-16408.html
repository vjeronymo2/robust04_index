			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Warning over Forth crossing Traffic across the Firth of Forth is likely to grow by 50 per cent between 1990 and 2010, says an independent study into plans for a privately financed second Forth road bridge. The report for the Scottish Office said that neither a new bridge nor public transport improvements in isolation would resolve the problems of increased traffic which could lead to regular 10-mile tailbacks. The study was carried out by MVA Consultancy, Oscar Faber TPA and Environmental Resource Management.</p>

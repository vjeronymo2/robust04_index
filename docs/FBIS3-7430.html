The mission was fraught with difficulties due to lack of  familiarity with the roads and terrain.    The repatriation of over 20,000 Cambodians who ran away from  the fighting between the Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge  forces for control of Pailin in Battambang Province was made via  Sap Tali town in Soi Dao District, Chanthaburi Province, about  40 km north of Ban Phakkat. The people were sent back in a  convoy of military GMC trucks and 10-wheel trucks provided by  Thai mine operators. Some traveled by their own motorcycles.  The mission was reportedly carried out with difficulty due to  the long journey and winding roads. Many vehicles overturned or  had accidents. Some lost their way and missed the border  crossing point.    Speaking through interpreters, some Cambodians said they had  to leave behind at Ban Phakkat some bulky belongings, such as  power generators, television sets, video players, as well as  motorcycles which had no gasoline. The people said they were  returning with small valuables like jewelry and cash. Several  pregnant women gave birth during the trip. Asked about food,  the Cambodian people said they had no problem with a food supply  because of the ample ration provided by Cambodian group leaders.    Correspondents said the 563d Company of Thai Marine Rangers  was responsible for moving the Cambodians from Ban Sap Tali to  an area about 1 km inside the Cambodian border. The refugees  would then cross the canal and be met by Khmer Rouge rear  guards, who will check the refugees and take a head count.    Regarding the evacuation of Pailin, there was a report that  all civilian Cambodians had left Pailin. This included  relatives of the Khmer Rouge leaders who had earlier left Pailin  by cars and trucks. Those remaining in Pailin now are  combatants who stand ready to resist the offensive by Cambodian  Government troops.</p>

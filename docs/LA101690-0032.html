			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DONAHUE: IT'S STILL EARLY IN THE RACE;  </P> <P> UCLA: THERE IS A LOT OF FOOTBALL TO BE PLAYED, THE COACH SAYS. THIS WEEK'S  RESULTS WILL TELL MORE.  </P> <P> Midway through the Pacific 10 Conference football season, five teams have been  virtually eliminated from championship contention.  </P> <P> With two defeats, Arizona, Oregon, Arizona State, Stanford and Washington State  can only hope to play in a bowl game other than the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> Still alive are Washington, the only unbeaten team at 3-0; UCLA, California and  USC, all with 2-1 records, and, if you can believe it, Oregon State at 1-1.  </P> <P> The list of contenders could be pared to three teams this weekend, depending on  the outcomes of UCLA's game against Cal Saturday at Berkeley, and the  USC-Arizona and Oregon State-Washington State games.  </P> <P> "If you subscribe to the theory that two losses is the kiss of death, then it's  an elimination tournament," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said Monday. "I don't  know, though, that this year that will necessarily be the case.  </P> <P> "The conference is awful tough from top to bottom and hard to read. There's a  lot of football left in five weeks. A lot of people want to predetermine the  championship early. But a lot of things can happen."  </P> <P> The rest of the Bruins' schedule is demanding, but also presents opportunities  -- games against California, Oregon State, Oregon, Washington and USC.  </P> <P> Asked to evaluate his team, which is 3-3 overall at the midway point of the  season, Donahue said:  </P> <P> "I wish this was the beginning of the year. And what I mean by that is that we  know more about our team. The quarterback position is established (with Tommy  Maddox), (fullback) Kevin Smith has emerged, (tailback) Brian Brown has come on  and (flanker) Scott Miller is back in the lineup.  </P> <P> "I think we're in a developmental process. We have some powerful people who can  impact a game, and then we have some other personnel deficiencies that makes us  vulnerable.  </P> <P> "I don't think we're a great team by any stretch of the imagination, or a bad  team. I think were kind of in the middle."  </P> <P> UCLA's offense is flourishing, averaging 26.2 points a game. But the defense  has given up an average of 30.3 points.  </P> <P> "I don't think our defense is as bad as it appears statistically when we're  healthy," Donahue said. "Unfortunately, our defensive team is very thin and,  when we lose a starting player, it's just has an unbelievable rippling impact  on us. We can't replace players like we once could."  </P> <P> Defensive lineman Siitupe Tuala is the latest addition to the Bruin injury  list. He suffered torn ligaments in his right knee on the last play of the game  against San Diego State Saturday night and is lost for the season. Surgery is  pending.  </P> <P> Linebacker Roman Phifer has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury.  Linebacker Rocen Keeton missed the first three games after having had  arthroscopic knee surgery.  </P> <P> Others who have been inactive for one to three games with injuries are  defensive tackle Brian Kelly, safety Matt Darby, defensive end Mike Chalenski,  and cornerbacks Dion Lambert, Michael Williams and Damion Lyons.  </P> <P> UCLA center Lance Zeno was unable to play against San Diego State because of  sprained ligaments in his foot. His backup, John Zilinskas, injured his ankle  in the game and may be inactive for several weeks. Aron Gideon, a walk-on,  finished the game at center.  </P> <P> California is 4-2 overall, having won its past three games.  </P> <P> Donahue said the big difference in the Bears from others years is their running  game. Cal hasn't had an outstanding running back since Chuck Muncie in the  mid-1970s.  </P> <P> Now the Bears apparently have accomplished players in tailbacks Anthony Wallace  and Russell White. Wallace is averaging 4.7 yards a carry, White is at 5.2 and  has scored 10 touchdowns, seven rushing.  </P> <P> "White is extremely fast for a big running back (6 feet, 200 pounds)," Donahue  said of the former Encino Crespi High star. "He breaks a lot of tackles and  makes people miss him. Wallace is also a fine player in his own right."  </P></p>

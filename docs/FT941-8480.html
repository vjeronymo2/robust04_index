			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Reorganisation could be the death knell of local democracy in Wales Sir, Joe Rogaly's comments on the Tory party's attack on local government are as accurate as they are belated ('Dustbin-lids to the fore', February 15). A steady erosion of local democracy was seen between 1979 to 1994, and reorganisation legislation for Wales and Scotland, currently before parliament could well prove the death knell. Here in Wales particularly the overt injustice of success by opposition parties in local elections time and time again being matched only by the aggrandisement of government-appointed quangos makes a mockery of democratic pretensions. As one who has served in elected office since 1981 and who disappointingly was allowed a walk-over last year in what had been originally a Conservative seat, I can only conclude that the route to local power through elections has now been abandoned by that party in favour of patronage and sinecure with its attendant association in Wales of secrecy and disrepute. We have been allowed no Local Government Commission by our Whitehall-imposed secretary of state and consultation and public debate over proposals for reform now in the Lords have been superficial. Joe Rogaly comments that in England if blood still ran red it would be in mid-revolution, and such a remark applies equally to Wales. In many cases for the first time, supporters of local democracy in Wales are beginning to wonder if the nationalist and republican homes of the Celtic world are not more appropriate than the current scenario of unaccountable bodies often manned by imported placemen lauding over ineffective unitary authorities.

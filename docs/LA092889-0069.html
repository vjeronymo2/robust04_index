			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: HEALTHFUL ENTREES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PEAK SEASON FOR  APPLE CROP  </P> <P> The arrival of the fall apple crop blew in like the old North wind last week,  with prices reported as low as 29 cents per pound at some supermarkets.  </P> <P> That's not particularly surprising given the current atmosphere for apples,  thanks to a pesticide-cancer scare earlier this year which sent shock waves  throughout the community.  </P> <P> Producers have slashed the price of their product and are touting its fiber  content (in the form of pectin) as a major reason for consumers to resume  consumption of the maligned fruit. Newspaper advertisements urge shoppers to "  . . . rediscover the delicious and nutritious reasons to enjoy new crop apples  . . .."  </P> <P> But some consumers are still a little reluctant to resume their apple-eating  gusto because of a widely publicized charge made on a broadcast of "60 Minutes"  in February by the National Resources Defense Council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apple Preservative  </P> <P> The group warned parents that children face "a massive public health problem"  from pesticide residues, particularly from the pesticide Alar, which is used by  growers to preserve red apples, and the ingredient into which the product  breaks down, UDMH.  </P> <P> Despite NRDC's allegations to the contrary, however, the scientific community  was quick to acquit Alar (scientific name Daminozide) as a potential  carcinogen. And most consumers recovered from the "scare." (Even the Los  Angeles Unified School District returned the beloved fruit back to its luncheon  menu after hastily removing it from children's plates.)  </P> <P> Still, there are some children who are not so quick to forget.  </P> <P> "No mommy, don't buy the red ones," a little boy was overheard to say in the  produce section of a supermarket recently, "they'll make you sick," he said.  </P> <P> But there is reason to once again trust in apples, according to scientists,  toxicologists and dietitians who have investigated the major media event.  Today, as they did then, these professionals continue to stress that there is  no need to be alarmed about the potentially toxic effects of possible Alar  residues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exaggerated Risks  </P> <P> Dr. Carl Winter, Department of Entomology, UC Riverside, is one of them.  </P> <P> "My personal opinion is that the risks from Alar in apples were greatly  exaggerated," said the extension toxicologist, "and that the decisions to  remove Alar were based more on emotional and legal battles than on scientific  evidence."  </P> <P> Winter explained that the process by which the government determines the  "cancer potency" of a particular product was not used by NRDC. Likewise, the  Environmental Protection Agency and other policy-making organizations  complained that the data used by NRDC to support their claims had previously  been rejected by independent scientific peer groups, such as the Scientific  Review Panel, as early as 1985.  </P> <P> "There shouldn't be a real concern about the apples because there is still a  lot of questions about whether or not the breakdown product is even a  carcinogen . . . I don't really have any reservations about limitations . . .  liberal amounts pose no undue risk of cancer," he said.  </P> <P> Evelyn Tribole, media spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn., agreed.  </P> <P> She explained that in general, in populations that eat higher amounts of fruits  and vegetables, there is a decreased rate of death from cancer. The key, she  reported, is to maintain variety.  </P> <P> "Have an apple today, a banana tomorrow and so on, so that you minimize  exposure to possible contaminants in our diet and maximize key nutrients,"  Tribole said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2,500 Varieties Grown in U.S.  </P> <P> One of the reasons to again buy apples is that there are so many varieties from  which to choose. With about 7,500 types of apples grown worldwide and 2,500  types grown on U.S. soil, each offers its own shape, size, sweetness, aroma,  color and crispness. The assortment of qualities allow for much dietary  variety. They can be eaten fresh, baked, stir-fried or used as a garnish.  </P> <P> Nutritionally speaking, one medium apple is a fat bargain, offering less than  0.5 gram for its 81 calories. Among its attributes is its contribution to the  daily requirement for dietary fiber. The pectin it contains (1.07 grams) makes  it a good source of soluble fiber.  </P> <P> But since children seldom eat foods for nutrition, here are some  delicious-tasting apple recipes, one of which was developed by Tribole to serve  to her 2-year-old daughter, which should help restore faith to the wary.  </P> <P> GROUND TURKEY PATTIES WITH FALL FRUIT COMPOTE  </P> <P> 1 pound ground turkey  </P> <P> 2 envelopes instant spring vegetable soup mix  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sliced green onions  </P> <P> 1/3 cup oat bran  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 medium apple, sliced  </P> <P> 1 medium pear, sliced  </P> <P> 1 cup cranberries  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons brown sugar  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> Combine turkey, soup mix, green onions, oat bran, poultry seasoning, salt and  1/4 cup water.

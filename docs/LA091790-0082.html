			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC PILOT PROJECT WILL CUSTOMIZE COLLEGE TEXTBOOKS  </P> <P> A technological revolution is brewing on college campuses. And if the  insurgents win, the venerable college textbook, as well as the traditional  campus bookstore, will be forever changed.  </P> <P> Textbook publishers are offering new computer and printing systems that allow  professors to custom-design textbooks by handpicking course materials from  electronic databases stocked with traditional textbooks, magazine articles and  other published information. These customized books can be printed in limited  quantities by the campus bookstore and distributed to students, sometimes  within hours -- not weeks or months -- after ordering.  </P> <P> The first of these systems nationwide, to be operated at USC in partnership  with McGraw-Hill, is to be announced this morning on the Los Angeles campus.  During the three-year partnership, USC and McGraw-Hill, the nation's  second-largest college textbook publisher, will also develop new electronic  course materials and explore ways to link the customized publishing system to  an electronic library under development at the university.  </P> <P> USC's first customized textbooks are scheduled to roll off the campus  bookstore's new presses next January. Although just a few books -- including  business and law texts -- will be available initially for customization,  university officials said they expect dozens of professors to participate in  the program for the fall, 1991, semester.  </P> <P> "This is a real revolution in how we deliver the textbook to the student," said  Carl Tyson, president of McGraw-Hill's college textbook division. "We have been  talking about doing this for 20 years, but this is the first real step."  </P> <P> With the USC pilot project, McGraw-Hill is taking the early lead in a battle to  bring new computer and publishing technology to the $2-billion-per-year college  text market. If the experiment succeeds at the university level, publishers  say, it will be only a matter of time before elementary and secondary schools  are offered textbook customizing services.  </P> <P> Customized teaching materials are nothing new, particularly on campus, where  professors have long created anthologies of printed materials for their  classes. But with advances in computers, databases and printing, professors  have access to a greatly expanded range of materials, allowing them to put  their personal stamp on their curriculum through creative packaging of course  readings.  </P> <P> The new technology is particularly important in fast-moving fields such as law  and science, where developments can render portions of textbooks outdated  overnight.  </P> <P> The new technology also could permanently alter the role of the traditional  campus bookstore.  </P> <P> After years of losing business to the copy shops that ring a campus, bookstores  can fight back by getting into publishing and, perhaps, eventually into  managing on-line database services.  </P> <P> Kenneth Green, a senior researcher at USC's Center for Scholarly Technology,  said students and professors will some day dial up texts and other software  data from personal computers on campus and in their dormitory room, bypassing  the bookstore entirely. However, the bookstore's role would be to manage the  computer systems and keep track of student usage and charges.  </P> <P> Already at USC, students are issued magnetic-tape-encoded identification badges  that can be used as "debit cards" to pay for purchases at the bookstore and  campus eateries. Green envisions that students would use these same cards to  gain access and pay for services at the university's new electronic library and  database.  </P> <P> McGraw-Hill isn't alone. Simon &amp; Schuster, the nation's largest textbook  publisher, and Follett Corp., the nation's largest operator of college  bookstores, are working together to print customized textbooks.  </P> <P> McGraw-Hill said the new customized textbooks can be a bargain for students  because professors will typically only want to reprint a portion of the  traditional textbook, and prices will be based on the amount actually inserted  into the customized version. For example, the first book in McGraw-Hill's  project, an accounting text by Robert and Walter Meigs, usually costs $43.95.  But the first customized versions have included only a fraction of the text and  cost far less.  </P> <P> Because McGraw-Hill also pays royalties to authors based on the amount  reprinted, authors -- particularly those of widely used introductory texts --  could find their royalty checks shrinking as professors use only part of their  tomes.  </P></p>

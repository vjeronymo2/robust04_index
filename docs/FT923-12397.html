			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Unity tonic gives 'Wessis' a pain AN all-German health survey has shown an 'astonishing' reduction in the number of people in eastern Germany suffering from complaints often associated with psychosomatic causes since the two parts of the country were reunited. However, people in the west have shown an increasing - and opposite - propensity to suffer from headaches, troubled sleep, nervousness, giddiness, stomach ache and loss of appetite. Pollsters from the respected Allensbach Institute recently repeated a health survey last carried out in the west in 1989 and in the east in 1990, just after reunification. The results show that the proportion of 'Ossis' suffering 'occasional or frequent' nervous attacks has fallen from 38 per cent to 25 per cent. The figures for 'Wessis' show a rise from 21 per cent to 24 per cent. The tally for headaches is down five points in the east at 28 per cent, but up eight in the west at 33 per cent. Similar results are recorded for all the so-called psychosomatic ills except loss of appetite. While the proportion of easterners suffering from this most un-German complaint has fallen by five points to 8 per cent, the figure for the west is unchanged at 5 per cent. The institute, recalling similar effects in the west at times of economic uncertainty, attributes the change in the east to rising optimism 'despite the bad economic situation, higher unemployment and lack of job security'. The improvement is due to the general feeling that in spite of problems, life and prospects have changed for the better. The signal from the west, the institute says, is that even though the current situation is stable, people feel that the economy is catching a cold and that 'personal living standards will deteriorate in future'. On the subject of sneezes and sniffles, its social scientists offer no clear explanation of why the proportion of Wessis catching colds has increased from 30 to 38 per cent, while the incidence among hardy Ossis has fallen one point to just 28 per cent.</p>

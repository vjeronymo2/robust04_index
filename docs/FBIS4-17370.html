			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Anisimov and Yevgeniy Kirsanov report: "Rebukes </F> Whistled Past Gerashchenko's Temple Like Bullets"]    [Text] The latest, fourth congress of the Association of  Russian Banks, which have recently been increasingly frequently  called the "fifth estate," was held in Moscow Thursday and  Friday [21-22 April]. This estate, however, can also aspire to  a higher title: Few people today would risk casting doubt on  the influence of commercial banks. In all, there are more than  2,000 banks in Russia, and the association has united almost 800  of them -- naturally, the largest and most respectable financial  establishments primarily become its members. The banks' actual  influence on the economy is so great that both the government  and the Central Bank of Russia deemed it necessary to tell the  bankers of their intentions.    In particular, O. Soskovets, vice premier of the Russian  Government, announced an upcoming revision of tax policy. He  said that it will be aimed at creating the most favorable  possible conditions for capital investments in production. But  he at once "gladdened" those assembled with the fact that the  government has a project according to which they must channel  into developing the agro-industrial complex up to one-half of  the profits made on deals in the currency market and on other  "speculative" deals.    V. Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank of Russia, was the  traditional target for the bankers' attacks. They criticized  him harshly for the archaic system of transactions, for the  inordinately high interest rate on centralized credits, and for  many other things. There is no point in enumerating all the  grounds for criticism, since this time too Mr. Gerashchenko  turned a deaf ear to the rebukes.    Even though one of the most painful questions -- the  admission of foreign banks onto Russian territory -- was  discussed at the congress, it rarely found itself at the center  of attention. To all appearances, there will be no radical  indulgences for foreign banks in the immediate future.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Pakistan to seek Dollars 2.4bn aid deal THE Pakistani government will seek Dollars 2.4bn in fresh assistance from members of Aid to Pakistan consortium, which begins its meeting in Paris today. Despite economic pressures caused by a drop in international prices for cotton and yarn, and last year's rise in the oil import bill after the Gulf War, Pakistan, in presenting its case, is expected to highlight signs of economic growth. According to official estimates, the projected growth rate for 1991/92 is 6.5 per cent, exports have risen by 13 per cent and inflation has declined from 12.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent. Among the country's major liabilities during the year ahead, debt servicing alone would account for Dollars 1.5bn which would absorb a major portion of commitments made in Paris. Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, who is leading the Pakistani delegation, said before his departure there were good prospects of obtaining this amount of aid. Pakistan would present plans for a social action programme to improve the status of the poor, and a new environmental strategy. 'The social action programme is the second wheel of our development strategy, one being accelerated growth and investment through privatisation and deregulation, the other being a very strong social action programme,' added Mr Aziz. Western economists and government sources say the programme has been prepared in response to concerns from donors, some of whom want Pakistan to double its spending in the social sectors from the current level of between 3 to 4 per cent of GDP. The environmental strategy has also come in response to concerns over continued deforestation and soil erosion, resulting from an annual population growth rate of 3.3 per cent and inadequate resource allocations for these sectors. Among other concerns, western donors are expected to examine the country's large defence spending, which absorbs almost a third of the budget. Officials say the issue remains sensitive, because of continuing tensions with India, and due to resistance from the politically influential army.</p>

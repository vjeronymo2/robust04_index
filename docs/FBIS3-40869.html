			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jakarta (KOMPAS)--Harmoko, general chairman of the  GOLKAR [Functional Group] DPP [Central Executive Council] said  that each sociopolitical organization is entitled to be a  "single majority." GOLKAR's present position as single majority  was decided by voters who channeled their political rights  through GOLKAR. It is not true that its position could plunge  Indonesia into a culture of "dictatorship of the majority and  tyranny of the minority."    "There is no need to worry about a single majority. The  people elected GOLKAR because they accepted GOLKAR's program,"  Harmoko told reporters who stopped him at the Department of  Information on Tuesday [11 January].    According to Harmoko, each sociopolitical organization must  fight in the general elections to win a majority. "That is true  everywhere in the world. Although there may be only two or three  sociopolitical organizations, there is certain to be a battle to  win a majority. GOLKAR fully realizes that its position as  single majority is the will of the voting public.    Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, former GOLKAR DPP secretary general,  expressed a similar view when asked for comment. "What is  expected? A single majority is the result of general elections.  Show me a country anywhere that does not have a single  majority," Sarwono said following a national PROKASIH [Clean  River Program] working meeting at the Department of Home  Affairs. "It is more unlikely that election results would be  divided among sociopolitical organizations to give the  appearance of democracy."    When asked about the statement of Megawati Sukarnoputri,  general chairperson of the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party]  DPP, who said she worried that the ideas and zeal of the single  majority could plunge Indonesia into a culture of dictatorship  of the majority and tyranny of the minority, Harmoko stated  there is no need for such worry.    "GOLKAR continues to promote deliberation to achieve  consensus, in legislatures as well as in other institutions.  GOLKAR continues to promote Pancasila [ideology of the  Indonesian state] democracy," Harmoko said. As for Sarwono, he  replied concisely, "I do not understand why Ms. Mega said that."  <H5>  Please Do So </H5>   Harmoko acknowledged that the tour he made of the provinces  after being elected GOLKAR DPP general chairman was an effort to  maintain GOLKAR's position as single majority. However, he  rejected the statement that GOLKAR's present majority position  is only quantitative and not yet qualitative. "What GOLKAR has  been fighting for qualitatively and quantitatively is in  accordance with applicable laws. We have never done anything in  the elections that is not `sympathetic,'" Harmoko said.    In her speech on the 21st anniversary of the PDI, Megawati  had also called for reconsideration of whether the term `single  majority' is consistent with the 1945 Constitution. When the  statement was passed on to Harmoko, the GOLKAR DPP general  chairman replied, "How can the will of the people be  misinterpreted as inconsistent with the 1945 Constitution? That  is not true. How can it be contrary to the 1945 Constitution for  the political rights of the people to be channeled through one  party? That is not true. What are the arguments?"    "If another sociopolitical organization wants to be the  `single majority,' please let them do so. It is natural that  each sociopolitical organization would want to do that. If the  people then elect GOLKAR, it cannot be stopped," he said. The  GOLKAR general chairman denied that GOLKAR's victory in the  general elections was because of support by GOLKAR external  elements, including the "superstructure."  <H5>  Not Contradictory </H5>   Meanwhile, Dr. Albert Hasibuan, S.H. [Master of Laws], and  Martin Hutabarat, who were contacted separated, said that the  existence of a single majority will not lead to a political  culture of "dictatorship of the majority and tyranny of the  minority" that would be contradictory to the spirit of  deliberation and consensus. Such a spirit of deliberation and  consensus is very dependent on the spirit of state  administrators and leaders of sociopolitical organizations and  not on the existence of a single majority.    "The desire of a party to get the most votes is natural.  Just  think of the alternative: If a party does not want to be a  `single majority,' it must hold back lest it get the most votes.  Would that not make it difficult for the party itself?" asked  Albert Hasibuan, who is general chairman of the LPPH (Institute  for the Publicizing and Study of Law).    Therefore, said Hasibuan, it is the right of every  organization participating in general elections to win a single  majority by democratic means.    Hasibuan surmised that the recent emergence of discussion  was  prompted by suspicion that a single majority will create a  monopoly in decisionmaking. Under Pancasila democracy, however,  a decision does not depend on the existence of a single majority  but on the rightness of the issue for which a decision must be  made.    According to Hasibuan, it would be better if statements on  single majority were put in the context of dialectic dynamics,  so that everyone would try to move the next general elections  toward being more democratic. The important things are that  democracy be adhered to and that votes are not "engineered."  <H5>  Strengthening of Legal Institutions </H5>   Like Hasibuan, Martin Hutabarat believes that the principles  of deliberation and consensus and of single majority are two  different things. Deliberation and consensus is a decisionmaking  method, while single majority is the goal of an election  participant organization for the sake of ensuring the stability  of development.    Hutabarat said that a single majority does not automatically  lead to "dictatorship of the majority and tyranny of the  minority," which would ultimately neglect the deliberation and  consensus principle. "That depends on the spirit of state  administrators. Do they want to maintain a spirit of family and  of deliberation and consensus, or not?" Hutabarat asked.    Nevertheless, Hutabarat said, it is not enough to depend on  the spirit of state administrators. Therefore, the support of  other elements is needed if the spirit of state administrators  is to be maintained. This includes, for example, openness of the  press, which has been actively promoting issues of openness and  transparency.    According to Hutabarat, another element is the strengthening  of legal institutions, such as state administrative  jurisprudence and the National Commission on Basic Human Rights.  "For example, if a person is dismissed from his job because he  joined the PDI, he can now appeal that decision to the PTUN  [State Administrative Court]. That is a control that prevents  state administrators from acting arbitrarily," he said.  <H5>  No Conditions </H5>   Meanwhile, two DPR members from other factions, namely Ali  Hardi Kiaidemak of the FPP [Development Unity Faction] and Y.B.  Wiyanjono of the F-PDI [PDI Faction] said in separate interviews  that the idea and spirit of single majority are acceptable for  all political parties as long as there are no conditions. If the  situation is otherwise, however, the worry over dictatorship of  the majority and tyranny of the minority is justifiable.    According to Kiaidemak, all political parties have the  desire  to be big, but that desire should not bring about practices  outside the democratic concept. He said he is confident that as  long as all political players adhere to the democratic concept,  a single majority will not bring forth a terrible dictatorship  or tyranny.    Wiyanjono, however, said that if the single majority sets  conditions, as it does now, he is confident that sooner or later  it will create an unhealthy political climate. This is  particularly true if it produces a tendency toward unfairness to  other political parties. "Thus, I support what Megawati said,"  Wiyanjono said.    Through spokesman Taheri Noor, the ABRI [Indonesian Armed  Forces] Faction stressed that the single majority issue depends  on the aspect from which it is viewed. If seen from the liberal  aspect, a single majority admittedly could create dictatorship  and tyranny. If viewed from the aspect of Pancasila, however,  that will not happen.    "Therefore, we must establish the concept or point of view  of  single majority. We should not hastily draw conclusions that  could produce a high level of polemic," said Taheri.    Under the Pancasila concept there is no such term as  "dictatorship" or "tyranny." There is only deliberation and  consensus, which can be achieved despite the existence of a  single majority. Therefore, the single majority must be retained.  <H5>  Interferes With Consensus </H5>   On the other hand, political observer Dr. Afan Gaffar  stressed that the single majority idea clearly can interfere  with the process of achieving consensus through deliberation.  The majority party will use every means to achieve victory for  its programs, especially those related to political interests.  On the other side, minority parties will find it difficult to  present proposals.    "A single majority is still needed, however, and everyone  has  the right to be the single majority. In fact, if GOLKAR wins  only 40 percent of the vote in the next general elections, it  will still be the majority sociopolitical organization. That  will be especially true if it is supported by 100 DPR members  from the ABRI Faction," said the instructor from the staff of  the UGM [Gadjah Mada University] Sociology and Political Science  Faculty.    "Actually, a party's becoming a single majority is not a  problem, as long as it is done democratically. In other words,  there should be no voting fraud or holding of seminars on how to  vote that profit only a particular party," he said.    In this connection, Afan Gaffar feels that there is indeed a  need to revise the implementation of general elections, because  although there have been improvements in quality since 1971, the  improvements have not been significant. Under revised general  election implementation, it is hoped that each sociopolitical  organization will be able to do its utmost to seek voter  support, consistent with existing political norms and ethics.  "The question is whether GOLKAR will want to approve changes in  the general election law, which has benefited GOLKAR," Afan  Gaffar said.</p>

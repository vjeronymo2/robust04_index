			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Management: Rule by consensus - Kabi Pharmacia's chief executive exemplifies the Swedish way / Euromanagers to Watch AS CAREER moves go, it could hardly have been better timed. In the four years since Hakan Astrom joined Sweden's Kabi pharmaceuticals group, he has shinned up the corporate ladder at the same time as the company has gone through a dynamic period of expansion. Sales have grown 10 times since he took the helm. In 1989 he was worried the company was too small to survive. Today he sits at the top of Europe's eighth largest pharmaceuticals group and one of the world's top 20 - the jewel in the crown of the food and pharmaceuticals group Procordia. Astrom, 46, is nothing if not modest about his success. Of his elevation to the post of chief executive in March 1992, he comments it was a fortuitous reshuffle around him that brought him the top job. 'There was no-one left but me for Kabi Pharmacia,' he says. Colleagues say the promotion was merited by his intelligence, in-depth knowledge of pharmaceuticals and capacity for hard work. His tendency towards self-deprecation is part of a manner that is low-key. In conversation Astrom is soft-spoken, undemonstrative and easy-going. He is not outwardly dynamic, comments a colleague, who adds that he is a far less dominant figure within the company than Hakan Mogren, boss of Sweden's other big pharmaceuticals company, Astra. Part of the reason is that Astrom works in the shadow of Jan Ekberg, Procordia chief executive and a former boss of Kabi. But his manner sits well with a management style that emphasises teamwork and consensus. Management is about getting the 'commitment and involvement' of those around you, and not just giving orders, he stresses. 'You get the best out of people if they have been involved in the decision-making process and understand why a decision has been taken,' he maintains. Consensus-style management is part of a Swedish tradition and culture. It is a process that extends to the shop-floor through the extensive consultation rights of trade unions. Astrom does not criticise the process of union involvement. 'The unions have the same objectives as management, which is to develop a good company. It is a strength, particularly in periods of change, to know that unions are supportive of a given strategy.' He notes that in other countries, managements often use unions as an excuse for not doing things. He goes further in suggesting that the management of a big international pharmaceuticals group also needs the direct input of its specialists and researchers. 'These groups expect to participate in the life of the company, but they also have a lot of knowledge which has to be brought into the management process,' he says. But he admits that this can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Unions, for example, are consulted at corporate, divisional and plant level, while Astrom has a monthly meeting with union representatives. 'It's much easier to be a manager in a country where there is more emphasis on giving orders because what you are saying is not really questioned. But it doesn't mean you will reach the right decision. With the Swedish way, you are more likely to have challenges if decisions are not right.' Not everyone is so enthusiastic. As one foreign observer says: 'Swedes don't like to take decisions individually, which can mean they are rather weak and slow to make up their minds.' Astrom does not accept this, and points to the current integration of Kabi with the newly acquired Italian pharmaceutical group Farmitalia Carlo Erba to make his point. 'This deal was only completed in May, and yet already we have moved very quickly to get the new management teams in place in all the countries where we will be operating. You can combine both speed and accuracy of decision making with a management style of involvement and commitment,' he maintains. Astrom confesses to being a workaholic - his working day can easily stretch from 8am to 10pm - but he also finds time to pore over management books and articles. One result of his reading has been a new emphasis on time-based management, or a programme called TTM 50 which aims to cut delivery times to market by 50 per cent. Important as measures like this are, he believes there are dangers in becoming too caught up in internal processes. 'It's very easy to get internally focused, but the key to management is to maintain an external focus as well so that you don't lose sight of the customer, the market and the competitive situation. It's important to establish a strategic direction, so that everyone in the group is heading towards the same goal.' Though clearly a defender of Swedish management style, Astrom believes the Swedes lose out in having a limited number of foreigners in senior management positions, even in the country's big multinationals. It's not surprising, he says, given Sweden's climate, high tax rates and generally low pay levels by international standards. 'But it will have to change. Sweden needs to become less insular,' he states. New turmoil awaits Kabi in the autumn as Procordia - which is part-state-owned and part owned by Volvo - is split into its food and pharmaceutical segments as part of a resolution of an ownership dispute between the two main shareholders. Volvo is to take over the food operations, while what is left of Procordia will be vertically integrated with its pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses. For Astrom it almost certainly means he will be playing second fiddle again to Jan Ekberg, at least in the short term, probably as one of several vice-presidents. 'It is a lesser role,' he says without a trace of wounded pride. 'On the other hand the company is much bigger now, and the challenges ahead are tremendous.' These challenges suggest he will remain with the group in the short-term, at least until the Kabi and Farmitalia Carlo Erba integration is complete. This will take several years and for the moment he is not looking beyond that. 'You shape your career path by creating results. If you create results, you will over time be rewarded,' he says.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel A. Voskresenskiy] </F>   [Text] The OPS-5 water distillation plant was accepted into  troop supply in 1990 to replace the OPS plant and is designed to  desalinate, neutralize, and purify water. Unlike  thermocompression desalination of water, the OPS-5 uses the  highly productive progressive method of membrane isolation of  the media--reverse osmosis.    The technology of reverse osmosis desalination of water is  noted for high reliability and simplicity of design, and makes  it possible to decrease the size characteristics and  power-intensity of the plant. Depending on the salt content of  the source water and the depth of its demineralization, the  OPS-5 plant provides for a stepped desalination, making it  possible to do deep demineralization of water and obtain lightly  mineralized water of up to 1-2 grams/liter.    The plant ensures complete purification of water by treating  it with chlorine-containing preparations with subsequent  dechlorination in a sorption filter.    The plant includes water purification and desalination  equipment, a power-generating unit, a PLVS laboratory, RDV-5000  reservoirs, reagents, and a spare parts, tool, and accessories  kit. All equipment in the OPS-5 plant is arranged on one  KRAZ-260G base chassis. The power-generating unit is actuated  from the vehicle's transfer gearbox.    The OPS-5 plant's output for desalination of water is twice  as high as the OPS plant, and the power consumption has been cut  40 percent.    The OPS-5 plant can be used in areas experiencing a shortage  of fresh water, on seagoing vessels, and also in emergencies and  ecological catastrophes.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Basic Specifications of the OPS-5                                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Base                                  |KRAZ-260G motor vehicle               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Output for water with following salt  |                                      |  |content:                              |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2-6 g/l, cubic meter/hr               |6-5                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5-18 g/l, cubic meter/hr              |5-3                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |18-35 g/l, cubic meter/hr             |3-18                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Set-up time until receipt of desalina-|2                                     |  |ted water, hrs                        |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Shut-down time, hr                    |1                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fuel consumption, l/hr                |22                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weight, t                             |21.6                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Crew size                             |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

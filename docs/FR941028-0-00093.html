			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Effect of the Rule on State Programs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The provisions of section 503(a)(1) of the Act require that State laws regulating surface coal mining and reclamation operations be ``in accordance with'' the requirements of the Act. Further, section 503(a)(7) of the Act requires that State programs contain rules and regulations ``consistent with'' regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These terms are defined at &sect;730.5 of title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations to require that State programs contain procedures which are, with respect to the Act, no less stringent than the Act; and with respect to the Secretary's regulations, no less effective than the Secretary's regulations in meeting the requirements of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following promulgation of this final rule, OSM will evaluate State programs to determine whether any changes in these programs will be necessary. If the Director determines that any State program provisions should be amended to be made no less effective than the revised Federal rules, the individual States will be notified in accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Federal Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The collection of information contained in this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . and assigned clearance numbers 1029&hyph;0034, 1029&hyph;0041, and 1029&hyph;0051. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778; Civil Justice Reform Certification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under the applicable standards of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195). In general, the requirements of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778 are covered by the preamble discussion of this rule. Additional remarks follow concerning individual elements of the Executive Order: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. What is the Preemptive Effect, if any, to be Given to the Regulation? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rule would have the same preemptive effect as other standards adopted pursuant to SMCRA. To retain primacy, States have to adopt and apply standards for their regulatory programs that are no less effective than those set forth in OSM's rules. Any State law that is inconsistent with, or that would preclude implementation of this proposed rule would be subject to preemption under SMCRA section 505 and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 730.11. To the extent that the rules would result in preemption of State law, the provisions of SMCRA are intended to preclude inconsistent State laws and regulations. This approach is established in SMCRA, and has been judicially affirmed. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Ass'n, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  452 U.S. 264 (1981). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. What is the Effect on Existing Federal Law or Regulation, if any, Including all Provisions Repealed or Modified? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule modifies the implementation of SMCRA as described herein, and is not intended to modify the implementation of any other Federal statute. The preceding discussion of this rule specifies the Federal regulatory provisions that are affected by this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Does the Rule Provide a Clear and Certain Legal Standard for Affected Conduct Rather than a General Standard, While Promoting Simplification and Burden Reduction? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The standard established by this rule are as clear and certain as practicable, given the complexity of topics covered and the mandates of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. What is the Retroactive Effect, if any, to be Given to the Regulation? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Norway moves to protect currency NORWAY'S central bank raised its key overnight lending rate yesterday by one percentage point to 11 per cent. The aim was to relieve pressure on the krone caused by recent European interest rate rises, especially in Sweden and Finland. The overnight rate was last changed in September 1991 when it was raised from 9.5 per cent. The central bank also raised the credit rate - the interest rate the banks receive on central bank deposits - from 9 to 11 per cent. Mr Hermod Skaanland, Norway's central bank governor, rejected suggestions that devaluation has been considered as an alternative to defend the krone. He said the central bank in August bought NKr7.5bn (Pounds 682m) to support the currency and had waited as long as it could before raising rates. Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, did not raise lending rates yesterday but said it could not rule out a future increase.</p>

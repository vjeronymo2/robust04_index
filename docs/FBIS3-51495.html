			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari </F> during a signing ceremony for the Pact for Stability,  Competitiveness, and Employment at Los Pinos Presidential  Residence in Mexico City -- live]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: The fact that labor,  peasant, and business organizations today reaffirmed their full  commitment with the terms of the Pact for Competitiveness and  Employment and agreed to strengthen and broaden it is of great  importance. Today, you have shown more proof of unity and work  in favor of Mexico's best interests.    For the nation, the pact means that the nation is moving on  the path toward stability and growth. Moreover, it represents  the efforts undertaken by each sector and each Mexican to help  the country curb inflation, advance in the modernization of its  industrial plants, and above all, give more attention to the  most needy.    I must stress that inflation hurts most those who earn the  least, and it shrinks the income of Mexicans. Now, after  significant advancements, we have abated the most unjust tax to  levels that for the first time will benefit more than half of  the population -- young people who under the age of 25.    Therefore, with their work and commitment to the pact, the  economic sectors have contributed to inspire in the Mexican  people new hope for a better future. Today we have renewed our  willingness to discuss our problems and reach concerted  agreements within the law as the only path Mexicans accept to  meet our challenges and advance toward our goals. Government  actions have been based on this principle for more than five  years, moving forward with a new outlook -- an outlook of  discipline, tolerance, and a clear concept of social justice.    First, the agreement you have signed reaffirms the general  guidelines and specific efforts previously agreed to in  consolidating our economic and social advancements.    Second, within the framework of the policy of fiscal and  monetary discipline, the federal government commits itself to  guarantee that the real increase in public expenses for  employment and social programs -- which are very significant --  will reach the communities and the population more  expeditiously. I must remind you that the government spends  more now in resolving social problems because it maintains  healthy public finances. As we have already announced, in 1994  social expenses will surpass 50 percent of the government  budget, almost 10 percent of the GNP. These are the highest  figures in our history. In this manner, our social and economic  policies are consolidated as a solid pillar of a broad and  profound strategy for the benefit of those who earn less.    Third, the labor and business sectors -- within a framework  of respect and solidarity, and, above all else, while taking  into consideration the nation's best interests -- they are  committing themselves to preventing and giving prompt solution  to disputes that could emerge among the various productive  forces.    Fourth, the agreement stresses the priority attention that  Mexican rural areas deserve and will receive. We will continue  working together to make sure that rural areas will receive  opportunities and a dignified and productive way of life.    Finally, the various sectors that signed the agreement will  have to work intensively, redoubling efforts. We will reinforce  the established mechanisms in order to give the necessary  follow-up to the acquired commitments, maintaining close  communication among all economic sectors.    Today and here, we reaffirm our commitment to defend and  consolidate what we have built with so much work and effort,  always based on our pluralism, our solidarity, and always --  always -- based on the law.    Ladies and gentlemen: It is within the legal path that we  will guarantee social peace and tranquillity in Mexican homes,  as well as a just and sustained development for the benefit of  all our compatriots. Following that path -- the path of the  law, which benefits us all, because we must all abide by the law  -- we will be able to advance in peace toward our objectives of  growth and social justice. Thefore, at this renewed phase of  the pact, we reaffirm our commitment with the state of law,  which guarantees the defense of our most precious values.    There are serious problems we must face. At all times,  however, it has been through concerted efforts and strict  compliance with the law that the Mexican people have attained  their goals. Let us clearly understand and remember that no  problem, no matter how great or complex, is unsurmountable by  itself. The government and society will continue working for  the country's sovereign development with the unity of all  Mexicans.    Therefore, today we again reaffirm our pride as Mexicans and  our confidence in our future. Thank you very much. [applause]</p>

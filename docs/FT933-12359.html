			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gucci chief in fight to retain 50% shareholding - Court battle for control of luxury goods maker A FIERCE battle for control of luxury goods maker Gucci is being launched in the US courts and threatens to be as bloody as the family rivalries which rocked the Italian fashion house for more than a decade. Investcorp, the international investment bank based in Bahrain which owns 50 per cent of Gucci, is seeking to unseat the chairman and grandson of the founder and win control of his 50 per cent stake through two court actions begun in New York this week. The bank claims that several operating subsidiaries of what was once one of Italy's greatest fashion houses are 'in or near insolvency' due to the conduct of Mr Maurizio Gucci. Investcorp has won a temporary order freezing his 50 per cent stake for 10 days. The action was taken following Investcorp's claims that he was seeking to put his holding out of the reach of the bank, which has rights of first refusal over the shares. Maurizio is the last remaining Gucci on the board and was the apparent victor in a fight for control of the 70-year-old company which set fathers, sons, brothers and cousins against one another in the 1980s. Investcorp is also seeking to remove Mr Gucci through an arbitration procedure alleging several violations of the shareholder agreement drawn up in 1991, when Investcorp took its 47.8 per cent stake to 50 per cent. Mr Gucci is alleged to have pledged shares to secure debts and borrowed Dollars 800,000 (Pounds 533,000) from Gucci America without Investcorp's knowledge. Furthermore, Investcorp also alleges that in 1991 Mr Gucci planned to auction 90 per cent of his stake to pay off a judgment against him. Questioned on how he managed to repay the debt at the eleventh hour, without selling his shares, Investcorp claims Mr Gucci said he had found the money under the floorboards of his house after 'being visited in a dream by the ghost of his father'. A spokesman for Investcorp said the decision to resolve the dispute in court followed two years of discussions with Mr Gucci over managing the company. It is believed the bank has offered Mr Gucci the titular chairmanship as long as it controls day-to-day running of the company. The bank is believed to have identified a number of possible replacements for Mr Gucci. Spokesmen for Mr Gucci in Milan dismissed the initiative. The arbitration procedure 'can have no influence on the Gucci group shares, which are and will remain Maurizio Gucci's', and the company would continue to be run normally, they said. Any conduct 'injurious' to the agreement between Mr Gucci and Investcorp 'is solely attributable to the Arab shareholders', according to Gucci. As for the criticisms of the group's management, these reflect a 'distorted reading of the facts and strategies', which emerges in the 'divergent judgments about the real situation of the Gucci group'. The bank, which has come to prominence by purchasing, developing and selling on western luxury goods companies such as Tiffany, Chaumet and most recently Saks Fifth Avenue, claims Gucci has been deprived of vital funding. Investcorp alleges that attempts to inject capital of between Dollars 50m and Dollars 100m, in return for a controlling stake in Gucci, have been rejected by Maurizio. Gucci has had a troubled time since the bitter family dispute which distracted managers' attention from running the business was finally resolved in 1990. Mr Gucci has tried to rationalise the group's products and geographical expansion, both of which had grown out of hand in the booming 1980s. The aim has been to return Gucci to its roots as a producer of up-market accessories, notably shoes and bags, and clothing, rather than attach its name to any articles which might sell. The number of authorised sales outlets has also been pared, with a sharp reduction in stores which are not deemed to be sufficiently upmarket or suitably located to reflect the Gucci name. In addition, the product range has been purged. However, the restructuring has coincided with the severe recession in the luxury goods market. Italian newspaper readers were astonished this month to see discreet advertisements for an end of season sale at Gucci's flagship stores in Milan's via Montenapoleone. Sales are estimated to have fallen from more than Dollars 300m three years ago to less than Dollars 180m, while a profit of Dollars 50m has been reversed into a loss of more than Dollars 30m. Gucci is also reported to be struggling with a serious liquidity problem. Matters have not been helped by the increasingly strained relations between Mr Gucci and Investcorp. Late last year, strong rumours circulated that the company, or a significant stake, was to be sold to the UK's Dunhill group. The reports, swiftly denied, were immediately attributed by Mr Gucci's aides to an ill-advised attempt by Investcorp to step up the pressure on the family at an increasingly difficult time in the market.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHILD DEPORTEES FACE ABUSE, ACTIVIST SAYS  </P> <P> Children deported to Mexico after illegally entering Southern California are  routinely thrown together with juvenile criminals in Tijuana jails where they  are often mistreated and abused, according to an immigrants rights advocate who  visited Los Angeles to rally support for a petition to the Mexican government  on behalf of the youngsters.  </P> <P> Jose Luis Perez Canchola, director of the Center for Migrant Investigations and  Studies, said last week that U.S. immigration authorities turn over about 20  unaccompanied youngsters daily to Mexican authorities, an increase of more than  25% over the previous year.  </P> <P> The increase has also been noted by social workers in Los Angeles who say they  have seen a growth in the number of homeless immigrant children traveling on  their own.  </P> <P> The children are held in jail for about a week, pending deportation to their  countries or passage back to their homes in the interior of Mexico, Perez said.  Most range in age from 9 to 16, he said.  </P></p>

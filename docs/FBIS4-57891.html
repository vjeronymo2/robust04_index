			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 17 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Today in La Paz,  Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Sanjines Yanez revealed  that after years of investigation, Army intelligence has  detected indications of the active presence of subversive groups  in the Cochabamba tropical region.    This information was disclosed a few hours after Gen. Guido  Tavera Leyton, commander of the 7th Army Division, said that  next month, there will be an "active" presence of military units  in the tropical regions of Cochabamba Department to verify the  presence of subversive groups in that zone.    In La Paz, Army Commander Gen. Reynaldo Caceres Quiroga  recently told LOS TIEMPOS that the Armed Forces are carrying out  antisubversive training daily in Chapare and other parts of the  national territory. He denied, however, that his command had  ordered the deployment of members of the Rene Barrientos Ortuno  and Capitan Victor Ustarez Regiments, which are stationed in  Tolata and Colomi respectively.</p>

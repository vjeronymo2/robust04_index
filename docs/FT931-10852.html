			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Van Miert warns energy utilities EC competition commissioner Karel van Miert has warned European governments and energy utilities that they should end monopolies on intra-EC imports and exports of gas and electricity. He told a Brussels conference on Wednesday evening that he favoured security of energy supply - one argument put forward by energy utilities resisting liberalisation - but attempting to define security of supply in purely national terms was 'out of date'. His comments echoed those of his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, now trade commissioner, but Mr Van Miert's tone was much less confrontational. For example, he did not threaten to use special Commission powers to attack national monopolies. Draft legislation to allow consumers to buy electricity and gas from any EC supplier is stalled at ministerial level because of government opposition. The conference - inspired by French utilities in the fields of water, energy, telecommunications, road, rail and postal services - yesterday launched a European charter aimed to promote benefits of the French model of public utilities. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, welcomed the initiative as the beginning of a new era for public service companies. Utilities had suffered a series of unjustified 'frontal attacks' in recent years based on 'dogmatic and ideological' objections, he said. French public monopolies believe the appointment of Mr Van Miert, a Belgian Socialist, as competition commissioner will ease ideological pressure. During the conference, Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, French housing, transport and infrastructure minister, said he hoped Mr Van Miert would introduce a 'different spirit'. Mr Van Miert said he did not consider the application of competition policy alone would automatically make things better; he repeated his view that other elements - like social and environment policy - should be taken into account. But he warned the audience: 'If you think I'm a sort of anti-Sir Leon, forget it.'</p>

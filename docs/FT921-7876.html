			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Guyanese gold output at 76-year high AN INCREASE in payments to miners has led to an expansion in Guyana's gold production, which reached 59,300 troy ounces last year, 20,300 ounces more than in 1990, 4,300 ounces more than the industry had forecast and the highest for 76 years. The Guyana Gold Board and the Miners Association in the English-speaking republic on the north eastern shoulder of South America, are anticipating production of 100,000 ounces this year, and significantly higher levels from next year when a major new mine begins production. The local industry said the expansion in production is the result of a deregulation of Guyana's foreign exchange market and the consequent payment to miners at rates which were not pegged to the official exchange rate of the Guyana dollar. An agreement with the government allowed the miners to keep a half of their earnings from gold in hard currency - a move which officials say provided a powerful incentive for increased production. Guyana's gold is produced mainly by individual miners working alluvial deposits. Before the new incentives were offered, say government officials, much of Guyana's gold was smuggled across the country's borders to Venezuela, Brazil and Suriname, because of higher prices. The industry is expecting a further expansion in national output from a USDollars 150m venture by two Canadian companies, Golden Star Resources and Cambior. They are opening a mine in the Omai District of Guyana, where production is expected to begin by late this year. Annual output from next year is projected at an average 255,000 ounces annually during mine's anticipated life span of about 10 years. Guyana's diamond production last year, at 22,000 carats, was just over 7,000 carats more than 1990 output. The increase has been attributed by government officials to changes in the manner in which miners are allowed to declare production. The government recently removed the need for miners to produce extensive documentation to back their declared production.</p>

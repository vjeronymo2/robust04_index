			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EASY GOER FACES TOUGH COMPETITION  </P> <P> Easy Goer takes a four-race winning streak into the $1,099,000 Jockey Club Gold  Cup on Saturday against a seven-horse field that includes the only other horse  to beat archrival Sunday Silence this year.  </P> <P> The 1 1/2-mile Gold Cup will be Easy Goer's last race before once again  confronting Sunday Silence in the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 4 at Gulfstream  Park. In all likelihood, Horse of the Year will be at stake.  </P> <P> First, however, Easy Goer must contend with a field, entered today, which  includes the 3-year-old colt Prized, who beat Sunday Silence in the Swaps  Stakes one start after Easy Goer beat him at the Belmont.  </P> <P> Easy Goer will be ridden by Pat Day. Eddie Delahoussaye gets the ride aboard  Prized. Also in the field will be three horses Easy Goer already has beaten --  Forever Silver, Cryptoclearance and Its Acedemic -- along with Jack of Clubs  and Impersonator.  </P></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Strike by lecturers ruled unlawful Further-education employers yesterday won a 'landmark' High Court ruling that a planned strike by lecturers was unlawful because they had not been provided with the names of the potential strikers. Natfhe, the lecturers' union involved, immediately appealed, and the case will be heard by the Appeal Court this morning. The union plans to hold a one-day strike on Tuesday next week in protest against new flexible contracts. Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the Colleges' Employers' Forum, described the judgment as a 'landmark', and said only 28 per cent of lecturers had voted for action. Natfhe described the ruling as a 'disaster for the liberties of trade union members'. Unions and labour lawyers were surprised at the move. Mr John Bowers, a leading labour lawyer, said: 'This is an unexpected interpretation of the law, and it seems strange that an injunction should be given on those grounds alone.' Ms Sue Berryman, the union's chief negotiator, said: 'Parliament will be seen to have been misled by ministers who resisted amendments to the new laws on the grounds that trade unions would not be expected to reveal the names of their members to employers.' The change to the law on balloting - which was part of the 1993 Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act - appears to have been designed to prevent unions from surprising large employers over which groups of workers they call out on strike. Mr Brendan Barber, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said this interpretation of the law was an invitation to employers to put pressure on workers before voting. Providing lists of members who were voting in strike ballots would be a bureaucratic burden for unions.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Owners crashes on warning HOLIDAY stocks were rocked by two numbing announcements yesterday, with profits warnings from both Owners Abroad and Euro Disney sending the two groups' shares sharply lower and leading other related stocks down. The most dramatic statement came from Owners as it revealed that full-year results would probably be around half what the market was expecting. Although the revelation came just 45 minutes before the market closed, Owners still managed a 48 per cent fall. It staged a slight recovery to close at 66p, a dramatic decline of 32 1/2 in brisk turnover of 2.6m. Only around 100,000 shares had been traded prior to the announcement. This latest development at the UK's second biggest tour operator will be yet another blow to the company's credibility in the market. Shortly after it had closely fought off the bid from Airtours earlier this year, Owners angered analysts by advising them to lower their profits estimates, which had been a cornerstone of their defence against Airtours. Cuts to around Pounds 27m were made then. Yesterday, the more gloomier analysts were predicting that Owners would be lucky to break Pounds 10m. In a statement issued after the market closed, Airtours said that Owners' excuses that a fall-off in demand had contributed to their problems flew in the face of its own estimates of a 6 per cent growth this year. Hoare Govett had similar figures, and Mr Hamish Dickson, the broker's leisure analyst, said: 'They obviously took their eye off the ball during the Airtours bid.' In spite of the sweeping management changes made yesterday, leisure specialists forecast more downside to the shares. But late market gossip suggested that Owners' biggest shareholder, the German travel group LTU, whose 29.99 per cent stake was largely bought at up to 150p a share during the Airtours bid, may yet come to the rescue with a full offer. Airtours lost 3 1/2 to 334p, Eurocamp, which itself issued a profits warning last week, fell 6 to 187p and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which owns Centre Parcs, dipped 5 to 459p.</p>

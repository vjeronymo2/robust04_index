			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (8): Privatisation the driving force - Some record offerings are likely to come to the market in a year or so / International equities, Tracy Corrigan says business is holding up well Business in the international equities market has held up well this year, in the face of weaker domestic stock markets and volatile interest rate conditions. In the first quarter, the volume of new international equity issues reached Dollars 11.6bn, according to Euromoney, well above last year's first quarter total of just over Dollars 5bn. However, last year's bumper volume of Dollars 36.5bn was weighted towards the second half of the year, as the strong performance of stock markets encouraged a number of governments to push ahead with privatisation programmes. This year, although the types of new issues remain diverse - ranging from secondary offerings of common stock, to global depositary receipts and initial public offerings - privatisation is the driving force, particularly in Europe. The poor performance of emerging markets in Asia and Latin America this year has hit business in those areas hardest, though some analysts believe issues from these regions now offer better value. The increase in volume also reflects a growing trend towards structuring equity offerings as international rather than domestic deals, as institutional investors continue to increase their allocation of assets overseas. 'We still have a bigger pipeline of business than we did this time last year,' said Mr John St John, a director of Kleinwort Benson. However, the worsening of conditions in the stock market has made investors much more sensitive to pricing: increasingly, issuers are being told to price their deals attractively or stay out of the market. Despite the need to price new issues more cheaply the flow of deals has not abated. This is because many governments which have embarked upon privatisation programmes are not in a position to wait for conditions to improve. 'Basically, governments around the the world are burdened with a big debt problem, an ageing population and a social services superstructure which they can no longer pay for out of taxes,' says Mr St John. 'It's not just that they want to make their companies more efficient: they have to sell off assets to pay for it all.' As a result, some record offerings are likely to come to the market in the next year or so, for example from Germany, where Deutsche Telekom and Lufthansa are expected to be put on the block. The Deutsche Telekom deal, which is likely to take more than a year to come to market, is expected to be the largest equity offering to date, with estimates in the range of DM25bn. The Swedish government recently announced its largest privatisation offering: it is selling SKr 10bn of shares in Pharmacia, the pharmaceuticals group - or 32.5 per cent of the company. Other European countries which still have slates full of privatisation issues include Italy, Austria and Spain. 'There is, waiting in the wings, an enormous amount of privatisation business,' which will not be halted by the more demanding market conditions, according to Mr David Freud, vice-chairman of Warburg International. 'There is too much political goodwill invested in the programmes.' At the same time as governments are privatising state companies, they are acting to relax capital raising controls on non-state companies. In Austria, where the privatisation programme is being accelerated, the taxation rules have been changed to make it more attractive for companies to issue paper. For example, Mayer Melnhof, a private company, recently brought a Dollars 300m offering. Liberalisation of controls has been particularly evident in some Asian countries, such as India, where business has been particularly active. The strength of Asian stock markets helped issues from the area to soar last year, but the market has since become far more selective. Deals now have to be priced attractively to attract institutional investors. The postponement of a planned Dollars 1bn issue for Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the state-controlled international telecommunications monopoly by the Indian government, which would not lower a price considered too high by fund managers, reflects the new mood. But many governments are likely to decide that they would rather accept a slightly lower price for their assets than wait for the market to turn. Deals which are attractively priced can still be oversubscribed: Tele Danmark, the Danish state monopoly telecommunications operator, met strong demand for its sale of 48.3 per cent of its shares yesterday, worth around Dollars 3bn. But US investors are proving particularly selective: several underwriters reported poor US demand for the French privatisation issue for UAP, the insurance company, blaming the pricing and the surplus of financial services deals. Meanwhile, the pace of issuance by US companies - both initial public offerings and secondary offerings - has slackened somewhat. 'I would characterise it as a buyer's market rather than a seller's market,' said Mr Ludovico del Balzo, a managing director of Lehman Brothers. Meanwhile, as the long-term trend towards greater diversification of assets is set to continue, the use of international equity offerings is likely to become increasingly important. In countries such as China, India, and Brazil, the rash of deals launched last year has barely scratched the surface of these huge markets. But in the short term, bankers are learning to tone down their promises to potential issuers. 'In terms of supply, it will be pretty sustained - the key is to make sure that deals come to market at reasonable levels,' Mr del Balzo warns. 'I don't think there is a frenzy of irrationality. In general, people are becoming more realistic.'  ---------------------------------------------- International equities volume (1993-94)  ---------------------------------------------- Launch         Shares       Issues              (Dollars m)  ---------------------------------------------- January        955.39          12 February       904.19          20 March        3,428.63          38 April        1,344.83          25 May          1,990.54          38 June         5,632.88          48 July         3,535.38          41 August       1,053.43          25 September    3,275.10          41 October      4,420.07          38 November     5,644.43          75 December     4,306.57          53  ---------------------------------------------- 1993 total  36,491.45         454  ---------------------------------------------- January      3,028.12          27 February     5,111.02          35 March        3,523.78          42 April        4,999.84          29  ---------------------------------------------- 1994 total  16,662.76         133  ---------------------------------------------- TOTAL       53,154.21         587  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Euromoney  ----------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVEL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  </P> <P> Question: Are there special times of the year for touring the White House?  </P> <P>  Answer: The White House sightseeing tour is conducted year-round. Contact your  senator or congressman for permission to join special tours that may save you  from standing in long lines.  </P> <P>  Q: Are private golf courses in Ireland open to American visitors?  </P> <P>  A: All of Ireland's courses welcome U.S. golfers; greens and caddy fees range  up to $15 U.S. each. It is wise, however, to apply in advance because on some  days there may be tournaments, or all starting times may be filled.  </P> <P> Q: On our European trip we'd like to do some ballooning. Are there tours that  provide this activity?  </P> <P>  A: The Bombard Society packages ballooning tours in France, England, Austria  and Switzerland, varying in length and itineraries. Contact your agent or call  the society at (800) 862-8537.  </P> <P> Q: My travel agent is arranging a European tour for my small group and is using  a foreign tour firm. Isn't that risky?  </P> <P>  A: European tour firms are as competent and financially sound as those in the  United States. Many are even affiliated with the American Society of Travel  Agents. Have your agent check the credentials.  </P> <P> Q: I understand it is possible to stay with a Soviet family as a tourist  visiting the Soviet Union. How is this arranged?  </P> <P>  A: Such stays are being offered by American-Soviet Home Stays, Box 68, Iowa  City, Iowa 52240, and possibly next year by Intourist, the official Soviet  travel bureau, at 630 Fifth Ave., New York 10111, (212) 757-3884, which only  arranges dinner or other brief meetings with a family.  </P> <P> Q: What's the outlook for resumption of tourist travel to Cuba?  </P> <P>  A: Although specialized travel for journalists and others is sanctioned on a  case-by-case basis, no lifting of general restrictions is imminent.  </P> <P> Q: Is it true that all travel agents sell cruises at discounts. If so, are  these discounts the same at every agency?  </P> <P> A: While cruise lines allow their agents to sell below the advertised fare, the  size of the discount can vary from region to region and agent to agent. Be sure  that you deal with agents accredited by the ship lines.  </P> <P> Q: How much cheaper are the fares advertised by ticket consolidators than those  available from regular travel agencies or the airlines directly?  </P> <P> A: With many new low fares being marketed, price differences between the  consolidators and the carriers is narrowing. There are still bargains, however,  through consolidators, which also are available at travel agencies.  </P> <P> Q: Can I obtain travel advice directly from the State Department?  </P> <P> A: The State Department Citizens Emergency Center provides updated information  and current advisories on areas around the world. Call (202) 647-5225.  </P></p>

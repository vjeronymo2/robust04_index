			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Revived rate hopes bring new peaks TURMOIL in European currencies provided the driving forces behind a powerful advance to new highs in the UK equity market yesterday. Share prices extended their gains in the second half of the session when rumours circulated that the Bundesbank might succumb to pressures from other ERM counties and cut rates by a full point this morning. A cut in German rates would open the way for further reductions in UK base rates, analysts believe. The FT-SE Index gained 39.4, breaking through previous intra-day and closing peaks for a final reading of 2,873.8. Heavy volume across the full range of equities also took the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to a new high of 3,023.6, up 28.3 on the day. London was encouraged at the close by widespread gains on Wall Street as it began its new trading session. The fall in sterling to new lows against the mark, French franc and the yen, quickly drove shares in Britain's leading export groups ahead. Sterling was also perceived to be signalling expectations of another cut in UK base rates, the stock market electing to discard the rejection of such plans issued by Downing Street at the beginning of the week. The combination of a further effective devaluation of sterling with more interest rate reductions proved to be a strong stimulant for equities. The advance was checked briefly following news of an annualised increase of 4.1 per cent in M-0 domestic money supply last month, but found renewed strength later as attention turned to the ERM currency pressures. Trading volume remained high, but the Seaq total of 851m shares compared with 854.7m in the previous session. However, with the attention swinging back to the blue chip export-led international stocks, the proportion of non-Footsie shares traded fell to 56 per cent yesterday from around 63 per cent earlier this week. Retail business remained high on Tuesday, returning a value total of Pounds 1.5bn. Yesterday's upswing in the stock market was led by strong gains in interest-related stocks, with property shares again extending the recovery prompted by the renewed optimism on base rates. Banks, where loan books would benefit if doubtful debtors are helped by lower interest rates, also strengthened and insurances also stood out. Market strategists sounded almost helpless in the face of the market's renewed strength but agreed that the FT-SE could easily challenge 2,900 very soon  - unless the mood changes. Fears that depressed sterling may soon show through in the form of higher prices for imported goods were expressed. The stock market is now trading on a multiple of around 18 times existing earnings. But Mr Roger Palmer of Kleinwort Benson Securities pointed to higher earning expectations for 1994 which would bring ratings down to around 12.8. 'London still looks the most attractive of all the major markets,' he said. The excitement generated during the second half of the session brought spectacular gains among the financial stocks. Dealers were cautious regarding some of the more speculative reasons put forward for gains in the sector. Oil shares rounded off a strong session with further gains on the back of the strong opening on Wall Street.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Boycott Urged: Angered by a price increase announced last week, some users of  the Prodigy electronic communication service asking other subscribers not to  buy products promoted through advertisements on the service. A large-scale  boycott could be a setback for Prodigy, a joint venture of Sears, Roebuck &amp;  Co. and International Business Machines that has yet to turn a profit. The  company's new pricing system raises monthly rates by $3-top $12.95-for those  who pay on a monthly basis.  </P></p>

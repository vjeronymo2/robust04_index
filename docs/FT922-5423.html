			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / W German inflation slows Western German inflation slowed slightly in May to an annual rate of 4.5 per cent, compared with 4.6 per cent in April, according to preliminary data issued by the Federal Statistics Office yesterday, Reuter reports from Wiesbaden. The inflation rate hit a 10-year high of 4.8 per cent in March and is one of the key factors behind Germany's record interest rates, which have in turn been blamed for stunting economic growth throughout Europe. The office said that prices in western Germany had risen by 0.3 per cent from April, the same increase as in the previous month.</p>

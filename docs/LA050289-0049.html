			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> GEORGE STRAIT'S WHITE-BREAD BRAND OF DISTILLATION  </P> <P> Let's hope George Strait has had all his inoculations. If not, he's bound to  catch something from all those flower-bearing babes he kissed between songs  Sunday at the Pacific Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> But then, the health risk was the only risk the big-grinnin', big-hatted Texan  took in a show marked by a superficial and safe nature that pretty much summed  up the sad state of country music, 1989. And there's no vaccination for  vacuousness.  </P> <P> Sunday's show left little doubt that the whistle-baiting hunk's success is due  as much to his looks as to his music -- a Strait-arrow, white-bread  distillation of Texas swing and honky-tonk, without a hint of the innovative  genius associated with such pioneers as Bob Wills and Hank Williams.  </P> <P> Which isn't to say that Strait and his solid Ace in the Hole Band are without  merit. His voice is as shiny as his teeth, and the band has a natural feel for  the styles. But you'd never know from their version of the Wills arrangement of  "Milk Cow Blues" or from such facile Strait hits as "All My Exes Live in Texas"  that Wills' fusion of hillbilly music and swing jazz was explosive and  inventive.  </P> <P> An even better (?) example of sanitized regression came from opening act  Baillie &amp; the Boys, which draws not upon country, but its very distant  relative, '70s California pop a la Karla Bonoff and Wendy Waldman.  Second-billed Kathy Mattea fared a bit better, thanks largely to her pure alto  and winning personality. But there's little in her twang-pop to distinguish  her; these songs would sound the same done by any pure alto with a winning  personality. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

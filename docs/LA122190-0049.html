			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIAS VICTIMS MAY BYPASS RIGHTS PANEL, COURT SAYS;  </P> <P> LAW: JUSTICES' DECISION WILL ALLOW PARTICIPANTS IN SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES TO  SEEK POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN COURT.  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court, denouncing the "pernicious influence of sexism,"  ruled Thursday that victims of sex discrimination may bypass the state civil  rights commission and seek large damage awards in court.  </P> <P> The justices unanimously rejected contentions by employers that bias complaints  must be taken first to the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission, an  administrative body that conciliates disputes and has only limited power to  compensate victims.  </P> <P> The court found that the anti-discrimination provisions of the state  Constitution reflected a "fundamental public policy" against sex bias,  entitling victims to seek potentially lucrative compensatory or punitive  damages in court.  </P> <P> "So long as (sexism) exists, we are all demeaned," Justice Edward A. Panelli  wrote for the court. The decision caused some surprise, coming from a generally  conservative court that only two years ago restricted the damages that workers  can win for wrongful firing in cases not involving discrimination or a  violation of public policy.  </P> <P> "This is an encouraging sign to employees that the tide may have turned on the  California Supreme Court," said John M. True, staff counsel of the Employment  Rights Center in San Francisco. "The justices were invited to regress on  employee rights in discrimination cases and they declined to do so."  </P> <P> Steven G. Drapkin of Los Angeles, lawyer for the Merchants and Manufacturers  Assn., voiced disappointment with the ruling. "This will create a lot of added  litigation that otherwise could have been handled properly by the commission,"  he said.  </P> <P> The decision was one of three issued Thursday involving the extent to which  employers may be held liable for violation of labor-protection laws.  </P> <P> In a second pro-worker ruling, the justices unanimously permitted a state  employee to seek compensatory and punitive damages under a "whistle-blower"  protection law for stress-related injuries that he said resulted from  harassment for his efforts to investigate official wrongdoing.  </P> <P> In a third decision, the court, as expected, sharply limited the remedial power  of the Fair Employment and Housing Commission, which receives about 8,000  complaints of sex, race and other bias annually. The justices held 5 to 2 that  the commission, unlike the courts, lacked authority to award compensatory  damages for emotional stress and other intangible harm, and was limited to  ordering back pay and reinstatement.  </P> <P> This decision followed a 1987 ruling that barred similarly lucrative punitive  damage awards by the commission.  </P> <P> The ruling opening the way for court action by bias victims resulted from a  suit by Emma Rojo and Teresa Maloney against their former employer, Dr. Irwin  H. Kliger of Los Angeles, charging that they suffered emotional distress from  sexual harassment and improper demands.  </P> <P> The women charged that they had been grabbed, kissed and fondled by the  physician and were forced out of their jobs when they resisted his demands.  Kliger denied the charges.  </P> <P> The high court rejected the employer's contentions that a worker must exhaust  the administrative process before going to court. The justices noted that  although the commission's procedures for conciliation, back pay and  reinstatement may be effective for many workers, the judicial remedies of  punitive and compensatory damages can provide the "only adequate form of  relief" for others.  </P> <P> The court also rejected employers' contentions that victims of sex bias could  not sue for wrongful discharge as a violation of public policy. "No extensive  discussion is needed to establish the fundamental public interest in a  workplace free from the pernicious influence of sexism," Panelli wrote.  </P> <P> Attorneys for business groups expressed disappointment with the ruling. Fred J.  Hiestand, general counsel for the Assn. for California Tort Reform, predicted a  "boom" in employment litigation and increased legal costs for employers.  Increasing numbers of aggrieved workers will go to court hoping for a "big  jackpot," Hiestand said, while fewer people -- those more interested only in  reinstatement -- will go to the agency.  </P> <P> In the second case decided Thursday, Jack Shoemaker, a former special  investigator for the state Department of Health Services, filed a lawsuit  against the department seeking damages for stress-related injuries. Shoemaker  contended that he had been harassed and then fired after he found, in an  investigation, that officials might have improperly given funds to  family-planning clinics that did not use licensed professionals.  </P> <P> A trial court rejected the investigator's bid for damages and a state Court of  Appeal agreed, ruling that Shoemaker could collect only the $140 per month  payment he was due from the state workers compensation fund, the system  established to provide for the work-related injury or death of an employee.  </P> <P> In an opinion by Justice Armand Arabian, the high court held Thursday that the  "whistle-blower" law was aimed specifically at protecting state workers who  properly report unlawful governmental actions. Even though the workers  compensation system was designed to comprehensively cover injuries on the job,  Shoemaker could sue under the separate law aimed at deterring retaliation by  authorities.  </P> <P> The third case Thursday centered on a discrimination claim filed with the  commission by Rose Brown against her former employer, the Peralta Community  College District in Oakland. Brown, a temporary secretary, charged that she  suffered emotional distress from sexual harassment by a college dean.  </P> <P> The commission ruled in favor of Brown, ordering the district not only to  reimburse the woman $374.55 in lost pay, but also $20,000 in compensatory  damages for harm to her "dignity and esteem."  </P> <P> The high court, in another opinion by Panelli, concluded that state statutes  allow the commission only to order back pay and reinstatement to an unjustly  fired worker or to issue orders barring discriminatory actions by employers.  </P> <P> State Deputy Atty. Gen. Marian M. Johnston and commission Executive Director  Steven Owyang expressed disappointment with the court's limitation on  commission power. While employees who go to court will profit from Thursday's  rulings, those who choose the faster, less-expensive process of the commission  will gain far less in compensation, they said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  reconfirmed the need for joint efforts to successfully conclude  bilateral framework talks and agreed to hold subcabinet-level  negotiations early next week in Washington, Foreign Ministry  officials said Friday [4 February].    Kantor and Hata reached the accord during a breakfast  meeting  at the ministry's Iikura Guesthouse. It was the second meeting  between the two men since Kantor arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday.    Kantor and Hata agreed that both Japan and the United States  should strive to solve the "remaining problems" in the trade  talks before the February 11 summit between Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton in Washington, they  said.    Japanese and U.S. negotiators are supposed to draw up a  progress report on the framework talks in time for the  Washington summit, the third round of talks between the two  leaders since Hosokawa assumed the office of prime minister last  August, they said.    But the two sides remain deadlocked over the definition of  the "objective criteria" to measure the progress of foreign  access to Japanese markets.    The United States wants to set numerical targets but Japan  opposes any indicators on the grounds they could lead to managed  trade.    Hata told Kantor he wants the report to balance all three  main themes of the framework talks -- the macroeconomy,  microeconomy and global cooperation, the officials said.    Although Kantor and Hata did not argue over "objective  criteria" in the morning talks, they appeared to have shared the  perception that the "remaining problems" concern the difference  between Japan and the U.S. over their respective definitions of  the term, the officials said.    The subcabinet-level negotiations will be held in Washington  as early as next Monday, the officials said.    Hata told a press conference that through a series of talks  between Kantor and high-level Japanese officials this week,  Japanese and U.S. negotiators were able to confirm their "strong  intentions" to successfully wrap up the bilateral framework  talks.    Hata said Kantor gave high marks to Japan's efforts to  introduce measures to stimulate the economy and quoted him as  saying the developments of the past few days over the  introduction of a new tax system are "dramatic."    Meanwhile, a senior Trade Ministry official also said Friday  the Japan-U.S. subcabinet-level negotiations will resume in  Washington as early as next Monday.    The official, who declined to be named, said a broad  agreement has already been reached on government procurement of  medical and telecommunications equipment, except their numerical  targets.    Japan is willing to reach an accord on automotive issues but  it has no intention of yielding to the U.S. demand for numerical  targets for Japanese imports, the official said.</p>

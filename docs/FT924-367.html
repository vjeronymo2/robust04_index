			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Diary of a Private Investor for 1993: Difficult, but the chances are there but challenging - year in 1993. Interest rates in the UK ought to fall a bit further, so cash in the bank will lose some of its attractions. But what else is there to buy? The government is keen to raise money in order to help finance its spending plans. So, it is likely to try to ensure it gets a good price when it sells its remaining shareholding in British Telecom - which is worth more than Pounds 5bn. But who wants more BT shares? Surely the institutions have enough of them already, and even foreign investors have had ample opportunity in the past to buy. So what will induce them to acquire even more? The vast majority of private investors have also, at one time or another, bought BT shares during its privatisation. The government will, therefore, have to try to show that the UK economy is improving in order to attract foreign buyers to BT, and it will have to offer considerable 'perks' to private investors in Britain if the issue is to be a success. But can it deliver? The best way to encourage wider share ownership, and promote renewed interest in BT shares from private investors, is for chancellor Norman Lamont to use his Budget next spring to give them the same tax advantages that are available now to pension funds and some other types of institutional investor. An individual should not be forced to deal via a personal equity plan or other fund manager in order to gain tax advantages: these should be available automatically for anyone investing directly in shares. This would save investors a large amount in fees. In 1990, the government agreed that stamp duty on share transactions would be abolished when the City's electronic share settlement system, Taurus, began operating. Stamp duty ought to be ended in the Budget rather than waiting for Taurus, which has been delayed already for far longer than most people (except me) had anticipated. The first securities are now supposed to be traded 'live' on Taurus towards the end of 1993. I still have considerable doubts about this. I feel the stock exchange would save everyone a lot of money if it aborted Taurus now and developed, instead, a variation on the US system using depository companies and retaining share certificates. Investors might also consider the effects on the market if the Queen starts to pay tax in April. Will the Queen have to reduce some of her shareholdings in order to pay the tax? If so, this could have some effect on the share prices of companies such as RTZ in which, it is rumoured, the Queen has a large shareholding. A major restructuring of her asset portfolio, to make it more tax-efficient, could also have a modest impact on certain companies. There will, however, be a considerable number of major influences on stock market sentiment in 1993. Events in many of the countries that used to form the USSR still give cause for concern. The continuing integration of eastern Germany with the western half is likely to provide increasing financial, political, racial and emotional strains on that nation; this could easily cause problems elsewhere. Meanwhile, new trouble spots emerge every year. Even 10 years ago, who could have predicted the conflict now going on in Yugoslavia? And 1993 could well see troubles breaking out in other unexpected places. With share prices in the US and the UK trading at near-record levels, changes in sentiment can have dramatic consequences. But what else is there in which to invest money? It looks as if British property in 1993 will remain in a gloomy state. The new council tax will hit particularly hard in the south and south-east, and unemployment is likely to remain high. There is also the problem of people having 'negative equity' in their homes, where the outstanding mortgage is greater than the value of the house. At the top end of the market, the difficulties of 'names', who have pledged their wealth to Lloyd's, the insurance institution, is likely to continue to depress prices. Commercial property, too, is unlikely to rise significantly because of the collapse of prices for empty offices and factories. And people with endowment mortgages could face problems. They may find that some insurance companies - hit by the effects of relatively low inflation and poor investment performance - are having to slash bonus rates so that the returns from endowment policies may not be sufficient to pay off mortgages completely. There are county council elections in May and, unless the government starts giving counties a larger share of education and other grants immediately and announces plans for major infrastructure improvements, then some Conservative authorities could fall to the opposition. This would hardly inspire confidence to invest in property. People do not like uncertainty and want to be able to plan ahead, knowing what decisions will be made which may affect the area in which they live and property values. Looking at other forms of investment, the recent problems with Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Assurance Society are likely to make people more wary of investing with friendly societies. My wife and I have policies with L&amp;Y which mature next year. Fortunately, they were in a 'balanced portfolio' rather than the society's Capital Secure fund, which has suffered from write-downs in property values. I should, therefore, still make a profit. How much is something else. I have a number of investments with life assurance companies, and one 10-year investment plan matures next year. It will be particularly interesting to see if the proceeds match, or exceed, what an average investor could have achieved by investing directly in shares. There will be many pitfalls for private investors in 1993 - including avoiding the shares of those ITV companies which have bid too high for their franchises and will have to start paying for those bids. But I believe there are still ways in which significant profits can be made. These, however, will depend largely on selecting and monitoring shares in small companies carefully, and in taking advantage of any further major upheavals in currencies.</p>

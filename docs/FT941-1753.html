			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Clinton plans to speak out on Whitewater President Bill Clinton will tonight hold perhaps the most important televised press conference of his presidency. The White House expects it to be dominated by the Whitewater affair, reports Jurek Martin from Washington. The president is concerned by the extent to which the first family's financial investments in Arkansas has deflected attention from his domestic agenda. The broadcast gives him an opportunity to go over the heads of a suspicious Washington political and media establishment to assure a national audience only dimly aware of Whitewater that he has committed no wrongdoing and is co-operating with all investigations. Both houses of Congress have called for fully fledged hearings into Whitewater.</p>

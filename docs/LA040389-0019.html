			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TARGETING YUPPIE DRUG USERS  </P> <P> Hooray for Colman McCarthy! ("Bluster on Drugs, but That's No Solution," Op-Ed  Page, March 21). It's been too long now that the "war against drugs" has been  limited to "just say no" slogans and calls for more guns, military  surveillance, and jails. Finally, McCarthy asks the fundamental question: Why?  What are these people feeling that makes them want to deaden their senses? And  not only those suffering the pain of poverty -- we all know that drug use knows  no socioeconomic boundaries. There are big hurts out there, and until we stop  the demand in this country for the drugs to treat those pains, we're going to  have more dead, more wounded . . . more war.  </P> <P> MIRIAM McKENNA BUSH  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

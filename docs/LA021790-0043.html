			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> VINNEGAR WELCOMES FRIENDS IN INDIGO RETURN  </P> <P> A number of musicians -- some of whom he invited to share the bandstand --  turned out for Leroy Vinnegar's homecoming Thursday night at Indigo Jazz Club  in Compton.  </P> <P> The three-night engagement marked the nimble-fingered bassist's first Los  Angeles appearance since he moved to Portland, Ore., more than two years ago.  </P> <P> Before his move, Vinnegar had been a center post of support in the Los Angeles  jazz scene for more than three decades.  </P> <P> During the second and brief third set, the tall, broad man with a shock of  graying hair -- whose instrument seemed almost diminutive against his girth --  played a brace of mainstream tunes that was highlighted by "Melody for Thelma,"  an enchanting, sinuous Blue Mitchell bossa nova. Here, pianist Bill Henderson  swayed between slowly stated ideas that were filled with space and dashing  note-dense structures that were delivered with disarming ease.  </P> <P> On "Polka Dots and Moonbeams," where Henderson also offered a throaty soprano  sax improvisation, and a Sam Jones blues, "The Chant," Vinnegar displayed his  sweet, supple sound, which was a balancing point between Henderson and lithe  drummer Tootie Heath and his as-ever rock-solid time. "The Chant" found the  bassist soloing with fluid "walking" lines, as has long been his fashion, while  on "Thelma" he opted for more horn-like stance to tell his story.  </P> <P> Later, he invited singer David Whitfield up to the bandstand. Whitfield all but  buried "My Funny Valentine" in vocal and physical histrionics. In the third  set, saxman Teddy Edwards and pianist Dwight Dickerson cruised through "Four"  and "Bag's Groove" with efficient musicianship, Edwards soloing with his  inherent bluesiness and Dickerson adding a spark with his jaunty rhythms and  neatly turned melodies.  </P> <P> Vinnegar, with Edwards, Henderson and Heath in tow, closes tonight.

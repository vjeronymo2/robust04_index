			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Balmoral bugs being fixed - At a glance Bristol &amp; West says it is solving the processing problems which have occurred with its Balmoral account; those who have yet to receive passbooks should receive them by Tuesday, February 9. The society says that interest will be credited from the day after cheques were received by it. Additional staff have been recruited to cope with the demand. From next week, says Bristol &amp; West, customers sending cheques to open accounts will be sent their pass books and account opening documentation or acknowledgment, by return of post.</p>

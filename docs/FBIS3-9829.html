			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ludovit Cernak, a member of the Preparatory </F> Committee of the National Democratic Party, and Roman Kovac, a  member of the Preparatory Committee of the Alternative of  Political Realism, by Jana Pankovcinova and Alica Strbava; place  and date not given: "Why Have Cernak's, Knazko's, and  Moravcik's Parties Not Unified?"]    [Text] The first assembly of the National Democratic Party  (NDS) will be held in Zvolen today. According to reports from  one month ago, this should have been the merger congress of the  NDS, the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic [AD SR],  and the supporters of Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik.    [SME] Why will the centrist parties not merge on Saturday  [26 March]?    [Cernak] Following all of the talks that have been held,  there is unanimous will to proceed jointly. However, we realize  our responsibility before voters not to create an incoherent  conglomerate, as was the case with the Public Against Violence  movement or the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, which later  fell apart. There is only one remaining difference among us.  Colleagues Knazko, Kovac, and Moravcik identify more with  liberal ideas and the Liberal International, while we find  sympathetic a conservative orientation and the European  Democratic Union. We have therefore decided to establish two  entities--a liberal one and one with a conservative orientation.  Otherwise, we have almost identical programs, and it is highly  probable that, before the elections, we will set up a centrist  coalition bloc. Meanwhile, the AD SR will merge with Moravcik's  followers. We will proceed further according to the political  circumstances, but for sure jointly.    [Kovac] Mainly because the Alternative of Political Realism  is not technically prepared for such a step yet. In view of the  fact that Cernak's group has been preparing its assembly for a  long time, we have agreed that its assembly should go ahead. We  must still complete the technical preparations. The question of  further cooperation will be assessed by us in mid-April.    [SME] Will you discuss a merger or merely a joint ticket for  the elections?    [Kovac] I do not rule out either possibility.    [SME] In other words, you deny the information from behind  the scenes, according to which the reason for the failure of the  centrist parties to merge is the problem of who would be the  party's chairman? Besides, not all of the centrist parties have  established structures in the countryside. The NDS is the sole  exception, and it would thus probably have the largest number of  elected delegates at the merger congress....    [Cernak] What you say has its logic. Apart from the  differences in the orientation of our programs, which I have  already mentioned, there is among us yet another difference of  opinion: how to build the party. The AD SR has already  declared that it would be a selective party and Messrs. Moravcik  and Kovac, too, would not want to build their structures any  further than the district level. We, on the other hand, are  trying to win "our man" in every small village. It should be a  person who commands authority at the local level and who could  explain the party's program and objectives. We had differences  on this point, and the problem regarding the number of delegates  would apparently also result from this. However, for me, this  is not a substantial issue. If we want to successfully defy  Meciar's populism and his visits to every little village, we  must do the same and rebut his assertions by making our  arguments heard in the same village.    [SME] Who else, besides you, is running for NDS chairman?    [Cernak] I am not the only person running. There will be at  least two or three candidates. The list of candidates will be  put forward today. I do not want to anticipate events.</p>

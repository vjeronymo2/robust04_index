			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rate cut fails to maintain Tokyo's momentum EXCITEMENT over the Bank of Japan's 75 basis point cut in the discount rate faded in the afternoon session, and share prices closed marginally lower on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei index fell 31.40 to 17,190.63, its first decline in four trading days. It saw a high of 17,390.79 in the morning after the official announcement of the rate cut, before falling an afternoon low of 17,171.87 on profit-taking. Volume fell to 260m shares from 339m. Declines led advances by 555 to 368 with 205 unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.77 to 1,300.83 after rising for seven consecutive days. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.74 to 1,057.96. Reaction on other financial markets was muted, with the yen closing at 124.60 against the dollar, down 0.27 from the previous day, and the yield on the No 145 10 year benchmark bond rising 0.015 points to 4.355 per cent. However, market participants remain hopeful that the lower interest rates will filter through the economy to good effect. Traders said that investors are now waiting for further fiscal stimulus. 'Whether the stock market will recover or not depends on the government following up the cut with another supplementary budget, or a cut in income taxes,' said a manager of Nippon Life's stock investment division. Activity centred around short-term speculative trading and cross-trading by financial institutions to realise profits ahead of the March book-closing. Joyo Bank, a leading regional bank, was the most active issue of the day, rising Y10 to Y860 on cross activity. Isuzu Motors, which has been bought on the 'restructuring' theme, fell Y5 to Y375 on dealer profit-taking while Oki Electric, which has also been traded actively as a restructuring beneficiary, gained Y1 to Y392. Aids-related issues were active. Green Cross fell Y40 to Y1,220 and Kanematsu, a trading company which will produce and distribute a substance used in AZT, an anti-Aids drug, rose Y20 to Y396. Profit-taking depressed some financial issues which had been popular on expectations of wider profit margins due to a rate cut. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y50 to Y2,380 and Mitsubishi Bank lost Y10 to Y2,390. In Osaka, the OSE average fell for the first time in eight trading days on small-lot profit taking. It closed 96.23 lower at 18,576.86 in 54.3m shares. Roundup A cautious mood emerged in many of the region's markets. HONG KONG ended firmer with sentiment still underpinned by the record price paid at Wednesday's government land auction. The Hang Seng Index gained 67.21 to 5,778.01 in turnover of HKDollars 1.86bn. Properties saw the sharpest rise with Cheung Kong gaining 50 cents to HKDollars 20.30 and Sun Hung Kai Properties up 20 cents to HKDollars 27.20. AUSTRALIAN stocks staged an early rally, inspired by the strength of overseas markets; but the advance ran out of steam, leaving the All Ordinaries index to close just 1.2 higher at 1,531.4. Turnover was healthy at ADollars 242m. up from ADollars 238m on Wednesday. A 16 cent fall in News Corp to Dollars 29.40 was attributed to market speculation that the group's stake in British Sky Broadcasting may be worth less than originally thought. SINGAPORE retreated on profit-taking and the Straits Times Industrial index fell 10.51 to 1,627.08 in volume on 114.45m shares. KUALA LUMPUR closed mixed as investors became cautious after Wednesday's surge. The composite index closed 3.71 higher at 642.95 in volume of 163m shares. BANGKOK saw a late selling spree as a series of rumours - none of them true  -spread through trading rooms. Investors later repurchased bank and finance company issues leaving the SET index 3.10 lower at 972.16 in turnover of Bt10.34bn.</p>

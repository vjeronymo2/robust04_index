			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains lost on renewed interest rate worry - Market report Growing concern that the next turn in domestic interest rates may be upwards undermined UK equities at the close of a highly erratic trading session yesterday. An advance of around 21 points on the FT-SE 100 Index in early dealing was wiped out when Wall Street opened easier and gains in British government bonds were sharply trimmed. Worries over interest rates were particularly acute ahead of tomorrow's routine meeting between the Governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The closing reading of 3,129.5 on the FT-SE 100 showed a gain of only 0.5 on the day. Lower oil prices, in the wake of the decision by Opec ministers to maintain present production ceilings for the rest of the year, helped both bonds and shares at first. 'A lower oil price is like a tax cut for manufacturing companies, and it also encourages confidence that inflation will stay low,' commented one strategist. However, it was clear that investment confidence was restrained, with the big securities houses unwilling to open up new positions in the market during a trading week curtailed by the extended Easter weekend; important data on US employment is due on Friday. Traders stressed that turnover had been unimpressive, with the day's Seaq total at 516.8m shares, about 40 per cent down from Friday's level. However, the Friday total was worth Pounds 2.2bn in retail worth, indicating one of the most active sessions of the year. Share prices opened lower as traders reacted to widespread comment in the weekend press that any cut in UK base rates may now be difficult to achieve, and that rates may soon have to rise to restrain the pressures of a recovering economy. Tomorrow brings the auction of Pounds 2.5bn of floating rate government securities. But strong gains in government bonds, together with a sharp rise in the premium on the Footsie stock index future for June, soon turned share prices higher. Traders were not greatly impressed, and pointed out that Friday's session had left many securities houses needing to buy stock and unwilling to leave their trading books exposed over the Easter weekend. The downturn, when it came, bore out suggestions that genuine underlying demand for shares was light, and also that UK equities are still dominated by the gilt-edged market and its continued uncertainty over the outlook for domestic interest rates. Volume increased but selling pressure was not heavy. Several large US houses were clearly active in stock index futures, and share prices were often influenced by their operations to untie positions in underlying stocks. The final picture was fairly mixed, with company results and special situations providing the features of what was clearly a nervous market. Among the blue chips, oil shares moved nervously as investors assessed the outcome of the Opec meeting in Geneva. The new issue market looked more healthy following news that the House of Fraser share issue, to commence trading at the beginning of next month, had been subscribed 2.2 times. Activity across the range of the market enabled the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to hold on to much of an early gain, closing 10.5 higher at 3,785.7. But, with Wall Street down 20 Dow points when London closed, traders sounded cautious on the prospects for this morning's opening of trading in UK shares.</p>

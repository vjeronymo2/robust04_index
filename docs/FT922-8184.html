			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Appeal for greater openness in gold market THE FIRST chairman of the London Bullion Market Association made a final appeal for greater transparency in the gold market as he stepped down from his position yesterday after four years, Reuter reports. Mr Robert Guy, a director of NM Rothschild, the bullion house, said the long bear run in gold had discouraged investors from using the market, but added that if they returned as the market picked up, they would demand more information. 'If you want to attract investors into the market you shouldn't ask them to invest blind,' Mr Guy said. The LBMA chairman said historic but regular reports on London's gold market turnover would also assist the bullion houses themselves. 'It is internally important for the companies involved in the market to have a benchmark to compare their activities with each other,' he said. Pointing out that both the gilts and foreign exchange markets appeared to benefit by producing turnover figures, he suggested the gold market should gradually do the same. 'I think the majority of market makers would be happy to see turnover figures, but the LBMA believes in consensus,' he said. The question of value added tax on gold, said Mr Guy, would continue to be an important issue. He said the outcome of current talks in Brussels on the harmonisation of VAT rates within the EC would be of vital importance to the London and continental gold markets. 'As far as London is concerned the worse we could do is maintain the current situation. There are sound reasons for removing VAT from gold, but political reality means this will be very hard to achieve.' Under current regulations members of the LBMA who trade between themselves do not pay VAT on their transactions. 'It would be helpful if investors could buy gold free of VAT provided they did not take delivery,' said the outgoing chairman. He saw no move towards the market adopting a central clearing house system but said there was an interest in reducing the cost of providing a clearing service in London. 'There is no standard cost charged by the London market to the international world. . . and the provision of that cheap or free service obviously attracts a lot of business,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamud Munsir: "Yemen: Failure To Withdraw Forces </F> Threatens `Two 'Alis' Meeting in Cairo"]    [Excerpts] Sanaa, Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Yemeni  joint military committee has failed to reach an agreement on the  separation of northern and southern forces in the contact areas  on the former partition border between north and south Yemen. As  a result, there is a delay in preparing a plan to implement the  military aspect of the "Pledge and Accord Document," which was  supposed to be submitted to the Council of Ministers for  endorsement at its meeting in Sanaa today under the chairmanship  of First Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Hasan Makki.    Sources familiar with the military committee's work have  said  that the failure to reach an agreement is attributable to the  Yemeni Socialist Party's [YSP] insistence that the military  units belonging to it be withdrawn from northern governorates  and that the northern units present in southern governorates be  moved to the north; there are five southern brigades in the  northern governorates. [passage omitted]    The sources added that the proposal to return the forces to  the governorates to which they belong is one of the clauses in  the Egyptian mediation initiative between the YSP and the  General People's Congress [GPC]. This is in addition to the  proposal to withdraw forces from the former partition border  which the military committee agreed to implement in yesterday's  meeting. It has also drawn up a plan to implement it.    The military committee's failure to withdraw northern forces  from the south and southern forces from the north could result  in delaying the anticipated meeting between President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, secretary general of the GPC, and Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the YSP, in  Cairo at the end of the month or the beginning of next month,  because the Egyptian initiative focuses on defusing seats of  military tension first.

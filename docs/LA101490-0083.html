			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAX INCREASE SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO STOP CANYON'S DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The residents of Laguna Beach are expected to vote to increase their property  taxes via a $20-million bond issue to provide a significant part of the funds  to purchase the Irvine Co.'s Laguna Laurel development land in Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> Monies will also be contributed by the county -- $2 million per year for five  years. Thus, through the leadership and generosity of the residents of Laguna  Beach, the county will have a wilderness park for pennies on the dollar. The  acquired Laguna Laurel area is to be administered as part of the county's  wilderness park system.  </P> <P> The Laguna Laurel area is close to the county's Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional  Park and Crystal Cove State Park, which are significant parts of the Laguna  Greenbelt. The Laguna Laurel area is in the heart of the Laguna Greenbelt, and  its preservation is essential to provide wildlife a habitat that is large  enough for a thriving ecosystem. This is the "central park" for Orange County.  </P> <P> The negotiations are the results of cooperative efforts of Laguna Beach, led by  Mayor Lida Lenney and Councilman Robert F. Gentry, the Irvine Co., the county  and environmental groups. The letters you printed indicate that other Orange  County cities are being taken advantage of, with preferential treatment being  given to Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Laguna Canyon Conservancy president Carolyn Wood said the acquisition of Laguna  Laurel is a "win for everyone." Hopefully, the Irvine Co. will accrue goodwill.  Pollution and congestion will be reduced preventing degradation to the quality  of life for residents of Laguna Beach and other cities. And Orange County will  get a wilderness park with a small contribution of county funds.  </P> <P> I'm sure the county's park people will be eager to scrape up funds to acquire  open space near other cities willing to tax themselves to provide a greater  portion of the money. Those of us in Laguna Beach would be overjoyed to support  such actions in this county, which otherwise has development running amok.  </P> <P> GENE FELDER  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

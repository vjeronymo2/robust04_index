			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Observer: HK Brothers Sir Nigel Broackes, the founder of Trafalgar House, has his critics. But he can't be accused of underestimating the clout of his new, and biggest, shareholder - the Keswicks' Hongkong Land. He describes himself as a 'minor patrician' compared to the Keswick brothers. Old Etonian Simon Keswick, chairman of HongKong Land, and his elder brother Henry, chairman of the Jardine Matheson parent, may not be knighted like Sir Nigel and their father, the late Sir William Keswick (a former director of the Bank of England and Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company), but their City connections outclass Sir Nigel's. Henry is on the board of Sun Alliance, Robert Fleming, Rothmans International and The Daily Telegraph. He and his wife Tessa are well plugged into the Tory party hierarchy - Sir Charles Powell sits on their boards - and they share the same sort of beliefs as Lord Hanson, Sir James Goldsmith and Garry Weston. Simon, recently given a seat on the Hanson board, is a bit more raffish and apart from being a member of the Queen's Body Guard for Scotland, is a Tottenham Hotspur fan, according to his Who's Who entry. If you count the other brother - Hambros Bank chairman 'Chips' Keswick  - one begins to feel a certain sympathy for the underdog in the coming contest.</p>

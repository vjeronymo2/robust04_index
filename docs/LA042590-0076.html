			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> SECOND ISSUE OF MAGAZINE GAINS RESPECT ON S.D. SCENE  </P> <P> The second issue of San Diego Music Magazine hit the streets last week, and  publisher-editor Steve Saint is more confident than ever that the free monthly  publication -- something of a house organ for the San Diego pop-music community  -- will be around for a long, long time.  </P> <P> Ad sales are up considerably over last month, totaling 3 1/2 pages as opposed  to less than two in the inaugural March issue, Saint said. And, perhaps more  significant, he added, the magazine is rapidly catching on with its target  audience.  </P> <P> "I just came from a record store where one of your typically hip record-store  workers had totally ignored the March issue," Saint said. "When I handed him  the new issue, he said, 'Oh, yeah, I read the last one, and it was really good  -- I know a lot of bands, and I'm going to tell them to send you stuff.' "  </P> <P> "He was really nice to me, whereas before, he had been totally standoffish. I  think people are starting to realize that we're going to be here every month,  that the magazine is going to be some kind of a permanent fixture."  </P> <P> For a city to maintain a vibrant original-music scene, Saint said, it's  essential to have a magazine devoted to covering that scene -- through features  on aspiring hometown heroes, reviews of local club shows and records, and  updates on major-label signings of San Diego bands.  </P> <P> "I've been in San Francisco and Los Angeles and Chicago and New York, and  everyone says there's a music scene in those cities, but there's no music scene  in San Diego," Saint said.  </P> <P> "The fact is, there is a music scene in San Diego, but, until now, there hasn't  been a magazine to focus attention on it -- as there is everywhere else.  </P> <P> "It's our goal to change all that. We've got quite a scene down here, and we  just want to put it down on black and white and get it out in front of  everybody."  </P> <P> Saint said his decision to launch a monthly music magazine resulted from his  work with Musicians Who Care, a San Diego association of do-good musicians.  </P> <P> "After working with Musicians Who Care for a year, I found that we were taking  on more and more of an advocacy role for our bands," Saint said. "We went from  trying to get musicians to help the community to trying to get musicians to  help themselves.  </P> <P> "So it just seemed to us that we were the natural people to do a magazine  covering the local music scene. Besides, I'm a journalist by trade. I've been  putting out newsletters since junior high school, and I've written for Music  Connection, the Reader, even Time."  </P> <P> Expansion plans for San Diego Music Magazine include increasing the number of  pages from the current 12, upping the press run from 1,000 to 5,000 or more,  and possibly changing the format from broad sheet to tabloid, Saint said.  </P> <P> 'We're going to keep this format for a while, because we started with it and we  feel we should be consistent for a few months," Saint said. "We're using  recycled paper, so no trees are being cut down to do this, and we want to make  sure that if we do go to another format, we can maintain this type of standard.  </P> <P> "So for now, the only changes we're looking at are to be bigger. We're shooting  for a 16-page edition in May, and for the June issue, our big goal is to have  an article on every aspect of the San Diego music scene by genre: who are the  bands, who's in the studio, where are the clubs, what's getting played on  radio, in regard to not just rock 'n' roll and new wave, but reggae, country,  rap, and rhythm-and-blues.  </P> <P> "And of course, that largely has to do with getting more advertiser support. We  don't have a large infusion of capital; we are not a big-corporation publisher.  We are musicians doing this for musicians, so it's kind of a family thing."  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: The third annual San Diego Folk Heritage benefit concert will be  held Saturday night at the Del Mar Shores Auditorium. Once again, various board  members and volunteers of the nonprofit organization, which since January of  1988 has been producing local concerts by touring folk acts from around the  world, will take to the stage themselves to raise money to help subsidize  future productions. Among them: Jo Ann and Larry Sinclair, singing traditional  and topical folk tunes; Ronni Russell and Jim Hayes, squaring off on the hammer  dulcimer; and Dave Allen, Christopher Cunningham, and Barbara and Bruce Reid  (he's the current board chairman), performing together as an old-time fiddle,  banjo, and guitar combo . . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale Saturday at 10 a.m. for Tracy Chapman's May 28 concert at  San Diego State University's Open Air Theater, and April 30 at 10 a.m. for  Elayne Boosler's May 25 appearance at the California Theater downtown . . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: Hot Tuna with Peter Kaukonen, Thursday  at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; Eric Burdon with Robby Krieger and the Walking  Wounded, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; Garth Brooks with  Holly Dunn, Friday at the Bacchanal; the Screamin' Sirens, Friday at the Casbah  in Middletown; Curtis Mayfield with Sharkskin, Friday at the Belly Up; the  Temptations with the Four Tops, Saturday at the Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park;  Karla Bonoff, Saturday at the Bacchanal; Bonnie Bramlett, Sunday at the  Bacchanal; Nils Lofgren, Sunday at the Belly Up; Keiko Matsui, Sunday at the  Culbertson Winery in Temecula, and O.J.

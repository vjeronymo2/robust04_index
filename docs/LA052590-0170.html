			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS;  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS ARE LIFELINE OF CITY ANIMAL SHELTER  </P> <P> The San Clemente Animal Shelter has many projects in which volunteers play a  vital role. "We currently have about 100 volunteers," said Roberta Gorny,  shelter manager.  </P> <P> "The majority of the volunteers work with fund-raising projects, and the others  staff the shelter. They help us remain pro-life.  </P> <P> "Without the volunteer help, we would not be able to keep up the shelter as we  do now."  </P> <P> Some of the volunteers' duties include walking and bathing the dogs and taking  animals to the veterinarian. Volunteers are also trained to issue animal  licenses and check up on adoptions.  </P> <P> "We currently have a program in which we take pets to schools and educate  students to care for pets, the importance of licensing and keeping a dog on a  leash," Gorny said. "We have another program in which volunteers will bring a  pet to a day-care center or nursing homes for an hour or so."  </P> <P> The main objective for volunteers is to keep the animals happy and adoptable,  which at the same time fulfills the interest of many volunteers.  </P> <P> "We still have most of our original volunteers since the program started in  January, 1983," Gorny said. "Our volunteers seem to be satisfied by just seeing  the animals' tails wag."  </P> <P> For details on volunteering your time for the San Clemente Animal Shelter, call  Michael Ewart, volunteer coordinator, at (714) 492-1617. Volunteers must be at  least 16 (14- and 15- year-olds may work with a parent).  </P></p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Guardian Royal changes name Guardian Royal Exchange, the fifth largest of the UK composite insurers, is dropping Royal Exchange from its title and will be known in future simply as Guardian. The group is also replacing its company logo with the image of an owl, to create a 'new visual identity . . . part of the group's strategy to build a more powerful corporate brand worldwide'. The name will be introduced progressively in 1994 but the legal names of Guardian Royal Exchange and its trading subsidiaries in more than 50 countries are not affected. 'A new name and identifier have been adopted for use internationally. This is particularly important now as we establish new companies and reposition existing ones,' explained Mr Sid Hopkins, chief executive. See Observer</p>

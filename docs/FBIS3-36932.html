			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Podlipskiy report: "The Economy Ministry Has Found </F> Points of Convergence With Academicians"]    [Text] Judging by the results of yesterday's session of the  Economy Ministry Collegium, the scholars who have been actively  developing alternative economic programs lately should not  expect the government publicly to admit the erroneousness of the  present economic policy. Rather, the scenario for the further  course of events will essentially repeat the patterns of the  cabinet's collaboration with "non-nomenklatura" economists:  Some of their proposals will be incorporated into the  government action plan while the alternative programs themselves  are in for protracted discussions in parliamentary committees  and at party caucuses, to be subsequently buried in oblivion.    This is a win-win scenario for the government. On one hand,  the leading members of the cabinet stress that the reform  program in effect since last August will not be canceled under  any circumstances. On the other, it is admitted that to  overcome the economic crisis it is necessary to go outside the  framework of purely monetary methods of economic regulation. It  is expected that the main directions in economic policy  adjustments will be promulgated at an expanded government  session on 17 February (the president's speech to the Federation  Council scheduled for 18 February, however, can shift the date  of this event somewhat). In this case the incorporation of some  provisions from the alternative programs (at present there are  three: a memorandum by a group of academicians led by Stanislav  Shatalin; a program by Sergey Glazyev and Dmitriy Lvov; and the  "heterodox" plan by Yevgeniy Saburov) will allow the government  to avert possible accusations from its opponents of monopolist  practices in working out an economic course. As for the fate of  the "academic" reforms as a whole, speaking at yesterday's press  conference, Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin stated that all  of them will be considered at a State Duma session today,  together with the forecast for Russia's sociopolitical  development in 1994 prepared by his ministry and a report by the  State Statistics Committee -- which could well become the  beginning of a lengthy process of coordinating these programs,  which differ substantially. Usually the search for such  compromise formulas ends inconclusively.    Even so, as an Economy Ministry official said after the  collegium session, any programs drawn up now have very little  chance of being implemented -- regardless of their quality.  This is primarily due to the fact that in today's Russia any  prediction of socioeconomic development becomes outdated and  unrealistic very soon. Furthermore, the experience of  implementing such plans shows that they -- even judging by the  number of corresponding government documents adopted -- are  implemented by less than half. Thus, for instance, the August  plan of government actions in the sphere of financial policy was  fulfilled by 20 percent (out of the required 15 documents a mere  three were adopted); in the sphere of institutional changes, out  of 19 resolutions, five were approved; in structural policy,  only one-third of the documents planned were signed. In  addition to these, the ministry official singled out yet another  fact: In spite of the reorganization of the government  structure, it has proved impossible to overcome the "redundancy  of decisionmaking channels" -- the majority of government  members are busy "putting out fires" involved in the operation  of particular branches and enterprises, which does not allow the  government to attend to strategic planning.   <H3>    Main directions of action by the Russian Federation  Government in 1994 </H3>   creation of a commission on economic reform under the  government chairman;    rigid state regulation of monopoly activity, including  control of prices for their output;    enhancing financial settlement discipline: all enterprises  must submit information about all of their bank accounts;    elaboration of several models of government actions  contingent on the actual situation;    elaboration of a system of limit indicators in the social  sphere which must be exceeded;    implementation of institutional transformations aimed at  promoting competition on the domestic market;    lifting export quotas on a number of goods beginning in the  second half of the year.</p>

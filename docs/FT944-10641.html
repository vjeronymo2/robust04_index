			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (20): Community effort is the key / Profile of Caico farming co-operative When Kotei Gushiken arrived in Bolivia in 1954 he had little more than hope in his baggage - hope to begin a new life after leaving behind the economically depressed post-war Okinawa. With him came some 405 Japanese peasants, each of whom was given a plot of land by the Bolivian government as part of a programme to expand the agricultural frontier into the dense jungle that still predominated in the areas just north of Santa Cruz. A mysterious fatal disease and the peasants' unfamiliarity with the tropical soil and climate led nearly half of the recently arrived immigrants to abandon their new homes. Adverse soil conditions forced the remaining settlers to move their community twice before finally founding Okinawa colony in 1956. Attempts to cultivate cotton and other crops failed in these early stages. Yet today Mr Gushiken sits in an executive chair in his air-conditioned office in a brand new community centre built with Japanese government aid. He is now president of the Japanese-Bolivian Association with its 730 members. Mr Gushiken says: 'In the early days I never believed we could achieve what we have now - and much of that success is due to a communal effort.' The agricultural co-operative Caico, formed by the colony in 1971, today controls 10 per cent of the country's soya grain production and 35 per cent of total soya seed production. It was this community that began experimenting with the cultivation of soya back in the early 1970s, before the bean became the number one agricultural export in Bolivia. Land and machinery remain private property in the community but Caico provides technical assistance, long-term planning and collective bargaining with wholesalers. Quick to realise the long-term benefits of adding value to its basic product, Caico soon began processing soya beans on site. First, a seed processing plant was installed, then facilities to extract oil and produce soya-based animal feed. With a long-term outlook of secure but steady growth, Caico presently invests heavily in training its staff. Youngsters in the colony are given a scholarship and sent abroad to be trained as agronomists, veterinarians, business administrators and lawyers. 'In order to secure our future we need to invest in our people, maintain our high quality standards and diversify our product line,' says Mr Masayuki Kudaka, general manager of Caico. Caico is now studying the macadamia nut as a crop with a large potential for growth. Tree nurseries are already in place but the first harvest is still two years away. The latest success, though, is the co-operative's own supermarket in the city of Santa Cruz as a direct outlet for its products. Says Mr Kudaka: 'With help of the co-operative, we achieved together what we never could have done on our own.' An important factor in the community's perseverance has been the maintenance of cultural traditions. Japanese sociologists who recently visited the colony say its people have preserved their traditions more than their brethren in Okinawa.</p>

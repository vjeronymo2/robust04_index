			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Report of the Spokesman of the Public Order Ministry -- </F> ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, April 11 (ATA) -- On April 10, 1994, at  about 2.30 a.m., a unit of 6-7 armed Greek terroristic  commandos, among whom one who spoke Albanian with a Greek  accent, entered the Albanian territory in the vicinity of  Peshkepi village in the Gjirokaster district. At a distance of  four kilometres from the border, in a military training centre,  two of the group killed the soldier Arsen Llazar Gjini, 20  years, from the Seman village, Fier. After that, four others  rushed into the bedroom of the officers and opened fire against  some officers who were sleeping. As a result, the training  chief officer, first captain, Fatmir Sali Shehu, 34 years old,  was killed. Shehu was born in Tepelena and lived in  Gjirokaster. Three soldiers were also wounded and many others  had injuries. During these terrorist acts, one of them  screamed: "You have this for the north Epirus. Don't think we  have forgotten".    The investigation group led by public order minister, Agron  Musaraj, went to the spot immediately. It was concluded that  the act was carried out by Greek terroristic commandos in  military uniforms and with masks on their faces. They wore high  shoes of Greek production. All of them were armed with  shotguns. Material proofs found in the spot and the testimonies  by officers there prove that this is a planned barbarous act.  The fact that traces of the criminals lead to a Greek border  point is a clear proof that it is a massacre, the report of the  spokesman of the Public Order Ministry says.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 4 (XINHUA) -- China will float a  total of 5.5 billion yuan worth of shares for domestic investors  in 1994, roughly the same amount as the previous year.    The figure was decided upon in light of the actual capacity  of the current domestic market, said Ma Zhongzhi, a senior  official with the State Council's Securities Committee, to the  press here today.    He refused to disclose this year's projected sum for B  shares  targeted for overseas investors but said that the issuance of B  shares will still be limited to Shanghai and Shenzhen.    The securities authorities will, as last year, give each  province a certain quota of stocks to issue drawn from the total  amount. However, the examination and assessment of the applying  enterprises will be stricter to ensure the implementation of the  state industrial policy as well as the quality of the listed  company, according to Ma.    Allocation of this year's quota has not been revealed to the  localities, but Ma assured that the securities authorities will  arrange the flotation in a "proper and measured" manner.    China announced the issuing of 5 billion yuan in stocks last  year. However, the flotation did not start until August, after  the 30 billion yuan in state treasury bonds was sold out.    The continuous and fast-paced listings since the latter half  of the year quickly drained the capital pool of individual  investors and deflated their enthusiasm about stock buying,  which resulted in the doldrums of the stocks market over the  past several months.    Ma said the state's freeze on trading of the  institution-held  shares will not be removed before relevant regulations and rules  are worked out.    "We will see that the institution-held shares issued over  the  past few years do not flood into the market all at once, even  after we have the regulations worked out," Ma said.    The trading of state shares is more complex, Ma said.  Lifting the ban requires time, although it is the goal.    At present, when a state enterprise becomes a share-holding  firm, the shares it issues should be in three forms, owned by  the state, institution and individuals, with the proportion  roughly 5:3:2.    At present, all the stocks trading in Shanghai and Shenzhen  are individual shares. Meanwhile only six or seven  institutional shares are being traded in a special market in  Beijing on a trial basis. But the state stopped approval of more  such shares listed in the market due to a lack of proper laws  and rules.    Ma said that the state also will strictly ban the issuance  of  stocks by enterprises to their own employees before the state  publishes relevant rules to guide the activity.</p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US airline cancels Airbuses CONTINENTAL Airlines has cancelled a contract with Airbus Industrie for up to 46 aircraft originally valued at about Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.95bn) as the fifth largest US carrier attempts to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The contract included 20 firm orders for aircraft and options on 26 more. Mr David Venz, an Airbus spokesman said: 'I believe this is a pro forma technique to help Continental come out of bankruptcy. In some cases it is automatic for contracts to be cancelled when companies come out of Chapter 11. I think the operative word here is 'reorganisation', Chapter 11 allows the company to get itself reorganised, to come out and renegotiate contracts. . . ' Mr Richard Danforth, a Continental spokesman, said: 'Through the bankruptcy process we rejected the contract with Airbus. It is important to stress that we continue to have discussions with all three aircraft manufacturers.' Virgin Atlantic and its advertising agency have asked Continental to stop a campaign claiming Continental's new BusinessFirst service is unique. Virgin says its own Upper Class service is similar or superior to Continental's BusinessFirst, and has been offered for nine years.</p>

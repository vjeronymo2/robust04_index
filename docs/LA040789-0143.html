			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOLLWAY OFFICIALS, IN EFFORT TO CUT LEGAL BILLS, ORDER STUDY OF A STAFF  ATTORNEY JOB  </P> <P> Moving to quiet controversy over seven-figure legal bills, officials of Orange  County's tollway agencies Thursday ordered a study of the potential benefits of  hiring a staff attorney.  </P> <P> The decision came after a partner in the politically influential law firm that  has charged the agency $1.2 million in the last 2 1/2 years defended the  quality and cost of its work.  </P> <P> The law firm, Nossaman, Guthner, Knox &amp; Elliott, currently handles both  general legal work and lobbying in Sacramento for the San Joaquin Hills  Transportation Corridor Agency and the Eastern/Foothill Transportation Corridor  Agency. The agencies are planning tollways in eastern and southern Orange  County.  </P> <P> A joint five-member agency finance committee Thursday ordered Executive  Director John Meyer to study and resolve the issue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Proposals Rejected  </P> <P> The committee earlier rejected two separate proposals -- one to hire a  consultant to study the question, and another to split the agency's legal  business into separate categories for general representation and lobbying.  </P> <P> The lobbying work of the Nossaman firm is praised as "superlative" in a report  submitted to the committee by members Thomas Daly, an Anaheim councilman, and  Robert A. Curtis, a Mission Viejo councilman. However, the report recommends  that the corridor agencies explore ways to use friendly legislators and the  legislative counsel's office in Sacramento for some of the work now done by  Nossaman, Guthner.  </P> <P> The recommendations of Daly and Curtis echoed concerns raised by former tollway  board member and former county Supervisor Bruce Nestande. Nestande, a memer of  the California Transportation Commission, said Thursday that Nossaman, Guthner  was never supposed to handle both general legal work and lobbying in  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Nestande was a member of both corridor agency boards in 1986 when Nossaman,  Guthner was first hired. Nestande said board members at that time agreed to  seek separate contracts for general legal services and lobbying. But agency  board members said they cannot recall such an agreement and that the work was  never divided.  </P> <P> Minutes from discussions at agency meetings in 1986 show concerns on the part  of some board members about problems that might arise by using a single law  firm to research, draft and lobby for the same legislation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Criticism  </P> <P> Some slow-growth advocates had also criticized the Nossaman firm's representing  at that time both the tollway agency and an organization representing many of  the developers who paid fees that went into the agency's coffers.  </P> <P> Nestande, citing his position with the state Transportation Commission, which  has approved some state funding for the tollways, said Thursday that he still  has concerns about the same law firm's researching and drafting legislation,  and then working to secure its passage.  </P> <P> "There is no way to establish a comfort factor with the public at large that  every single piece of work being done is essential if the same firm is  researching, drafting and advocating the same legislation," Nestande said.  </P></p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Property deals pull in Pounds 230m for new-towns commission The Commission for the New Towns, the government agency which owns the remaining public assets of England's 21 former new towns, raised Pounds 230m cash in the year to the end of March, up from Pounds 160m. In July last year Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said that the commission would be wound up by March 1998. It has already been split into two slimmed-down agencies responsible for marketing the remaining land and buildings. The commission's annual report, published yesterday, shows commercial property sales valued at Pounds 130m. A further Pounds 111m came from the transfer of housing assets to the local authority and housing associations in Basildon. After tax and loan interest the commission returned Pounds 117m to the government, bringing its total contributions to the Exchequer in the past five years to Pounds 867m. The commission made 500 sales during the year, compared with 430 in 1992-93. Sir Neil Shields, chairman, said market conditions had improved since the begining of the financial year and that Pounds 95m from commercial transactions had already been received. He estimated that receipts for the current full year would be about Pounds 162m. The commission still owns 2.5m sq ft of commercial and industrial floor space and 19,000 acres of land. Most of its remaining assets are in Milton Keynes and former new towns in the North and Midlands, such as Telford and Warrington. Holdings in the former new towns surrounding London have dwindled. Excluding the Basildon housing transaction, which involved the transfer of 13,000 homes and leaves the CNT with virtually no residential housing, receipts from towns in Southern England amounted to only Pounds 35m. The commission employs 450 people, down from a peak of 1,100 during the mid 1980s. The number of employees is projected to fall to 220 by 1997/98.</p>

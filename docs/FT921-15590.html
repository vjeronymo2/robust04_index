			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Second opposition party launched in Kenya KENYA'S second opposition party was formally launched in Nairobi yesterday. The Democratic Party (DP) promised to end what it called President Daniel arap Moi's dictatorship and to usher in democracy, good governance, accountability and transparency. Mr Mwai Kibaki, a veteran politician and former vice-president who resigned from Mr Moi's government on Christmas Day, said his party was also committed to free enterprise and to racial, sexual and religious equality. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford) was the first substantial opposition party to be launched. Multi-party elections are due this year. In a lengthy policy manifesto, Mr Kibaki, a prominent political figure from the large and wealthy Kikuyu tribe, also set out the first detailed opposition social and economic programme. Political observers said yesterday, Mr Kibaki had failed to attract sufficient broad-based support among Kenya's tribes to make the new party a serious contender against the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy as the main opposition party. DP leaders are mostly Kikuyu and former members of the government. Political analysts say the DP may further alienate the Kikuyu inhabitants of the populous Central Province, away from the ruling party.</p>

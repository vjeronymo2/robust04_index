			<p>BFN     [Text] [Acting] Secretary Aguirre [of Department of  Interior and Local Government] says the Philippine Government  will continue to go after communist rebels who have standing  warrants of arrest. Aguirre made this statement as he defended  the National Police's continued detention of CPP-NPA [Communist  Party of the Philippines-New People's Army] Secretary General  Wilma Tiamzon and four others. He cited cases of kidnapping  with serious illegal detention, robbery and other  rebellion-related offenses as their bases for holding the five  under custody. Aguirre also stressed that the arrest did not  adversely affect the peace process, since the Philippine  Government has not entered into any agreement to suspend any  arrest, hear cases or surveillance activities with the National  Democratic Front.    In a related development, doctors of Tiamzon are urging  President Ramos to order her release from detention on medical  and humanitarian grounds. The doctors examined Tiamzon, Tuesday  morning, and recommended her immediate hospitalization. They  said Tiamzon is suffering from severe uncontrolled hypertension,  chronic infection of the kidney, kidney hemorrhage and bronchial  asthma. They urged the president to have her transferred to the  Philippine Heart Center where she can get immediate and constant  medical attention.</p>

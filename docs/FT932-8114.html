			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Letter: S African authorities must change rules of corporate governance Sir, In our Personal View article of August 19, 1992 ('Feather beds in South Africa's boardrooms'), we argued that shareholding arrangements, particularly pyramiding and the ubiquity of de facto voteless shares, should be changed so that the great South African conglomerates were subject to the discipline of takeover bids, and that this would be likely to lead to the unbundling of many a bloated corporate structure. Now we have the first big unbundling of Gencor which is rightly welcomed in your editorial, 'Unbundling' (May 12), as a first step in releasing South Africa's economy from the stranglehold of the few who control the large holding companies. The shareholders of Gencor are the immediate beneficiaries, but the ensuing improvements in efficiency will benefit both workers and customers as well. But Gencor's unbundling, probably encouraged by a newly enlightened tax regime, occurred in spite of a structure of securities law (and exchange control) which still allows, even encourages, concentration of management control in few well-sheltered hands. The remaining conglomerate managements can still lie snugly in their feather beds safe behind the barriers to intruders. Indeed, Anglo American has announced that it intended to do precisely that. The Gencor components will still be largely free from threat of takeovers both domestic and foreign. The South African government and the stock exchange authorities should change the rules of corporate governance and open all South African industry to domestic, and eventually, through abolition of exchange controls, foreign takeover bids. Only then will a free competitive South African industry thrive in an open environment and provide the prosperity on which its political as well as its economic future depends.

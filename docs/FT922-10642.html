			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Austmin launches rescue plan for Europa THE BATTLE for management control of Europa Minerals, the UK mining finance house, being waged between Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, and Austmin Gold, an Australian exploration company, entered a new phase yesterday when Austmin gave details of its own rescue plan for Europa. Austmin said it had prepared a fully underwritten rights issue for Europa on terms it believed would be better than those recently proposed by the Europa board. The Australian group, which is Europa's biggest shareholder with 14.3 per cent, said institutions which together accounted for more than 40 per cent of Europa's capital had indicated they would support the proposal. Henry Ansbacher would act as lead underwriter for a 9-for-4 rights issue at 5p a share. Mr Guido Staltari, Austmin's managing director, said this would raise Pounds 4.25m gross against the Pounds 3.4m under the board's scheme. There would also be about 20 per cent less dilution for shareholders not taking up their rights. Also, control of Europa would remain with existing shareholders and 'potential domination' by GPG and Mid-East Minerals, two companies in Sir Ron's orbit, would be avoided. Austmin's rights issue depends on the outcome of a special meeting on May 7 when the Australian company hopes shareholders will vote to remove all four of Europa's non-executive directors and put two Austmin representatives on the board. Austmin would retain Europa's oil and gas assets and would not dispose of the Preston colliery. Mr Staltari pointed out Austmin would limit its shareholding to 19.9 per cent after the rights issue and was not not seeking to control the board. Abbey Life, with 9.79 per cent of Europa, said yesterday it would support the Austmin proposals if they were put. M&amp;G, with 10 per cent, said it was 'supportive' of the Austmin proposals but was still talking to both sides and had made no final decision about its vote at the special meeting. Standard Life, a 9 per cent holder, said it had not not made its position clear to either side.</p>

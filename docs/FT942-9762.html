			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Lisbon announces radical reform of bond market Portugal's bond market is to be radically reformed next month with a comprehensive package of measures designed to increase liquidity, improve efficiency and bring trading practices into line with other European capital markets. The government said yesterday the measures would create a wide range of new instruments and make the market more attractive to foreign investors. The package, which includes the effective abolition of withholding tax on non-residents, takes effect on June 23. Traders welcomed the reforms, which should provide a framework for market development and a significant increase in liquidity. They are the culmination of almost two years of reform following the liberalisation of Portuguese capital movements in 1992. 'These reforms provide the instruments that international investors have long been looking for in Portugal,' said Mr Rui Ferreira, director of fixed-income security trading at Banco Finantia. 'We are now likely to see foreign investment in the bond market move up from less than 5 per cent of the total towards 30 per cent.' The main reforms are: The effective abolition of a 20 per cent withholding tax on non-resident holders of government bonds by refunding investors within 24 hours. Investors based in tax havens will not be exempt; The creation of a screen-based over-the-counter market open to banks for wholesale fixed-income security transactions of at least Es175m. The stock market will continue to be limited to brokers and will tend to specialise in retail transactions; Non-residents will be free to issue bonds and commercial paper in the Portuguese market after giving four days notice. Such issues are currently subject to government approval; A 9 per cent stamp duty and a 0.5 percent stock-market commission on repurchase agreements will be abolished and replaced by an annual fee to be paid for linkage to the screen-based reporting and clearing system; The abolition of taxes and commissions is designed to foster the growth of a repurchase market for Treasury bonds. The Bank of Portugal, the central bank, is to use Treasury bond repos as a new instrument of monetary policy; A regulatory framework for short selling and bond lending is to be introduced. The main aim is create a 'grey market' to allow bidding at bond auctions to begin earlier; Coupons are to be traded on a gross basis and interest will accrue to the financial settlement date. Coupons are currently traded on a net basis and interest accrues to the physical settlement date; A new payment versus delivery system is to be installed bringing Portugal in line with the Euroclear system. The aim is to increase security and reduce counterparty risk. 'These measures will place us much closer to the more advanced European bond markets in terms of legislation, infrastructures and trading practices,' said a government official. 'The reform will be further enhanced by the creation of a futures and an options market before the end of the year.' Market capitalisation of the Portuguese bond market was Es4.58bn at the end of 1993, a rise of 35 per cent over the previous year. Daily turnover averaged Es27.6bn in February, against Es7.3bn a year earlier. Analysts said the market was benefiting from Portugal's sound economic fundamentals and political stability. For example, the yield on five-year government bonds yesterday was about 100 basis points higher than in Spain, which is suffering the effects of a political crisis. But inflexible legislation, high taxes and a lack of liquidity currently made Portugal relatively unattractive to international investors. 'The withholding tax was a big deterrent to foreign investors,' said Mr Jorge Silveira Botelha of brokers Midas Investimento. 'Now that we have a date for its abolition, the liquidity of the market is certain to improve and market-makers will become more aggressive. These reforms will help Portugal compete more effectively with its main rivals, Spain and Italy.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               DEVELOPMENT OF THE PORTUGUESE BOND MARKET  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 1992 Escudo placed in ERM of the EMS Dec 1992 Capital movements liberalised Dec 1992 Benchmark for five-year fixed-term securities Apr 1993 Fixed-term securities integrated into stock exchange's          continuous trading system Apr 1993 Benchmark for seven-year fixed-term securities May 1993 Standard &amp; Poor's upgrades Portugal's long term external debt          to AA- from A+ Jul 1993 Benchmark for 10-year fixed-term securities Jan 1994 Fixed-term securities issued with standard annual coupon Feb 1994 Plans announced to change fiscal system to enable non-resident          investors to receive refund of withholding tax levied on          Portuguese government bonds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

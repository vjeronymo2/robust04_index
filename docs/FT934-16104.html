			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Fujitsu and Hyundai in D-Ram chip venture FUJITSU, the Japanese computer and telecommunications company, and Hyundai Electronics, part of the South Korean Hyundai Business Group, have agreed to collaborate in the manufacture of semiconductor memory chips. Fujitsu said they would work on 4-megabit and 16-megabit dynamic random access memory (D-Ram) chips. The move reflects the changing order in the memory market, where Japanese semiconductor makers once held predominance. Last year, Samsung, another Korean company, overtook Toshiba of Japan as the world's largest manufacturer of D-Rams. The move to next-generation D-Rams involves huge investments which Japanese companies, under pressure both at home and abroad, cannot now afford to make. As a result, Korean semiconductor makers have led in the race to invest in 16-megabit D-Rams and those unable to do so have set up alliances which often span national borders. 'It's a good move for Fujitsu because it can't really afford to spend so much money on D-Rams,' commented Mr Phua Lee-Kerk, analyst at Barings Securities. Mr Phua said that in the long run D-Ram makers could be reduced to five: NEC and Toshiba from Japan, Samsung and Goldstar from Korean, and Texas Instruments of the US. Fujitsu and Hyundai also agreed to explore the potential for collaboration in developing future generations of D-Rams.</p>

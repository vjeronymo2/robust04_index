			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Du Pont reduces toxic emission DU PONT, the leading US chemicals company, said the level of its toxic chemical releases declined by 30 per cent in 1990, thanks to advanced technologies. Using data it supplied to the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, Du Pont said that 1990 toxic releases from more than 80 plants in the US amounted to 236m pounds, compared with 339m pounds in 1989. Some two-thirds of the toxic releases were piped into deep underground wells. Mr Bruch Karrh, Du Pont vice-president in charge of environmental affairs, said the company's goal by 2,000 was essentially to eliminate the underground injection of hazardous chemical process wastes. Meanwhile, Raytheon, the defence, electronics and aircraft company, has issued a report on its own efforts to reduce environmental damage caused by its manufacturing. The Massachusetts-based company said it reduced chemical releases to the environment by 58 per cent between 1987 and last year. Based on reports from 22 plants across the US, Raytheon said its total chemical releases were 2.5m pounds in 1991, down from 5.9m pounds in 1987. It achieved the reductions through a combination of chemical substitutions, process modifications and chemical management controls.</p>

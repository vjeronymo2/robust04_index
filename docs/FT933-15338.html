			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: TGWU rounds on Labour reform plan MR BILL MORRIS, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, yesterday launched a strong attack on Labour's front bench as the TGWU's biennial conference voted to reject the Labour leadership's plans for reforms of internal party democracy. Delegates gave Mr Morris a standing ovation as he warned those in the Labour party who wanted to introduce the principle of one member one vote that 'we will not be moved'. Mr Morris added: 'We are not turkeys and we are not going to vote for Christmas.' Meanwhile, in the Commons yesterday, some Tories taunted Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, over the opposition to reforms he faced from the unions. Mr Tony Newton, Leader of the House, said Mr Smith's attempts to persuade the unions of his plans had been a 'catastrophe'. But Mr Smith's aides said the Labour leader 'stood by every word' of the speech he made to the TGWU conference in Bournemouth on Wednesday when he called for the relationship between Labour and the unions to be 'modernised'. The stage is now set for a battle on union-Labour links at this autumn's Labour party conference. Only the AEU engineering union and the ISTC steel union positively support the Labour leader on the key issue of removing unions from the selection of local candidates. With a few other small unions probably backing the leader that might amount to 15 per cent out of the 70 per cent of the votes allocated to the unions at the conference. Combined with about 65 per cent of the constituency parties - who together account for 30 per cent of the total vote - supporters of Mr Smith's plan for one-member-one-vote command no more than one-third of the conference votes. Some of the opponents of the the Labour leader's plan are seen as potential waverers. The conference delegations from three out of the big six unions affiliated to the party - Nupe the public service union, Usdaw the shopworkers and MSF the white collar union - could, it is believed, be persuaded to shift position to support one-member-one-vote.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Albanian Democrats predict poll victory over Socialists OUTSIDE what in communist days was Korce's Palace of Culture, a line of neatly-dressed Albanians waited to vote yesterday in the country's second free elections in just under a year. There was almost complete silence inside, as voters marked their ballot slips behind a bright orange curtain and dropped them into a box sealed with string and plasticine. Polling seemed orderly in Korce, the largest town in southern Albania - in contrast with last year, when voters, especially in the surrounding villages, were physically intimidated by the security police, according to candidates and local officials. The Democratic party hopes to reverse last year's defeat by the Socialists, the renamed communists, by attracting a substantial percentage of votes in the countryside. 'Last year we won in Korce and most towns but we lost the election because we didn't have transport to reach the villages,' says Mr Petrika Minga, the Democrats' district chairman. As well as owning battered cars now, Democratic party candidates have been covering the countryside in brand new American jeeps, accompanied by American diplomats. This helps reinforce an impression, already widespread among Albanians, that US aid and investment will be the key to rescuing the country from its deep economic impasse. The Democrats say they will win about 55 per cent of the vote and an overall majority in parliament, which will have up to 155 seats, depending on how many parties meet the 4 per cent of the vote threshold for representation in the chamber. Although 11 parties are fielding candidates, the Social Democrats and the conservative Republicans are alone among smaller groups in expecting to win more than the odd seat. The Human Rights Committee, an umbrella for the ethnic Greek party banned from the election, complains that several of its candidates were illegally prevented from running. The Socialists, who claim they will be the strongest parliamentary party, say that because of a fiercely polarised political climate only a coalition of politicians and technocrats from all big parties will be able to govern the country. But it has been under a succession of weak and quarrelsome coalition governments that Albania has slipped into near anarchy in the past nine months. Many local officials carry pistols to work and foreign businessmen have been forced to hire bodyguards. The country now depends mainly on foreign aid, provided mostly by Italy over the winter, for basic food supplies. Industrial output is down to about 20 per cent of its levels before the Stalinist regime collapsed at the end of 1990, and seems likely to fall further, since much post-election aid will have to be channelled into food production. But even so, farm production will be only around 25 per cent of last year's because disputes over land privatisation meant that virtually no cereals were planted last autumn. 'Whoever comes to power in Albania now must be an optimist,' says Mr Ilir Manushi, the Korce district governor.</p>

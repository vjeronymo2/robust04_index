			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOBEL LAUREATE'S DATA TARGET OF PROBE  </P> <P> A congressional panel looking into scientific fraud said Thursday the Secret  Service found "significant" alterations in notebooks used to support a paper  co-authored by Nobel Prize-winning biologist David Baltimore.  </P> <P> Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and  investigations, said the Secret Service probe "confirmed that the data and  authenticity of parts of the key notebook were questionable."  </P> <P> But Baltimore countered that nothing uncovered by the Secret Service indicates  wrongdoing or would change the scientific conclusions of his research.  </P> <P> Dingell said entries purported to have been recorded in 1984 and 1985 were  actually made in the spring of 1986 -- after the controversial paper,  describing mouse experiments on genetic control of the immune system, had  already been published.  </P></p>

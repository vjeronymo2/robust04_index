Against the depressed background it was a commendable performance, said Sir Eric Pountain, chairman. Operating profit in the second half was only 6 per cent lower than last year, and compared with a drop of 34 per cent in the first half. The important Christmas trade was very late to develop. Sales edged ahead to Pounds 67.6m (Pounds 67m) excluding VAT, and operating profit was nearly 13 per cent lower at Pounds 5.25m.

Investment income and interest declined to Pounds 2.49m (Pounds 3m) reflecting the downward movement of interest rates. Earnings per share were 11.3p (13.03p) and the final dividend is 4.35p for a total of 5.75p (5.5p).</p>

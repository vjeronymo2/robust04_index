			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Hong Kong stays at peak SPECULATION that the Osaka securities exchange will soon announce a new stock futures index triggered unwinding of arbitrage positions, and share prices lost 1.1 per cent on selling of small-capital stocks, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 234.62 to 20,265.63 after a high of 20,494.45 and a low of 20,262.83. Investors and dealers sold components of the Nikkei 225 index, on rumours that the index will be replaced by a capitalisation weighted average. The settlement of October options contracts today also prompted selling by traders adjusting positions. Osaka and Tokyo stock exchange authorities have been working on a capitalisation weighted average to replace the Nikkei 225, which is a simple price weighted average and is seen as easily manipulated. Volume was 300m shares against 330m. Declines led advances by 613 to 382 with 184 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.99 to 1,646.79 and, inLondon, the ISE/Nikkei50 index rose 3.42 to 1,279.93. Traders sold low liquidity small-capital component issues of the Nikkei, on expectations that such stocks would be excluded from the new index. Nippon Kayaku fell Y10 to Y851 and Shinagawa Refractories lost Y70 to Y1,060. However, Daiwa Securities gained Y50 to Y1,420 and Yamaichi Securities rose Y10 to Y810 on rumours that they would become components of the new index. Pharmaceuticals were lower on reports of cuts in regulated drug prices: Sankyo plunged Y130 to Y2,830 on speculation that price cuts of up to 10 per cent might be made on Mevalotin, its profit generating anti-cholesterol drug. Elsewhere, Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical fell Y40 to Y2,410 and Takeda Chemical lost Y30 to Y1,310. High-technology issues which gained ground on Wednesday, fell on profit-taking. Hitachi declined Y6 to Y844, Mitsubishi Electric lost Y11 to Y575 and Sony declined Y40 to Y4,580. On the other hand, foreign buying supported car shares, with Mitsubishi Motors gaining Y6 to Y832, Nissan Motor up Y26 to Y767 and Honda Motor rising Y30 to Y1,640. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 54.05 to 22,401.76 in volume of 15.9m shares. Small-lot selling depressed large-capital shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets continued in positive fashion yesterday. HONG KONG finished at a fifth consecutive record during a session that saw prices sharply lower after earlyprofit-taking by local investors before US funds, which have been driving the rally, once again entered the market as buyers. The Hang Seng index finished 25.22 higher at 8,066.79 inturnover that dipped to HKDollars 6.19bn against an adjusted HKDollars 7.18bn on Wednesday. The index has risen by 8.2 per cent over the last 10 days as strategists, mainly in the US, have increased their weighting for the market. Index futures fell sharply in late trade and the lower trend spilled over to subsequent London trading, where the indicative index shed 71 to 7,996. AUSTRALIA saw its third consecutive rise with the All Ordinaries index adding 3.7 to 2,022.5, but off the day's high of 2,031.8. Turnover was ADollars 612.8m. Coca-Cola Amatil gained 38 cents to ADollars 8.98 after announcing earlier this week that it was paying ADollars 70m for a half share in Indonesia's main Coke bottler. NEW ZEALAND added to Wednesday's gains with a strong rise in Telecom, up 11 cents to NZDollars 4.24, which was sought by US investors. The NZSE-40 capital index ended 36.42 higher at 2,018.95. KUALA LUMPUR saw interest focused on rubber stocks and Genting, the gaming group, which put on MDollars 2 to MDollars 27 on reports that it was to commission two floating casinos. The composite index closed up 8.57 at 874.34 in volume of 657m shares. MANILA closed higher on steady buying by domestic investors and the composite index rose 12.35 to 1,961.04 in volume of 516m shares. TAIWAN extended early gains to end 2.1 per cent higher and turnover expanded on hopes for the successful passage through parliament of a proposal to cut the stock transaction tax.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Paola Badaracco] </F>   [Text] Justice Minister Ruben Creixems yesterday disagreed  with the idea of civilian armed groups or death squads taking  the administration of justice into their own hands. "The states  must solve their security problems in accordance with the law,  fully respecting human rights, and following legally established  procedures," he said.    All of these situations are irregular, are even an offense  classified by Venezuelan law as a crime, that of taking justice  into one's own hands. One single person should not determine who  is guilty or innocent, or apply the sentence that best suits him  as judge. That would be terrible for society, he added.    Regarding the Catia Prison, he said the idea is to close it  down but that it has been impossible because there is no  available room in other prisons to transfer the inmates. The  solution of this problem will take some time because new prisons  have to be built. The Catia Prison cannot be repaired because of  its dilapidated condition. In addition, it is not normal these  days to have prisons in the center of cities. "Prisons must be  on the outskirts. When Catia was built, it met this requirement  but now it has been engulfed by the city." Nevertheless, he  admitted that society is desperate for a degree of insecurity,  although the crime rate has experienced a remarkable reduction.    Asked about the "Lights Against Criminals" organization, the  minister said he does not know its members but is of the opinion  that this is a civilian movement legally pressuring the  government to find a solution to the insecurity problem while  contributing commonsense ideas that should be taken into  consideration.    Regarding the possibility of this being a rightist movement,  he said it would be necessary to investigate but added that not  everyone who declares himself against crime is a Fascist or a  rightist. It will have to be looked into because I do not have  sufficient information to express an opinion on the personal,  philosophical, or ideological features of the members of this  organization. I am under the impression that they are a group of  worried persons who contribute ideas, sometimes extreme ideas. I  do not think, however, that they are seeking violent solutions  or taking justice into their own hands. If this is the case, it  should be strongly rejected because we believe in a de jure  state and an established administration of justice, he said.    As for the interior minister's proposal to reactivate Isla  del Burro, Creixems recalled that, once the Executive Branch has  decided to open a prison, his office must update and manage it.  He explained that the money for carrying out Minister Escovar  Salom's proposal are not included in the budget, but that if the  proposal is accepted, the money could be secured. Anyway, he  pointed out that it is up to the Urban Development Ministry to  secure the money for any renovations.    Consulted over the resignation of some magistrates because  of  their low salaries, Creixems said the situation is dramatic and  admitted that the public officials are underpaid. He regretted  that competent and efficient magistrates resign because of low  salaries and leave their posts to officials who are not overly  concerned with salary. "I do not mean that those who do not  resign are scoundrels. But we are in a situation in which  high-level officials, with very great responsibilities, are  pressured by the economic crisis and the scant money they earn,  which prevents them from leading a decent life consistent with  their profession," he said.    The minister said that a Security Council will meet next  Thursday where everything related to the matter and the  solutions proposed by the Executive Branch will be discussed.  Once measures are decided on, they will be announced as  political measures.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Iberia pilots force showdown The crisis at Iberia, the Spanish state airline, deepened yesterday after Mr Javier Salas, the company's chairman, failed to convince the powerful pilots' union to support a rescue plan for the financially crippled flag carrier. The breakdown of what was viewed as a final negotiating round with the pilots is now likely to force the government to intervene directly in the dispute. Madrid will want to avert a resumption of strike action over the peak Christmas period following last week's stoppages. Mr Salas said the failure to obtain an agreement with the pilots, after the viability plan had obtained preliminary acceptance by ground staff unions, meant he would now press ahead with a controversial restructuring programme that involves cutting some 5,000 jobs, 20 per cent of Iberia's labour force, and the sale of subsidiaries in order to stave off the company's threatened bankruptcy.</p>

The Armed Forces have reinforced their troops with 6,000  soldiers in the area of conflict, where there were already a  number of soldiers prior to the EZLN-launched offensive, the  newspaper stated, not citing its sources.    This report has not yet been officially confirmed.    According to Chiapas authorities, the guerrillas "are just a  few," possibly some 400, but estimates made by journalists who  have traveled to the region list the EZLN members at between 800  and 1,000.    A guerrilla has told the press that his troops consist of  approximately 5,000 men.    The area of conflict is located approximately 700 km south  of  Mexico City.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  SANTA MONICA BANS ASSAULT WEAPONS  </P> <P> Santa Monica has joined the growing list of California cities banning assault  weapons.  </P> <P> Citing "unprecedented episodes of violence," the City Council voted unanimously  late Tuesday night to outlaw the sale of semiautomatic assault rifles,  effective immediately. Possession of the firearms is banned starting May 1.  </P> <P> More than a dozen gun enthusiasts, members of the National Rifle Assn. and gun  shop owners protested the law, saying it was unconstitutional and wouldn't  work. They complained the definition of assault rifles is too broad and said  the ban would take away "legitimate" weapons from hunters.  </P> <P> But council members were unswayed. Councilman David Finkel, who called assault  rifles the "scourge of the country," said he hoped Santa Monica's action would  encourage the state Legislature to enact a ban. Santa Monica modeled its law  after a Los Angeles ordinance that took effect Wednesday, defining an assault  weapon as a rifle that can be outfitted with a detachable magazine that holds  at least 20 rounds of ammunition.  </P></p>

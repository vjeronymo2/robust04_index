Candice Bergen won top honors for best actress in a  comedy.  </P> <P> "I guess this means you'll be saying 'You were robbed' to some other boy,"  Danson kidded the black-tie audience in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. He plays  Sam Malone, the womanizing bartender in the NBC comedy "Cheers."  </P> <P> His co-star, Kirstie Alley, earlier had ribbed Danson about his poor track  record, likening it to a sexually unfulfilling trip to the drive-in theater.  </P> <P> "This is exactly what happened to me in the drive-in," Danson said when he won.  "The whole drive-in stood up and cheered."  </P> <P> Bergen, who won for the title role on CBS' "Murphy Brown," thanked her fellow  cast members "for helping me with my marks every week."  </P> <P> "Delta (Burke) is going to be waiting for me in the parking lot," Bergen said,  referring to a fellow nominee. "I really feel twice blessed."  </P> <P> Alex Rocco won the Emmy as comedy's outstanding supporting actor for his  portrayal of sleazy talent agent Al Floss in "The Famous Teddy Z." The  supporting actress award for a comedy went to Bebe Neuwirth, the self-possessed  psychoanalyst on "Cheers."  </P> <P> "Hello, lady," said a stunned Rocco upon accepting his statuette. "My gratitude  to Hugh Wilson for creating Al Floss, the most fun character I ever played."  </P> <P> Said Neuwirth, who plays Lilith on "Cheers": "I'm overwhelmed. I'd like to  thank all my friends and family who said go ahead and take the job in  television in Los Angel es."  </P> <P> "The Wonder Years" collected trophies for best directing (Michael Dinner) and  writing (Bob Brush) in a comedy series.  </P> <P> Terrence McNally won the writing honor miniseries or special category for  "Andre's Mother," on American Playhouse (PBS).  </P> <P> The award for supporting actor in a miniseries or special went to Vincent  Gardenia for "Age-Old Friends" on HBO. Director Joseph Sargent won the trophy  for a miniseries or special for "Caroline?" on the Hallmark Hall of Fame on  CBS.  </P> <P> Eva Marie Saint won in the supporting actress category for a miniseries or  special for her role on NBC's "People Like Us."  </P> <P> Bergen, Jay Leno and Jane Pauley were hosts of the gala event.  </P> <P> ABC took an early lead in the 42nd annual award presentation, winning 13 Emmys  in the non-televised segment of the program leading up to Sunday's nationally  televised show.  </P> <P> After Saturday night's creative arts Emmys, ABC had 13 trophies, NBC had 11 and  CBS had 6.  </P> <P> ABC and NBC had tied for the most nominations with 95 selections. CBS had 73  and Fox drew 23.  </P> <P> ABC's quirky drama "Twin Peaks" won two awards in Saturday's non-televised  program -- for editing and costume design.  </P> <P> Fox's "The Simpsons" was selected top animated program.  </P> <P> In addition to "Twin Peaks," multiple winners from Saturday's festivities were  Fox's "The Tracey Ullman Show" and HBO's "Carmen on Ice," with three awards  each, and NBC's "The Phantom of the Opera," with two.  </P> <P> Before Sunday's broadcast, Leonard Goldenson was selected as the recipient of  the annual Governor's Award. Goldenson, founder of the American Broadcasting  Cos., joins such previous winners of the award as Grant Tinker, Lucille Ball,  Johnny Carson, Bob Hope and Alistair Cooke.  </P> <P> The Emmy for outstanding achievement in casting was announced in August. It  went to Randy Stone and Holly Powell for CBS' "The Incident."  </P> <P> The Fox network, which has broadcast the Emmys for the last three years, is in  the first year of a new three-year contract with the television academy.  Despite attracting smaller ratings than the three major networks, the Fox  broadcasts have helped to establish the fourth network as a significant  television presence.  </P> <P> The broadcast was seen in more than two dozen countries, representing a global  audience of 150 million. Nations receiving the show included Bangladesh, Costa  Rica, Nicaragua and Venezuela.  </P></p>

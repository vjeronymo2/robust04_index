			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WISCONSIN;  </P> <P> MULTIPLE PERSONALITY RAPE CASE DROPPED  </P> <P> A judge dismissed charges against a man accused of sexually assaulting a woman  with 46 personalities.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Joseph Paulus had asked that Mark Peterson, 29, not be retried  because it might be harmful to the victim. Circuit Judge Robert Hawley in  Oshkosh, Wis., earlier had overturned Peterson's Nov. 8 conviction because the  defense had not been allowed to have a psychiatrist examine the woman before  the trial. "The jury verdict, although now set aside on a legal technicality,  sent a strong message to the community that mentally ill individuals in our  society must be protected from those who prey upon them," Paulus said.  </P></p>

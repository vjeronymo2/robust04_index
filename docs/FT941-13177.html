			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / Liberal leader of Belarus ousted by his parliament The Soviet-era conservative parliament of Belarus yesterday ousted the country's liberal leader, Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, and appeared to end any hope of rapid economic reforms and a neutral foreign policy, agencies report. Deputies voted 209 to 36 to dismiss Mr Shushkevich, 59, as chairman of parliament. In his position he had waged virtually a single-handed ideological battle against reluctant converts to market economics in parliament and government. The country's conservative prime minister, Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, and Mr Shushkevich's constant rival, survived a similar vote to oust him. A total of 101 voted for his dismissal and 175 against. The formal motion accused both men of corruption. However, deputies made it plain that the vote was intended to censure Mr Shushkevich's support for market reforms and resistance to aligning foreign policy with neighbouring Russia. 'This is approval for the government's policy. Mr Shushkevich is an idealist,' said Mr Kebich's senior adviser, Mr Valery Skorynin. 'You cannot reform and privatise any more quickly than our government has been doing,' he added. Mr Shushkevich's first deputy, Mr Vyacheslav Kuznetsov, a government official in the Soviet era, took over as acting chairman of parliament. Liberals, a small minority in parliament, said the vote portended the end of Belarus as an entity separate from Russia in the post-Soviet era. 'Belarus's new pro-Russian leadership will conduct its affairs in such a way as to bring the country into the Russian empire,' said Mr Zenon Poznyak, leader of the Belarus Popular Front. 'This is a betrayal of Belarus sovereignty.' Some moderates said Mr Kebich was still morally obliged to resign after more than 100 deputies voted against him. Mr Shushkevich, backed by President Bill Clinton during his tour of the former Soviet Union two weeks ago, came under fierce attack from opponents in the debate leading up to the vote. Some said he had failed as a statesman, others denounced him for helping dismantle communist power, as a co-signatory of the 1991 accord declaring the Soviet Union defunct. In contrast to neighbouring Ukraine, Belarus did not seek independence as the Soviet Union disintegrated and its politics remain dominated by communists.</p>

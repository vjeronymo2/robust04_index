Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and national unification  minister, said the government will step up consultations with  the United States and the IAEA on ways to have Pyongyang accept  inspections by the U.N.-sponsored nuclear watchdog. He made the  remarks during a consultation on unification policies between  government and ruling Democratic Liberal Party officials.    Yi also gave the meeting an analysis of the North Korean  Foreign Ministry's statement Monday, where the communist country  threatened to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,  if Washington continued to demand full-scale inspections and  build up its forces in the South.    "North Koreans seem to fear that the strengthened U.S.  military and intelligence activities in the South may be part of  its efforts to accumulate pretexts for international sanctions  (against them)," he said.    Meanwhile, a senior Foreign Ministry official said it was  improper for North Koreans to take issue with the deployment of  Patriot missiles in the South, which has nothing to do with the  North Korean nuclear issue.    Commenting on the North Korean statement, the official said  the antimissile missiles are for defensive purposes only and  their deployment is part of a plan to improve the joint South  Korea-U.S. defense capability.    South Korea still expects North Korea, recognizing the  inevitability of international inspections of its nuclear sites,  to take positive steps to receive the inspections soon, said  Chang Chae-yong, the Ministry's director-general for American  Affairs. He said Seoul also favors solution of the nuclear  issue through dialogue and is closely cooperating with the  United States and other countries concerned to achieve it.</p>

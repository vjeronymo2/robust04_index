			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: US faces up to the realities of oversupply - O&amp;Y's woes have spoiled dreams of property sector recovery Until quite recently, the US commercial property market thought it had seen the worst. Prices in some areas of the country had begun to stabilise and it was even agreed that values had probably bottomed out in the long-suffering north-east. Then came Olympia &amp; York. The placing of the company's Canary Wharf development into administration in the UK has sent a shiver through the US market. Suddenly fund managers, investors, bankers, bondholders, lawyers and property executives have had to contemplate a scenario in which the Reichmanns decide to file for the bankruptcy protection of all or part of their US property empire. Some participants in the O&amp;Y restructuring think it inevitable that the Reichmanns will eventually make a US filing. And several O&amp;Y creditors - and not only banks - are already understood to be seeking ways in which they can attach themselves to the company's US assets. One adviser to a big O&amp;Y bank creditor says that over the next six months US creditors may face a request from the company for fresh cash - needed to make repairs and improvements on some of the 23m sq ft of New York office space. The possible sale - now being negotiated - of a 34-storey property on Park Avenue may generate cash in the short term, but probably not enough. Other New York disposals could follow. What everyone agrees is that O&amp;Y filing or not, the US market has received a psychological body blow. David Shulmann, a commercial property specialist at Salomon Brothers in New York, predicts that O&amp;Y's troubles will affect capital values and the confidence of investors. 'If the Reichmanns, who are widely regarded as geniuses in real estate, can't make money, then investors will shy away from the market.' However Mr Shulmann and others in New York argue that even if O&amp;Y did not exist, the outlook for the US commercial property market would still be fairly bleak. In a study just published, the Salomon property team surimportant urban US office markets and found 540m sq ft of 2.7bn sq ft vacant, making for a national average vacancy rate of 19.8 per cent. Based on a forecast of vacant space being absorbed at the rate of about 32m sq ft a year, Salomon says the market currently faces a 12-year supply of space. Most property insiders say values are now down by 30 to 50 per cent from peak levels of five years ago. The recent purchase by Bertelsmann of Germany of a Manhattan office block is seen as an indicator of current price levels  -the German media and entertainment group paid a price equal to 50 per cent of the building's 1990 construction cost. Mr Arthur Mirante, chairman of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the biggest commercial property manager in the US, says he does not think a further drop in values is likely. However he says he has never in his career seen a national vacancy rate so high. Other property executives agree the present slump is far worse than the last big US property downturn in the mid-1970s, which was more a correction of a long-running bull market by comparison. Mr Mirante says the rate of jobs growth is a key measure of recovery prospects; he complains that redundancies at many US companies are 'keeping vacancy rates high and markets from improving'. He calls O&amp;Y's troubles 'another negative for real estate as an investment'. Mr Alvin Dworman, a banker and property investor who manages a multi-billion dollar US property portfolio, calls the oversupply of US office space 'gigantic'. He notes that markets in northern California and parts of the Midwest are holding up reasonably well, and that regions such as Texas and Colorado are already recovering from the worst. But, he says, the north-east is still 'on a slight slide'. He terms downtown Manhattan as 'really very bad'. The recovering fortunes of several big US commercial banks, meanwhile, remain intertwined with the commercial property market. Where it seemed, at the start of 1992, that the banks had made enough bad debt provisions, the latest forecasts from analysts such as Standard &amp; Poor's suggest many banks have not set aside enough reserves. Last week S&amp;P claimed the overhang of property loan losses 'will continue to be a significant drain on industry earnings over the next few years'. The consensus in the US is thus that O&amp;Y's troubles can only worsen an already gloomy outlook. The market, as Salomon Brothers puts it, 'is so deep in the hole of oversupply that it will take many years to climb out'.  ----------------------------------------- US VACANCY RATES AND OFFICE SUPPLY  ----------------------------------------- Region             Vacancy      Years of                    rate (%)      supply  ----------------------------------------- North-east          18.5          21.4 Midwest              8.9          12.4 South-east          20.5           9.4 Sthn California     21.0           8.7 Nthn California     14.2           6.9  ----------------------------------------- Source Salomon Brothers  -----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy turnover in Steel PLANS to reduce production by 20 per cent, together with a warning that worse could follow, sent shares in British Steel tumbling in heavy turnover of 23m, the second biggest of the day. The move, the latest against a bleak background for the European industry, raised doubts over British Steel's dividend prospects. Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said that while the company had little choice in slashing output, the move would equate to a loss of Pounds 100m. He estimates that Steel's full-year losses will be in the region of Pounds 250m, with more to come if the company makes further production cuts in the fourth quarter. 'This raises a question mark over the dividend. The market was looking for around 3p, but we are now forecasting a half-penny, or perhaps even less. There is no chance for income or capital appreciation for investors in the short or medium term. British Steel is dead money.' The shares closed 6 1/2 off at 56p. Lucas active Reports that Mr Tony Edwards was quitting as group managing director of Lucas unsettled the shares in busy trading. The boardroom ructions at the automotive and aerospace group - the finance director resigned earlier this year - have left analysts questioning the board's strategy and have fuelled speculation that a predator might exploit the managerial uncertainty. However, the shares recovered from early falls yesterday to close steady at 107p. Mr Edwards was seen as the architect of the so-called 'Lucas Plans' to restructure the company and his departure raised questions in the market as to whether these plans will be pursued with the same vigour. 'Lucas is the worst managed company in the market,' one analyst said bluntly. 'The board is in disarray and the chances of a bid must have been increased by these lastest developments.' Siebe, off 14 at 335p, and BTR, down 4 at 498p, were two names touted as potential bidders. Tarmac strong Tarmac, the building materials/construction group, was the heaviest traded stock in a lively building sector after the company confirmed stories in the weekend press that it had won a series of government contracts totalling Pounds 100m for motorway improvements. The programme involves widening and resurfacing part of the M6 in the north-west of England, the M25 near Heathrow airport and extending the M3 in Hampshire. Tarmac shares raced up to 88p early in the session, with the market responding not only to the hints of the new government contracts but also to the long-running but nevertheless persistent stories that a potential predator is lurking in the wings. Minorco, the international mining and metals group linked to Mr Harry Oppenheimer's international mining empire, has long been viewed as a potential buyer of Tarmac. Specialists refused to ignore the bid stories surrounding Tarmac, pointing out that profit margins on contracts such as the motorway projects are typically only in the region of 1 to 2 per cent. By the close Tarmac shares had come back to close a net 4 higher at 86p. Turnover was a heavy 9.1m. Wellcome wanted Pharmaceutical group Wellcome attracted interest ahead of results on Wednesday. The shares burst through the Pounds 10 barrier to record a more than 25 per cent rise since the Pounds 2.3bn issue at 800p a share in July. The rise in the shares has been checked recently as a result of US selling following worries that drug prices will be held down if Bill Clinton is elected president. However, the worries were partly eased by press comment yesterday. Also, securities house Hoare Govett reinforced its buy recommendation and argued that analysts will be bound to upgrade profit estimates for the forthcoming year as a result of the stronger dollar. More than half the company's profits come from the US. The shares were up 26 at one stage but suffered from some profit-taking and closed a net 18 higher at 1009p. The recent slippage in oil prices, resulting from fears of increased production, kept the oil sector under modest pressure. Shell was the odd man out in the sector, the shares edging up 4 to 533p, as recent hefty selling pressure, prompted by a County sell note, dried up. Lasmo eased 2 to 181p, reacting to 'take profits' advice in the weekend press. The rap on the knuckles from the accounting board failed to cause any real damage to British Gas which held around 268 1/2 p. HSBC was the most active of the clearing banks, with the shares shrugging off worries about strained relations between the UK and China, and closing 5 higher at 485p after turnover of 7.2m. TSB, the subject of considerable takeover speculation during the past couple of weeks, eased to 142p on good turnover of 5.3m after Smith New Court lowered its profits estimates for the bank. Activity in insurances was at a low ebb, but broker Willis Corroon picked up 6 to 220p and life assurance group London &amp; Manchester 10 to 269p. Glaxo bucked the market to add 6 at 784p. Mr James Culverwell at Hoare Govett said he was drawing clients attention to the fact that 'the stock has lagged Wellcome but, longer term, has a more exciting research and development pipeline'. Pharmaceuticals manufacturer Medeva moved up 5 to 198p ahead of an analysts' trip to Liverpool today. Tobacco to insurance conglomerate BAT Industries slipped 12 to 892p as Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken argued that the stock was over-priced. Carr conglomerates analyst Mr Martin Hawkins likes the long-term prospects but feels the dividend payment is likely to be less attractive than previously. The group is to publish third-quarter figures on November 4. ICI, which is to publish third-quarter figures on Thursday, performed well despite increasingly gloomy forecasts. Japanese house Nikko likes the stock but joint broker Hoare Govett, which shocked the market recently with sharp profit forecast cuts believes it may have to reduce estimates further. It also has the stock as a 'hold' which because of Hoare's brokership relationship with the company many interpret as a tacit 'sell' recommendation. The shares lifted 19 to 1066p. Invesco MIM, the investment management group, was the market's heaviest traded stock after Drayton Consolidated, the investment trust, sold its shareholding, via a series of agency crosses executed at 77p a share. The shares gained 8 1/2 to 77p. Turnover in Invesco totalled 49m shares. The disposal by Storehouse of its Habitat and Richard Shops, although expected, still managed to lift the shares as analysts expressed approval of the higher price obtained for Habitat than had been expected. The shares rose 3 to 164p. A suspected bear raid on Grand Metropolitan left the shares reeling, touching 394p, although they later recovered to 398p, a fall of 11 on the day. Spurious stories that the drinks giant had suffered substantial losses on foreign exchange markets were angrily denied by the company. Redland and Marley were two of the poorest performers in building materials after BZW, the investment bank, lowered profits expectation for both. BZW reduced current year forecast for Redland by Pounds 6m to Pounds 192m and next year's by Pounds 5m to Pounds 200m. For Marley, BZW moved down to Pounds 10m for this year. The broking firm cited increasingly aggressive pricing in the UK bricks and roof tiles businesses for the downgrades. Redland settled 10 lower at 342p, on 2m traded, and Marley dipped 4 to 76p with 677,000 shares changing hands. An institutional visit to Marley's operations in Germany commences today.

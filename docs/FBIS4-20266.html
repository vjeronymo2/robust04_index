			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gonzalo Lopez Alba report: "PSOE Deputies Think Solchaga </F> Should Have Already Resigned"]    [Text] PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] deputies  think that Carlos Solchaga should have already resigned from his  post as floor leader of the Socialist Group in parliament  because, as the net draws tighter around the "Rubio case," it  will be more difficult to make political capital out of his  decision. Another part of the group, however, maintains that an  early resignation would only clear the way for other  resignations to be demanded, more specifically the resignation  of [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez.    Concern and uncertainty prevail in the climate of  "temporariness" being experienced by the Socialist Group in  parliament. The members of the group are already placing bets  on the candidates best placed to succeed Carlos Solchaga. His  resignation is felt to be inevitable, especially if it is  confirmed that the Bank of Spain gave preferred treatment to  Ibercorp during Mariano Rubio's term, which would demolish the  defense that the irregularities under investigation were  committed in the area of private dealings.    The Socialist group is divided into three major blocs, which  do not necessarily correspond to the labels of "renovators" and  "Guerristas" [Alfonso Guerra supporters], and it would appear  that a majority is gradually forming that feels that it is  inevitable that their floor leader must resign.    A broad core of deputies thinks that Solchaga should have  already resigned. Their argument is that the passing time will  only contribute to letting "the situation rot away" and will  make it difficult, if not impossible, to make "political  capital" out of the resignation. These deputies feel that  Solchaga should have left his post before the debate on the  state of the nation.    Another broad group defend their view that it is necessary  to  be extremely cautious when deciding on a time to submit his  resignation since, if it is done too early, it will quickly be  forgotten and will only serve to clear the way for demands that  Felipe Gonzalez himself resign.    Lastly, a third group maintains that "since he did not  resign  when the scandal broke, then it does not matter if he resigns  today or in a month's time, because the damage has already been  done."    The government and the PSOE leadership maintain that "we  will  decide on the political responsibilities when the time is right,  not when the opposition or the media want us to." In this  regard, there is a virtually unanimous feeling that the ideal  time would be when the public prosecutor investigating the case  forwards his decision to the judge. The executive feels that  this could happen late next week. By then, Felipe Gonzalez, who  will begin an official visit to Romania and Bulgaria next Monday  [2 May], will have already returned to his office at the Moncloa  [prime minister's residence].    Socialist sources have pointed out that one of the factors  that has delayed Solchaga's resignation is that Felipe Gonzalez  has refused to be deprived of one of his closest collaborators.  Since the last elections were held, Jose Luis Corcuera and  Carlos Solchaga, two of his closest advisers, to whom he had  entrusted a fundamental part of his plan to renovate the PSOE,  have been jeopardized politically by the Roldan and Rubio cases  respectively.    In the "pools" organized by the Socialist deputies, the  candidates best placed to replace Solchaga are Joaquin Almunia,  another former minister, and the Minister of Presidency Alfredo  Perez Rubalcaba. However, appointing the former would leave a  major hole in the PSOE executive, since he is felt to be the  "strong man" of the renovators, whereas appointing the latter  would force a government reshuffle and would deprive it of  someone who is beginning to be categorized in Socialist circles  as "de facto deputy prime minister."</p>

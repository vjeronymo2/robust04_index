			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: Berlin Festival Fringe With a wheelbarrow, a crutch and a bicycle, a new work by an obscure young director leaps on to a stage made of wooden crates and in 75 minutes knocks out its sedate festival audience. The unexpected hit of the Berlin Festival, The End of the Workhouse seems to announce in Andrej Woron and his Teatr Kreatur an exciting force in European theatre. The play is a fragment of an Isaac Babel story about a group of Jews in post-revolutionary Odessa who eke out a living burying the dead in shrouds, with a single reusable coffin. When a revolutionary hero dies, the Russian boss orders him to be laid to rest in the coffin itself. Their livelihood gone, the Jews are expelled from the workhouse and starve. But for Woron the story is a starting point for theatre as a return to myth. With barely a dozen phrases spoken - 'To the cemetery]', 'In Odessa]' - he sketches it as a montage in which the rituals of mime, dance, and music crystallise an image of eastern European Jewish life in 1917 and make it a symbol for timeless themes: survival versus mass destruction, the brutality of changing one kind of world for another, the powerless individual against the state. It is history dramatised as a sort of beggar's opera for our times. To waltzes and folksongs and jazz, marches and drumbeats, strident, yearning and joyful, Woron's troupe of puppet players live out ceremonies, revolutions, circuses, and funerals. With faces exaggerated into grotesque masks, some bony and chalk-white, others smudged black, eyebrows and sockets mockingly enlarged, lips curved into jaunty triangles or open circles, they recall the expressionist visages of Dix or Beckmann. A soldier on stilts acts as a tin model, bandy-legged, his paint worn off. A drunkard boozes from an hourglass, the bottle filling up rather than emptying as it reaches his mouth; he acquires four faces and spirals round under a carousel, challenging us to tell flesh from make-up. Out of a ghostly stillness all explode into action at one stroke, clattering, stampeding, shrieking in flight; whispering hoarsely, flopping into a heap. They are automatons in voice and movement, their rhythm and tempo now speeded up to a frenzy, now wound down to slow motion. But the fearful, eager look in their eyes, directed always at us as they hardly react to each other, is almost unbearably moving, the more so as it is set off by Woron's cast of broken mechanical toys - an armless harlequin on a bicycle, a two-headed doll somersaulting in a pram - which his real actors do, yet do not, resemble. In the final scene, the end of the workhouse, the curtains fall from the stage and it breaks into dozens of little boxes which each actor chases furiously before opening the lids and pulling out an effigy of himself as a corpse: 'the dead live longer than the living'. Not since the 'happenings' of Woron's fellow Pole, the great director Tadeusz Kantor who died in 1990, have I experienced theatre at once so raw and emotional and yet so precisely disciplined, in execution and conception, into an artistically coherent whole. It is the play Berlin has been waiting for; it now deserves an international tour.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Differing views on market influences - London The debate over the market influences of rising corporate earnings and dividends as against the probability of higher interest rates has now moved into closer focus. While the factors behind the moves last week to raise rates in Italy and Sweden may have been largely domestic, there was no gainsaying the warning delivered to the UK market. Even after allowing for the widespread predictions of base rate rises already circulating among London market analysts, there has been a rush to reassess the situation. But, once the shock of the Swedish and Italian moves had passed, opinions on the UK market outlook were by no means as black as might have been expected. The widely held perception that the UK market is particularly vulnerable because the UK is at the head of the queue for a rate increase may not be correct, according to Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson Securities. He comments that the latest survey of rate forecasts suggests that the threat of higher rates will be much more of a shock to continental European markets than to London. It has been suggested that UK equities may suffer less than mainland European shares, because of the relative ratings of the various equity markets. UK markets have already enjoyed a year of rapid earnings growth, while continental European markets are still at a much earlier stage of recovery. SG Warburg touches the same point but stresses that growth in continental Europe is now accelerating and that this has brought 'significant upward revisions' in gross domestic product forecasts for Germany and France. For UK stocks, this throws even greater emphasis on those shares offering exposure to European growth, a sector picked out earlier this year by BZW. Some of these, especially the UK construction groups with interests in Germany, have already moved strongly against the trends of the UK market. However, their performance has in part reflected optimism for one last easing in Bundesbank rates, and last week's interest rate developments may restrain them for a while. Of the European-influenced builders, Redland, with 65 per cent of operating profits taken from mainland Europe, outperformed the market by 7.8 per cent over the past three months but its lead all but vanished last month. RMC, 68 per cent influenced by continent Europe, has followed a similar pattern but retains a 16.9 per cent outperformance over the 12 months. Top of Warburg's list is Waste Management International, with 75 per cent of operating profits from continental Europe. On this basis, the share has been overlooked, lagging the market by 6.7 per cent over one month and 6.2 per cent over 12 months.</p>

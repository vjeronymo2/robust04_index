			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia could double its exports to the Indian  market to around $2 billion by the end of the decade if local  business attitudes are changed, according to a major Federal  Government review.    But the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's East Asia  Analytical Unit warns that Australia's current market share in  India will drop "unless Australia increases its efforts in  India".    At a preview of India's Economy at the Midnight Hour:  Australia's India Strategy, the unit's director, Dr  Meredith Borthwick, said the private sector will have to drop  its outdated and largely negative image of the subcontinent.    Dr Borthwick acknowledged that India was a difficult market  but "it will repay the perseverence required".    The new report -- to be launched by the Minister for Trade,  Senator McMullan in Melbourne today -- says the Indian business  environment is not well regarded, even by Australian companies  which have been successful there.    "This negative image must be redressed. Although some  difficulties remain, old stereotypes no longer reflect the  realities of the Indian market. India is changing, and our  competitors have been quick to realise this," the report says.    "More and more, India is being hailed as the `new tiger'  [with annual growth rates of around 6 percent] and its economic  prospects are being compared favourably to the other giant in  the region, China"    The report chronicles the transformation of India's  political  and economic climate over the past three years. Key changes  include big reductions in industrial tariffs, the easing of  foreign investment rules, the abolition of licensing  requirements for industrial ventures, tax cuts and increased  capital market flexibility. The report says the Indian reform  process has passed the point of no return.    "Three years of courageous, bold and rapid liberalisation  have sufficiently entrenched deregulation trends in both the  popular middle-class thinking and among most economic actors and  opinion leaders."    Australia last year enjoyed a trade surplus with India of  $513 million with Australian exports of $920 million against  imports from India of $407 million. The report concludes that  "Australia could double its annual exports to the Indian market  by the year 2000" but warns that "opportunistic, ill-researched  approaches bear high risks."</p>

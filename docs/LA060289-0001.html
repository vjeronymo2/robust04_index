			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INJUNCTION RESTRAINS ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Abby Soven has issued a preliminary injunction  prohibiting harassment of UCLA faculty members at their homes and other  disruptive activities by Last Chance for Animals, a group opposed to the use of  animals in scientific research.  </P> <P> The injunction specifies that Last Chance for Animals and six of its leaders  may not threaten, intimidate, harass or annoy faculty at their homes, break  into or block facilities at the Westwood campus or interfere with or obstruct  the teaching, research or other functions of the campus. The research in  question involves cats.  </P> <P> UCLA spokesman Richard Elbaum said the group has broken into campus  laboratories where research involving the cats is done and has harassed faculty  members who are conducting research using animals.  </P> <P> Christopher Rose, president of Last Chance for Animals, who was named in the  injunction, said the ruling was "a direct infringement of our constitutional  rights" that "just goes to show the power of these institutions."  </P> <P> "They can dictate their own law," he said. "But in no way will this deter us.  We will prevail."  </P> <P> Rose acknowledged that his group had demonstrated at the homes of two UCLA  health-sciences faculty members but denied that the protesters acted  inappropriately.  </P></p>

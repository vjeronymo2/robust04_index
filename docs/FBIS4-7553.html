			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, March 31 (CTK) -- Most Czechs support the  middle ground in politics or are right of center; only two  percent support the extreme left wing and five percent the  extreme right, according to the results of a recent poll  conducted by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (IVVM).    Respondents were asked to define their position on the  political spectrum with numbers from 1, signifying extreme left  wing, to seven, the extreme right. Twenty-nine percent described  themselves as centrist, 38 percent right of center and 17  percent left of center. Nine percent had no opinion.    A higher number of those identifying themselves as right of  center are in the 30-44 age group or are entrepreneurs, while  the position finds less support among people over 60 and  workers. IVVM polled 1,559 people over the age of fifteen.</p>

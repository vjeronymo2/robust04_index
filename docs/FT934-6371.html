			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Switching channels From the government which brought the nation the farcical ITV franchise auctions comes another blockbuster of legislative muddle. For the second time in as many years, the government is proposing to tamper with the industry's structure, turning the quoted television sector into a speculator's playground. The proposed relaxation of the franchise rules has already resulted in stock market mayhem as investors anticipate a rash of takeovers reducing the 14 ITV companies to just eight. A failure of bids to materialise will produce some nasty crashes. However, it would be surprising if Granada did not now tilt at LWT. It is also a racing certainty that Carlton will bid for Central, although the OFT may worry about its combined share of ITV advertising revenue. Both these targets could, of course, make bids themselves to try to evade takeover. The hypothetical bidding scenarios which could result are mind-boggling. The change in the rules will throw up unmissable opportunities to grab a bigger slice of the ITV network. It could still be tricky to make the takeover sums work. Television companies are relatively transparent and bidders will have a good idea of their target's current worth. But the ITC's insistence on regional programming will prevent the wholesale rationalisation of costs. Moreover, ITV companies will require rights issues to fund acquisitions. Yet they will have to raise money in ignorance of the future shape of the industry and with the fate of the BBC and the laws governing cross-ownership of the media still hanging in the balance.</p>

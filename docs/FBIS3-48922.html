The river station  border crossing alone issued 70 entry visas and 8,640 transit  visas for vessels sailing the Danube. Romanian nationals most  frequently pass the border into Bulgaria (over 690,000).  Macedonians and ethnic Albanians rank immediately after with  320,000, said the regional directorate of the interior chief  Nikolay Dechev. The authorities of these border crossings  barred 503 foreigners from entering Bulgaria. A total of 17,620  Deutsche Marks and $1,250 were collected from fines paid by 46  foreigners upon their exit from this country on account of  expired visas. Forty trespassers were caught on Bulgaria's  western border.    Over 2-kilometer lines of vehicles are waiting on the Serb  side to enter Bulgaria by way of the Bregovo and Vrushka Chuka  border crossings. Over 7,000 Serb nationals pass daily via the  border crossings in both directions. Most of them go to Kulata,  Vidin and Bregovo, which are situated near the border, to do  their shopping for the holidays. The information that Serb  citizens will have to pay taxes -- 10 Deutsche Marks per person  and 50 to 100 per vehicle -- upon exit from Serbia brought about  a busier passenger traffic. The introduction of exit taxes for  Serb citizens is unprecedented in the international practice,  customs officers say.    The number of people passing through the two Bulgarian  border  crossing doubled after the Serb authorities informed about the  envisaged taxes, BTA learned from the customs officers on duty.</p>

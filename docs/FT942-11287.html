			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Property: An appetising brew - Investors are increasingly heading for the pub. Vanessa Houlder explains why Investors scouring the commercial property market in search of value are beginning to turn their attention to an unconventional target: pubs. Pubs are 'one of the last untapped property investment resources', according to property advisers Erdman Lewis. The recent changes in the UK brewing industry - prompted by the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission report designed to make the industry more competitive - has potentially opened up a new class of property investment, with a total value equivalent to 8 per cent of the total property market. Institutions and property companies have, so far, been tentative in their approach to the pub market. But the remarkable performance of the property investment market over the past year is encouraging investors to be more adventurous in their search for bargains. Pubs share many of the characteristics of retail property, but yields (ratio of income to capital) are markedly higher. 'More and more people are looking at pubs as a form of property investment in order to get more attractive yields,' says Mr Gareth Jones of Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith, property advisers. The recent sale at an auction of a pub in Whitechapel, east London, (currently let to Shepherd Neame) for about Pounds 500,000, on a yield of 9.5 per cent, is a good example. Relatively few other deals have yet been struck, though some investors are actively considering investing in the market. Erdman Lewis estimates that Pounds 150m has been earmarked by institutional funds, property companies and family trusts to spend on pub property. This nascent interest in the pub property market is the result of the MMC-induced shake-up in the industry. In a market traditionally dominated by the brewers, the MMC limitations placed on brewers' pub ownership has created new opportunities for other investors to enter the market. In broad terms, the impetus for the development of an investment market in pubs is likely to emerge from the search by pub owners for increasingly creative ways to finance their pub estates. Opportunities for investors could also arise with the emergence of licensed retailers such as J D Wetherspoon, Regent Inns and Grosvenor Inns. According to Erdman Lewis, property investors are prepared to regard this type of company as acceptable tenants. The market has been slower to take off than some analysts expected. Brewers have so far shown little appetite for striking sale and leaseback deals while finance is available from more conventional sources. They may also be holding back while there is continuing uncertainty over the structure of the pub industry until the European Commission reviews in 1997 the competition exemptions that enable British breweries to operate the tied house system. But an equally important brake on the market is investors' reticence. This reluctance is not entirely the consequence of unfamiliarity with the sector. In a survey of investors that own more than Pounds 3bn of direct property holdings, Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith found that 40 per cent already held pubs as investments in their property portfolio, usually as a result of a larger property holding, which in many cases was historic. One of the most serious obstacles blocking direct institutional investment in property is a difference of approach between investors and tenants concerning the method of rent calculation. Traditionally, pub operators have based their assessment of rents on the potential trade that could be generated from a pub. This basis of assessing rents deters investors accustomed to calculating rent on the basis of total floor area. When Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith surveyed investors it found that rent calculation methods topped the list of concerns. 'Problems with rental calculation are evidently preventing investments in public houses,' it concluded. The poor quality of information about rental and capital values is another inhibiting factor holding back potential pub investors. In the Conrad Ritblat Sinclair Goldsmith survey, nearly all investors said this factor has resulted in poor market awareness. 'In any event, an index demonstrating rental and capital growth is a prerequisite to any significant investment market being created,' it said. The low value of the average pub deal and the heavy toll on management time and effort is another disincentive. Institutions frequently require portfolios of between eight and 50 pubs or big city centre sites, to make it worth their while in investment terms. Potential investors are also concerned about the perceived oversupply of pubs. The brewing industry expects the closure of a further 10,000 pubs in the next few years from a total of about 60,000 at present. The concern over a possible flood of pub sales over the next few years is reflected in the higher values commanded by those pubs which could potentially be put to alternative use. An urban pub, with a strong potential for alternative use, will command much higher prices than a rural pub. The dilemma facing potential investors is that some obstacles to the development of a pub investment market, such as the lack of a rental index and the method of rental calculation, are unlikely to be changed in the early stages of the market's development. Investing in pub property may have attractions, but at present it is strictly for pioneers.</p>

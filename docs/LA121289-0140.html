And we'll see where we go, but  we had this one refinancing. I am now told that that might not be enough."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said that Bush had based his remark on conversations he had had, but  has "no plans to take any action."  </P> <P> The press spokesman declined to identify with whom Bush had talked about the  thrift industry and where he received the pessimistic report.  </P></p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Renewed interest in index-linked gilts - International After underperforming conventional UK government bonds in the recent sell-off, index-linked gilts could outperform the rest of the market in coming months, some analysts say. While UK inflation forecasts vary, the uncertain inflation outlook may fuel interest in the index-linked sector. Meanwhile, other countries are warming to index-linked bonds, with Sweden planning to kick off its index-linked sector with an issue of 20-year zero-coupon bonds in April. Index-linked gilts were created to offer investors a hedge against inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index. Interest payments and the amount due at maturity are adjusted to reflect changes in the RPI. If retail prices rise, an index-linked gilt provides a nominal gain from purchasing the stock at issue and holding it to maturity. If retail prices fall, the expected redemption value of an index-linked stock also declines, but retains its value in real terms. In the UK there are currently 15 index-linked stocks in issue, with an outstanding nominal value of around Pounds 21.5bn - about 11 per cent of the total gilt market. Since the beginning of the year, conventional gilts have posted a total return of minus 3.7 per cent, compared with a loss of 4.5 per cent in the index-linked sector (to Thursday's close), says Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura Research Institute. The recent sell-off in gilts was largely sparked by external factors: a rise in US yields following the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening, frustration at the slow pace of Bundesbank easing, and heavy bond sales by highly leveraged speculators. The resulting rise in conventional yields dragged index-linked yields higher. Indeed, index-linked fared worse than conventional gilts because their lower yield base and longer duration means their price is more sensitive and will move more sharply on identical shifts in yield. According to Mr Dillow, index-linked yields are determined not by 'real economy' factors, but by conventional bond yields minus inflation expectations, where conventional yields are determined principally by short-term rates and overseas yields, and where inflation expectations include an allowance for inflationary risk. 'Index-linked yields have risen because conventional yields have risen by more than inflation expectations,' he says. This suggests that index-linked gilts can outperform conventionals in the next few months, mainly because falling overseas yields may push UK yields lower, he says. In the US this would be a stabilisation in yields after the recent sell-off. In Germany, the case for lower yields is stronger, with the Bundesbank aggressively cutting short-term rates as inflation and M3 money supply growth weaken, he says. Moreover, the gap between index-linked and conventional yields could widen as index-linked gilts benefit from rising UK inflationary expectations. For example, the yield gap between the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 and the 2 1/2 per cent index-linked due 2009 has widened to 4.11 per cent on Friday, from 3.60 per cent on December 31 Meanwhile, Sweden is setting up its own index-linked market. It plans to raise up to SKr10bn in an auction of 20-year zero-coupon bonds in the week of April 18, says Mr Staffan Crona, director-general at the Swedish National Debt Office. Sweden is the first country to issue zero-coupon index-linked bonds, which Mr Crona says offer better inflation protection and are easier to price. 'We hope to attract institutional investors with a long-term view, such as life insurers and the national Swedish pension fund. They are very keen on having investments that offer real interest rates over a long period, as they often have to make payments to their clients in 20 or 30 years' time,' he said, adding 'some of them have already shown great interest'. If the results of the first issue are satisfactory, 'we will probably continue issuing index-linked bonds to the institutional market, and may also issue bonds with smaller denominations to attract retail investors', he says. The first bond will probably be issued in denominations of SKr100,000 or SKr1m. Liquidity in the index-linked sector will be limited at first, Mr Crona says. 'I don't think the market will be as liquid as the big benchmark loans in the Swedish government bond market, but it is our ambition to a create liquid market for index-linked bonds as well.'</p>

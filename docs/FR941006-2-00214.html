			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Principle of Minimum Cash on Hand. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Recipient organizations should request funds based upon immediate disbursement requirements. Grantees should time their requests to ensure that cash on hand is the minimum needed for disbursements to be made immediately or within a few days. Idle funds in the hands of subgrantees will impair the goals of good cash management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Financial Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to obtain financial information concerning the use of funds, the Institute requires that grantees/subgrantees of these funds submit timely reports for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two copies of the Financial Status Report are required from all grantees, other than recipients of scholarships under section II.B.2.b.v., for each active quarter on a calendar-quarter basis. This report is due within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter. It is designed to provide financial informa-tion relating to Institute funds, State and local matching shares, and any other fund sources included in the approved project budget. The report contains information on obligations as well as outlays. A copy of the Financial Status Report, along with instructions for its preparation, will be included in the official Institute Award package. In circumstances where an organization requests substantial payments for a project prior to the completion of a given quarter, the Institute may request a brief summary of the amount requested, by object class, in support of the Request for Advance or Reimbursement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees receiving a continuation or on-going support grant should provide financial information and number their quarterly Financial Status Reports on a project rather than a grant basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Grantees receiving a package grant must submit a quarterly financial report summarizing the financial activity for the entire package and separate reports for each project within the package. On the separate reports for the component projects, the alphabetic project identifier (A, B, C, etc.) must be appended to the grant number in Block 5 of the Financial Status Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation  (PLO) are seeking to coordinate their positions on negotiations  with Israel on the fate of Palestinian refugees and displaced  persons and then to bring in Egypt before actually opening  quartiparite talks on the issue, officials said Friday [18  February].    The decision to hold prior coordination among the Arab sides  to a four-party (Palestinian-Jordanian-Egyptian-Israeli)  committee, which is proposed in the Sept. 13 autonomy agreement  between Israel and the PLO, was taken during last week's  Jordan-PLO meetings, the officials said.    A sub-committee on refugees and displaced persons met on the  sidelines of meetings of the higher Jordan-PLO Joint Committee  attended by Deputy Prime Minister Sa'id al-Tall and PLO foreign  affairs chief Faruq Qaddumi.    Minister of State 'Adil Irshayd and PLO Executive Committee  member Samir Ghawshah (Popular Struggle Front) chaired the  sub-committee meetings, which submitted its recommendations to  the higher committee, the official said.    The Jordanian stand during the meeting was that prior  coordination was a must among the Arab parties concerned before  launching the proposed four-party committee and this was  accepted by the PLO side, they said.    Jordan has been refusing to entertain the idea of the  four-party committee, which was sprung as a surprise to the  Kingdom along with the secret autonomy accord negotiated by  Israel and the PLO.    Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said: "We believe in  the conceptual approach to the issue; coordination between  ourselves (Jordan and the PLO) first and then with Egypt before  proceeding further."    Dr. al-'Anani said no date had been set for the first  meeting  of the proposed four-party committee. Reports from Cairo and  Tunis said it could take place in April.    But Dr. al-'Anani indicated that the meeting would not take  place until Jordan is satisfied that the Kingdom, the PLO and  Egypt have coordinated their positions and are able to present a  common stand to present in this context.    The Jordan-PLO coordination is expected to be consolidated  during a meeting next week of the joint sub-committee before the  two sides approach Egypt, said Omar Khatib, the deputy chief of  mission at the Palestinian embassy here.    "The decision of the sub-committee was clear. Any  negotiations with Israel over the fate of Palestinian refugees  and displaced persons should be based on related U.N.  resolutions regardless of any other considerations," Mr. Khatib  told the JORDAN TIMES.    U.N. Resolution 194 upholds the right of the Palestinian  refugees of 1948 to return home or receive compensation.  Resolutions issued since then uphold the same principle and  call for an equitable solution to the problem of refugees.    Mr. Khatib said Jordan and the PLO were awaiting the outcome  of the ongoing Israel-PLO negotiations in the Egyptian Red Sea  resort of Taba before formulating further steps. He indicated  that the Taba talks could produce a clear Israeli stand on how  the Jewish state intended to handle the issue of displaced  Palestinians.    "We have to have a very clear perception of our own  positions  and options before we sit down with Israel (in the four-party  committee); that is what Jordan and the PLO are trying to  acheive," said Mr. Khatib.    During last week's talks, Jordan agreed to conduct a census  of displaced Palestinians living in the Kingdom for  documentation purposes and eventually to find out how many of  them would like to return to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    On Feb. 1, Egypt launched a similar survey of Palestinians  from Gaza living in Arab countries after starting a census in  its own teritory. It plans to close the enumeration on April 15.    Response to the Egyptian census in Jordan has been very  slow,  diplomatic sources said.    Palestinian "refugees" are classified as those who fled or  were forced to flee their homes in Palestine when the state of  Israel was created in 1948. Many of them ended up in refugee  camps in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank only to be turned out  again and forced across the Jordan River in the 1967 war.    They were joined by many natives of the West Bank and Gaza  Strip in the flight; and these are classified as "displaced  persons"-- meaning that they were displaced from their homes,  not refugee camps, in the occupied territories.    According to PLO statistics, the number of Palestinians  "displaced" from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip during the  1967 war and their dependents now stands at 875,000.    "The majority of them are living in Jordan, and the rest are  in Egypt," said Mr. Khatib. "Very few of them are in Syria or  elswhere."    The Sep. 13 autonomy accord puts off any Israel-PLO  discussion of the "refugees" until the "final status  negotiations slated to be in in the third year of Palestinian  self-rule in the occupied territories.    But the issue of refugees and displaced persons is a  prominent item on the agenda signed on Sept. 14 for peace  negotiations between Jordan and Israel, thus making the Kingdom  the only Arab party dealing with the subject until the final  status negotiations.    Jordanian officials say it was a significant achievement for  Jordan that it managed to include the issue as a topic for  bilateral negotiations. They say that Jordan's approach to the  issue with Israel is on a state-to-state level with no prejudice  of the right of the refugees to return home or receive  compensation.    Jordan is demanding compensation for having hosted  Palestinian refugees on its soil. It points out that the  refugee problem was a result of the creation of the state of  Israel and as such Israel has a direct responsibility to address  its consequences.    Israel has ruled out the return of any massive number of  Palestinians, but has agreed to consider allowing an unspecified  but limited number to return, and both Jordnaian and PLO  officials say they expect the issue to be one of the most thorny  in negotiations.</p>

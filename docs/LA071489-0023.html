			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH IN EUROPE;  </P> <P> ECONOMIC SUMMIT LIKELY TO FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> It is billed as the 15th annual economic summit of the leaders of the seven  largest industrial democracies, but this year's session, on Saturday and  Sunday, is likely to focus more on environmental issues than the economy.  </P> <P> Although there are plenty of international economic problems for the leaders to  grapple with, President Bush and the leaders of the six other nations lack both  the money and the political will to do much about them. So for the record, they  are saying the global economy is doing well and does not need any tinkering.  </P> <P> "The truth of the matter is that economic conditions around the world are very,  very good, taking the broad view over time," U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  F. Brady asserted last week. "You don't want to change the throttle settings  right now."  </P> <P> Instead, this will be the Year of the Environment -- or, at least the year of  talking about environmental issues -- according to the advance billing that  officials of the seven participating countries have provided over the last few  weeks.  </P> <P> William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told  reporters last week that "there is even something of a race . . . by some of  the economic summit participants to be . . . the greenest of all."  </P> <P> An advance draft of the communique that the leaders are expected to issue at  the summit's end Sunday declares that "decisive action is urgently needed to  understand and protect the Earth's ecological balance."  </P> <P> With Bush eager to be seen as the "environmental President," U.S. officials say  they want the Paris summit to "lay the groundwork" for further action at next  year's economic summit, which will be held in the United States.  </P> <P> "It is time that a summit address our natural heritage, and let Paris then be  known as the summit which accepted the environmental challenge," Bush said in a  news conference before he left Washington for Poland and Hungary late last  week.  </P> <P> "This is basically an agenda-setting summit," said Robert D. Hormats, a former  State Department economic strategist and now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs  International, a New York investment banking house.  </P> <P> </P> <P> France's Third  </P> <P> The summit rotates every year, with each country -- the United States, Japan,  West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- taking its turn as host. The  current session will be the third in France, and it is timed to coincide with  today's celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.  </P> <P> As a result, Paris is under a double strain: the tight security imposed to help  protect the seven heads of government, which has closed off much of the center  of the city, and today's anniversary gala, which is attracting throngs.  </P> <P> The summit sessions will be held at the top of a stark, arch-shaped modern  building called the Arche de la Defense, a pet project of President Francois  Mitterrand, situated about two miles northwest of the Arc de Triomphe. Still  not finished, it was filled with workers late Wednesday.  </P> <P> The conference room itself, on the 35th floor, contains the customary oversized  round granite-and-wood table built to accommodate the seven heads of  government, their foreign ministers and their finance ministers, the only  persons allowed inside the closed-door sessions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Top Issues  </P> <P> In this setting, the summit leaders will discuss a range of environmental  issues:  </P> <P>  -- Global warming. Leaders of all seven summit countries are under new  pressure from their constituents to take steps to reduce emissions of carbon  dioxide, which scientists now blame for the so-called greenhouse effect, the  gradual warming of the atmosphere.  </P> <P>  -- Third World deforestation. The industrial countries worry that the  disappearance of the rain forests is depriving the global environment of  oxygen-producing trees and increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide  around the globe.  </P> <P>  -- The ozone layer. The seven leaders will seek to reinforce an accord reached  at a Montreal conference in 1987 to help stem the depletion of the ozone layer  in the stratosphere, which is being eaten away by chlorofluorocarbons, such as  those that are used in spray cans.  </P> <P>  -- International problems. The leaders will be groping for ways to heighten  international cooperation in dealing with pollution problems such as ocean  dumping that transcend national boundaries. In the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil  spill in Alaska, they also may reinvigorate earlier efforts to improve  technology.  </P> <P> How far the seven heads of government will go, however, remains uncertain.  </P> <P> Several European countries, notably West Germany and France, have proposed the  creation of a new international organization that would be empowered to require  countries to adopt specific regulations designed to help blunt the global  warming trend, mainly by limiting the use of fossil fuels.  </P> <P> Last month, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sent a letter to President Bush  calling for a worldwide convention to discuss long-term climatic trends,  leading to "internationally binding obligations for limiting carbon dioxide  emissions."  </P> <P> But officials concede that the summit most likely will not produce any sweeping  new agreements to regulate fuel consumption or emissions. Both the United  States and Britain are adamantly opposed to creating any new international  regulatory agency and will not participate in one.  </P> <P> Instead, the seven leaders are likely to call mainly for stepped-up monitoring  of the situation and, possibly, for a new international conference later this  year to discuss proposals to eliminate chlorofluorocarbons by the end of the  century. Bush grudgingly endorsed that plan earlier this year.  </P> <P> For all the emphasis on the environment, the leaders will not ignore economic  issues entirely. They are expected to discuss topics such as the continuing  global trade imbalances; the Third World debt situation; the threat of renewed  inflation; the new, more aggressive U.S. trade policy; international aid for  Poland and Hungary; a more liberal restructuring of Poland's debt, and a  coordinating mechanism to channel the aid to the two Eastern European  countries.  </P> <P> Although few decisions are expected, the summit is unlikely to be free of  friction on economic issues. The United States is expected to lock horns with  Europe and Japan over how much more the industrial nations should do to reduce  the current global trade imbalances -- America's trade deficit and the others'  corresponding surpluses.  </P> <P> Washington wants its two major trading partners to bolster demand at home so  that their consumers and businesses will buy more U.S. exports.  </P> <P> But the others are reluctant to do so for fear of aggravating inflation, which  is already accelerating at home. They urge the United States to trim back its  federal budget deficit, which would leave more of the nation's savings  available to finance the business investment that is needed to boost production  capacity and spur productivity.  </P> <P> Bush also may run into some embarrassment over the Treasury Department's new  Third World debt strategy, which has yet to show any concrete results after 3  1/2 months in operation. The scheme has been dubbed the Brady plan after the  U.S. treasury secretary, who is its author.  </P> <P> The Treasury had hoped to be able to tout a debt-reduction accord between  Mexico and commercial banks as a symbol of the Brady plan's success, but  despite months of negotiations the two sides still are only edging toward an  agreement in principle. (On Thursday, the United States said it is prepared to  provide Mexico with a temporary "bridge" loan after talks are completed. Story  in Business, Page 1.)  </P> <P> Mitterrand, never shy about trying to upstage the United States, invited  leaders of about 30 Third World countries to an eve-of-summit dinner Thursday  to discuss the debt situation, with the aim of calling for a world conference  on the debt issue later this year.  </P> <P> Although Mitterrand is not expected to succeed, the summit's endorsement of the  Brady debt-reduction plan is considered likely to be tepid. Many critics fear  that the strategy will not be able to provide enough relief to ease economic  and political tensions in Latin America.  </P> <P> And despite the roller-coaster ups and downs of the dollar so far this year,  the seven are unlikely to do anything to tighten the international  exchange-rate system. Although France has been pushing for stricter limits on  currency movements, the United States and others oppose any such move.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Douglas Jehl in Washington contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE OTHER KEY PLAYERS  </P> <P> Third World debt and environmental issues will probably top the agenda as  President Bush meets with leaders of the six other major industrialized nations  and the leader of the European Community.  </P> <P> EUROPEAN COMMUNITY  </P> <P> Jacques Delors  </P> <P> President of Commission of 12-nation EC since 1984.

Not surprisingly, Iran is included in the  list, and according to U.S. sources, will not be eligible for  receiving "U.S. aid" or U.S. support in obtaining loans from the  World Bank.    Iran is using its own resources to fight drug producers and  smugglers, and the effort is costing the Islamic Republic  heavily, both in monetary and in human terms. Dozens of Iranian  security forces members are killed or injured by drug smugglers  every week, and the country is overstretching its financial  resources in trying to cut the flow of drugs through its  territories. This is no easy task since the border between Iran  and Afghanistan, where most of the contraband is cultivated and  transported to the U.S. and the European markets, stretches for  hundreds of miles, and due to its remoteness, is extremely  difficult to control.    Despite U.S. antagonism and Iran's own financial and  technological limitations, the Islamic Republic continues to do  its best to combat drug smuggling through its territory. Iran's  Interior, Minister Mohamad Besharati, today announced the  completion of a 30 Kilometer trench along Iran's eastern border  where most of the illegal drugs enter Iranian territory.    The most important aspect of this issue is the fact that  according to Western beliefs regarding the free market principle  of supply and demand, supply will dwindle and vanish if demand  is eliminated.    The voracious appetite of Americans for all kinds of drugs  is  a well known fact. Some U.S. administrations have made  superficial attempts to curtail the use of drugs, but all  government efforts have been cosmetic and were initiated as  political ploys for attracting votes just before elections were  due to be held. The most ludicrous and useless of these  anti-drug campaigns was launched by the former U.S. first lady,  Nancy Reagan, who coined the phrase "Just say no" in the naive  belief that school children will be able to overcome peer  pressure just by uttering a few meaningless words.    Illegal drug cultivation will continue so long as the United  States and Europe provide such lucrative markets for its  distribution, and the successful distribution of contraband  drugs are only possible through the collusion and cooperation of  the governments of drug consuming nations with drug  distributors. Under these circumstances, it is hard to believe  the sincerity and conviction of U.S. and other governments of  drug consuming nations regarding their antidrug projects.    The annual revenue generated by the illegal drug trade in  the  West amounts to tens of billions of dollars and it seems  implausible that the U.S. and other drug-using nations will  allow this trade to continue without getting a share of its  income. Also, the social fabric of these societies are  conducive to the propagation of the drug culture.    The United States with its enormous wealth and its  specialized anti-drug task forces is unable to stem the flow of  drugs into its territories, and has repeatedly stated that it  cannot control its borders effectively. If this statement is to  be believed, then how can the same country expect others who  lack its sophisticated technology and monetary resources to  succeed in this campaign without financial and material help  from world organizations charged with eradicating this  dehumanizing trade.    It seems that the U.S. is, as usual, using any old excuse to  single out the countries that are opposed to its policies for  chastisement. On the one hand the United States insists that  drugs must be eradicated and drug distributors must be punished.  But on the other hand, through several international  organizations which it finances, the U.S. condemns countries  such as the Islamic Republic for executing convicted drug lords  in accordance with the law of the land.    Before the United States passes judgment on other nations  and  societies, it will do well to take a look at its own society and  start to implement social changes that will help its people find  contentment and satisfaction in the everyday activities of the  nucleus family rather than by using drugs.</p>

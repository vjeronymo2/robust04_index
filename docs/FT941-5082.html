			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Goldman Sachs profit estimated at Dollars 2.7bn Goldman Sachs, the private US investment bank, earned a pre-tax profit of Dollars 2.7bn last year, according to an industry newsletter. The firm is believed to have earned Dollars 1.5bn before taxes in 1992. The firm would not officially comment on the figures, which were obtained by Investment Dealers' Digest from a prospectus for a recent Goldman Eurobond offering, but sources close to the firm say they are accurate. The data confirms that Goldman is the most profitable firm on Wall Street, and its 150 partners, who share a good deal of the profits, are the most highly rewarded professionals in the business. However, last year may prove to have been the peak in the earnings cycle for both Goldman and Wall Street. Since US short-term interest rates were increased by the Federal Reserve on February 4, US and European financial markets have been in turmoil, exposing some of the biggest players in the capital markets to substantial trading losses. Goldman is rumoured to have incurred large short-term losses, although the firm insists its operations are profitable for the year. Over the longer term, rising interest rates will make it harder for investment banks to match the extraordinary profits earned between 1990 and 1993, when US interest rates declined to record lows. According to the IDD figures, Goldman's revenues in 1993 totalled Dollars 13.2bn, up from Dollars 9bn the year before. That makes the firm's profit margin 20.1 per cent, which analysts say is the best among large Wall Street investment banks. The record-breaking year lifted Goldman's capital to Dollars 5bn from Dollars 3.7bn.</p>

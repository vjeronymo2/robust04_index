			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> BAT to Shut U.S. Office: Batus, London-based BAT Industries' U.S. holding  company, based in Louisville, Ky., will be phased out this year, the company  said. BAT's Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco unit in Louisville and Farmers Group  insurance subsidiary in Los Angeles will then operate as independent entities  reporting directly to London. The move is part of BAT's sale of its paper and  retailing businesses to focus on tobacco and financial services.  </P></p>

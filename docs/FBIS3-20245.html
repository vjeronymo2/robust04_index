			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Milan Canale 5 Television Network in  Italian at 2251 GMT on 28 March 94 carries a report from the  Rome headquarters of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS,  where leader Achille Occhetto answers journalists' questions on  the results of exit polls and computer projections:    Occhetto says:    "It is unsatisfactory for the country. There is no doubt  that the Right has won, but it will not be capable of presenting  a government to the country."    He continues:    "Regarding the Progressive Alliance, it is a team, a team  that has played for the first time. It has gained valuable  experience. I think it should remain on the scene because as  other European experience has shown, the Right does not know how  to resolve society's basic problems. This alliance," he says,  "will be able to be an extremely clear and decisive opposition  in constitutional terms."    He adds: "The electoral law, obviously, has not clarified  anything. Right from the beginning we said that it was  compromise between the old and new system. Had there been an  electoral system with two rounds the people would have been able  to choose between each round whether to let the Right win,  something which was not clear with this system."    He adds: "The Left maintains the energy that it has had  recently. I've already said it: this was an unsatisfactory  result."</p>

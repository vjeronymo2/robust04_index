			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Homeless youth, lacking a stable family environment and without social and economic supports, are at high risk of being involved in dangerous lifestyles and problematic or delinquent behaviors. More than two-thirds of homeless youth served by ACYF-funded programs report using drugs or alcohol and many participate in survival sex and prostitution to meet their basic needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Homeless youth need a support system that will assist them in making the transition to adulthood and independent living. While all adolescents are faced with adjustment issues as they approach adulthood, homeless youth experience more severe problems and are at greater risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Homeless youth have been a population eligible to receive services under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act since 1978, but the service goals for homeless youth are different from those of runaways. For example, family reunification, though desirable, is typically not feasible for homeless youth. In many instances, programs serving the homeless populations are able to provide only limited assistance to homeless youth, whose needs are more complex and longer-term than those of runaway youth.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth specifically targets services to homeless youth and affords youth service agencies an opportunity to serve homeless youth in a manner which is comprehensive and geared towards ensuring a successful transition to self-sufficiency. The TLP also improves the availability of comprehensive, integrated services for homeless youth, which reduces the risks of exploitation and danger to which these youth are exposed while living on the streets without positive economic or social supports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum requirements for project design: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As a part of addressing the evaluation criteria outlined in Part II of this announcement, each applicant must address the following items in the program narrative section of their application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Objectives and Need for Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

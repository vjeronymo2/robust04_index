General Lisandro Abadia, Armed Forces of the Philippines  chief of staff, earlier said that the military is planning to  buy up to 24 high-performance fighter interceptors and a modern  radar system. Abadia admitted that at present the country is not  capable of defending the air against any external aggression.    According to Air Force Chief Major General Nicasio  Rodriguez,  the United States and Belgium have offered their secondhand F-16  fighter jets, while France is ready to sell the country its  surplus Mirage jets. The Air Force also needs bigger  helicopters for search and rescue missions.    Regarding counterinsurgency, Abadia said that because of the  military's continued campaign, the number of New People's Army  rebels has narrowed down to only 8,000.</p>

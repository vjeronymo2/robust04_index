			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOOTER AT SKEET RANGE WOUNDS 6 SPECTATORS;  </P> <P> ACCIDENT: THE LA CRESCENTA MAN FIRED TOWARD THE GROUP WHILE TRACKING A FAULTY  TARGET.  </P> <P> Six people were injured when a gun enthusiast at a trap and skeet range in  South El Monte accidentally fired his shotgun in the wrong direction,  authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Ronald Smith, 43, of La Crescenta, who was tracking a faulty target that broke  in two as it was flung from a skeet tower, fired toward the group of spectators  Tuesday at the Pachmayr International Shooting Sports Range, Los Angeles County  sheriff's spokesmen said.  </P> <P> Smith had tracked the fragment of the clay target that flew toward the range's  parking lot. Five men and a teen-ager were about 30 yards away from Smith,  talking and watching the shooters, when they were hit by pellets from Smith's  gun, Deputy John Ashley said.  </P> <P> Ismael Hurtado, 23, of Los Angeles was taken to a nearby hospital and treated  for wounds to his face and neck. He was transfered to County-USC Medical  Center, where he underwent surgery to repair damage to his left eye, a hospital  spokeswoman said. He was in satisfactory condition Wednesday night, the  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Jesse Robles, 17, of El Monte suffered a neck wound and was taken to a local  hospital, where he refused treatment and was released against the advice of  doctors.  </P> <P> The four others who were struck by pellets were treated at the scene by  paramedics.  </P> <P> Kevin Scott, general manager of the range, said that during instruction,  shooters are cautioned against firing at broken targets.  </P> <P> Although Smith was a regular at the range, which is located in the Whittier  Narrows Recreation Area, Pachmayr officials said they could not comment on his  skills as a shooter.  </P> <P> "People who work here recognized him by face and by name," said Ron Plue, vice  president of Pachmayr Ltd. "Exactly how experienced he is, I don't know."  </P> <P> David MacDonald, 50, of Rowland Heights, who frequents the range twice a week,  said the accident surprised him.  </P> <P> "I'm always impressed by how safety-conscious the shooters and the workers are  here," said MacDonald.  </P> <P> "This isn't typical," he said, referring to the shooting, which sheriff's  investigators determined was accidental. "I can't imagine someone goofing off  here. It's just not a place to mess around."  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Money Markets: Portillo dips futures SHORT-DATED sterling interest rate futures fell back sharply yesterday after a British government minister sugg-ested that there might not be any interest rate cuts in the UK for some time, writes James Blitz. Yesterday's July data for retail sales and inflation were much as the market had expected and had little effect on sterling prices. But interest rate futures fell back and the longer dated cash rates firmed after Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, was satisfied with current interest rates. 'He is showing himself satisfied with the present level of interest rates,' Mr Portillo told a television interviewer. 'So I do not want to lead you to expect any changes whatsoever.' The comments had an immediate impact on futures dealers who, in recent weeks, have pushed the December contract up to levels that virtually price in a full percentage point off interest rates. The contract dropped 14 basis points at one stage to a day's low of 94.58, before ending at 94.62. The September contract was 8 basis points down on the day at 94.16. In the cash market, three-month money was unchanged at 5 7/8 per cent. The yield curve out to six months and one year sloped a little less steeply than it did on Tuesday, however. Six-month money closed at 5 per cent and the one-year rate at 5 17/32 per cent. The overnight cost of lending was up at 6.50 per cent because of difficulties removing a Pounds 900m shortage, which left late assistance of Pounds 285m. French franc market interest rates fell sharply yesterday as the currency continued to appreciate on the foreign exchanges. Three-month French francs were back below 8 per cent yesterday, closing at 7.75 per cent from a previous 8.33 per cent. September French franc interest rates were up 26 basis points on the day, finishing at 93.08 from a previous close of 92.82. In its weekly intervention in currency markets, the Bundes-bank drained liquidity of DM5.8bn. This was due to a lack of interest in the weekly tender, which again came at a fixed rate of 6.80 per cent. With call money yesterday at 6.74 per cent, dealers clearly borrowed more cheaply in the interbank market.</p>

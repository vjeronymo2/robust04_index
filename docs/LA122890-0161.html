			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 CARRIERS AMONG 17 SHIPS ON WAY TO GULF  </P> <P> Tearful family members lined piers in a cold breeze and drizzle today as about  16,000 sailors and Marines began their journey to the gulf to beef up Operation  Desert Shield forces.  </P> <P> The deployments of 17 ships from East Coast ports, including eight from the  huge Norfolk Naval Base, involved a rare same-day departure for two aircraft  carriers, the America and the Theodore Roosevelt.  </P> <P> Several dozen relatives and friends watched as the destroyer Caron pulled out.  </P> <P> Joseph Leyes, whose son, Louis, is an ensign aboard the Caron, said he felt a  mixture of emotions: "Sad, excited, supportive, frightened. They're going to go  out there; they're going to do a job; they're going to come back."  </P> <P> Donna Beckum, whose husband, Larry, also is a Caron crew member, said her main  concern was "just how long they're going to be gone."  </P> <P> The Roosevelt and America will join three other carriers -- the Kennedy, the  Saratoga and the Ranger -- already operating in the Middle East.  </P> <P> The deployment of such a large number of U.S. warships to one part of the world  is unprecedented since the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> Capt. Charles S. Abbot, commanding officer of the Roosevelt, said his crew was  prepared, though not eager, to leave home so soon after the holiday.  </P> <P> Still, Christmas was bittersweet for those shipping out and their families.  </P> <P> "I'm happy he was here for Christmas, but I'm upset he's leaving and not  knowing when he's coming back," said Carmen Kubala, whose husband, Dan, is an  electrician aboard the America.  </P> <P> Navy officials said the carriers will take about two weeks to get to their  destination.  </P></p>

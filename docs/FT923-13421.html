			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Civil servants to strike over proposed move to Docklands TENSIONS over government plans to move civil servants to Docklands were highlighted yesterday, as Downing Street pressed departments to look again at whether more officials can be relocated and civil service unions decided to stage a one-day strike tomorrow in protest at any move. The Downing Street initiative is understood to stem from dissatisfaction on the part of Mr John Major, the prime minister, at government departments' paltry responses to a preliminary survey of what activities they might shift to Docklands. Despite organised coach trips for staff to the site to try to reduce resistance to the move, the strike votes show that many officials remain strongly opposed to going to Docklands because of the extra cost and time they will face in travelling to work. The 2,000 civil servants in the Department of the Environment are the only officials definitely signed up to move to Docklands, though there is also strong pressure on the Department of Transport, which is carrying out a review of its office requirements, and the Department of Trade and Industry. So far, the DTI has volunteered only the Radio Communications Agency. The strike is part of a growing campaign among officials against the move away from the area round Westminster. It will coincide with a lobby of parliament tomorrow, when the issue is also expected to be raised during questions to environment ministers in the Commons. DoE union leaders are to meet Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, on Friday. At the DoE, members of the NUCPS civil service union, which represents middle-ranking staff, voted 60 per cent in favour of strike action while 62 per cent of members of the CPSA union, which represents junior officials, were in favour of striking. At the transport department, members of NUCPS voted 55 per cent in favour of strike action. The FDA and IPMS civil service unions, which represent senior and professional staff, support the Westminster lobby but are not taking part in the industrial action. Mr John Delaney, NUCPS group secretary, said: 'Although it is a one-day strike called at very short notice because parliament is adjourning for three months, we intend to campaign throughout the summer.' 'Our members are not going to Docklands, to a place where there is no infrastructure and inadequate transport. It is a political decision because they cannot persuade their friends in the private sector to take up the space.'</p>

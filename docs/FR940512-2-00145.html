			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The replacement, and subsequent EPN change, of inboard containment isolation excess flow check valves PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;72f and PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;73e with swing check valves brings the plant into conformance with the analyzed design bases. Operation and maintenance of these valves in accordance with design and Technical Specification requirements provide assurance that primary containment will be maintained for the design basis LOCA event. The EPN change is required to conform to standard nomenclature for identification of penetration isolation valves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The administrative name change for PI&hyph;EFC&hyph;X29d is made to ensure consistency between Technical Specification Table 3.6.3&hyph;1 and existing plant design documentation. Renaming this excess flow check valve provides consistency to the nomenclature of other excess flow check valves which use a dual tube method of draining condensate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The replacement and subsequent EPN change of inboard containment isolation valves PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;72f and PI&hyph;EFCX&hyph;73e brings the plant into conformance with the analyzed design bases. Maintenance and operation requirements are not modified in any manner. Adherence to the analyzed design bases will not affect the margin of safety for the design bases analysis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In preparing this request the Technical Specification Bases were reviewed for impact. No changes are necessary to address the EPN changes or the replacement of two excess flow check valves with swing check valves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this review, the Supply System has determined that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Accordingly, the Supply System has determined that this amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 30-day notice period expires. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

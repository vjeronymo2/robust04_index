			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition gives fillip to T&amp;S shares Shares in T&amp;S Stores rose 29p to 197p yesterday as the company announced its first sizeable acquisition since 1989. The tobacco retailing and convenience stores operator is paying Pounds 2.13m for the Gibbs Newsagents chain. The deal includes the repayment by T&amp;S of a Pounds 4.56m term loan. In the event that completion accounts show a net tangible asset value - after repayment of the term loan - of less than Pounds 1.5m, the consideration will be reduced. The Gibbs business comprises 74 sites in the southern counties trading as traditional newsagents. In the year to January 2 1993 the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 534,000 on turnover of Pounds 25.7m.</p>

			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> S.F. JURY SUBPOENAS LUKENBILL  </P> <P> Subpoenas have been issued to developer Gregg Lukenbill and others to appear  before a San Francisco grand jury investigating the financing of the campaign  that defeated a measure to build a new baseball stadium for the Giants.  </P> <P> San Francisco Dist. Atty.  </P> <P> Arlo Smith said "four or five" subpoenas were issued Monday at the request of  the grand jury. The investigation grew out of charges by Mayor Art Agnos  shortly before election day last November that the Sacramento developer was  trying to steal the baseball team.  </P> <P> Lukenbill, apparently surprised by the news of the subpoenas, said he had no  comment.  </P> <P> He acknowledged Friday that he helped raise funds that paid for last-minute  mail brochures that urged San Franciscans to vote against Measure P, which  would have paved the way for a replacement for Candlestick Park. The measure  was defeated by fewer than 2,000 votes, and the Giants have begun negotiations  with Santa Clara.  </P></p>

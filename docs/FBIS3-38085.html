			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Foreign  Ministry issued a statement today, saying the following:    Violence has again flared up in the territories occupied by  Israel. At dawn today an Israeli settler opened machine-gun  fire, killing and wounding dozens of people in al-Khalil  [Hebron]. As a result, the situation has sharply deteriorated  on the West Bank of the river Jordan and in the Gaza sector, and  clashes have taken place between Israelis and Palestinians,  causing more human casualties.    We decisively condemn this act of terror, carried out during  a time of prayer in the month of Ramadan, which is sacred for  Muslims. Measures must urgently be taken to prevent similar  occurrences in the future and to punish the culprits. We  express our condolences to the families of those who were killed  and injured, and to all Palestinians.    It is notable that the incident in al-Khalil has been  condemned by the leadership and the main political parties in  Israel, which, however, does not absolve the Israeli leadership  of full responsibility, nor does it remove the need to act in  such a way that will prevent violence from increasing.    Such acts are certainly having a negative influence on the  process of the Arab-Israeli dialogue and are damaging to  everything positive that has been achieved toward a Middle East  settlement through intense efforts. This crime has been carried  out precisely when a tangible possibility was taking shape for  arriving at an agreement between Israel and the PLO on the  introduction of self- government in Gaza and the Jericho area.  We consider it necessary to do everything possible to ensure a  productive continuation of the talks and to prevent giving the  extremists a chance to torpedo the peace process.    The Russian Foreign Ministry is closely following the  development of the events and is in contact with the interested  parties in the interest of a speedy normalization of the  situation and the creation of conditions for the further  development of the peace process in the Middle East.</p>

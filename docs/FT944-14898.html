			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Attempted rally reversed by bond weakness - Market Report Uncertainty about the US dollar continued to gnaw away at confidence in a sluggish UK equity market yesterday. Further losses in government bonds, following confirm-ation that domestic retail sales had strengthened in September, also bore down on share prices, and the FT-SE 100 Index lost a further 24.5 points to close at 3,060.8. Early trading saw a brave attempt at a rally, largely inspired by a brief uptick in stock index futures. The Footsie climbed to just above 3,092, but the flurry was quickly over and it was clear that there was no support for a challenge to the 3,100 area. The 0.5 per cent gain in UK retail sales last month was in line with some forecasts hurriedly reshaped by City analysts in the wake of Tuesday's survey from the members of the Confederation of British Industry. Members of the CBI reported that retail sales were growing at the fastest rate for nearly a year. On balance, equity market analysts did not see the retail sales growth as being a threat for an early rise in base rates, but retail and consumer issues showed little enthusiasm for the indication that retail sales may at last be responding to economic recovery. The market was restrained by the weakness in bonds, especially in Germany, and also by the lack of vitality in the US dollar even before the announcement of the US trade deficit for August. Disclosure that the US trade deficit with Japan had risen to the highest level for a year sparked further weakness in the US currency, and the blue chip dollar-earning shares in London were quick to react. There were sharp falls among the pharmaceuticals stocks, which had already been unsettled on Tuesday by SmithKline Beecham's admission that sales of its Tagamet drug had been badly hit by expiry of the US patent. Other shares regarded as closely linked to the dollar's fortunes, including RTZ and HSBC, also turned lower. But the picture was little better among the domestically orientated issues. Most of the high street retailers continued to move lower, on the paucity of buying support rather than on any increased selling pressure. These stocks are now close to the pre-Christmas period which generates the bulk of their annual profits, and confidence in near term prospects remains muted in spite of yesterday's evidence that retail sales may be picking up. Once again, the focus was on the big name stocks and the second liners were somewhat overlooked. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index retreated 11.1 to 3,521.2. Non-Footsie business made up about 60 per cent of the day's total equity turnover. Seaq-reported volume moved higher again, from 527.8m shares on Tuesday to 596m yesterday, but was still on the disappointing side of average levels. Traders continued to stress the sluggishness of the market that is believed to be making commercial life difficult for the pure brokerage houses, which depend on retail, or customer, business for their living. The London market is likely to turn its attention to domestic matters for the rest of the week. This morning brings the latest statistics on domestic money supply and on building society lending, to be followed on Friday by provisional gross domestic product numbers for the third quarter of the year. However, the stock market will continue to watch the US dollar closely, with the blue chip issues unlikely to respond to purely domestic factors at present. But many analysts continue to predict an upswing in equities before the end of the year as recovery in the domestic economy shows through in terms of corporate profits and dividends, while subdued inflationary pressures prompt a rally in global bond markets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok, May 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu remained optimistic Tuesday about North  Korea's nuclear crisis despite news that Pyongyang already  started unloading from its nuclear reactor, saying next North  Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue could open early next month.    "If the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) judges  that  the situation is not serious, even if it was improper for North  Korea to start the nuclear rod discharging process without IAEA  presence, the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks will open,"  Han told accompanying South Korean reporters after his midnight  arrival here.    "The high-level dialogue, in that case, is likely early  June,  although there is still possibility that it may open late this  month," he said as he arrived at the second stop of his  Southeast Asian tour.    North Korea had said it had to start removing the fuel rods  from its 5mw reactor in Yongbyon by itself out of technical  necessity.    Han referred to "the line" that separates whether this  removal process has gone far enough for South Korea, the United  States and the IAEA to declare an end to diplomatic negotiation  and take the matter to the U.N. Security Council.    This line, he said, remains uncrossed as long as North  Korea's activities so far at the reactor have not destroyed  chances of IAEA's random selection and safekeeping of the fuel  rods for measurements sometime later.    "The entire mood of the international community will change  if North Korea has crossed this line," Han told reporters.    "I believe that even China will react negatively if such  event occurs," said the foreign minister.    The IAEA will ultimately decide whether Pyongyang has stayed  within this boundary, he said.    The agency's inspection entered Pyongyang on Tuesday via  Beijing for a week-long check of North Korea's controversial  nuclear program.    The team will come out of North Korea mid-way through the  inspection if it finds North Korea in violation of safeguards on  the nuclear reactor, he said.    "This entire issue of fuel rod discharging is entirely  different in nature of the problem. So far, North Korea was  charged with not doing something it is supposed to do. But the  changing of the rods is about North Korea doing something it is  not supposed to do. It's that much more serious," said Han.    Asked about North Korea-U.S. Working-level contact on the  nuclear problem, he said Seoul and Washington will be able to  get a sense of where the situation stands on the fuel rods while  the IAEA is inside North Korea.    "If the IAEA report is positive, North Korea and the United  States could make contacts although they don't necessarily have  to be working-level meetings," he said.</p>

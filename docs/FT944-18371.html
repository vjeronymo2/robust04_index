			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Spanner in the Rolls-Royce engine: Peter Norman explains the arcane issue that has caused a split between the IMF and its principal shareholders Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has pulled off a remarkable feat. He has elevated the special drawing right (SDR), the IMF's own reserve asset, from almost total obscurity into the stuff of headlines. On Sunday, the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee failed to agree a modest increase to the world's currency reserves, prompting acrimony over Mr Camdessus's role in pursuing the issue. There was concern among the Group of Seven leading industrial countries that the IMF managing director had found himself at odds with his principal shareholders, including Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary. While the clash will not have any significant effect on the fortunes of the global economy, it raises questions about the future authority of the Fund and Mr Camdessus's position as its head in his remaining two years and four months of office. The issue about which so much heat has been generated is arcane, even by the standards of international monetary diplomacy. The SDR is an artificial currency unit, a composite of the dollar, D-Mark, yen, French franc and sterling which is at present worth about Dollars 1.47. SDRs were first created in the late 1960s after years of growing concern over a perceived shortage of international liquidity, but now just account for little more than 2 per cent of non-gold reserves. For some years, Mr Camdessus, backed by the developing countries, has been pushing for a general allocation of SDRs to be distributed among the IMF's 179 members. Before the current IMF meeting, he proposed a 36bn SDR allocation. This stance was backed by the developing countries, some of which put forward similar plans. Under the IMF statutes, a general allocation is permissible, provided there is a 'global need' for such reserves and provided it wins the support of 85 per cent of the IMF's members' votes in the Fund board. To demonstrate global need, Mr Camdessus pointed to an anticipated expansion of demand for non-gold reserves of all IMF member countries of about 400bn SDRs over the next five years. He said 55 per cent of all countries and 67 per cent of the former communist states 'in transition' have international reserves equivalent to less than 12 weeks of imports. Mr Camdessus's proposed allocation would meet about 9 per cent of the forecast expansion in demand for reserves. This would be modest in relation to the size of the world economy, but Mr Camdessus has pursued his case with extraordinary passion. He genuinely believes the SDR should live up to the plans of its inventors and become a central part of the international monetary system. To achieve this, he believes a boost in its reserve role from the current low level is crucial. Germany, together with the US, UK and other members of the G7, have long argued against such money creation by the IMF, declaring it to be unnecessary, potentially inflationary and creating a dangerous precedent. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, insisted that with today's large international capital markets there was no 'global need' for new reserves. However, Germany and the other big industrialised countries recognised that the 37 countries that had joined the IMF since the last issue of SDRs in 1981 were victims of an injustice. These countries, many of them former communist states, had no SDRs in their reserves. Germany was therefore prepared to back a compromise proposal put forward by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Bentsen for a special allocation of 16bn SDRs. This would benefit all IMF members, but the newcomers and certain poor developing countries in particular. However, it would necessitate a change in the IMF statutes involving parliamentary ratification in most member states, in addition to requiring an 85 per cent majority of the IMF's votes. These hurdles, the Germans felt, were high enough to dispel any idea that the IMF could become a money-creating machine. The UK-US compromise on the SDR was presented in a package together with plans to raise the annual access limits to the IMF's normal loan facilities for countries in economic difficulty. Also envisaged was a boost to the systemic transformation facility (STF), which the IMF has set up as a temporary source of support for former communist countries. UK officials always said it would be difficult to secure agreement for the package. But hopes rose on Saturday because the G7, representing about 45 per cent of the IMF's votes, gave it unanimous backing. The agreement of France was seen as especially significant and raised hopes that Mr Camdessus, a former director of the French Treasury and central bank governor, would fall into line with his compatriots. Instead, Mr Camdessus stuck with his proposal and carried the developing countries with him, with the support of Mr Manmohan Singh, the influential Indian finance minister, who headed a G9 group of developing country representatives in the Interim Committee. It was clear on Sunday that neither the UK-US nor the Camdessus proposals could command the necessary 85 per cent majorities. The proposed strengthening of the STF failed for the same reason. However, agreement was reached that the access limits to loan facilities should be raised from 68 per cent to 'at least 85 per cent of quota' or membership rights. Some poorer IMF members will be the losers from Sunday's events. British officials estimated that the UK-US plan would have boosted Russia's reserves by about Dollars 1.47bn and those of the entire former Soviet Union by Dollars 2.35bn. Low-income developing countries stood to gain Dollars 2.49bn and lower middle income countries Dollars 4.55bn. With hindsight, some G7 ministers admitted it was bad tactics to publicise their accord on the UK-US plan. This gave the impression that they were giving the IMF membership a 'take it or leave it' offer. But they also believe that Mr Camdessus made a bad mistake in thinking that he could break the unity of the G7. One participant observed that he had ignored advance warnings that the biggest IMF shareholders would not support a general allocation. By pushing his plan in the meeting, he forced them to choose between their own club and the IMF managing director: they opted for the G7. Mr Camdessus's performance is seen by G7 officials as an extraordinary lapse by a man regarded as a skilled operator and, until now, as a very able managing director of the IMF. It has also raised questions about the role of the IMF managing director. Was he right to lead the charge for the developing countries or should he have campaigned for the compromise backed by his biggest members? Should he behave like a politician or an official? After Sunday's meeting, an unrepentant Mr Camdessus insisted he had a right to promote policies of his own and vigorously back them, even if they ran counter to the ideas of the biggest IMF members. Yesterday, ministers attending the IMF meeting were involved in a damage-control exercise, cultivating a 'business as usual' air. The talk was of new discussions at the IMF's next spring meetings, perhaps even a special Interim Committee gathering on the question. But the weekend row has cast a cloud over the IMF in this its 50th anniversary year. Mr Camdessus's stand may eventually be validated by the great sweep of history, as the industrialised countries lose economic clout to the so-called developing world. But by battling with his principal shareholders, and the US in particular, the IMF managing director has thrown a spanner in the works of what has always been seen as the Rolls-Royce of the international financial institutions.</p>

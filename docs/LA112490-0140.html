			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA;  </P> <P> CURBSIDE CONTAINER TAMPERING ILLEGAL  </P> <P> The City Council has outlawed tampering with curbside recycling containers  after residents complained that scavengers have been going through trash and  taking bottles, cans and newspapers.  </P> <P> Under the new ordinance, passed unanimously this week, those caught tampering  with the trash can be liable for civil damages.  </P> <P> A state law passed in 1989 gave councils the authority to enforce such an  ordinance.  </P> <P> "Just this morning, I saw this person going through my neighbor's trash, and it  bothered me," Mayor Norman Eckenrode told the council.  </P> <P> Revenue from the recycling program is used to defray the cost of trash  collection. Since the recycling program was launched in June, 1,477 tons have  been recycled at a value of $61,168.  </P> <P> City officials said that residents had complained that scavengers who go  through their trash are violating their privacy. In addition, Placentia  Disposal has complained that scavengers' vehicles have at times blocked trash  trucks.  </P> <P> "I don't think a lot of people go through trash because they choose to," said  Councilwoman Maria Moreno. "I think it's one step away from being homeless.  Still, they could be looking for credit card receipts." TED JOHNSON  </P></p>

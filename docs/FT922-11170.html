			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Something to offer: Europe After a short burst of noises off, the French parliamentary establishment looks ready to ratify the Maastricht Treaty on European Union without a serious fight. For a moment the right-wing RPR Gaullists seemed set to throw themselves into a wild nationalist war-dance, calling on their ancient gods to confound President Francois Mitterrand's federalist schemes; but common sense has now been restored. At first Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullists, had only seen the Maastricht treaty as an archetypal weapon for attacking President Mitterrand; curiously, he seems to have overlooked the fact that a successful attack would be fatal for his own political ambitions. The defeat of the Maastricht treaty would be a serious blow to Mr Mitterrand; but it would also put paid to any prospect that he, Jacques Chirac, could be elected president of the republic. As a result, there is a tacit compromise, which will allow the treaty to go through. But it has also cleared the ground for a much more important debate, on the substantive purpose of the Maastricht treaty. President Mitterrand is selling it as the guarantor of peace and stability in western Europe; but the Socialists are now selling it as the engine of economic growth. The idea sounds banal: the Community has always been sold as the engine of economic growth. The difference is that the French Socialists are now saying that the member governments must together take active new steps to make the Community into an engine of economic growth. Ten days ago, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, told the Senate that the economic policies of the 12 'are not sufficiently co-ordinated'. He said he had written to the presidents of the Commission and the Council, asking them to take 'initiatives' to ensure that Europe become 'an accelerator of growth'. The new line was reinforced last Thursday by Mr Michel Rocard, former prime minister and virtual candidate for the Socialist party in the next presidential elections. In Le Monde, he urged support for the Maastricht treaty, very largely because he believed the Community had the means to become a zone of high growth. 'Most of the dramas and difficulties of the world come from the general slowdown of economic growth,' he said. 'We shall not beat unemployment except through significantly stronger growth. And significantly stronger growth implies the intervention of a single and coherent public authority over a large territory. 'I believe today that a true intellectual revolution is necessary to recover the use of those rules which brought us continuously strong growth (in the past), and which suppose the careful use of monetary, budgetary, customs, regulatory and above all fiscal instruments.' The new line is obviously political. The Socialists were hammered in the recent regional elections, and they desperately need a message of hope to counter the prospect of defeat in next year's legislative elections. Unemployment is the main problem; but since the commitment to European monetary union prevents an independent French economic policy, Europe must have an economic policy instead. The problem is that the Socialists' new line is in manifest conflict with the thrust of the Maastricht treaty which they have just negotiated. Every aspect of the programme for economic and monetary union (Emu) is deflationary, from the high interest rates being imposed by the Bundesbank to the compulsory cuts in national budget deficits; yet the Socialists are effectively calling for collective economic reflation. This is, in fact, the deal they thought they had bought: a hard monetary policy run by the Bundesbank, but in the context of a European economic policy run by the 12 governments. Unfortunately, the monetary and budgetary deflation is already in place; but the European economic policy does not start until 1999. If then. Economists may say a European reflation is impossible; but after their previous disasters, we need not be mesmerised by their latest certainties. Remember that this is the tribe that sold us Bretton Woods, floating rates, and fixed rates; Keynesianism, monetarism, and structural adjustment; each time with the same supercilious self-sufficiency. Some say there is no remedy apart from liberating labour and other markets; but if this means a deliberate policy of greater insecurity and poverty for the working class, forget it. The world has seen the results of 10 years of Thatcherism, and it seems to have few takers among the conservative parties on the Continent, none among the Socialists. Only one thing is really impossible: that mainstream political parties should admit to permanent impotence in the central business of government, which is economic policy. Voters in the French regional elections fled both the Socialists and the conservatives, because neither side offered any solution to unemployment. If Emu means anything, it must mean a recovery through pooled influence over economic policy. Credible political leaders must have something to offer.</p>

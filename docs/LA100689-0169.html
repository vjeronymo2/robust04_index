			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT TOPICS: DO YOU FEEL MISUNDERSTOOD?  </P> <P> Everybody, at one time or another, feels misunderstood. Maybe you've done  something -- without even knowing it -- that's brought about the silent  treatment from your best friend. Maybe you have an undeserved reputation at  school. Or maybe your parents have grounded you, and you're not exactly sure  why.  </P> <P> Hot Topics wonders: "What is the one thing you feel you are most misunderstood  about?"  </P> <P> "I am most misunderstood about my life style. Because of the friends I hang  around, most people often think I am loud and even arrogant. I enjoy being with  my friends, but more than that, I enjoy my quiet times."  </P> <P> Carter Kim, 17,  </P> <P> senior, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "The image I present at school, because during the last five years or so, I  have had a total rebel attitude. I know that in a year or so reality will kick  in and my 'party' years will be mostly a memory."  </P> <P> Tom Cornwell, 18,  </P> <P> senior, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "People just don't seem to understand my intentions. Different people have  different personalities, and therefore need more or less of my time. Some  people handle compliments better than others; therefore, they receive more or  less and the appearance is sometimes misleading. I wish everyone would know I  really do care about them equally, and sometimes my distribution of myself  isn't always as fair as I would like it to be."  </P> <P> Jeff Vinson, 16,  </P> <P> junior, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "People are always trying to get too much out of me. They expect that I can do  so much in so little time."  </P> <P> Neal Schuster, 15,  </P> <P> sophomore, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "Most people think I'm really quiet and shy, but once you get to know me, I'm  totally opposite."  </P> <P> Andrea Baiz, 16,  </P> <P> junior, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "The way I act."  </P> <P> George Palafox, 17,  </P> <P> junior, Cypress  </P> <P> "The way I feel about others."  </P> <P> Joanne Cox, 15,  </P> <P> sophomore, Cypress  </P> <P> "My meanness, because it's a type of sarcasm, but someone may take it as a  put-down."  </P> <P> Justin Boatman, 16,  </P> <P> junior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "My seriousness, because people take the things I say the wrong way."  </P> <P> Ryan Harrison, 17,  </P> <P> senior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "My jokes, because people don't think they're funny, but I do."  </P> <P> Janet Rollins, 16,  </P> <P> junior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "My personality, because I have mood swings."  </P> <P> Chris Reese, 15,  </P> <P> sophomore, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "When I've just met someone and I act shy, sometimes they think I'm stuck-up."  </P> <P> Wendy Gilpin, 15,  </P> <P> sophomore, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "People think I'm smart because of the classes I take, but I really don't study  as much as they think."  </P> <P> Arie Loeb, 14,  </P> <P> sophomore, Fullerton  </P> <P> "People think I'm quiet, but in reality I'm really wild and obnoxious."  </P> <P> Katie Zerga, 16,  </P> <P> junior, Fullerton  </P> <P> "People think that because I'm a blonde, I'm stupid, but that's not true."  </P> <P> Becky Oakden, 17,  </P> <P> senior, Fullerton  </P> <P> "My music, because I like hard rock and heavy metal, but my parents aren't  thrilled with it."  </P> <P> Kari Johnson, 16,  </P> <P> senior, Irvine  </P> <P> "When your parents make you do your homework even though you know you have  enough time to do something else."  </P> <P> Vanessa Chepo, 14,  </P> <P> sophomore, Marina  </P> <P> "My hair; people think that because I have long hair I'm some kind of dirt bag  or something."  </P> <P> Marc Larson, 17,  </P> <P> senior, Marina  </P> <P> "My problems."  </P> <P> Lori Ermel, 16,  </P> <P> senior, Marina  </P> <P> "Life -- in general."  </P> <P> Christine Quimbo, 15,  </P> <P> sophomore, Mater Dei  </P> <P> "People misinterpret you in your actions, thoughts and words."  </P> <P> Melissa Trullio, 15,  </P> <P> sophomore, Mater Dei  </P> <P> "People see me as a quiet person, and believe me, that's not true."  </P> <P> Ludwig Freimuth, 17,  </P> <P> junior, Mater Dei  </P> <P> "People make judgments about you before you know them."  </P> <P> Amy Kelly, 17,  </P> <P> senior, Mater Dei  </P> <P> "When anyone over 21 treats all teen-agers like we're weapon-wielding,  tire-slashing, gang members with no goals or aspirations to call our own."  </P> <P> Paul Ohm, 16,  </P> <P> senior, Ocean View  </P> <P> "When my parents ask me why I'm so tired after school, because they think  school doesn't compare to one of their rough days at work."  </P> <P> Jon Thorne, 17,  </P> <P> senior, Ocean View  </P> <P> "By my parents when they think I am just like any teen-ager they see on  television or when they compare me to other kids they know.

Is anyone?"  </P> <P> Seema Mehta, 15,  </P> <P> sophomore, Ocean View  </P> <P> "Whenever I meet some guy and then I talk to him or be what you'd call  friendly, most of my friends tend to jump to the conclusion that I like the  guy, which I don't. Can't a girl be nice to a guy without wanting or liking  him?"  </P> <P> Annie Piyabdtayakarn, 16,  </P> <P> junior, Ocean View  </P> <P> "People think I study all the time because I usually get good grades.

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Slicker in the City: Warburg is re-evaluating its strategy to compete globally We will never go deeper into the gutter than anyone else, but by our lights we will be relatively aggressive,' said the Earl Cairns, chief executive of S G Warburg, the UK's most ambitious investment bank. He was responding to a report that a US rival had not been playing fair  - a Warburg director had complained that an American securities firm it was working with had been 'pinching' Warburg's corporate finance ideas and passing them off to a client as its own. Lord Cairns' remark sums up a dilemma faced by Warburg in deciding its next moves in a long-running strategy to become a genuinely international investment bank. At the moment, the most successful international houses, on many measures, are American - such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and First Boston (with its London affiliate, Credit Suisse First Boston). The challenge for Warburg is how to become more globally competitive without abandoning the valuable European traditions and practices responsible for its 30 years of primacy in London. As the chairman of a rival UK securities firm said: 'Warburg has got to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.' Lord Cairns' goal is clear. 'We want to be a European version of whatever they (the leading US firms) are.' American rivals have very profitable domestic operations, just as Warburg has a powerful UK operation. But they have a bigger share of international capital markets business, ranking ahead of Warburg in league tables for the issuance of Eurobonds, other debt securities and equities distributed in more than one country. Warburg insists it is not interested in market share, but in profitability. However, on this measure too, it lags behind many American competitors. Despite growing challenges, Warburg remains the most successful of the UK's integrated securities houses. Over the past seven years, it has outperformed firms such as Barclays de Zoete Wedd, County NatWest and Kleinwort Benson in penetrating overseas markets, and has been more profitable. However, the performance of its global investment banking business looks less impressive if the high returns earned by Mercury Asset Management, the leading fund management group which has been partly demerged from Warburg, are ignored. Without the inclusion of Mercury's earnings in calculations, Warburg's profits as a percentage of its shareholders' funds - or its return on capital - has exceeded 20 per cent only once in the past five years. Otherwise the return has varied between 14 per cent and 16 per cent, until it slipped sharply in the first half of the current year to less than 6 per cent, due in part to some exceptional factors. 'There is no denying we have not had the return on capital which we would have wanted to have and intend to have,' said Lord Cairns. His aim is to get it to at least 20 per cent, excluding Mercury. Warburg would be more profitable if more UK companies used it as a one-stop shop for financial services, as it hoped they would at the time of Big Bang in 1986, when London's securities market was deregulated. But a majority of Warburg's clients still insist that it works either with another broker or another merchant bank on any particular deal. 'We can't press the case too hard (for using Warburg on its own), because it sounds like pure self-interest,' Lord Cairns said. 'We've got to wait for it to catch on.' A further factor in holding profits down has been Warburg's substantial investments since Big Bang in overseas operations, where 40 per cent of employees are based. 'Because of our perception that financial markets will be global, there is a willingness to accept lower returns for a while to establish ourselves in overseas markets,' said Lord Cairns. Lord Cairns became chief executive 18 months ago, taking over many of the responsibilities then held by Sir David Scholey who, as chairman, remains involved in formulating the firm's strategy. Lord Cairns' methods of boosting profits have to a certain extent been outside the Warburg tradition in that they have involved bigger job cuts than in the past. 'Last year we looked at the (costs) of the business very hard,' Lord Cairns said. As a result, about 100 UK jobs were axed. There was an uprecedented reduction of about 20 in the corporate finance department, the traditional heart of the firm. Lord Cairns said this rigorous approach would be continued: 'Are we going to continue to look at the business in a more hard-boiled way than in the past? Yes, a bit.' However, some Warburg staff fear a tough job-cutting programme could erode the loyalty of employees and put Warburg's valuable culture at risk. The essence of the culture - which one executive described as 'almost Stalinist', though Lord Cairns preferred to call it 'slightly Japanese' - is that the good of the firm comes before that of the individual. Long-established practices include never going to meetings with client alone  -always in pairs or groups - and extensive note-taking. When telephoning clients, executives often listen in to each other. But maintaining the cohesion of the firm has become more difficult as its size has increased. In 1981, it employed 660 - and even then the founder, Sir Siegmund Warburg, feared it had become too big. Today it employs 5,090, 75 per cent of whom have joined since 1986. Nonetheless, rivals agree that a high staff turnover has not dented its professional standards. 'Their culture remains one of their major strengths,' said a senior executive of a US firm. 'In meetings, they are tremendously professional,' said a UK merchant banker. While its professionalism appears to be safeguarded, an important element in Warburg's corporate philosophy is under review. The firm has traditionally avoided taking big positions in shares or securities, because of a concern that this would lead clients to question the impartiality of its advice - and also partly because it regarded trading for its own account as risky. However, its American rivals take substantial positions in securities and derivative instruments, such as swaps and options, in the knowledge that the risk inherent in one position is being offset by another. The result has been that they have used their capital to make big profits, with comparatively little risk. Lord Cairns admits that Warburg's systems for controlling the risks of making loans or holding securities and derivative instruments have been less sophisticated than those of US rivals: 'We have been too literal in seeing the risks separately. We have not bundled up the risks and measured the combination of them.' He foresees Warburg trading in securities for its own account more often. However, he retains 'a natural aversion to getting as far down the line (in holding securities) as the US firms'. For their part, some American firms are delighted at Warburg's cautious approach. One chairman said: 'I don't think Warburg can afford its scruples.' In its international battle, 'relative aggression' may not be enough.</p>

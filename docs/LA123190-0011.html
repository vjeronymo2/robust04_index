			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Seeing Double: Visitors to the corner of Broxton and Weyburn Avenues in  Westwood Village will see the unusual sight of two movie theaters with the same  film on their marquees: "The Godfather Part III."  </P> <P> Both the Mann Village and Mann Bruin theaters, across the street from each  other, are showing the Francis Ford Coppola film at the same time. Mann  Theaters director of operations Ben Littlefield said that the success of the  film at the 1,500-seat Village Theater since it opened on Christmas Day caused  the theater chain to open the movie at the 800-seat Bruin. "It takes a dynamic  film with a large demand to warrant that kind of treatment," Littlefield said.  BETH KLEID  </P></p>

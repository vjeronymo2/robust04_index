He recalled Clinton's idea, voiced during his visit in  Europe, that solving economic and social problems and ensuring  prosperity for all was one of the prerequisites for the peace  and security of states. Grebenicek said it was necessary that  this idea not to remain a mere oratorial [as received] phrase  but be implemented in specific deeds.    He said American initiatives designed to help reforms in  Central and East European countries were not meeting this task.  He said the United States had allocated $400 million to support  democratic and market reforms in these countries, which amounts  to 13 percent of the U.S annual military aid to Israel.    The Partnership for Peace plan would be an "unequal  partnership" for Central European countries and would deepen the  rivalry among the Visegrad Four countries (the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland), Grebenicek said. "We are  anxious that the Czech political leadership has enthusiastically  agreed with it.... A referendum should decide on its  acceptance," he added.    Vojtech Folip, a KSCM expert on legislation and human  rights,  said that the agreement crossed the bounds of the Constitution  by, for example, the fact that it would station foreign armies  on the Czech Republic's territory which, he said, would be  limitation of its state sovereignty.    The Communists hold the view that cooperation in Europe  could  be much better secured through the revival of the Helsinki  process than through the expansion of NATO, KSCM Deputy Chairman  Miloslav Randsdorf said. He pointed to the fact that the Czech  Republic would have to "financially participate in North  Atlantic Alliance actions." At a time of economic reform this  would be an especially sensitive burden for the state budget, he  said.    The Communists favor a Europe stretching from the Atlantic  to  the Urals without a privileged position for anyone and the flow  of such foreign capital in the Czech Republic which would  enhance the economic strength of the country.    Grebenicek said that unlike German capital, which could  threaten the Czech national identity, the penetration of  American capital does not represent such a danger.</p>

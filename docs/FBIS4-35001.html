			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Juan De Dios Garcia Davish] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 23 Jun -- The Zapatist  National Liberation Army [EZLN] has extended its operations 15  km into Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas, where it has  intensified its rustling and looting, Jorge Constantino Kanter,  a leader of the cattle ranchers, has reported here. Meanwhile,  the State Prosecutor's Office has arrested 127 members of the  State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations [CEOIC] who  have occupied seven estates.    Constantino Kanter and the president of the State Federation  of Small Rural Owners, Fidel Enrique Culebro Trejo, have  confirmed they will stage a sit down protest in front of the  Government Palace tomorrow to demand that the state and federal  authorities clear at least 200 estates that have been occupied  since the beginning of the armed conflict by Zapatists or CEOIC  members. Laura del Carmen Mayagoitia Penagos, owner of the  Granja de la Paz Estate in Simojovel Municipality, has announced  she will start a hunger strike.    Culebro Trejo said that even though they will not obtain  positive results to their demands, they will avoid a  confrontation with the Zapatists and the CEOIC squatters  inasmuch as "this would be a mistake." In this struggle, we will  defend ourselves legally.    To this effect, Constantino Kanter has said the Zapatists  have again started to collect war taxes for the mobilization of  animals or traffic, which, in addition to the lootings, has  increased uncertainty because there are no kinds of guarantees.    Both men have said they will be joined in their protests by  at least 1,200 Tzotzil, Tojolabal, and Tzeltal Indians who have  fled to avoid being enrolled in the EZLN ranks. These Indians  live in unhealthy conditions, even though they have homes in  which to live, but these are in the area of conflict.    Meanwhile, early this morning, public security officials and  judiciary policemen began to clear out the seven estates that  grow export products. They arrested 127 people and charged them  with private property damage, association with criminal intent,  and misappropriation. During the operation to clear out the  estates of Ojo de Agua, Chiquita, Chacatelje Tobruc, Argelia,  and Pinotepa, all in Mazatan Municipality, the authorities  arrested 102 people and 25 others on the El Rincon Coffee  Plantation. All of these individuals were turned over to the  Attorney General's Office by State Prosecutor Arturo Becerra  Martinez and Police Coordinator General Augusto del Pino Estrada.    During the operation to clear out the estates, the police  seized machetes and knives and destroyed rustic shacks that had  been built of wood, palms, and plastic. The shacks had banners  reading: "We demand respect for land occupations; CIOAC  [expansion unknown], CNPA [National Coordinating Board for the  Ayala Plan], CEOIC. We will win with the unity of the poor."    According to a spokesman for the State Prosecutor's Office,  the operations to clear out the estates were ordered following  the charges raised before this office. The land and estates  were returned to Rodolfo Flores Garcia, Rolanda Stivajet Corral,  Roberto Fourzali Moises, Alfredo Sanchez Gomez, Pedro Rene  Bodegas, and Bernardo Pholenz Krauze.    Police Coordinator General Augusto del Pino Estrada has  reported that to prevent further land occupations, special  surveillance measures will be established in Mazatan  Municipality to guarantee security.    Hermino Verdugo Munoz, regional CEOIC leader, has advised if  they have not received clear responses to their requests by  tomorrow, they will take over the international bridges linking  Mexico with the Central American Isthmus, and they will block  entries to six municipal capitals of the coastal area.</p>

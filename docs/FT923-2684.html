			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (1): Well-placed for an eventual recovery - As the Welsh economy has diversified in recent years, observers believe that the principality will be the first part of the UK to take advantage of an economic upturn JUNCTION 24 on the M4 motorway into south Wales, a few miles to the east of Newport, presents a microcosm of what is happening to the economy of the principality. To the north, the Welsh Development Agency and Wilson Bowden are working on the Langstone business park, the first stage of a joint venture between the public and private sectors that is eventually expected to create several hundred jobs. Across the road, the shell of the building which the electronics company, Inmos, once occupied now stands empty. Wales is no more immune to recession as unemployment rises, liquidations and closures increase, and business confidence wanes, than the rest of Britain. It differs from many other parts in that there is good news as well as bad. Mr David Hunt, the eternally optimistic secretary of state for Wales, tours the country announcing new investments, jobs created. Thus, the marine insurance concern, Hayter Brockbank, will create 230 jobs in Cardiff; Henrob, which makes rivets in Flint, is to undertake a Pounds 1.8m expansion to create 34 jobs; Pullmaflex, which makes car seats, is to expand in Ammanford at a cost of Pounds 2.8m, creating 40 jobs. This welcome news has been offset, however, by other less favourable announcements. British Coal is closing two of the last three pits in the Welsh valleys, with the loss of 700 jobs, BP has put a question mark over one of its chemical plants at Baglan Bay, Port Talbot, where 1,900 are employed, and companies such as Panasonic, AB Electronics and Hoover have introduced lay-offs or short-time working. Success and failure go hand in hand in Wales in 1992. The long road from an economy based on heavy, smoke-stack industries to a diversified, modern industrial base has been largely completed. Wales is now a country in which financial services, motor parts, processed foods, electronics and information technology are established sectors. The country has the highest percentage of small businesses and start-ups, relative to population, of any part of the UK. Management buy-outs are continuing at a healthy pace, says 3i, the investment capital group. It is this change in the economy that has led commentators to suggest that the principality will be the first part of the UK to take advantage of the upturn in the economy when it comes. 'People have kept their nerve here,' says Dr Gwyn Jones, chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, set up in 1976 to rejuvenate the economy. 'In the recession of the early 1980s, confidence went as unemployment and closures rose. This time, although the recession has checked our economic momentum, people are confident of what they can do when times get better.' Mr Brian Morgan, the agen cy's chief economist, points out that manufacturing output has fallen by just 2 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1988 and the second quarter of this year, compared with 20 per cent between the second quarter of 1979 and the last three months of 1982. This time, unemployment has gone up by 2 per cent, against 130 per cent a decade ago. And in some areas, such as business services, Welsh growth exceeded that in the rest of the UK between 1985 and 1992 by 15 percentage points. Mr Keith James, chairman of solicitors, Eversheds Phillips &amp; Buck in Cardiff, says there has been considerable resilience during the recession. 'Manufacturing has continued to expand,' he says, and the corporate and services infrastructure has remained strong.' Mr David Kern, chief economist of National Westminster bank, believes Wales will lead a weak UK recovery. 'The Welsh economy will register a small rise in economic growth of 0.1 per cent this year,' he says, 'in contrast to fairly large outright declines in London and the rest of southern England. 'Next year, Wales's output growth, forecast at 1.7 per cent, will continue to outperform the national average. The resilience of the Welsh economy in the face of the longest, and one of the most severe British recessions, is remarkable,' he argues. Much of that resilience has come from the inflow of investment. The capital inflow last year topped Pounds 1bn, according to Dr Jones, twice the level achieved a decade ago. A Canadian company, Fisher Gauge, has chosen mid Wales, and a Singapore concern, Mayor-Sakata, is already in production in Merthyr Tydfil. The Gooding group has announced a further joint venture with Japan's Sanken for electronics expansion and Ford is to put another Pounds 100m into its Bridgend engine plant. Tesco is to build its largest UK distribution depot outside Newport. Yet, for all the confidence being expressed in Wales's resilience, the recession, if, prolonged much further, will undoubtedly be very damaging. A survey just published by accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand shows that two-thirds of Welsh businesses have suffered significant reductions in turnover, three-quarters have seen their margins come under severe pressure, and half have had to lay off workers. Contrary to the more optimistic assessment being made elsewhere, Coopers' partner in charge in Cardiff, Mr Hywel Jones, is one of those who believe there has been a significant reduction in confidence in the future. An earlier Western Mail/Touche Ross survey similarly concluded that business confidence had been severely dented this year. Mr Robert Ellis, senior Cardiff partner with the accountants, has gone so far as to describe the collapse of confidence as 'startling and dramatic, indicating bad news for the economy for the foreseeable future.' Another Cardiff-based accountant, Mr Hugh Thomas, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, claims that while Wales has fared better than areas such as the south-east of England, the effect of a post-election buzz has been was short-lived. 'Wales still has a long way to go towards achieving prosperity,' he states. The position is unlikely to get better for 18 months, suggests Mr Paul Sheldon, chief executive of the South Glamorgan TEC. The benefits being achieved by schemes such as the Valleys Initiative of former secretary of state, Peter Walker, have also been called into question. A recent report by two Cardiff academics argues that the initiative was largely a marketing exercise, packaging together policies and projects already in existence, without the substantial extra funds needed to make it work. Unemployment in a number of towns such as Holyhead, Merthyr Tydfil, Aberdare, Haverfordwest, Bangor and Llanelli hovers around the 20 per cent mark, while low pay continues to be a depressant, a consequence in part of the large numbers employed in the public sector. Nor are the problems confined to the older industrial areas. Agriculture remains depressed with farm incomes last year, while marginally higher than in 1990, still 25 per cent down on 1989 levels. Meanwhile, tourism in south Wales has been helped by the highly successful garden festival in Ebbw Vale. The Institute of Welsh Affairs, an independent think-tank, has set up a steering group, Wales 2010, to try to chart an economic development plan which will equip Wales for self-sustaining growth in the 21st century. Its chairman, Mr Gareth Jones, says the group is 'seeking to develop a successful strategic intent and direction for Wales, which will not only produce a significantly higher GDP but also improve the quality of life.' It is a direction everyone in Wales wants to travel.  -------------------------------------------------- TRAVEL TIMES BY ROAD BETWEEN UK CENTRES  -------------------------------------------------- Travel times between leading UK centres and Welsh business and industrial areas are shorter than often realised:  -------------------------------------------------- From South Wales (Cardiff) to:  -------------------------------------------------- London: 2 hrs 30 mins.

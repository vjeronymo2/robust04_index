			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Equity Issues: Ten Indian groups aim to raise Dollars 1bn this year AT LEAST 10 large Indian companies, including some of the country's leading private enterprises, aim to raise some Dollars 1bn in new equity capital on the Euromarkets before the end of this year. Grasim Industries, the cement, textiles and fibre manufacturer which delayed a domestic offering earlier this year when trading on the Bombay stock market was halted, will now enter the Euromarkets this month with a Dollars 100m issue through Citibank and Merrill Lynch. Hindalco, an aluminium company, will also enter the markets in November, with Jardine Fleming managing a Dollars 100m issue. Tata Iron and Steel will raise Dollars 100m through Credit Suisse First Boston and Citibank. ITC, the tobacco and hotels company, will make a Dollars 80m issue through Merrill Lynch and Citibank. Gujarat State Fertiliser Corporation plans a Dollars 80m offer through Merrill Lynch and Citibank. Essar Gujarat, the iron company. is raising Dollars 100m through Merrill Lynch and Citibank. Bombay Dyeing, the textiles manufacturer, is seeking Dollars 100m through S G Warburg Securities and Citibank. Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, a finance company, will make a Dollars 100m through Morgan Stanley and Citibank. Southern Petrochemicals and Industries Corporation (SPIC), the fertiliser and chemicals manufacturer, will raise Dollars 100m through Solomon Brothers and Citibank. Gujarat Ambuja Cements, the cement company, will issue Dollars 100m via Solomon Brothers and Citibank. India's leading foreign banks have cautioned the Securities and Exchange Board (SEBI) to monitor the performance of shares of companies planning Euro-issues. This follows fears that companies may attempt to artificially inflate prices on the domestic stock markets before pricing their Euro issues. Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) for Euro issues are priced taking into account share prices on the country's stock exchanges during a specified period. The government has discontinued the two-year lock-in period, replacing it with a 180-day 'cooling off' period.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 23 June (ITAR-TASS) -- "Earlier or later we  shall arrive at an alliance [words indistinct] Euro-Asian union.  It had better be done now, without bloodshed and fighting,  President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan said in an interview  published by the MOSCOW NEWS weekly [no end quotes, as received].    "Within the European Community small countries secured a  position for themselves in which bigger countries are allowed  less dictate," he said. "This is the aim of the European Union.  I understand why certain circles in Russia are opposed to  Nazarbayev's idea -- it is easier to dictate when the  Commonwealth is in its present state, within a union, account  must be taken of the interests of smaller states [sentence as  received]. But there is no alternative, the way of dictatorship  will inevitably make Russia weaker," Akayev said.    "Russia is a priority direction of our foreign policy.  Unfortunately, trade and economic relations with the Russian  Federation are shrinking, it now ranks third after Kazakhstan  and Uzbekistan. But even when we do not meet with reciprocity,  we can look only to Russia for protection. We were among the  first to support the establishment of the collective security  council within the frame of the Commonwealth of Independent  States."    "While among the former Soviet republics we lean on Russia  for support, beyond this boundaries great moral support comes  from the United States. The United States is the main donor to  our programme of democratisation and transition to a market  economy," the president said.</p>

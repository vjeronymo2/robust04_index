			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Corporate Finance (1): Dreaming of takeovers - The takeover activity of the 1980s which dominated the work of merchant banks' corporate finance departments has given way to the three Rs; restructurings, rights issues, and rescues. Robert Peston looks at the consequences THE three Rs; rights issues, restructurings and rescues have dominated the work of merchant banks' corporate finance departments over the past year, especially in the UK. The furious takeover activity of the mid-1980s seems an age away. Just Pounds 7.2bn was spent by companies buying UK listed businesses in 1991, marginally down from 1990, and less than a third of what was spent on UK corporate acquisitions in 1988. In other words, merchant banks could no longer rely for the bulk of their fees and profits on providing advice in takeovers, whether recommended takeovers or hostile bids. Indeed, the mega-bid was particularly elusive. The biggest completed UK takeover of the past year was the Pounds 1.4bn acquisition of Hawker Siddeley, the engineering and aerospace group, by the conglomerate, BTR, which was advised by the specialist corporate finance boutique Hambro Magan and by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays. Only one other completed takeover, that of Ultramar by rival oil company Lasmo, was worth more than Pounds 1bn. Both are dwarfed by the recommended Pounds 3.9bn offer by Hongkong Bank for Midland. That takeover was redolent of the good years, in that Hongkong Bank, advised by Schroders, for a while faced a stiff challenge to buy Midland from Lloyds Bank. Lloyds had unusually indicated it would put in a bid exceeding that of Hongkong only if certain pre-conditions were met. In the event Lloyds, advised by the merchant bank Barings, feared that it would have to pay too much to stand any chance of buying Midland, whose merchant bank adviser is SG Warburg, so it withdrew. In spite of the lack of takeover activity, leading merchant bankers say that many of their clients are contemplating making acquisitions and that there could, therefore, be an increase in the number of bids in the coming months. The bankers explain that following April's general election in the UK the confidence of some companies has returned. Corporate confidence has been in short supply over the past year, because many companies have been caught in the vice of large borrowings, taken on in the 1980s, and low economic growth. Hence, there has been a sharp rise in attempts by companies to raise cash through rights issues. The London merchant bank, Robert Fleming, estimates that in 1991 Pounds 10.5bn was raised by UK companies through rights issues, which was 25 per cent more than had been raised in any single year. The average size of each issue was relatively large at Pounds 58m, compared with Pounds 35m in the previous year. Small companies found it relatively difficult to make issues, because of the widespread fear among investors that smaller businesses were more likely to collapse in the inhospitable economic environment. Fleming estimates that 19 of the 30 biggest rights issues were carried out by companies in order to 'repair their balance sheets'. It classifies the biggest rights issue of all, the Pounds 604m one by P&amp;O, the property and shipping group, whose merchant bank adviser was Hambros, in this category. However, the next three largest rights issues - by Tesco, the supermarket group, Bass the brewer and J. Sainsbury the other supermarket chain - were carried out for rather less pressing reasons. They took advantage of a favourable money raising climate - the investment institutions were relatively flush with cash - to raise money for investment. The institutions' cash position is less favourable in the current year. Nonetheless, some further big rights issues are predicted by merchant bankers. Of great concern to investors is the possibility that one of the big clearing banks might launch a record breaking rights issue to restore their depleted capital resources. But the banks have resolutely denied that they are planning any such thing. There is one area of traditional corporate finance business which has undergone a revival: the flotation of companies on the stock market. Though there was a tiny number of flotations in 1991 - only 54, down from 167 in 1987 - in the current period a large number of new listings involving some very big companies are occurring. These include: The Pounds 465m flotation of Waste Management International, the waste disposal group, which took place in April. The sale was organised by the US investment banks, Merrill Lynch and Kidder Peabody, with Lazard Brothers, the City of London merchant bank, and Cazenove, the City stockbroker. The international public offering of 330m shares in Wellcome, the drug company, which are currently held by Wellcome Trust, the charitable institution. Robert Fleming is co-ordinator of that sale. The flotation of 26m shares in the Daily Telegraph at a price of 325p per share. This will raise Pounds 84.5m for Conrad Black's Hollinger group and puts a market value of Pounds 435.5m on the group. Two other big flotations, MFI, the furniture retailer, and Del Monte Foods International, the processed food manufacturer, have either begun or are due soon. The case of GPA, however, has emphasised that such issues are not risk-free. The sale of almost one-third of the Irish aircraft leasing group's shares, valuing the company at a total of Dollars 3.5bn, was aborted after it became clear that demand from institutional investors was well below expectations. 3i, the venture capital group has also been obliged recently to announce the postponement until next year of its planned flotation. As with Wellcome, there is an increasing trend for such share offerings to involve obtaining market listings in more than one country and for the marketing to be done globally. The technique for pricing the shares has also become far more sophisticated. On the other hand, flotation of small companies remains few and far between. The explanation is similar to the reason why small companies have launched few rights issues. Many small businesses have not yet recovered sufficiently from the effects of the recession for their shares to represent a suitably safe investment. The recession also explains why so much corporate finance work has been in the form of corporate rescues and restructurings. At the end of March, the reconstruction of Brent Walker's balance sheet and Pounds 1.65bn of debt was completed after 18 months of tense negotiations with banks. This was the biggest UK corporate restructuring. The merchant bank advising was Hill Samuel. Brent Walker's banks and bondholders have all suffered big losses on their loans. However, in the event they were persuaded that their losses would be significantly greater if Brent Walker had been put into liquidation, receivership or administration under UK insolvency law. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the securities house, is in the process of trying to persuade bankers and bondholders owed more than Pounds 1bn by Heron, the property group, that they too would be disadvantaged if they plumped for an insolvency filing for Heron rather than a debt reconstruction. However, creditors are not always persuadable. Bankers recently opted to put Canary Wharf, the east London property development owned by Olympia &amp; York Developments, the Canadian private company, into administration. In the case of Mountleigh, the property group, bankers took the view that their interests were best served by pressing for receivership. Corporate financiers view this fourth 'R', for receivership, as an anathema. Once a company is in receivership, all the fat fees go to the accountants and lawyers and none to the merchant bankers. These fees are indeed very tempting. Brent Walker, which was strapped for cash, nonetheless, paid more than Pounds 40m to its merchant bankers, accountants and lawyers in its battle to survive. Nice work . . .</p>

N.": "`Aggressive Act' Against Austria"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- Peter Pilz, spokesman of the Greens  Federal Executive Committee, said that the credit guarantees for  the continuation of the construction of the Czech nuclear power  plant Temelin at Austria's border is an "aggressive act against  the vital interests of the Austrian people." The Austrian  Government has to respond to this "most serious attack on  Austria's interests, at least in the past 20 years," with an  official protest and by recalling the Austrian ambassador to the  United States, Pilz demanded at a news conference yesterday,  Tuesday [1 February]. A little later, after the Cabinet  meeting, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky (Social Democratic Party of  Austria -- SPOe) affirmed his rejection of the nuclear power  plant construction, without dealing with Pilz's demand.  Vranitzky: "We will not stop our activities." It is intended  to offer again conversion to a gas-steam power station to the  Czech Republic. He also asked Nationalrat President Heinz  Fischer (SPOe) to "contact his U.S. counterpart," the chancellor  stated.</p>

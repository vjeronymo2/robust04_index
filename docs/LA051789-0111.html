			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'COTTON CLUB' FIGURE CHARGED IN 2ND KILLING  </P> <P> One of four "Cotton Club" defendants named in the 1983 execution of Broadway  promoter Roy Radin was charged Tuesday with a second and apparently unrelated  murder.  </P> <P> Former security guard Alex Marti, who is already fighting the Radin murder  charge in a preliminary hearing under way in Los Angeles Municipal Court, was  charged in the unrelated robbery and killing of Rene Vega on Aug. 4, 1987.  </P> <P> He and two co-defendants, Scott Hadley Ashley and Rod Brennan Columbo, are  scheduled to be arraigned Thursday on murder charges in the Vega case.  </P> <P> Marti, ex-security guards William Mentzer and Robert Lowe and reputed cocaine  dealer Karen DeLayne "Lanie" Greenberger allegedly shot Radin to death in  connection with a drug deal. Investigators believe that the drug deal and  execution may have been part of a plan to raise money for production of the  movie "Cotton Club."  </P> <P> Another former security guard, Carl Plzak, testified during the preliminary  hearing Monday and Tuesday and linked all four defendants to the murder in a  desolate canyon 65 miles northeast of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Deputy District Atty. David Conn's first witness, "Cotton Club" producer Robert  Evans, was excused Monday after he invoked his 5th Amendment right against  self-incrimination.  </P></p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Kode Intl more than doubled to Pounds 330,000 Kode International more than doubled profits in the 26 weeks to June 26 and has restored some of the previous cut in the dividend payment. The electronics and computer services group raised the pre-tax figure from Pounds 126,000 to Pounds 330,000 on sales up 29 per cent at Pounds 9.64m. The interim dividend is been raised by 0.5p to 1.5p on earnings of 2.7p (0.6p). In 1991, when profits were hit by redundancy and compensation costs, the overall dividend was reduced by 3.5p to 4p. There is no payment due on the shares created by the rights offer in July to finance the acquisition of DCM Services. The directors said yesterday that the two companies should be integrated by the year end.</p>

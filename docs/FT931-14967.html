			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Top price at Maxwell's auction is pounds 60,900 Top price at an auction of the contents of Robert Maxwell's home in Oxford was the Pounds 60,900 paid for a view of Jerusalem (above) by the Israeli artist Reuven Rubin, Antony Thorncroft writes. Possessions from Headington Hill Hall including reproduction Georgian furniture and video recorders went under the hammer at Sotheby's in London. The sale, arranged by receivers acting for creditors of the late media magnate, totalled Pounds 506,038, comfortably above Sotheby's Pounds 300,000 estimate. It was a subdued affair, perhaps because it was the first in London where the premium paid by buyers on top of the hammer price was 15 per cent, instead of 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan will attend the  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)  animals committee meeting scheduled for May 16-18 in Beijing, a  spokesman for the local green consumers foundation said Thursday  [12 May].    Foundation Chairman Fang Chien said the Council of  Agriculture [COA] agreed to attend the meeting after being  notified by committee Chairman Hank Jenkins, through Fang, that  he had reached an agreement with mainland Chinese authorities to  allow Taipei's participation.    Beijing had previously said it would not allow Taiwan's  participation at the meeting, ostensibly because it is not a  CITES member.    Jenkins, a conservation official in the Australian  Government, said it is important for Taiwan to be present at the  meeting because issues pertaining to wildlife protection and  conservation in Taiwan are on the agenda.    Both government agencies and private conservation groups in  Taiwan are hoping to attend the meeting since it will detail the  future direction of international wildlife management programs,  Fang said.    He said it would have been "unjustifiable" for Taiwan to be  barred from the meeting, considering CITES has threatened it  with trade sanctions for its failure to sufficiently stem the  trade in rhino horn and tiger parts.    The COA will be represented by Prof. Li Ling-ling from  National Taiwan University and Prof. Wang Ing from National  Normal University at the Beijing meeting. Fang said he would  also be a member of the Taiwan delegation, along with Ted Ting,  chairman of the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation, another local  conservation group.    The biennial meeting is a warm-up for the 1994 CITES parties  meeting, which is scheduled to open in Florida this November.</p>

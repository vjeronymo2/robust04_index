Meanwhile, on 18 February the Sao Paulo  Stock Exchange, which is one of the organizations that best  reflects the feelings of society, suffered a jolt: a drop of  almost 10 points. Are Franco and model Lilian Ramos to blame?  Partly. According to a market expert, the stock market fell  because in the morning of 18 February there was a rumor that  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso went to Juiz de Fora  to submit his resgination.    The rumor did not turn into reality but the reaction of the  stock market shows that Finance Minister Cardoso has become a  more important point of reference than the president. Even if  President Franco and Minister Cardoso were prisoners in the same  boat, they would be treated by Congress as separate forces, as  happened on 17 February when Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS)  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party--Rio Grande do Sul], the  rapporteur of the constitutional revision, criticized President  Franco for proposing Cardoso's presidential candidacy. According  to Jobim, the president's proposal obstructs the negotiations  for voting on the Social Emergency Fund. [passage omitted]    The presence of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the  government today is what gives perspective to society. He  represents initiative, he gathers power around him, and even his  personal contacts with Franco give support to the president.    These are compliments but they are the type of comments that  leave the minister concerned and the president annoyed. Of the  four finance ministers in the country in the last 16 months,  Cardoso is the one who has been able to maintain cordial, frank,  and constant relations with Franco for the longest time.  [passage omitted]    He represents power and work. While Franco remained in Juiz  de Fora, Minister Cardoso was one of the four ministers working  in Brasilia on 18 February and preparing his agenda for the next  day. With one hand on politics, he articulated the voting of the  Social Emergency Fund to be held on 23 or 24 February. With the  other hand on the economy, he was preparing the very complex  monetary transition to the URV [Real Value Unit].</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (14): The class that counts in the air - Some airlines offer more than others NOT ALL business classes are the same. But their differences are as much a matter of style and temperament as facts and figures. The airlines that offer a door-to-terminal limousine service, for example, are often not the same as those which have their own airport lounges. The reason is simple: big carriers such as British Airways simply have too many business class passengers to offer a free limousine service to them all. Small carriers, or those which may use an airport once or twice a day, find it more economic to offer a limousine service than a lounge. Cathay Pacific will drop you at your door within 40 miles of Heathrow without charge, but it does not have an executive lounge at the airport. For business passengers who care to choose their airlines carefully, at least seven features should be take into account when choosing a carrier. Flight frequency. The business traveller needs to know that if that last meeting day grinds on or the traffic on the Peripherique is locked solid, there will be another flight home later. Most airlines will accept another carrier's ticket, but it should really be a last resort as you may have to wait at a ticket desk, pay extra and probably lose your frequent flyer benefit. Seat pitch. The distance between the back of one seat and the back of the next one forward can make a significant difference to comfort on long-haul routes, especially for tall passengers. Most business classes, such as those on British Airways, American Airlines and Lufthansa, the German carrier, plump for a 40-inch seat pitch in long-haul aircraft. Air France and KLM, the Dutch airline, however, offer 38 inches or less. On some carriers, the pitch varies between aircraft. Swissair's A310 aircraft have 36-inch seat pitches in business class, but 40 inches in Boeing 747s. The business classes that are impossible to beat are those on carriers that sell first-class seat pitches - 55-60 inches - to business class ticket holders. The best known of these are Virgin Atlantic and Continental, the US carrier, on long haul services. But look out for Lauda air, the independent Austrian carrier run by former world champion racing driver Niki Lauda, and Eva Air, the Taiwanese carrier. Both fly between Europe and south-east Asia, and Eva has links to the US, too. Eva has a particularly unusual philosophy: it has a four-class aircraft. The upper deck contains first and business class, and the front of the lower deck has super economy, with seat leg-rests and some other features normally associated with business class. The idea is to appeal to the budget-conscious business traveller. Seat width. This is important for more than just the wider passengers. A narrow seat may feel comfortable for the first hour or two. But, as seasoned flyers know, finding another comfortable position may be hard work. Seat width depends as much on the aircraft type as the carrier. Seventeen inches is a typical economy seat width, 19 inches in business and 20 or more in first class. But if you are flying from Europe to south-east Asia, SAS business class seats on its Boeing 767 are only 18 inches across; on Thai, they are 21 inches across. Airport lounges are inc- reasingly becoming business tools, places in which reading, writing, phoning and faxing can be done in relative comfort. Their importance is redoubled if you have a connecting flight and need to stay in an airport for several hours, or if your business meeting can be conducted at the airport. The best lounges tend to be at an airline's main airport. There are four British Airways lounges at Heathrow's terminal four alone. But business class flyers going from Taiwan to Hong Kong will find that a BA ticket will get them an old sofa in a dingy room by the public canteen at Taipei's Chiang Kai Shek airport. If you have a ticket with China Airlines Inter- national, one of Taiwan's carriers, your lounge would grace any European airport. Some carriers will only offer lounges to first class passengers or registered frequent flyers, as with Lufthansa at New York's JFK and Air France at San Francisco. Much of this is irrelevant to business travellers who fly economy, especially on short-haul routes. Their choices are usually limited to any privileges conferred by membership of an airlines executive club. Others using London's Heathrow may prefer to pay a Pounds 50 a year subscription to UK travel agent Thomas Cook to use its new business centre at the airport. Travellers on a budget can make use of the usual business class lounge facilities such as conference room, secretarial support and showers. Limousines are as much for the good of the airline as the passenger. The sales pitch may be door-to-door service, but once the carrier has you on board its car, it knows you are going to turn up for the flight, that you will be on time and that you will almost certainly not switch to another carrier. No wonder that just about every long-haul airline flying out of Heathrow offers it. The exception, British Airways, goes some way to making up the gap for passengers bound for New York by giving away helicopter transfers to Manhattan for both first and business class carriers. Air France does the same for flights from Paris to JFK. And remember: if you are really in a hurry to get to the Big Apple, the Air France Concorde supersonic aircraft arrives in New York before BA's. Separate check-in and priority luggage handling. Essential tools for the executive short of time, separate check-in counters and fast luggage reclaim are standard with most airlines. A few exceptions include: no priority luggage handling on BA's short haul routes or any SAS routes. Airport convenience. City centre airports may be irrelevant for the executive who goes straight to the departure gate from verdant suburbia, but arriving at the other end with an easy transfer downtown can be a boon. For this reason, London's City airport is more popular with incoming executives than their London-based competitors. The US is the home of the convenient airport: visitors to the Bay area of northern California, for example, can choose from San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco Inter- national. Oakland is the closest to San Francisco's financial district. At the other end of the state, you can choose to arrive at LA International, Orange County (for Disneyland), Long Beach and several others. Taking such considerations seriously may cost you more money for your ticket. But many passengers find that it is worth the extra. The airlines recognise the selling power of factors such as flight fre- quency and lounges. Expect them to step up their sales campaigns as economic recovery takes hold.</p>

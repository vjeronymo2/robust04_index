Addressing a press conference after meeting Pan  Africanist Congress [PAC] President Clarence Makwetu in  Johannesburg on Thursday, Mr Buthelezi said the alliance was  waiting for a written compromise by ANC Chairman Thabo Mbeki  before talks resumed on Friday.    "But frankly, I am not optimistic about it. Nevertheless,  since we are determined to do everything in our power to find a  solution we feel we should do that and go the whole hog in  trying to reach an agreement."    On changing the April elections from a single ballot paper  for national and regional candidates to a two-ballot system, Mr  Buthelezi said ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa had refused  to discuss the issue. He said agreement on a two-ballot system  would help in getting the IFP to participate in the election,  but indicated outstanding consitutional issues such as stronger  regional powers would also have to be settled.    The IFP leader said a delegation for Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini was discussing the ballot issue with the government.  "The king said he would not encourgage his amakhosi, the chiefs,  and his people to participate in elections if the single-ballot  system was imposed on his people."</p>

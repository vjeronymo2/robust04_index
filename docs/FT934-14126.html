			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Clarke faces cabinet tax pleas today MR KENNETH Clarke will today face calls from cabinet colleagues to avoid jeopardising the apparently faltering economic recovery by imposing large tax increases in next month's Budget. But a full-scale cabinet debate of the options for November 30 will also hear a warning from the chancellor that the government's borrowing requirement is still on course to reach a record Pounds 50bn this year. Mr Clarke will tell his colleagues that, despite the latest disappointing output statistics, the economy should still grow faster this year than the 1.25 per cent predicted in March. Inflation will be lower than the 3.75 per cent envisaged by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor. His cautious optimism, however, will not extend to the outlook for the borrowing requirement, leaving open the real prospect of further tax increases. Mr Clarke has stressed repeatedly that the medium-term path for borrowing set out by Mr Lamont will not restore the Treasury's finances quickly enough. But as MPs returned to Westminster yesterday after the summer break, cabinet colleagues said that large tax increases in addition to the Pounds 10bn annual increase announced by Mr Lamont would endanger the fragile economic upturn. Only a small minority of rightwing ministers - most notably Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary - want the chancellor to resist any further rise in taxation. But others were last night scaling back their views of what would be an 'acceptable' pack-age. One senior minister said unless the economy showed stronger signs of growth, additional tax rises of more than Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn would risk a backlash from Conservative MPs. That assessment was echoed by another member of the cabinet who suggested that Mr Clarke should be aiming for a 'symbolic' rather than substantial cut in borrowing until the recovery was firmly established. Others, however, believe that the chancellor could opt for phased increases of about Pounds 5bn if the package was accompanied by a reduction in interest rates of at least 1 percentage point.

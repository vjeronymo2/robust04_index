			<p>BFN     [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev has favored the  need for the creation of an efficient CIS defense shield which  would have a powerful military potential and would be as good as  the Warsaw Pact of NATO. In an interview with INTERFAX Friday  [22 April] he said that the need to take such a step is  conditioned by the fact that the Euro-Asian space of the former  Soviet Union is now subject to dangerous bargaining in the West  and this, he said, violates the fragile balance of forces and is  fraught with global cataclysms.    Too many people in Russia and the world are not interested  in  the stabilization of the Euro-Asian space of the former Soviet  Union and Russia, as well as in the restoration and  strengthening of its might, said Dudayev.    "After a thorough analysis of the situation I came to the  conclusion that the restoration of the CIS defensive power and  Russia's status as a great power is the only way out of the  imbalance of forces taking shape in the world, said Dzhokhar  Dudayev.</p>

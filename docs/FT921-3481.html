			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: AMR shares benefit from revised traffic predictions SHARES in AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 77 1/2 yesterday morning, after the company suggested to analysts that March results should be better than previously expected. The results will compare with a very weak month in 1991, when the Gulf war overhung the airline industry. Nevertheless, AMR is reported to have revised its prediction for the increase in traffic from 22 per cent to 26 per cent, with a slightly more favourable picture on costs. American is one of the three largest carriers, and its results can be a pointer for the industry generally - which has been cheered by some firming of domestic fares. Some analysts were reported to have revised earnings estimates in the wake of AMR's latest news, with growing predictions of a profit from the group in the first three months of 1992. About 8,000 former employees at Pan Am, the now-defunct US airline, yesterday launched a Dollars 1.1bn 'class action' suit against Delta Air Lines. Delta, one of the three biggest US carriers, was to have been Pan Am's partner in a reorganisation plan which would have reduced the bankrupt airline's route network and left it concentrating on its Latin American and Carribean service. The 'reorganised' Pan Am would have continued to employ about 6,900 people. Delta went ahead with the purchase of Pan Am's east coast shuttle and transatlantic routes, but pulled out of the rest of the deal when Pan Am's losses mounted. Pan Am was then forced to ground its fleet, leaving thousands of employees - mainly in New York and Miami - out of work.</p>

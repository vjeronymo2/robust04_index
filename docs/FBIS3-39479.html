			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Pact for Italy leader Mario Segni by </F> Maurizio Caprara in Rome; date not given: "Segni: I Am Not  Making Any Purges But I Want More Credibility"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Caprara] Segni, first there  were the embraces, then sparks started to fly between you and  [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary] Martinazzoli. What  conflicts with the PPI still remain unresolved?    [Segni] The strategy behind the Pact for Italy, the real  reason for its existence, the strategy that prevails over the  difficulties, is the formation of a moderate European force that  is both liberal-democratic and reformist. In short, an  anchorage for serious government. A "broad right wing," made up  in reality of entities that are irreconcilable, has now joined  the inconsistent left front and there is a greatly increased  need for a credible force.    [Caprara] The fact remains that you are quarreling over  candidacies. Martinazzoli thinks it is unfair to lump together  all those under investigation, and warns of "the harshness of  purges."    [Segni] I have never been an admirer of Khomeyni. It is a  question of giving a little more, since the parties have lost  their validity. Of course that calls for sacrifices at the  human level, too. But they are necessary to restore credibility  to politics.    [Caprara] You have demanded all these sacrifices from the DC  [Christian Democratic Party] left-wingers: [former DC Chairman]  De Mita, [Interior Minister] Mancino, [Sicily Regional  Secretary] Mattarella. Bodrato says: "They are using the moral  issue to get rid of those who might end up on the right." Is  that not a political decision?    [Segni] That is an unfounded interpretation.    [Caprara] Why are you objecting to people under  investigation  from other teams?    [Segni] I am not making a personal issue of it and I am  truly  sorry that some people interpret it thus.    [Caprara] Your opponents are talking about you and saying:  "Why must we be `renewed' while he has been a parliamentarian  for five legislative terms and is staying on?"    [Segni] To tell the truth I have never pondered on the  problem of parliamentary terms. In a phase of change, there  must be a high level of renewal but also elements of continuity.  However painful it may be, the problem is the appropriateness  of certain candidacies. My place, however, is still available.    [Caprara] In the PPI primaries in Irpinia, De Mita's  candidacy was seconded by 8,142 people, and Mancino's by 4,322.  Are they not also flesh-and-blood voters?    [Segni] I have always said that at an epoch-making turning  point, it is necessary to make a change from those who  represented the previous system. Let it be very clear that  this is not a judgment. It is a political requirement. And it  is certainly a very strong one if the Pact for Italy wants to  win.    [Caprara] Did you expect to have a united bloc, of the type  that is emerging now, on your right ?    [Segni] I think that Sartori's article in CORRIERE DELLA  SERA  was perfect. What has been formed is not a political bloc. It  is not a liberal-democratic area, it is a conglomeration.  [Northern League Secretary] Bossi talks with [Forza Italia  leader] Berlusconi, and Berlusconi talks with [National Alliance  Coordinator] Fini, but Bossi will not shake hands with Fini. It  is impossible for them to have a common program. It is not just  the enormous gap in their views on Italian unity.    [Caprara] What other differences do you see?    [Segni] Is the MSI [Italian Social Movement] as in favor of  free trade as Berlusconi? Quite the opposite. The  inconsistencies on the left, in a lineup ranging from [Italian  Republican Party Chairman] Visentini to [Communist Renewal  Secretary] Bertinotti, are reflected on the right. We are more  consistent, that is why we are suffering more. We know exactly  what to do once we have gotten into government, whereas a split  is already a certainty on the other sides.    [Caprara] You once said that the Pact is an alternative to  the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left]. After the election  would you form an alliance to govern with Bossi and Berlusconi?    [Segni] We are asking for votes for ourselves and for our  programs. I do not know what will happen if none of the three  blocks achieves a majority. There may be a government of  technocrats to safeguard the nation, that will complete the  institutional reforms and ensure governability. What is certain  is that we will be moving in a specific direction, united  whether in government or in opposition.    [Caprara] Does this mean that the PPI cannot form an  alliance with the PDS?    [Segni] Exactly. And that is why we have decided to form a  single parliamentary group even if it takes the form of a  federation.</p>

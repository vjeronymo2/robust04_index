			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Watchdog sees bright future for building societies: The regulator is looking forward to his new job despite an early shock from Halifax No sooner had Mr Geoffrey Fitchew moved into his office as head of the Building Societies Commission than two of the largest societies announced plans to move out of the sector. It was nothing personal. But it was a sign of the widespread changes in the personal financial services industry which will dominate Mr Fitchew's time as head of the independent statutory regulator for societies. Societies have long been a stable financial presence in the high street, apparently generating more affection than the main clearing banks. But while smaller, local societies still have many traditional characteristics, the last remnants of cosiness have gone from the largest and most diversified. The announcement late last month by Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, of plans to merge with Leeds Permanent and then to convert to a public limited company with a full banking licence sent a shock wave through the sector. It had been galvanised in April by the impending departure of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society to become part of the Lloyds Bank group. So in applying to be head of the commission, Mr Fitchew had to consider how long there would be a sector to regulate. 'Needless to say, I didn't expect to be confronted with the specific Halifax and Leeds development in my first week in the office,' he said. 'But when I applied I took the view, and still hold the view, that the building societies' sector has a healthy future ahead of it.' The vast majority of the 80-plus societies did not want to become plcs, he said. 'It was a psychological shock to the system, but people get over psychological shocks.' The shock of the Halifax move is not the only significant shift in the sector. Early this year, the Treasury began a two-stage review of what powers building societies should have, and how they should be accountable to their customers. As mutual organisations, they are owned by their 33m or so borrowers and investors rather than by institutions. All the signs - including a report this week from the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs - are that societies will be allowed greater freedoms, but that they will also have to pay more attention to customers' rights as owners of the business. Before the review is published Mr Fitchew can say little about it, but he believes there are limits to the guilt that societies should feel about being unaccountable compared with plcs. 'A member of a society is not putting in risk capital and so it is not the same as being a shareholder in a plc,' he said. People who were unhappy with the way a society was behaving could simply move their accounts or mortgages. He is also clear that what matters is that customers are given more information about exercising membership rights, rather than being forced to take them up. 'It's up to members of the society to decide how active they want to be. In that sense it is no different from any kind of voluntary association such as an angling club or a golf club,' he said. 'Frankly, the ordinary building society customer has a lot of other things to do with his or her time.' Whatever the other challenges Mr Fitchew faces as head of the commission, maintaining the organisation's close links with the Treasury is unlikely to be one of them, as that is where he has spent most of his 30-year civil service career. His other postings have been mainly in Brussels. Most recently he ran the financial services department of the European Commission, where he was responsible for seeing through the banking, insurance and securities market legislation for the single market. Returning to the UK last year, he became head of the European secretariat at the cabinet office. From there, he took the view that heading the Building Societies Commission would combine his specialism in financial services with the prospect of running his own show, as he had done in Brussels. 'I was attracted by coming to be in charge of an independent operation of this kind,' he said. 'While in the European Commission I became used to being the person up-front in an organisation.' Further back in his career, however, there are aspects he must hope do not resonate with his new post. As a young high-flier in the late 1960s, he was private secretary to Mr Dick Taverne, then a Treasury minister whose main task was ensuring the parliamentary passage of the decimalisation bill. Mr Fitchew recalls how popular warmth towards the sixpence led to its being kept for a limited period, even though it swiftly became irrelevant in the new coinage. The coin, he said, 'was retained in the system for a time but in practice rapidly went out of circulation because of the way shop assistants give change. Nature took its course, and they all ended up at the banks.' One of the tests on which he will be judged in his new post will be whether a similar fate awaits building societies.</p>

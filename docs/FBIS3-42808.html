			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Center for the Study of Economic Trends under the </F> Government of the Russian Federation: "On the Population's  Standard of Living and the Situation in the Consumer Market in  1993"]    [Text] Over the past year the Russian government's actions  have been directed in many respects at strengthening the social  orientation of the current reforms, carrying out targeted  support of certain population groups and, through this,  achieving stability in society. The dynamics of the main  indicators of the standard of living show that in the past year  the bulk of the population have been able to adapt to the new  conditions.    According to estimates, in 1993 the real monetary income of  the population increased by more than 10 percent as compared to  1992. An especially fast rise of this indicator (almost 30  percent) was observed in the first half of 1993. An inflation  jump in the third quarter slowed down the dynamics of real  income. At the same time, comparing the distribution of the  population by income level at the end of 1993 with the analogous  period of the preceding year (in constant prices) shows a  certain increase in the share of persons whose material  situation became relatively better.    One of the main social consequences of economic reforms last  year was a considerable increase in stratification of the  country's population by income level. The gap in per capita  income between those in the top 10 percent income bracket and  the poorest population groups measured at the end of 1993 a  factor of 10.8 as compared to 8.7 in December of the preceding  year. It is estimated that the top 10 percent of the population  accounts for 30 percent of all income in society; in December  1992 it was 25 percent. The index of income concentration (the  Gini coefficient) increased by the end of 1993 to 0.350 as  compared to 0.256 in 1991 (0.327 in December 1992). The  accelerated rise of this indicator over such a short period of  time points to an extremely swift polarization of society.    Despite continuous increases in social benefits, there  remains a sufficiently large social group in the country whose  income does not provide for an acceptable consumption minimum.  By the end of 1993 there were 54 million persons (36 percent of  the total population) whose income was below the subsistence  level, including 4 million (3 percent) with income below the  physiological maintenance level. In the poor category are mostly  families with many children and incomplete families with  children, families with a high burden of dependents and labor  remuneration close to minimum wage, single pensioners, and the  disabled.    In the environment of a production decline and cutbacks in  centralized imports of consumer goods, market saturation mainly  took place through goods brought in by commercial structures and  physical persons from near and far abroad. Imported products  became more competitive in relation to domestically produced  ones; this includes first and foremost household electronics and  industrial goods.

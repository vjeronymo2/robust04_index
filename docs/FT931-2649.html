			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Disposal helps ASH profit leap to Pounds 45m Peggy Hollinger A profit of Pounds 32m on the sale of its loss prevention business helped Automated Security (Holdings) report a sharp jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 45.1m for the year to November 30. The pre-tax increase - with 1991 profits restated to meet new accounting standards - was achieved on sales 11 per cent lower at Pounds 173.2m. At the operating level, profits rose from Pounds 25.8m to Pounds 30.5m. During the year, ASH sold its European security and specialist CCTV business for Pounds 153m. The group also cut 620 jobs in the UK and US, resulting in redundancy costs of Pounds 3.7m. Lord Lane of Horsall, deputy chairman, said the rationalisation completed during the year had left ASH 'very much better both financially and operationally'. Profits from continuing operations increased by 6 per cent to Pounds 24m. However, Lord Horsall said that excluding the loss prevention business, pre-tax profits were Pounds 14.8m. This would be the benchmark by which ASH's future performance should be compared, he said. Lord Horsall felt cautious about the immediate outlook in the group's two main markets - the UK and US. The final dividend is increased by 8 per cent to 3.05p, for a total of 5.3p (4.9p). Earnings per share of 25.8p compared with losses last time of 6.6p. Excluding the disposal proceeds, earnings were 8.8p.</p>

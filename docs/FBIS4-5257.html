			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 8 Apr (AKP) -- Accompanied by his wife,  Queen Monineat Sihanouk, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk  arrived in Phnom Penh today, 8 April, from the DPRK.    Norodom Sihanouk, reenthroned as king of Cambodia last  September, has since been hospitalized in Beijing for cancer  treatment. He travelled to Pyongyang early this month before  returning to Cambodia.    According to a schedule arranged by the Royal Palace  cabinet,  the king will preside over a people's audience on 12 April to  solve five urgent problems from among the grievances aired by  the Cambodian people as selected by his high privy councillors.    A roundtable meeting between government leaders and the head  of the Khmer Rouge faction under the king's lofty chairmanship  has also been arranged.    Last month, government forces took control of several Khmer  Rouge-held bases, including Anlung Veng and Pailin, in the  region bordering Thailand. King Sihanouk launched an appeal  from Beijing calling on the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]  and the Khmer Rouge faction to put a halt to their fighting.    Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen,  respectively first and second prime ministers, have declared  that the RGC has adopted an "open-door" policy toward the Khmer  Rouge, allowing them a chance to reintegrate themselves into the  national community.</p>

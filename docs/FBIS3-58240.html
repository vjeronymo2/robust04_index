			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 11 (AFP) -- Here are the main points  of the communique issued by NATO leaders Tuesday [11 January] at  the end of their two-day summit:    MEMBERSHIP: "We expect and would welcome NATO expansion that  would reach to democratic states to our East, as part of an  evolutionary process, taking into account political and security  developments in the whole of Europe."    EAST-WEST MILITARY TIES: Launched Partnership for Peace, "an  immediate and practical programme that will transform the  relationship between NATO and participating states." Offers  former Soviet bloc states and other "able and willing" countries  cooperation in planning and joint exercises as well as crisis  consultations. "Active participation in the Partnership for  Peace will play an important role in the evolutionary process of  the expansion of NATO."    BOSNIA: "We reaffirm our readiness, under the authority of  the United Nations Security Council and in accordance with the  alliance decisions of 2 and 9 August 1993, to carry out air  strikes in order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the  safe areas and other threatened areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "In this context, we urge the UNPROFOR authorities to draw  up  urgently plans to ensure that the blocked rotation of the  UNPROFOR contingent in Srebrenica can take place and to examine  how the airport at Tuzla can be opened for humanitarian relief  purposes."    EUROPEAN DEFENSE IDENTITY: "The emergence of a European  Security and Defence Identity will strengthen the European  pillar of the alliance while reinforcing the transatlantic link  and will enable the European Allies to take greater  responsibility for their common security and defence."    ASSETS SHARING: "We therefore stand ready to make collective  assets of the alliance available, on the basis of consultations  in the North Atlantic Council, for WEU (Western European Union)  operations undertaken by the European Allies in pursuit of their  Common Foreign and Security Policy."    COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCES: Endorses a plan to create new  "separable but not separate" multinational command units that  could be detached from the main NATO structure for operations  without U.S. participation if needed. The joint task forces  could also be used for operations "with participating nations  outside the alliance."    NON-PROLIFERATION: Pledges to "intensify and expand" NATO  efforts to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction which "constitute a threat to international  security." Orders work on an overall policy framework "to  consider how to reinforce ongoing prevention efforts and how to  reduce the proliferation threat and protect against it."</p>

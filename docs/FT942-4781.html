			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / People: Peacock leaves for New York and BZW Ian Peacock, 46, who has spent 19 years with Kleinwort Benson, is moving to New York to be co-head of merchant banking in the US for BZW, Barclays Bank's investment banking arm. Barclays Bank has had a chequered history in the US. Just over a year ago it gave BZW strategic responsibility for the group's US operations, including day-to-day management of its large corporate lending. The reorganisation was in response to an increasing trend for large companies and institutions to raise funds from equity and bond markets rather than through bank borrowing. Peacock's move to BZW follows a reorganisation at Kleinwort Benson and a chance airport encounter with Graham Pimlott, 44, a former colleague, now chief executive of merchant banking at BZW who has recently taken on an expanded role within Barclays. BZW does not disclose the size of its US banking business, but it is known to be many times larger than the Pounds 2bn or so that Peacock was jointly responsible for at KB. Peacock ran the marketing side of KB's North American banking business between 1984 and 1987 before returning to the UK to be joint head of the group's lending operation. In his new role he will be primarily responsible for BZW's bank finance and structured finance products in the US. The other co-head of merchant banking in the US is Malcolm Le May, 36, who joined BZW in 1991 after stints at Drexel Burnham and Morgan Grenfell. Peacock is the latest ex-Kleinwort Benson banker to move to BZW. The best known is Sir Martin Jacomb, who spent 17 years with KB before helping form BZW in 1986. When Pimlott quit KB in 1989 he took with him Callum McCarthy, who now heads BZW's Japanese business.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: VW reduces loss in first nine months to DM1.5bn VOLKSWAGEN whittled losses for the first nine months of this year to DM1.53bn (Dollars 900m), helped by group net profits of DM70m in the third quarter, the troubled German-based motor group announced yesterday. Earnings of DM177m at the Volkswagen AG parent company in the three months to the end of September reduced the deficit there to DM768m, compared with DM946m at the half-way mark and a profit of DM289 in the comparable part of 1992, when group earnings were DM549m. Although the improvement had long been signalled through informal monthly reports from Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, the news was well received on the Frankfurt stock exchange. VW shares rose by sharply in early trading, leading a short-lived surge in the DAX index of leading stocks, and slipped later to close DM3.30 higher at DM395. A suggestion from a member of the supervisory board that the group should pay no dividend, compared with DM2 last year, came after the market closed. In a letter to shareholders, the company attributed most of the group loss to difficulties in the Spanish market, and 'the high investment costs and advance payments for new models' which had led to profit problems at Seat, its Spanish subsidiary. The letter gave no further details, although VW had earlier forecast a DM1.25bn deficit at Seat for the full year. Executives at Audi, the quality car subsidiary, last week forecast heavy losses for 1993 after a half-way deficit of almost DM200m. Group production worldwide had fallen 16.3 per cent in the first nine months to 2.19m vehicles; deliveries to dealers were down 15.4 per cent at 2.16m and deliveries to customers were 12.5 per cent lower at 2.33m. Turnover was 11.4 per cent lower at DM56.4bn compared with DM63.6bn in 1992. Only Skoda, the Czech brand, managed to increase unit sales, showing a 13 per cent improvement to 158,000. Volkswagen marque deliveries were 11 per cent lower, Audi slumped 26 per cent while Seat slid 16.5 per cent. The group maintained its leading market share in western Europe in spite of a slip to 16.4 per cent from 17.5 per cent a year earlier, and a 19.4 per cent slump in deliveries to customers. Its share of the German market, where sales slid 22 per cent, declined 0.7 percentage points to 28.5 per cent.</p>

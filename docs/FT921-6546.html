			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Setback for Canadian resource companies TWO Canadian resource companies, Repap and Westar Mining, have reported large 1991 losses, but they are looking to a lower Canadian dollar and firmer world markets to bring an improvement this year and in 1993. Repap Enterprises, one of North America's biggest coated paper producers with mills in New Brunswick and Wisconsin, reported a 1991 loss of CDollars 180m (USDollars 151.2m), or CDollars 2.90 a share, including CDollars 30m special charges. This compares with a profit of CDollars 3.1m, or 13 cents, in 1990. Revenues were CDollars 1.06bn, down 13 per cent. Half the loss came in the fourth quarter when market conditions led to temporary shutdowns. About one-quarter of Repap's business is making softwood craft pulp for the US and other markets. The Canadian paper mills also export most of their output to the US. Since the end of 1991, the Canadian dollar has declined about four basis points to about 84 US cents and pulp prices have risen from USDollars 480 a tonne to USDollars 540. Repap and other producers seek a 7.5 per cent increase on April 1 to USDollars 580. Firming markets and the lower dollar should help Repap this year, although it might not return to profitability till 1993, analysts said. Westar Mining lost CDollars 62.2m, or CDollars 3.66, on revenues of CDollars 457m in 1991, against a loss of CDollars 4.4m, or 49 cents, on revenues of CDollars 446m in 1990. The company has been hit by lower coal prices and higher mining costs. Westar, British Columbia's biggest coal producer, is negotiating to restructure its CDollars 336m debt. It shipped 9m tonnes in 1991, up 6 per cent on 1990. Its market is mainly Japan and a lower a dollar will help in 1992. Westar Group, which owns 66 per cent of Westar Mining, is selling its forest products affiliate. Quebecor, the communications group, through its printing subsidiary is planning to buy 60 per cent of Nadco Directory, a mid-sized US printer of directories, from BCE. The price was not disclosed. The US firm has annual sales of about USDollars 70m. BCE, holding company for Bell Canada and Northern Telecom, will retain 40 per cent. Quebecor Printing is North America's second biggest commercial printer. It bought the late Robert Maxwell's graphics business in the US two years ago and has completed several other acquisitions since then, including one in Mexico. BCE is moving out of printing to concentrate on its communications and equipment business, plus a Canadian financial services subsidiary. It has taken 60 per cent control of SHL Systemhouse, an international computer systems integrator, meshing Systemhouse operations with its own telecommunications business.</p>

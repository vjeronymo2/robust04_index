			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO FRIENDS, 10 EVENTS;  </P> <P> JOHNSON OUTLASTED YANG 30 YEARS AGO IN OLYMPIC DECATHLON  </P> <P> Accompanied by thunder and lightning, two athletes completed a two-day struggle  for a gold medal that is as well remembered for the athletes' unique  relationship as it is for their magnificent struggle.  </P> <P> It was the decathlon at the Rome Olympics, Sept. 5-6, 1960. Thirty years ago  today.  </P> <P> Two athletes, two countries . . . but the same university, the same coach.  </P> <P> Rafer Johnson, a UCLA graduate, was the heavy favorite. He was 25 and just off  a world record-breaking performance at the U.S. Olympic trials at Eugene, Ore.,  where he'd broken the world record before the end of the ninth event.  </P> <P> Yang Chuan-Kwang, called C.K. by most people, was a 27-year-old UCLA freshman  from Taiwan who had trained for two years almost daily with Johnson and under  UCLA track coach Elvin "Ducky" Drake.  </P> <P> When it all came down to two stormy, summer days in Rome, Johnson was the  winner because he wouldn't fold in the stretch of the final event, the 1,500  meters. Yang lost, he says today, because he wound up in the wrong 1,500 meter  heat -- with Johnson.  </P> <P> The day Johnson won his final decathlon -- he never competed again -- was  arguably one of track and field's most memorable days. On the same day Johnson  and Yang were waging the final hours of their decathlon, Herb Elliott of  Australia ran away from a great 1,500-meter field and set a world record,  3:35.6, that would last for seven years. And Otis Davis of Los Angeles, in a  photo finish, won the 400-meter final in 44.9, another world record.  </P> <P> But seldom had two athletes, tethered so tightly to each other's aspirations as  these two, competed so fiercely on such a stage. Some historians went back to  the 1924 Paris Olympics for a comparison, when boxers Joe Salas and Jackie  Fields, representing not only the United States but the Los Angeles Athletic  Club as well, wound up in the gold medal bout at featherweight.  </P> <P> Rafer Johnson came to UCLA from Kingsburg, Calif., a San Joaquin Valley town  where his father, Lewis Johnson, found work as a railroad section hand, at a  peach cannery and in an animal food processing plant.  </P> <P> At the age of 14, Johnson watched another San Joaquin Valley Olympic decathlon  champion, Bob Mathias, win a decathlon at nearby Tulare. Studying the  competition, Johnson figured he could beat half the athletes in the field and  he hadn't even gone out for track at Kingsburg High yet.  </P> <P> He won a decathlon as a high school senior while being recruited by virtually  every football coach on the West Coast. None of them won. Ducky Drake, the UCLA  track coach, did.  </P> <P> "I just had a great rapport with Coach Drake, and wanted to compete for him,"  Johnson says today. "I wanted to play football, too, and Red Sanders and I  talked a lot about it. But I just couldn't fit it in. In 1955 it was the Pan  American Games, in 1956 it was the Melbourne Olympics . . . "  </P> <P> Yang was a teen phenom in Taiwan. A member of the Takasago ethnic group, which  inhabited the island of Taiwan for centuries before the Chinese arrived, Yang  caught the eye of several officials of the Taiwan national track and field  federation, who raised funds and sent him to the U.S. to train.  </P> <P> He spent more than a year in UCLA extension classes, mastering English, before  enrolling as a freshman in 1958.  </P> <P> Suddenly, Drake had the world's two best decathlon performers on his track,  every day. Drake, who died at 85 in 1988, was a UCLA institution. When he  enrolled at UCLA as a freshman in the 1920s, the campus was on Vermont Ave.,  six years before the move to Westwood.  </P> <P> When he coached, he coached them together. When they competed, he coached them  separately, from the first row of the stands. Sportswriters covering the 1960  Games were fascinated at watching first Johnson visiting privately with Drake,  exchanging whispers, Yang waiting patiently a few yards away, for his turn.  </P> <P> "Before the 1,500 at Rome," Johnson said recently, "Ducky told me: 'You've got  to run the race of your life, Rafe, because C.K. is going to run the race of  his life.' He handled that situation wonderfully. To this day, neither C.K. nor  I know which one of us he favored, if he did. That's why we've stayed so close  all these years."  </P> <P> Johnson came to Rome in 1960 as the decathlon's premier performer. Track and  Field News called his 8,683-point performance in the trials "staggering." With  a 233-foot, 3-inch javelin throw, his first throw in the ninth event, he broke  the world record of the Soviet Union's Vasily Kuznetzov (who would finish third  in Rome). His final total surpassed Kuznetzov's by 326 points.  </P> <P> Few noticed, however, that Yang, too, broke the old world record, by 69 points.  </P> <P> Today, Johnson, 55, is the volunteer president of California Special Olympics,  funded by the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., Foundation. He has two salaried jobs, as  spokesman for the Hershey Track and Field Program and for Reebok USA.  </P> <P> He competed at 210 to 215 pounds but today, playing lots of racquetball and  tennis, he's a lean 190. He lives in Sherman Oaks with his wife, Elizabeth, and  children Jennifer, 17, and Joshua, 15. He was selected to light the Olympic  flame at the Coliseum to open the 1984 Games.  </P> <P> Yang, 57, lives in both Kao Hsiung, Taiwan, where he is executive director and  head coach of the country's track and field training center, and Thousand Oaks.  His wife, Daisy, whom he met at UCLA, lives at the family home in Thousand  Oaks. The Yangs have two sons, C.K., Jr., 26, and Cedric, 30.  </P> <P> Yang lives in Thousand Oaks for months at a time, following major Asian and  other international competitions.  </P> <P> Johnson never competed in sports again. Although he'd never played college  football, the Rams chose him in the NFL draft, as a defensive back. The Rams  offered him a $10,000 contract, big money then, and he declined.  </P> <P> Yang not only continued as a decathlete, he put the world record nearly out of  sight in 1963, with a 9,131-point performance. Yang's mastery of the fiberglass  vaulting pole (he briefly held the world vault record at 16-3 1/2) was one  reason the decathlon scoring tables were revised.  </P> <P> Rome would prove his best chance at an Olympic gold medal. He was eighth at the  1956 Olympics, second in Rome and fifth in 1964.  </P> <P> Both recently discussed their 1960 Rome memories, Johnson in an interview at  his Santa Monica Special Olympics office, Yang by phone from Taiwan.  </P> <P> RAFER JOHNSON  </P> <P> "I can't believe it's been 30 years. I told my wife the other day the 30-year  mark was coming up soon, and she couldn't believe it either. I think about Rome  so much, I forget how long ago it really was.  </P> <P> "My goal in those days, competing against C.K., was to try to keep him from  annihilating me in his two best events, the vault and the 1,500, and then I  would try to annihilate him in my two best events and his two worst events, the  shot and discus.  </P> <P> "If all other things were roughly equal, I'd win. But they seldom are in the  decathlon, so we were always pretty close to each other. In Rome, when the  second day started, the first event was the 110-meter hurdles and I ran an  awful race. I hit the second hurdle very hard and didn't recover. It was the  worst hurdles race of my career.  </P> <P> "I always figured if I had a good hurdle race, I would win any decathlon. Now,  I had a 55-point lead over C.K. after the first day, but blew it all with that  horrible hurdles (Johnson ran 15.3, Yang 14.6. Johnson's lifetime best was  13.8) I needed something extra.  </P> <P> "Really, at no time was I confident of winning in Rome. In 1956, I was the  world record holder in Melbourne, and Milt Campbell came along, had two  fantastic days, and beat me.  </P> <P> "On the first day, C.K. had had a bad shotput, which he almost always did. The  worst rainfall was on the first day, and he fouled a couple of times and had  trouble gripping the wet shot. So I buried him pretty good (51-10 3/4 to 43-8  3/8) there, but that was before my hurdles race.  </P> <P> "I've thought of that hurdles race, the first event on the second day, many  times. I didn't warm up properly. With the storms the day before, there were  long delays. I didn't get back to the village until something like 2 a.m. I was  wiped out.  </P> <P> "So when we lined up for the hurdles, I'm thinking in the back of my mind:  'Conserve energy.' It was the worst thing I could do, the worst kind of  attitude. Afterward, I went over and talked to Ducky and he told me: 'Keep your  head up. This is like life, one event at a time. Forget about it and get on  with it.'  </P> <P> "I buried C.K. in the next event, the discus (159-1 to 130-8 1/2) and got some  of it back, but I was still depressed over the hurdles.  </P> <P> "C.K.'s best event, the vault, was coming up and I knew if I had another poor  effort there -- it was a weak event for me -- I might not catch him in the  1,500. The javelin followed the vault, but we were fairly close there.  </P> <P> "Well, I got my career best in the vault, 13-5 3/8 (Yang did 14-1 1/4), and for  the first time I felt OK.  </P> <P> "In the 1,500, we both wound up in the same heat, which was very good for me. I  needed to stay within 10 seconds of C.K. to win it, and I planned to stick to  him like a buddy in combat. I had one other advantage, and I don't think C.K.  knew this at the time -- this was my last decathlon. I was prepared to run as  fast as I had to in this last race of my life."  </P> <P> And he did. In the cool night air, before 50,000 in the Olympic Stadium,  Johnson stayed two strides behind Yang, who tried but failed to pull away with  two separate sprints over the final 300 meters.  </P> <P> At the finish, they collapsed into each other's arms.  </P> <P> Talking of the 1,500, Yang said: "I knew he would never let go of me unless he  collapsed. I knew he would win. He is that way."  </P> <P> C.K. YANG  </P> <P> "Thirty years? It seems like only yesterday! I have films of some of the  competition on video and I still watch them. It doesn't seem so long ago when I  look at the films.  </P> <P> "There were two turning points for me, the shotput and the 1,500.  </P> <P> "The rain was really bad, especially the first day. It rained hard for three  hours, and when they started to dry the place up, the starting blocks for the  400 were under water. The shot was a terrible event for me and having to put a  wet one made it even worse.  </P> <P> "My first put was a foul, then it started raining hard again. The shot was so  slippery I had to concentrate on just getting off a fair put, let alone a good  one. I was afraid I'd foul on every put if I wasn't careful.  </P> <P> "You know, I took some Taiwan athletes to Rome for an international meet in  1987 and it rained hard then, too. It made me think of that day, of the trouble  I had with the shot.  </P> <P> "I figured I had an outside chance to win after nine events . . . until I found  out Rafe and I were in the same 1,500 heat. I knew he'd stay right with me, no  matter how fast I ran. If we'd been in separate heats, I'd have won the gold  medal, not Rafer.  </P> <P> "Rafe and I loved competing against each other. We needed each other, in a way.  In one of the practices before the Games in Rome, Rafe's pole broke during a  vault and he somersaulted in the air and landed awkwardly, on his back.  </P> <P> "He was OK, but the first thing I thought was: 'Oh, no -- I don't want to win  this without Rafe in the competition!'  </P> <P> "It was a remarkable time for all three of us. Same school, same coach,  different nations. It was a unique relationship, like a father and two sons.  And not once did Ducky ever show favoritism to either of us."  </P></p>

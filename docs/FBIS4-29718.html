			<p>BFN     [Text] Police have arrested a Pakistani and are hunting  another on suspicion that they were involved in a plot to harm  the Nepalese Crown Prince at the Asian Institute of Technology  (AIT) in Pathum Thani on Sunday evening [19 June].    Crown Prince Dipendra Bin Brikram Shadey, 22, arrived in  Thailand on Sunday to attend a four-day geography course until  June 23 at the AIT before beginning his official visit from June  24-27.    The two suspects, identified as Mohamad Javet and Shakil  Ammad, on Sunday allegedly hired a passenger pick-up truck to  the AIT where they told the reception office they were the  prince's guests.    Security officers asked the suspects to show their  passports.  Javet claimed he did not have it with him and left in a car  parked nearby purportedly to get his passport.    The security officers became suspicious and contacted Khlong  Luang District police to come and arrest the remaining suspect,  Shakil Ammad.    Ammad was taken for questioning at the district police  station.    Ammad claimed to be an engineer with a well-known  construction company. But the company when contacted by police  investigators, denied the suspect's name was on its list of  employees.    Ammad was intensively interrogated throughout yesterday  after  the Police Department ordered Khlong Luang police to urgently  investigate the case.    Police manning checkpoints have been ordered to be on the  alert to prevent the other suspect still at large from fleeing.    Police said they had "hard evidence" to support their belief  that the two suspects were involved in a plot to harm the  Nepalese Crown Prince.    According to police information, Javet had been in Thailand  for several days while Ammad arrived in Bangkok on Saturday.</p>

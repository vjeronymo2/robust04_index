			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Takis Dhiamandis from Gjirokaster] </F>   [Text] The Greek minority organization in Albania, Omonoia,  is trying to straighten out its internal issues and change its  profile following tension caused by the bloody incident at an  Albanian military camp in Episkopi on 10 April.    A few days after the incident, Albanian authorities began  arresting Omonoia members, including people who had previously  been involved only in provocative or inflammatory statements in  Greek media. In most houses the Albanian police claim they  discovered propaganda material from various North Ipirote  organizations active in Greece in support of North Ipiros'  independence or autonomy.    And it is not just this. The Albanian Government, indirectly  so far, has described Omonoia as a terrorist organization, a  description that has already been used in several progovernment  or nationalistic press reports.  <H5>  Ten Decisions </H5>   These facts forced Omonoia's leadership to make some  decisions. In its first meeting last week, the new general  council made 10 decisions, three of which concerned Omonoia's  image in the outside world, the other decisions concerned  procedural issues. Specifically it decided:    1. The organization will separate from every association or  organization by North Ipirotes outside Albania. These  associations will be asked not to get involved in internal  Omonoia issues.    2. Omonoia members must have the discipline to release  statements to the mass media that are in line with the positions  adopted by the organization. To represent Omonoia or express  the organization's views, they must be authorized by the general  presidium.    3. The organization will dispatch messages to the Greek mass  media -- particularly television channels such as Mega and  Antenna -- to avoid misleading reports on what is happening to  the Greek minority.    This message will also be sent to Government spokesman  Evangelos Venizelos, the Foreign Ministry, etc. Omonoia  President Sotirios Kiriazatis intends to give a news conference  in Tirana soon to brief the Albanian mass media, and through  them the political parties and the Albanian people, about  Omonoia's views on the Greek minority's position and role within  Albanian society, in order to avoid being misunderstood or  becoming an object of exploitation by anyone.</p>

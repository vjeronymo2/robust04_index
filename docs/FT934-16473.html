			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Amstrad Amstrad is barely recognisable from the apparently dead-end company Mr Alan Sugar tried to take private a year ago. The dividend has been restored, albeit at a modest level. Cash amounts to very nearly 30p a share, the price at which Mr Sugar pitched his offer. Even allowing for the seasonal demands on working capital, Amstrad has Pounds 100m to invest in new projects. That alone justifies the shareholders' decision to reject Mr Sugar's proposition. How he and the new chief executive choose to use this financial muscle will determine how much more than the offer price Amstrad is worth. The acquisition last month of Dancall, the Danish mobile phone manufacturer, provides an opening into cellular telephony. Like home computers and satellite dishes, digital mobile phones look like a technology on the verge of a mass market and therefore susceptible to the Amstrad treatment. Since the big service providers are paying subsidies to keep the retail price of digital handsets down, a low-cost manufacturer might expect a fair hearing. Whether that would extend to giving Amstrad a share of subscription revenues  -as Mr Sugar hopes - is more doubtful. Either way, the project turns on Amstrad undercutting established manufacturers such as Motorola and Nokia. Since their operating margins are anything but fat, Amstrad will have to find manufacturing efficiencies or technological short-cuts overlooked by the competition. Given Mr Sugar's record in other markets it would be foolish to dismiss his chances of success. But cellular phones looks a much more difficult target than home computers in the mid-1980s.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) on Wednesday [9 March] demanded that the  Justice Ministry submit statements from a former vice president  of Kajima, Shinji Kiyoyama, to a parliamentary panel in an  apparent bid to block an arrest of a former construction  minister for alleged bribery.    The LDP's requests, made at the House of Representatives  Steering Committee, also include questioning former Fair Trade  Commission (FTC) Chairman Setsuo Umezawa as a witness.    Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who left the  LDP earlier Wednesday, could be arrested as early as Thursday  for his alleged receipt of a 10 million yen bribe from  construction giant Kajima Corp., Diet sources said.    The committee brought the prospect of Nakamura's arrest  closer when it met Wednesday to listen to Justice Minister Akira  Mikazuki and a top ministry official concerning the case, the  sources said.    The LDP, however, questioned the way prosecutors are  charging  Nakamura and criticized a prosecutor's reported assault case  against a suspect in connection with investigations into a  corruption scandal involving contractors.    Committee Chairman Keiwa Okuda also called for the ministry  to turn in a "framework" of Kiyoyama's statements. The ministry  refrained from giving an immediate answer.    Okuda told the session the legislature needs to reach a  decision as soon as possible, the sources said.    Nakamura, 44, a member of the House of Representatives, is  suspected of accepting the 10 million yen bribe in January 1992.    The closed committee meeting, which began shortly after  midday, reviewed documents supplied by the Justice Ministry  detailing the allegations against Nakamura as well as relevant  legal provisions, the Diet sources said.    Mikazuki and the head of the ministry's Criminal Affairs  Bureau, Mamoru Norisada, attended the meeting.    Mikazuki told the committee that Nakamura has rejected  repeated requests to turn himself in and may destroy evidence  related to the case.    Committee sources quoted Norisada as saying prosecutors now  have enough evidence of Nakamura's involvement in the case,  including statements from Kiyoyama, 67, who was arrested again  Tuesday on suspicion of giving the 10 million yen to Nakamura.    Nakamura allegedly received the money as a reward for using  his influence to help prevent the FTC from lodging a criminal  complaint with the prosecution against contractors for  bid-rigging in Saitama Prefecture.    Kiyoyama allegedly asked Nakamura, who was a senior member  of  the LDP's construction lobby, to pressure the FTC not to file a  complaint with prosecutors against a bid-rigging cartel  involving Kajima and 65 other construction firms.    Norisada told the committee that the FTC had attempted to  carry through criminal proceedings against the contractors, but  Nakamura had pressed it to abandon the attempts.    Norisada was quoted as saying that Nakamura continued to  demand that the FTC abandon the case despite the commission's  repeated refusals.    Committee sources also said that Norisada told the committee  the 10 million yen Nakamura allegedly accepted was a "large sum,  different from sums normally given on special occasions like New  Year."    If the prosecutors' request is approved by the committee,  the  lower house is expected to hold a plenary session as early as  Thursday to decide whether to give the go-ahead to Nakamura's  arrest, political sources said.    Parties within the ruling coalition and the opposition  Japanese Communist Party are expected to agree to the arrest of  Nakamura, the sources said.    LDP head Yohei Kono said Tuesday the LDP will not pursue  party interests in considering the prosecutors' request to  arrest Nakamura.    On Tuesday, the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  asked the lower house to decide on the request.    Diet permission is required for the arrest of  parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet  is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late  January.    Prosecutors applied Tuesday for a warrant for Nakamura from  the Tokyo District Court, which sent a document to the cabinet  urging it to apply for Diet permission on Nakamura's arrest.    Nakamura's lawyers have said he is determined to "fight with  prosecutors," even if he is arrested.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Serdar Turgut and Mihrishah Safa: "A U.S. </F> Suggestion for Violation of the Embargo"]    [Text] Washington-London--The U.S. Administration has drawn  up a plan and submitted it to Ankara in the form of a "nonpaper"  on flushing the oil in the pipeline between Karkuk and  Yumurtalik. The plan indicates that the United States may agree  to the withdrawal of all the 12 million barrels of oil from the  pipeline on the condition that Ankara "temporarily" use 100  percent of the profit from its sale.    Considering Iraq's sensitive approach on the embargo,  however, Ankara wishes to resolve the pipeline problem in a way  that will also be acceptable to Baghdad. Any consensus between  Turkey and the UN Security Council must also take into account  Baghdad's approach. It will be recalled that Iraq has rejected  the UN condition for the sale of $1.6 billion worth of oil on  grounds that it infringes on its sovereignty.    Only 3.8 million barrels of the oil in the pipeline belongs  to Turkey. There is no problem on how Turkey's share will be  used after it is drained. However, 60 percent of the profit to  be made from the sale of the remaining 8.2 million barrels of  oil will have to be transferred to the fund which will be under  UN control. Another 30 percent will be registered with the UN as  profit. Meanwhile, the remaining 10 percent will be used to  provide humanitarian aid to Iraq.    The United States wishes to block any approach that may be  regarded as violating the embargo on Iraq. In view of that, it  seems that it is prepared to have Turkey use the profit from the  sale of the 8.2 million barrels of oil and pay it back to the UN  later on the basis of the 60-30-10 percent formula. However,  Britain has informed Washington that it is opposed to that  approach. It called for the use of only 60 percent of the profit  to be made from the sale of all the oil in the pipeline.    Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs Bilgin Unan has  held talks with British officials on the pipeline problem. He  has left Britain for Moscow after being informed that London  will agree in principle to the removal of the oil in the  pipeline.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Tom Wilkie article: "Scientists Must Halt Killer Virus </F> Project"]    [Text] Government safety inspectors halted research at  Birmingham University because of dangers that viruses  genetically engineered to cause cancer in humans could have  escaped from a laboratory.    The research, taking place in the Department of Cancer  Studies at the university's medical school, involved putting  cancer-causing genes into a virus similar to the one that causes  the common cold. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive  [HSE] were concerned that arrangements to contain the viruses  might not be adequate.    Although the chances of an accident were small, a virus  genetically modified in that way could infect workers in the  laboratory and trigger cancer or, if it escaped entirely, put  the public at risk.    This is the first time such tough action has been taken by  the executive since regulations covering genetic engineering  came in in 1992. The university's safety procedures will be  reviewed by the Government's Advisory Committee on Genetic  Manipulation.    Last week, the executive served a formal "improvement  notice"  on the university, giving it until 7 April to review the safety  of all work being done in the Department of Cancer Studies.    In December, Professor Phillip Gallimore, of the Department  of Cancer Studies, and the university itself were served with a  "prohibition notice," stopping the research immediately.    According to an executive spokesman, "the inspector had  fears  that the level of containment (of the viruses) was not  appropriate to the degree of risk. A prohibition notice is  issued where the inspector believes there is, or will be, a risk  of serious personal injury. An improvement notice requires  employers to take remedial action on specific breaches of the  law within a specified time limit."    Although many large companies routinely use genetic  engineering, one regulator said that industry was "squeaky  clean" compared with academia. Nearly four years ago, Professor  John Beringer, who heads a government advisory committee on the  safety of genetic engineering, predicted that university  laboratories would be the most troublesome to police for safety.    In 1978, Janet Parker, who worked at the university, died  after a smallpox virus escaped from another laboratory there.    Professor David Westbury, Vice Principal of Birmingham  University, said last night: "Even though research on cancer is  a vitally important area of medical research, safety has to be  our over-riding concern. We have already taken action in  response to the requirements of the HSE and we shall continue to  work with the inspectors until they are satisfied."    According to David Harrison, the university's safety  officer,  the researchers, funded by the Cancer Research Campaign, wanted  to isolate oncogenes -- those implicated in causing cancer --  and insert them in human cells which they had cultured in the  laboratory. By studying the effect of the new gene they hope to  gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that cause cancer.    The researchers used adenoviruses as the vehicle to transfer  the genes. The best known member of the adenovirus family is  that which causes the common cold.    As an additional safety measure, researchers had altered the  virus so that it could not replicate inside the cells which it  infected, said Mr. Harrison. He emphasised that research safety  had been reviewed within the university: "All of our genetic  modification work had gone through a committee and had been  carefully considered."    Britain acted early to ensure the safety of genetic  engineering and its regulations have been taken as a model by  other countries.    However, a House of Lords select committee has recommended  that some regulations should be scrapped, claiming they are too  heavy a bureaucratic burden for Britain's fledgling  biotechnology industry.    Larger companies maintain that safety has to be an integral  part of any successful industry and that commercial goals do not  conflict with that.</p>

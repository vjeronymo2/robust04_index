			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EX-OCEANSIDE TEACHER GUILTY OF MOLESTATION  </P> <P> An Oceanside High School history teacher was found guilty Friday of six counts  of statutory rape and child molestation by a Vista Superior Court jury.  </P> <P> Leonard Palos de la Rosa, 32, who is on unpaid leave from the school district,  will be sentenced March 3.  </P> <P> The jury deliberated nearly two days before reaching its verdict about 3:30  p.m. Friday, finding Palos de la Rosa guilty on all counts in a continuing  affair with a 16-year-old girl, now 17 and transferred to another high school.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Caryn Rosen said after the verdict was returned that she was  "pleased and happy for the victim" and hoped that the teen-ager "can put this  behind her and get on with her life now."  </P> <P> Palos de la Rosa admitted having a friendship with the girl but denied a sexual  liaison with her. He said he considered her a student, a friend and a member of  the family.  </P> <P> But Rosen, in opening statements in the trial, contended that Palos de la Rosa  had "acted upon a crush" the teen-ager had confessed. Rosen said the teacher  had "stepped over the bounds and had sexual relations with a student and a  minor."  </P> <P> Oceanside Police Officer Scott Gillis, brother-in-law of Palos de la Rosa,  testified during the trial that Palos de la Rosa had admitted to his family  that he had had sexual relations with the teen-ager.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Richard Muir said he could not speak for his client about  whether the verdict would be appealed or not, but said "there are significant  issues in the case that need to be looked into."  </P> <P> "In light of the totality of the evidence," Muir said, "the jury's verdict  seems not unreasonable."  </P> <P> Muir, in defending Palos de la Rosa, argued that the teen-ager had developed a  crush on her teacher and had imagined the sexual consummation. Palos de la Rosa  testified that he had maintained a close friendship with the girl but denied  any sexual wrongdoing.  </P></p>

The trial, which was scheduled to  start Tuesday, had to be delayed because of a shortage of judges. It was  rescheduled for Sept. 5. Jones was arrested April 8 and charged with possession  of 18 grams of cocaine when police acted on a tip and raided a recording studio  in Kingston. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

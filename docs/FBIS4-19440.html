			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Robert </F> Hochner in Vienna -- live]    [Text] [Hochner] I now welcome Foreign Minister Alois Mock  here in the studio. Dr. Mock, I do not think I need to  emphasize that this is a bitter time for anyone trying to  mediate and advocate principles of humanity and peace in this  war [in Bosnia-Herzegovina]. After what happened in Gorazde, is  there still a way out?    [Mock] One must never stop searching for new ways in such  tragedies, especially since there have always been proposals for  a different course. Your U.S. correspondent quite rightly said  that this is aggression constantly yiedled to, soemthing openly  stated in mid-April of 1992 by CSCE. Why should the aggressor  give up, withdraw, or keep his promise if he keeps getting  accepted and his breach of promise is rewarded with new  negotiations? I think you have to realize that the way to deal  with an aggressor -- and we think we have learned something from  World War II -- is to take diplomatic measures first, political  means. But then, "all means," as the United Nations Charter  says, including military means, should be adopted. In this  case, it happened the other way around: Those against whom the  aggression was directed -- originally the Slovenes, Croats, and  Bosnians -- were deprived of the possibility to defend  themselves by the arms embargo. This is against the UN Charter.  The UN Charter clearly says that the entire community of states  is to help fight aggression and that no one can be forced to  enter a war. If this is not possible, then every nation has the  right to defend itself. These nations were deprived of this  right. Now we are paying the price with new casualties, new  refugees, and a complete derogation of principles. I must say  that this also involves risking the reputation the United States  has acquired with special envoy Charles Redman and his mediating  between the Croats and Bosnians being strained and lost soon.    [Hochner] What could the next step be? One possibility  would be -- and this does not seem very likely -- that NATO and  the United States suddenly resort to military severity and bomb  the Serbs back to the negotiating table. This will not happen.  The second possibility is that the United Nations deploys an  adequate number of combat forces to the country with a combat  mission -- that it has not got yet -- in order to intervene on  the Muslim side. This will not happen either. What is still  possible in this difficult situation?    [Mock] Even at the risk of repeating myself: I have never  considered general invasion and intervention possible. We have  thought -- and therefore it also comes as a disappointment to us  -- that if a city is declared a security zone, military  intervention can become necessary to protect this security zone.  Why is Sarajevo a functioning security zone now, more or less  the first time in two years? Because the threat of military  strikes was meant seriously. I think that Sarajevo will be  endangered again as of tomorrow.    [Hochner] The United Nations not only declared Sarajevo a  security zone, but also towns such as Tuzla, Srebrenica, and  Gorazde. Was it not politically naive to think that the Serbs,  who want to have a compact whole territory for the future Serbia  in Bosnia, will tolerate Muslim enclaves in the middle of their  territory?    [Mock] I do not think this was naive, because we have seen  that it works. Austria was the first country to propose  security zones in the Security Council -- Bihac, Gorazde,  Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Travnik. We used the security zone for the  Kurds in northern Iraq as a model. Saddam Husayn has accepted  this. How would the United Nations have known that the  opponents in this war -- the Serbs -- would be even worse than  Saddam Husayn? I think that was a realistic assumption. But it  has never been handled with consistency. One resolution after  the other was adopted; there are five Security Council  resolutions saying that if humanitarian aid is obstructed, it  can be protected by military means. There is a Security Council  resolution saying that if a security zone is attacked, it can be  defended by military means. Why should the aggressor think that  any of this is true if there are never any consequences taken?  In the cases where there were consequences, like in Sarajevo,  these have had an effect. These consequences would be more  effective today since even Vitaliy Churkin and Andrey Kozyrev  are saying very clearly -- and this must be mentioned in  acknowledgment of Russian policy -- that the way the aggressor  is acting is irresponsible.    [Hochner] You said there were consequences in the case of  Sarajevo. There have been consequences in Gorazde as well --  two very limited and not very successful attacks. Does this not  mean that an attack by NATO, if it is carried out, must be much  more massive, more carefully directed, and more successful to  achieve the consequences you have been talking about?    [Mock] Yes, of course. If your house is attacked by  criminals and the police come along, they cannot ask: Will one  or two policemen be enough? They have the responsibility to  provide adequate police protection that not only protects  citizens from criminals but also protects the policemen  themselves.    [Hochner] The UN secretary general says this confusion is  the superpowers' fault, the Americans say the Europeans are to  blame, the Europeans say it is the European Union, and the  European Union says it is the United Nations. Should not all  these responsibilities be taken together and one organization or  one group of states be given the right to decide in order to  enable decisions -- if they are taken -- to be realized quickly  and consistently?    [Mock] This is right. I think the United Nations has  enormous weaknesses, which I have frequently mentioned. But you  must not forget that in spite of these difficulties, the United  Nations has saved the lives of thousands of people. But the  United Nations is only as strong as the major countries behind  it, especially in the Security Council. The ultimate  responsibility always lies with these countries.    [Hochner] Thank you very much for the interview.</p>

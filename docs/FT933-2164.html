			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Spain cuts reserve cash requirement THE BANK of Spain yesterday cut the reserve cash requirement it imposes on the banking sector from 3 per cent to 2 per cent, thus freeing some Pta440bn (Pounds 2.2bn) of deposits that had been trapped, interest free, with the bank authority. The cut , which brings the domestic banking sector closer in line with Europe, follows a half a point cut to 10 per cent in the bank's key intervention rate at the begining of this month. It should enable the private banks and saving institutions to lower the cost of borrowing. It will also reduce pressure on the interbank market where the bank has been forced to increase sharply the volume of its routine financing to credit institutions. Liquidity on the interbank market has been very narrow. Currency uncertainties have left the institutions short of pesetas and the strong demand for funding has hampered the central bank's monetary policy. Potential income from the funds freed by the latest cut represents nearly 4 per cent of the total pre-tax profit of domestic banks last year. However the impact of the cut on this year's bank results should be more muted because the sector, although under pressure to increase its lending, is nervous of increasing bad debts. 'The gain for the banks is that they will be able to use the new funds to lower their lending while keeping their balance sheets undamaged,' said Mr Jose Manuel Arrojo, banking analyst of the Madrid securities house, AB Asesores. Several of Spain's financial institutions have in recent weeks cut their preferential lending rates to below 10 per cent but they have maintained credit for all but top clients at a minimum of about 16.5 per cent. In August non-performing loans grew by some Pta35bn to account for 7.4 per cent of all loan portfolios.</p>

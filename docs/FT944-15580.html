			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / London-led operation halts Dollars 10bn international fraud A Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn) bank fraud was prevented by an international police operation led by the Metropolitan Fraud Squad. Details of one of the biggest bank frauds yet attempted emerged yesterday on the eve of the first National Fraud Forum, which brings together police, City regulators and private-sector investigators to discuss how to improve the country's record on fraud prevention and prosecutions. The victim of the fraud attempt was Agricultural Bank of China, one of China's big four banks. It involved the issue by the bank of Dollars 10bn in letters of credit or bank certificates guaranteeing trade payments between two companies. Letters of credit can be traded or used as collateral when raising bank loans. On April 1 last year the Hengshui Central branch of Agricultural Bank issued 200 of these certificates, in the name of United Asia (Group) Corporation, a shell company based in North America, with payment due to Sherwood Investments, of the Bahamas. According to an official with knowledge of the case, the certificates were genuine in that they were signed by two employees of the bank. However, they may have been obtained by deception and their export out of China was also probably illegal. The official said that the perpetrators of the scheme were too greedy. 'If there had been less money at stake, they might have got away with it,' he said. Most of the certificates were taken on a circuitous route through a series of offshore centres to the City, where eventually they were presented to Barclays Bank. Investigators believe that the aim of presenting them to Barclays was to obtain a receipt stating that the certificates had been lodged with the bank. This receipt would then have been used to obtain substantial loans from other banks. However, Barclays had suspicions about the provenance of the certificates and therefore contacted Agricultural Bank's head office and the Bank of England. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities had by July last year become aware of the export of the letters of credit. Messages were sent to all international banks via the Swift electronic funds transfer network, telling these banks that the certificates should not be treated as legal tender. The police in London and New York were alerted. In the next six months, they recovered 193 of the certificates in London. Another six were found in the US and West Indies. One was traced to a bank vault in Switzerland. Mr Lei Ping Wu of Agricultural Bank's London office said that thanks to the actions of the police, his bank had suffered no loss. The individual who presented the certificates to Barclays has disappeared. Several people have been imprisoned in China in connection with the case, including two bank employees. No charges have been laid against anyone outside China. Fraud survey, Pages 33-35</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Arts: The Getty Museum fights on over The Three Graces ruling A High Court Judge, Mr Justice Laws, ruled yesterday that the government had not acted unfairly in its efforts to keep Canova's sculpture of The Three Graces in the UK. But the long saga is not yet over. The Getty Museum of Malibu, California, which petitioned the courts, is to apply to the Court of Appeal in the hope that it will over-rule Justice Laws' decision that there was no need for a judicial review into the actions of heritage secretary Stephen Dorrell. The approach to the Court of Appeal will be made within the next seven days but it could be weeks before the matter is finally settled. The department of National Heritage said yesterday that it will not refuse an export licence until the appeal was resolved. In August, in his first act as heritage secretary, Dorrell added a three month extension to the export deadline. This enabled the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and the National Galleries of Scotland to raise the Pounds 1.8m still needed - from John Paul Getty II and Baron Thyssen - to keep the Three Graces in the UK. The Getty had bought the statue in 1989 for Pounds 7.6m but has been constantly thwarted in its efforts to retrieve it from the UK. A spokesman for the department of National Heritage said yesterday: 'We are pleased the judge has accepted our argument'. Mr Justice Laws awarded most of the costs against the Getty, but with an endowment of more than Dollars 4bn and annual expenditure in excess of Dollars 200m, they should be well within its budget.</p>

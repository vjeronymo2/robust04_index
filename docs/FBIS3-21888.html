The country  cousins of streetwise metropolitan youths are experimenting with  cannabis, Ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines.    In the market towns and cathedral cities of England's  shires,  an underground distribution network has evolved which makes most  substances available.    Michael Levi, professor of criminology at the University of  Wales in Cardiff, said that recognition of drug offending was  "quite low" in the countryside, because statistics depended on  the amount of police activity. "It is invisible, because drugs  squads aren't so likely to operate in rural areas," he said.    One of the few studies took place in East Sussex, where  2,047  schoolchildren were questioned last year at a cost of  &pound;16,000. The Home Office paid most of the bill. Researchers  discovered that a fifth of all pupils aged 14 and 15 had tried  an illicit drug. The proportion was broadly the same in rural  and urban areas. Boys were more involved than girls.    "It is prevalent, it is accessible. Anybody can get it if  they want to," Rosalind Turner, who worked on the study with  East Sussex Drugs Advisory Council, said. Children were  arranging deliveries of drugs to their villages from telephone  booths, "almost like dialling a pizza," she said.    Magic mushrooms and veterinary tranquilisers are more  commonly abused in the countryside, according to the addiction  charity Release. Cannabis has become as common in rural villages  as in the inner cities, and while cocaine's popularity is  spreading, crack is only occasionally brought to the  countryside. East Anglia has a problem of amphetamine abuse.    Particular health problems arise from the abuse of drugs in  the shires. Addicts may have to travel long distances for  advice, or to receive regular supplies of methadone. Those who  inject drugs live long distances from the nearest exchange point  supplying clean needles, vital to prevent the spread of HIV.    The highest rate of drugs seizures in Britain according to  latest figures, (for 1992) is in Greater London (2,849 per  million population). In England, the other highest counties are  Merseyside (1,962), Wiltshire (1,621) and Gloucestershire  (1,428). Scotland has a high rate of drugs seizures,  particularly in Strathclyde (1,966), Central (1,640), Lothian  and Borders (1,586), and Tayside (1,576). In Wales, Dyfed-Powys  has the highest rate of drugs hauls (1,646).    THE TIMES visited three of England's ancient shires,  Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, to discover how  widespread drug use has become.    COPYRIGHT: TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1994</p>

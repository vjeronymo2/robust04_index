			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Abu-Sarhan: "The Cabinet Reshuffle"] </F>   [Text] Market observers noticed on Monday [30 May], that  the price of the dollar has dropped to 350 dinars. Some people  said it was offered for 320 dinars but nobody bought it. In  addition, there has been a visible drop in the prices of all  supplies. This clearly indicates that there is no scarcity of  items, which would force prices up due to increasing demand.  This means these supplies have not been affected by supply and  demand. Otherwise, the prices would have remained stable in  spite of the cabinet reshuffle. At any rate, even if some  changes do occur, they would be slight and not sudden. This  confirms our past arguments that the increase in the price of  the dollar is not the outcome of the blockade or the supplies  that enter the country and the human consumption of these  supplies. Rather, it is our firm conviction that there is an  integral system made up of a group of people who have sold out  to the foreigner. This group represents around 20-30 percent;  70 percent of this misled group has been blinded by greed and a  desire to amass money. The group that makes up the 20-30  percent has foreign links, specifically with Saudi Arabia. This  group manipulates the price of the dollar to bring about such an  increase on the black market.    Therefore, and as a result of observing the financial market  in al-Shurjah, we noticed yesterday, Tuesday [31 May], that a  group of Kurdish traders, who are not well known, started to buy  dollars at any price, paying 420 or 450 dinars, in an open  attempt to raise the price of the dollar.    Here, we hope the security agencies and the Interior  Ministry  will work seriously and closely watch these developments. Had  it not been for God's care for Iraq and its leader, many  unexpected developments would have taken place.    The most important thing about the cabinet reshuffle, apart  from the people's joy and the drop in prices, is that this  reshuffle will make the source of decisions close to the  executive tools, that is, close to the ministries and their  leading personalities.    Another important point is that we should not judge the work  of ministries until at least three months have elapsed, because  the Iraqis are known for their initial rush, which soon  subsides. These three months represent an observation stage to  be followed by a scrutiny stage, which will reveal whether a  certain ministry is really doing its job or is just posing for  television.</p>

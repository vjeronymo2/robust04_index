			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Delors tries to give treaty kiss of life MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, will today begin a campaign to breathe life into the Maastricht treaty to build up momentum ahead of Friday's special EC summit in Brussels. Working with the Belgian Presidency of the EC, Mr Delors will call for closer macro-economic co-operation and a strengthening of the faltering EC 'growth' initiative at a meeting of EC finance ministers today in Luxembourg. The meeting marks the start of an intensive round of European diplomacy which could end on Friday with a decision on the site of a future EC central bank, more openness in the Community, and new 'joint actions' to intensify humanitarian operations in former Yugoslavia and monitor the parliamentary elections in Russia set for December. However, the summit could still be clouded by disagreements over implementation of economic and monetary union. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, yesterday dismissed attempts by some of Britain's European partners to re-establish the Maastricht timetable for a single currency as 'folly'. He also indicated Britain would strongly resist any watering down of the economic convergence criteria for economic and monetary union, saying the criteria - covering such things as relative inflation rates and the size of public sector deficits - were 'desirable in their own right'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, is expected to reinforce that point at today's meeting of Community finance ministers by telling colleagues that the criteria have a role independent of the proposed timetable for a single currency in promoting sustainable economic growth. Elsewhere, the pre-summit mood has been improved by the Bundesbank's unexpected decision to trim short-term interest rates by half a point. However, member states such as Belgium and France remain wary of cutting rates for fear of breaking their link with the D-Mark in spite of the increased flexibility offered by wider 15 per cent fluctuation bands in the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Delors views Friday's summit as a chance to relaunch the Community after months of drift caused by the delay in ratification of Maastricht. He wants EC leaders to agree to closer macro-economic co-operation exploiting the provisions of the treaty. At today's Luxembourg meeting, finance ministers will put the final touches to legislation allowing the second stage of Europeon monetary union to begin on January 1 1994. This would also create the European Monetary Institute, the precursor of the European Central Bank.</p>

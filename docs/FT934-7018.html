			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Unemployment benefit may suffer deep cuts: Leak discloses 'insidious' review of welfare state Unemployment benefit may suffer deep cuts if plans under serious consideration by ministers as part of their efforts to cut public spending are included in next week's Budget. The proposals emerged yesterday after documents outlining the scope of the government's long-term social security review were leaked to the Labour party. They set the scene for a prolonged and bitter row over the future of the welfare state. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the review was 'more insidious and more threatening than the previous Thatcher reviews' and went 'right to the heart of the welfare state'. Labour is expected to launch an attack on the proposed benefit cuts when the government's recently announced legislative programme is debated in the Commons this week. Ministerial resistance to changes in unemployment benefit has been reduced by the recent downward trend in jobless figures, underlined by last week's announcement of the biggest monthly fall in the total for nearly four years. One option being examined is to halve the time for which the 715,000 unemployment benefit claimants are eligible for the Pounds 44.65 a week benefit from a year to six months. If plans for that go through, the unemployed would have to rely on income support, which is pegged at Pounds 44 a week for a single adult but which is means-tested to exclude those with savings of more than Pounds 8,000. The government would need to legislate for such a change, however, providing a potential rallying point for its opponents and risking an embarrassing Commons defeat. Ministers have already indicated that the Budget will include a sharp reduction in the amount of state support given to employers whose staff go on sick leave and a Pounds 500m cut in the cost of state invalidity benefit. Yesterday's developments came as public figures queued up to give chancellor Kenneth Clarke advice on what he should do in his first Budget on November 30, with most agreeing that tax rises would be necessary. Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, said Mr Clarke should crack down on public spending, although he conceded he 'may need to raise taxes a little bit as well'. Mr John Biffen, the former Tory cabinet minister, argued for an extension of the VAT base to include water and transport, as well as other items currently zero-rated. A report written by Mr Bill Robinson, previously special adviser to Mr Norman Lamont, former chancellor, said Mr Clarke had no realistic alternative but to raise taxes in the Budget.

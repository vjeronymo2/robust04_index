			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has not defined critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prematurely for the delta smelt because the Act does not require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion of an economic analysis before the Service can propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat areas. In a critical habitat rulemaking conducted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service defines and proposes critical habitat boundaries, conducts an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impact analysis, takes public comment on the proposed critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat designation and the economic analysis, makes exclusions, if any,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to critical habitat boundaries, and promulgates a final rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary, through the Service, has the discretion to exclude critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat areas based on economics, in accordance with the section 4(b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. The section allows the Secretary to exclude any area from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, provided that exclusion will not result in extinction of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. The Service has properly conducted critical habitat rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the delta smelt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither the Act, nor its regulations, require the Service to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment on revised critical habitat designations where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has excluded areas of proposed critical habitat. The standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking process requires preparation of a proposed rule followed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule. Publishing a draft final rule is not required. The Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledges that the public was allowed to comment in the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described manner in the critical habitat designation for the Northern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spotted Owl, however, the opportunity for public comment was a policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision made specifically for that rulemaking and is not required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has provided ample opportunity for the public to comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the delta smelt critical habitat designation proposals and on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic analysis during prescribed comment periods from October 3 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 3, 1992; March 16 to April 30, 1993, and again from January 27  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to March 11, 1994. Four public hearings also were held to solicit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on the revised proposed critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 41:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter thought the critical habitat designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was flawed since the economic analysis could not properly analyze  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impacts likely to arise from the proposed designation, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Service failed to present any focused or concrete indication of what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific management measures would be pursued. The commenter thought  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public was not able to effectively comment on the critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation due to this inadequacy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Designating critical habitat does not result in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management plan. Specific management measures are identified in a draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recovery Plan that currently is being prepared by the Service, and need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be identified in a proposed critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in the above comment, the Service believes the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was given an opportunity to effectively comment on the critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation and the draft economic analysis. The draft RIA was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for review and provided sufficient detail so that the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could provide meaningful comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 42:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter believes the critical habitat designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is deficient because the Service failed to analyze the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impacts of any particular portion of the Delta.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4 of the Act requires the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into consideration ``The economic impact *&blank;*&blank;* of specifying any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular area as critical habitat.'' The Service may exclude any area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from critical habitat if it is determined that the benefits of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat, unless failure to designate such area will result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extinction of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service believes it has adequately analyzed the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impacts of the Estuary ``area.'' The Act does not require an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency to analyze potential economic impacts for any specific or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular ``area.'' An ``area'' is not limited to particular reaches of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> river, or particular areas of a species' habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 43:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of the Army thought the Service did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiently analyze the economic impacts of designating critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, and did not include adequate economic data. They thought the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service should have included channel dredging activities and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance of flood control levees in the economic analysis, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the economic impacts of potential failure and flooding since maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> might be limited due to critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service believes the economic impacts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designating critical habitat have been sufficiently addressed, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include discussion of dredging and levee maintenance. As discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule to list the delta smelt, and in the revised proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to designate critical habitat for the species, the Service determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the economic impact of restricting activities associated with deep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water navigation channel dredging were attributable to the jeopardy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard imposed by the listing of the delta smelt as a threatened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species. Hence, the economic impacts of these activities can not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with designating critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service did determine that levee maintenance may adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify critical habitat without necessarily jeopardizing the delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt. The economic impacts of restrictions associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction and implementation of these projects have been analyzed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the economic cost or benefit of critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Properly scheduling maintenance and construction activities to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods critical to a species can allow projects to go forward without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurring large economic impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

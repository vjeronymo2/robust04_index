			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Yekaterina Vysotskaya for </F> TASS]    [Text] Minsk 15 April, TASS -- "One should not be afraid  that the foreign capital will turn its back to its Belarussian  [Belarusian] partners because of the agreement with Russia.  Honest investors, for whom partnership with Belarus is a matter  of economy, not politics, have already come to our country, and  the unification of the Belarussian and Russian markets will not  influence those relations," Belarussian Prime Minister  Vyacheslav Kebich said at a news conference.    He pointed out that problems connected with relations  between  Belarus and third countries are not coordinated with Russia.  This is why it is for Belarus to decide whether to take foreign  credits or not.    Responding to the question of journalists about the reaction  of the International Monetary Fund to the signing of the  agreement, Kebich said: "A letter that we received before the  signing of the documents reaffirmed, that the IMF would continue  to cooperate with us. Moreover, the letter asked to decide more  quickly whether we join the rouble zone or not. So, our foreign  partners were also waiting for an answer to the question: Shall  we enter the rouble zone or not?"</p>

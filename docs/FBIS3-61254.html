Taranu, ambassador extraordinary and </F> plenipotentiary of the Republic of Moldova in the Russian  Federation, by V. Perushkin; place and date not given: "`We  Insist on the Withdrawal of the 14th Army'"]    [Text] Of all the wars that erupted on the territory  of the former Union, the war in Moldova was the shortest.  Military operations in this region were suppressed with the  participation of the Russian 14th Army. There is at the present  time a fragile armistice on both banks of the Dniester. Our  correspondent V. Perushkin asked A. Taranu, ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Moldova in  the Russian Federation, how political events would develop in  Moldova in the immediate future.    [Perushkin] Anatol Mihailovic, do you not have the  impression  that all conflicts on the territory of the former Union have  occurred and continue to occur not spontaneously but are a great  bloody game being played according to a single script, the  purpose of which is to unite everyone once again in a single  union?    [Taranu] The point is that the status of diplomat requires  that I be guided exclusively by the facts. I do not, however,  have facts confirming your conjectures. But I agree that many of  the events that are occurring could speculatively be viewed this  way. And I would like to mention here that if Russia is to build  its relations with its immediate neighbors on the basis of  commonly accepted, civilized standards, this presupposes respect  for the sovereignty and independence of the states that have  appeared since the disintegration of the Union. In this case,  despite the long transformation process, the result will be the  most desirable for all without exception.    If, on the other hand, Russia attempts to spread its  influence to its immediate neighbors by methods that were  officially approved in Abkhazia or Moldova, the anti-Russian  mood in the republics will intensify.    [Perushkin] What effect, in your opinion, will the results  of  the elections in Russia have on the political situation in  Moldova?    [Taranu] Of course, both the October events and the results  of the elections in Russia will, of course, be reflected in the  political situation in the countries of the CIS, Moldova  included.    The surprising success of political forces which, generally,  no one had taken seriously before could signify the  consolidation of all conservative blocs in our republic also.  Considering that parliamentary elections on a multiparty basis  are to be held in Moldova on 27 February 1994, I would like to  hope that our democrats would draw the correct conclusions and  not repeat the mistakes made by Russia's democratic forces. In  addition, the election struggle with us is being exacerbated by  the intensifying economic crisis. And the unresolved Dniester  and Gagauz issues are complicating the situation as well.    [Perushkin] Certain Western newspapers are starting to say  that economic assistance should not be channeled only to Russia.  How, in your opinion, will Moldova attract the West's attention?    [Taranu] The extent of the aid to be received by Moldova was  specified prior to the elections in Russia. And even after the  results have been tallied, no abrupt leap forward on this matter  on the part of the West has been observed. We have obtained  credit, which is more or less enabling us to support the  introduction of a national currency. The Moldovan national  currency as of the present is one of the most stable currencies  of the "near abroad" in relation to the dollar. A decline in the  dollar's rate against the lei has been recorded even.    It seems to me that the West would be making a big political  mistake were it not to render Russia the necessary support at  this time in order to strengthen the democratic transformations  there. There should be such assistance, but not at the expense  of other republics, just as, equally, the latter should not  obtain greater assistance at the expense of Russia either.  Russia is today the main economic partner of the former Union  republics. And the fullness and efficiency of economic relations  with other regions will depend on how matters stand as regards  the economic reform here. All of the former, us included, are  interested in Russia standing on its own two feet economically  as quickly as possible.    [Perushkin] The introduction of a national currency has in  many republics been more of a political than an economic step.  Will Moldova not suffer the same fate as Ukraine?    [Taranu] From Russia's viewpoint such a step could be  considered political. From the standpoints of the other  republics, however, it was a forced measure. And it was attended  by the defense of the republics' economic interests. In  introducing at home banknotes of the 1993 sample, Russia in  practice kicked the rest out of the ruble zone. In Moldova the  decision to introduce a national currency had been adopted back  in 1991, but only now could it be implemented, in extremely  inauspicious conditions, what is more. Any currency can function  normally only under conditions of growing production. It is  essential that in 1994 we halt the decline in production and  then organize its gradual upturn. Otherwise couponization or  karbovanization, which are one and the same thing, for that  matter, await us.    [Perushkin] Is there today a problem of the Russian-speaking  population in the republic?    [Taranu] Undoubtedly. But it is considerably less in terms  of  scale than in other republics. Instances of everyday nationalism  are observed in Moldova, but even this is not that widespread.  Our citizenship and language laws have undergone the  corresponding inspection in international institutions and have  been deemed to be perfectly acceptable. An attempt to play on  the anti-Russian mood in Moldova is manifestly doomed to fail,  therefore.    [Perushkin] How, in your opinion, is the presence of the  14th  Army in the Dniester region influencing the situation in the  region?    [Taranu] Our position here is quite categorical. We insist  on  its withdrawal from the republic before 1 July 1994. Many people  are saying that were it not for the 14th Army, the war between  Moldova and the Dniester region would still be going on. Maybe  so. But the situation is aggravated by the fact that the 14th  Army did not strictly maintain its neutrality throughout the  conflict. Materially, politically, and militarily it supported  the policy of the Dniester leaders.    [Perushkin] A compromise between Moldova and the Dniester  region has not, by all accounts, been found. Might not the war  begin once again as soon as the 14th Army withdraws?    [Taranu] I believe not, although the possibility of the  resumption of the military conflict cannot be ruled out in  principle. The events of the first half of 1992 were a stunning  lesson for Chisinau politicians. Even the most unbridled among  them realized that the problem of the Dniester region cannot be  resolved with an assault rifle.    [Perushkin] But what, then, will happen? Moldova's  politicians have recognized that this matter cannot be resolved  militarily, but the leaders of the Dniester region will not  negotiate until the Dniester region acquires republic status.    [Taranu] Compromise is needed. But solving these questions  with the present leaders of the Dniester region is quite  difficult. There has to be a change of policy signboards there.  Whereas this has already happened in Chisinau, everything on the  left bank remains at the 1991 level. We are prepared to solve  the question with the corresponding status of the Dniester  region within the framework of Moldova. This status would afford  an opportunity to remedy the postwar syndrome, and people could  in time recognize that they are all citizens of Moldova. But  today's leaders of the Dniester region will never agree to this.  And one of the main reasons is the fear of losing the benefits  and power that they have today.    [Perushkin] You maintain that there is in the Dniester  region  today a strict totalitarian regime not allowing of different  viewpoints. Where are the guarantees that Moldova's policy will  be different?    [Taranu] You read our newspapers, what they write about  President Snegur. The level of freedom of the press is very  high. Even too high, what is more, I would prefer our  journalists and politicians to express their views in more  civilized fashion. Their opportunity to express their viewpoint  is indisputable. There is none of this in the Dniester region.  The only person who can permit himself to speak is General  Lebed. But it is hard to argue with him: He is backed by tanks.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Contrite leaders try to put gloss on Maastricht EC leaders yesterday drew up a list of ideas aimed at selling the Maastricht treaty to the sceptical citizens of Europe. In contrite mood, the heads of government acknowledged that the EC had failed to explain in simple language what it was doing and why. The British presidency and the European Commission jointly presented proposals which combine pledges for more openness in EC affairs and a new emphasis on 'subsidiarity' - devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate level. They include a mixture of window-dressing and repackaged versions of existing practice, emphasising, in the words of Prime Minister John Major's spokesman, 'the human face of Maastricht': The introduction of British-style Green Papers inviting public comment on proposed EC legislation. Though this is current practice, British officials said the UK wanted more formal, open procedures. A plan by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, to send individual Commissioners to national parliaments to explain the Commission's annual work plans. Thus a Spaniard might appear before the House of Commons, and a Frenchman might appear before the Danish Folketing. Britain would like partially to open up EC foreign ministers' sessions to the public. particularly during policy debates. In his presentation on subsidiarity, Mr Delors avoided examples of where the Commission had overstepped the mark. He opposed repealing existing legislation, declaring that the body of EC law and existing treaties - the acquis communautaire - must not be affected by the subsidiarity campaign. Mr Delors argued that subsidiarity did not mean 'cutting back' the powers of the Commission. He also noted that the Commission was becoming less active now that laws for the creation of a single market were virtually complete. The UK, which has criticised the Commission for poking unnecessarily into national nooks and crannies, yesterday agreed with Mr Delors that there should be no change in the institutional balance of power in Brussels. This was viewed partly as a response to fears among smaller states that Britain, France and Germany were seeking to grab power at the expense of the Commission, their traditional protector. Mr Delors intends to put forward 10-20 examples of Commission proposals which do not pass the test of subsidiarity. These could be scrapped as part of the Community's collective mea culpa. But ministers warned yesterday that final decisions on new working procedures and criteria for subsidiarity would be held up until the EC summit in Edinburgh in December.</p>

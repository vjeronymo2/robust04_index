			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / EC accuses Greeks over Serb boycott GREEK companies are systematically breaking the United Nations trade embargo against Serbia, sending thousands of tonnes of oil to the former Yugoslavia, EC officials said yesterday. Operators based in Greece are sending oil by road and rail via Romania and Bulgaria, undermining UN efforts to curb Serbian aggression through a tight trade ban, the official said. Mr Abel Matutes, the Spanish European Commissioner responsible for Mediterranean affairs, laid out the sanctions-busting dossier during a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday. Mr Matutes said up to two trains a day were leaving Greece for Romania carrying an estimated 1,000 tonnes a day. Several thousand tonnes more a week were being ferried by lorry from Greece to Bulgaria. Mr Matutes said he was not accusing the Greek government of sanctions busting, since private operators were involved. However EC diplomats said the Greek foreign minister was embarrassed by the presentation. The Greek representative told the meeting his country could not control the operations of private companies with genuine documents showing oil being shipped to another destination. Greece has denied systematic violation of the sanctions and said it was investigating specific cases when Greek-operated vessels delivering oil were observed by western naval patrols. The details of sanctions busting come amid continuing Greek efforts to halt petrol supplies to the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Greece refuses to recognise the republic because of a dispute over the use of the name Macedonia. There is a Greek province named Macedonia. Greece however recently agreed to release 21,000 tonnes of oil being held at Salonika to go to Macedonia. But it is still holding around 60,000 tonnes ordered by Macedonia last summer. The UK presidency of the EC is trying to overcome Greek opposition to recognition of Macedonia and wants to avoid a row with the fragile Athens government before the Edinburgh summit. EC officials said yesterday that said there had been a serious breakdown of discipline among UN peacekeeping forces involving Russian, Ukrainian and Kenyan troops fraternising with Serbs. Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary intends to raise the matter with senior UN officials. An EC official said the incident could encourage Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman to carry out his longstanding threat to oppose an extension of the United Nations peacekeeping mandate in Croatia beyond March 1.</p>

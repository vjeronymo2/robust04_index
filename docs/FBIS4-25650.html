			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shuang Mu: "`Coaching' Intended To Ensure Safe </F> Listings"]    [Text] China is creating a framework for coaching  companies that want to publicly issue stock and be listed on  exchanges.    To ensure the quality of listed companies, the securities  authorities now require enterprises to accept a six-month-long  coaching by relevant departments before they publicly issue and  list shares.    The coaching programme is intended to help enterprises  convert their operations to those of shareholding companies,  said Sun Xiaoliang, president of the China Shareholding Company  Consulting Co.    Sun noted that shareholding has spread rapidly in recent  years.    By the end of 1993, 189 State companies had become listed  companies.    But some have not substantially changed their operational  systems. Instead, they still conduct business under the  original system and regulations.    According to the initial instruction plan, said Sun, the  coaching period will be divided into two stages.    The first stage is to be finished before companies issue  shares to the public.    This stage will focus on establishing new corporate systems  that will make the enterprises responsible for their financial  losses and profits.    The second stage, to be completed before companies are  listed, will mainly examine the newly established corporate  systems to ensure that they are put into effect, while studying  problems in how they are run.    As to what kind of institutions are qualified to coach  enterprises, Sun thinks they should have the following  characteristics:    Firstly, they should understand precisely the purpose of the  reform of the State economic system.    Secondly, they should be quite familiar with the substance  of  the various economic reforms.    Thirdly, they should fully grasp the policies, regulations  and details of the modern corporate system.    Finally, they should have experience in helping enterprises  transform their operational systems.    The institutions' qualifications should be formally examined  by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the State  Commission for Economic Restructuring.</p>

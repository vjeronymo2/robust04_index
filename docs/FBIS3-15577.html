Security Council to consider  the possibility of granting the collective CIS peace-keeping  forces formed last autumn and still deployed in Tajikistan the  status of U.N. peace-keeping forces.    In his messages sent on Saturday to the chairman of the U.N.  Security Council, Jean-Bernard Merimee, and to the U.N.  Secretary-General, Butrus-Butrus Ghali, Rakhmanov expressed  concern over the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, where  "armed units of the Tajik opposition backed by some groups of  Afghan mujaheddin continue to stage acts of terrorism and  sabotage."    The Government of Tajikistan "intends to firmly follow its  program for settling the conflict between different political  forces in Tajikistan peacefully and resolving the situation on  the Tajik-Afghan border by political means," Rakhmanov assured  members of the U.N. Security Council.    In this connection the Tajik leadership intends to enter  into  talks with spokesmen for the opposition in Moscow this month,  the messages said.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS 'VERY UNLIKELY' TO BACK GULF WAR SOON, U.S. SAYS  </P> <P> The White House said today it is "very unlikely" that President Bush will be  able to muster support at a European summit from the Soviet Union for a  compromise U.N. resolution on using military force against Iraq.  </P> <P> Just a few hours earlier, Bush had voiced optimism that some agreement would be  found to overcome Soviet objections.  </P> <P> But, as the second day of the summit wound down, White House spokesman Marlin  Fitzwater said it did not appear that Bush would have a deal in hand before he  goes to Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The Persian Gulf crisis continued to dominate the unofficial agenda of the  34-nation Paris summit today, although French President Francois Mitterrand's  spokesman said the Conference on Cooperation and Security in Europe would not  issue any statements on the crisis.  </P> <P> Bush flies to front-line Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to meet with Saudi leaders  on the crisis. He will spend Thanksgiving Day with U.S. forces in the region  and will meet with Egyptian leaders Friday.  </P> <P> The President, who was stung by his failure to win over Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev in private talks Monday, voiced optimism that he would be  successful in overcoming Soviet objections. "Just be patient and all will be  well," he told reporters when asked about Gorbachev's reluctance to support a  U.N. resolution authorizing force.  </P> <P> The Soviets today publicly held to their position that diplomatic efforts to  force Iraq out of Kuwait have not been exhausted.  </P> <P> "Both presidents are concerned about the issue," Gorbachev's spokesman, Vitaly  Ignatenko, said. "They agreed that both sides should use maximum effort to  fulfill the sanctions, and that the issue should be discussed in the (U.N.)  Security Council."  </P> <P> Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have been unsuccessful in  winning Soviet support for any kind of resolution authorizing a military  strike. A meeting between Bush and Gorbachev on Monday night failed to produce  a breakthrough.  </P> <P> The Administration would like the U.N. Security Council to pass some sort of  resolution authorizing in advance a military strike to force Iraq from Kuwait.  </P></p>

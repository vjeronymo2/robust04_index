			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Benn is voted off committee The House of Commons decided last night by a majority of 129 (181-52) to remove Mr Tony Benn from the privileges committee which is examining the 'cash for questions' affair. An unrepentant Mr Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, said that he had been justified in breaching the rules of the committee and the House by publishing his own account of proceedings which took place in private. He insisted that the public was entitled to know about charges which had been said to involve 'bribery, fraud and corruption'. Mr Benn said he did not know whether the allegations were true, but they had gravely damaged the democratic process. He said the public would be wondering if some MPs were using their position not to represent their constituents but to 'pedal their influence for money'. 'If the House decides to retreat behind its traditional practice of working in secret, it will be making a very great mistake that could damage parliament and public confidence in us,' he said. His demand that statements made by members of the committee when deliberating over their conclusions - as well as evidence by witnesses  - should be published was opposed from both sides of the House. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, argued that the maintenance of secrecy during the deliberation process was an essential element in helping to achieve the consensus which frequently led to a majority report. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow leader of the House, was joined by Mr Peter Shore, Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney in suggesting that, as with juries in criminal trials, it would be wrong for the deliberative processes of the committee to be conducted in public. Mr David Alton, for the Liberal Democrats, complained that Mr Benn's deliberate action in breaching the rules of the House had delayed the inquiry into a matter which had brought the reputation of parliament into disrepute. The committee's investigation centres on the action of Mr Graham Riddick, Conservative MP for Colne Valley and Mr David Tredinnick, Conservative MP for Bosworth, in agreeing to accept payment for tabling questions in the Commons.</p>

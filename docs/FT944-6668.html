			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Thai police bend rule of law: A catalogue of crime has stirred uneasy feelings Nobody paid much attention when they saw a 20-year-old policeman demanding cash from passing motorists in central Bangkok the other day; Thai policemen, unmistakable in their too-tight brown uniforms, routinely engage in roadside extortion. What gave Mr Thammarong Sricharoen away as an impostor and led to his arrest was not his blatant money-grabbing but an incorrect salute to a passing police officer with his left hand instead of his right. He had stolen the uniform. Incidents such as this (Mr Thammarong's mistake was explained at a news conference by a Thai police chief) have for years been cheerfully accepted by the majority of Thais. They take it for granted their 170,000-strong police force is corrupt. But a lengthening list of recent murders and other tragedies in which police were implicated has aroused uneasy feelings among even the most cynical Thais, fuelling a debate about the pernicious effects of corruption. Earlier this year, seven Thai policemen were charged with involvement in the murder of at least nine visitors from Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and China; the victims were robbed and shot. In July, a 15-year-old prostitute committed suicide by drinking poison in a police station in the southern town of Hat Yai; she had escaped from a brothel and gone to the police station to seek help, but the police sent her away. All prostitution is illegal in Thailand, and the government is waging a campaign against child prostitution. But underpaid policemen earn substantial sums in 'protection money' from brothel-owners for turning a blind eye, and in some cases run brothels themselves. Even if the credibility of the Thai police had been able to survive such scandals, it would surely have been destroyed by recent developments in the case of the stolen Saudi gems. In 1989 a Thai worker in Saudi Arabia stole Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.5m) worth of jewellery from the palace of a Saudi prince. He was arrested after his return to Thailand and the recovered items were proudly displayed by the police. Triumph quickly became farce when the haul was sent back to Saudi Arabia, because most of the returned jewels turned out to be fakes copied from the originals. A police general's wife was seen, and photographed, wearing what appeared to be one of the stolen necklaces, although she and her husband later insisted this too was a fake. At first the saga was seen in Thailand as something of a joke, since the Saudis were not popular either as employers in their own country or as visitors to Thailand. But the mood has now changed. Saudi Arabia has stopped granting visas to Thai migrant workers and forbidden its own citizens to go to Thailand on holiday, depriving Thailand of millions of dollars a year in income. Several people connected to the case have meanwhile been murdered in Thailand. The two most recent victims were the wife and child of a jeweller who was an important witness in the case. They were bludgeoned to death, but the police forensic department initially announced, to cries of derision, that they had died in a car accident. 'The law enforcement branch has broken its last bond with the people,' wrote Mr Suthichai Yoon, columnist and editor-in-chief of The Nation newspaper. The embarrassed Thai government finally acted: two police generals have been charged in connection with the killing of the jeweller's family, and dozens of other police officers are under investigation. Mr Mohammed Said Khoja, the outspoken Saudi charge d'affaires in Bangkok, remains understandably sceptical. He arrived in 1990 on what he thought would be a three-month mission to resolve the affair and is now in his fifth year in Thailand. 'I'm glad that the public in Thailand are starting to have some sympathy,' he said in an interview, but added: 'Anything can happen in Thailand. Today they arrest the generals; tomorrow they will say there is no evidence. The big policemen here have a better life than the prime minister himself.' Many Thai policemen are so involved in crime, rather than crime prevention, and so dedicated to protecting the rich and powerful, rather than enforcing the law impartially, that it will be hard for any government to make them change their ways. A recent study by Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University found that some officers pay bribes of up to Baht5m (Pounds 125,000) to their superiors to be promoted to lucrative posts enjoying a steady flow of extorted money - in areas with plenty of brothels, for example. But the new wave of popular outrage at the latest police crimes may start to make life easier for the few senior police officers regarded as honest. Maj-Gen Seri Temiyavej, one such crusader, recently arrested one of Thailand's best-known 'godfathers', in connection with an allegedly illegal land deal near the coastal resort of Pattaya. Even if such prosecutions succeed, cleaning up the police force is likely to be a painfully slow process. 'What we've been trying to do is to establish the rule of law,' says Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, 'I think the situation will improve as a result of the government's determination, but in the short term it may not be so easy to perceive.'</p>

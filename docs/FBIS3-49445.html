The same source says that, in addition to light weapons, the  Muslims used antiaircraft guns and machine guns, as well as  mortars.    The Herzegovina Corps headquarters claims that the "green  berets" sent a sabotage-terrorist group into the Cajnice region  yesterday, which was spotted and destroyed in time.    On other parts of the Herzegovina battlefield, only  occasional provocations from light weapons were registered  yesterday and last night.</p>

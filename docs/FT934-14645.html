			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Dispute at Timex ends in disarray with Pounds 1m cash offer THE EIGHT-MONTH Timex dispute in Dundee finally ended yesterday in disarray, amid the anger and tears of the workforce. By a narrow vote of 132 to 108, with 63 absent, the former employees backed a redundancy cash offer negotiated between the AEEU engineering and electrical union and the company. The deal settles one of the most bitter disputes in Britain for many years. In return for accepting Pounds 1m of severance money, the workers agreed that all unfair dismissal claims against Timex should be dropped by today and a worldwide trade union boycott of the company's products ended. 'The strike is over,' said Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU's national officer in Scotland. The Pounds 200,000 strike support fund is also to be disbursed on a 'fair and equitable basis' among the former workers, so that it can no longer be used to harass Timex. If the 340 unfair dismissal cases are not withdrawn today from the industrial tribunal, Timex has said that the redundancy cash offer will be withdrawn as part of the settlement. It was unclear last night whether the Timex workers who voted against the deal would accept the verdict and end their unfair dismissal claims. Mr Airlie said: 'I am confident the workers will accept the democratic majority verdict. If they do not then none of them will receive any redundancy money at all. They will get nothing.' He told a mass meeting of former workers earlier in the day that the union was no longer prepared to carry on with the strike. He informed them that it was ending immediately the Pounds 30-a-week strike pay they had been receiving since February and that no further legal aid, nor union representation, would be available for those who wanted to continue unfair dismissal cases. Mr Airlie said the union had already spent about Pounds 500,000 on the strike since it began in February, when Timex dismissed all its manual employees and hired a substitute workforce.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: BFI set for victory in Attwoods bid battle The battle for Attwoods was all but over last night with hostile predator Browning-Ferris Industries of the US believed to have acceptances for substantially more than 55 per cent of the UK company. The Pounds 391m cash bid needed acceptances of just 50.1 per cent to go unconditional. Earlier this week, BFI revealed it had won almost 43 per cent. BFI refused to comment, but did say it was 'very confident of success'. However, it is believed that Attwoods' two largest shareholders, Fidelity and Templeton Investments, had either accepted by last night or were in the process of doing so. Fidelity holds 11 per cent of Attwoods and Templeton about 13 per cent. This would give BFI 54 per cent, after allowing for the 29.8 per cent stake held by Laidlaw of Canada. Laidlaw agreed to sell its shares to BFI under the original lower offer of 109p per ordinary and 85p per preference share. Last month, BFI raised the bid to 116.75p per ordinary and 92p per preference share, and promised to pay the proposed 3.25p final dividend. Attwoods' shares closed steady yesterday at 117p. The Attwoods camp was last night reluctant to concede defeat before today's deadline. Nevertheless, it appears that shareholders have rejected the waste company's promise to return greater value through a break-up plan, in spite of interest from both Waste Management Inter- national and Cleanaway in the UK businesses. Analysts in London said the break-up had offered 'too little, too late' to tempt shareholders away from BFI's cash offer. Meanwhile, BFI announced it had won government approval for the takeover of Attwoods' businesses, which include substantial operations in Florida and the mid-Atlantic states. But it will have to sell a number of routes in four states.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTIST LE PEN RETURNS WITH 55 HOSTAGES  </P> <P> Extreme right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen returned home Thursday from Iraq  with 55 freed hostages and accused unnamed Western governments of "wanting to  keep hostages in Iraq in order to start a war."  </P> <P> Le Pen, accompanied by several European Parliament members belonging to  right-wing parties who accompanied him to Baghdad, landed in the eastern French  city of Mulhouse aboard a special Boeing 727 Iraqi Airways jet.  </P> <P> The rightist leader refused to elaborate on his charge that some Western  governments want the hostages to remain in Baghdad as an excuse to start a war.  </P> <P> But he again urged France to withdraw its troops from Saudi Arabia as soon as  possible because "American interests, and not French or European interests, are  involved."  </P> <P> The 55 hostages who returned with Le Pen are citizens of 10 European countries,  among them 21 British nationals, 14 Italians, seven Germans, three Irish and  two Belgians.  </P> <P> Two Dutch citizens, three Danish nationals, two Greeks and a Swiss were also  freed and returned with Le Pen.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> PLANNERS APPROVE 62-LOT SUBDIVISION  </P> <P> The Fillmore Planning Commission approved a proposal Thursday for a 62-lot  subdivision on nearly 17 acres south of California 126. The property on River  Street between Central and Mountain View streets is now an orange grove.  </P> <P> Fillmore planning officials said the proposal by InterCal Associates, a local  firm, is in keeping with the city's General Plan. However, about half of the  parcel is outside Fillmore's city limits and will have to be annexed to the  city pending final approval by the City Council.  </P> <P> Building permits will not be issued until improvements to Fillmore's water  system are near completion. City planners said Fillmore's third reservoir on  Foothill Drive is a prerequisite to future growth.  </P> <P> Work on the reservoir began about a month ago and should be finished by July 1,  officials said.

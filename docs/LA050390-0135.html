			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> House Panel Votes to Subpoena Milken: A House subcommittee has decided to offer  junk bond financier Michael Milken immunity from prosecution so that he will  testify before Congress, a panel aide said. The Energy and Commerce  subcommittee on oversight and investigations voted unanimously in a closed  session to subpoena Milken, who pleaded guilty last week to six felony counts  and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and restitution. If Milken receives  immunity from the full panel, nothing he says at the hearing could be used  against him in court.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Bizhan by Marat </F> Pohorelov; place and date not given; from the "Independence"  program -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Pohorelov] Many lances have been broken on the  issue of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine. The concrete  steps toward the resolution of this issue are often assessed  without taking into account the actual reality and the set of  all existent factors, that is to say, in a one-sided parochial  view. Therefore, the issue returns once and again to be viewed  in our programs. Today we will take a look at this with the help  of General Colonel Ivan Bizhan, deputy defense minister.    [Bizhan] Despite the fact that a great deal has been said  about this issue in the press, television, and on the radio,  many people are still interested in it. I would like to say one  more time that not a treaty but a declaration and an annex to  this declaration were signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the  Russian Federation, and the United States in Moscow. There are  no significant discrepancies between this declaration and the  Supreme Council resolution on ratifying the START I treaty. I  would also want to emphasize that Ukraine's nuclear disarmament  issue involves the United States as well. This is exactly what  we have wanted from the very beginning, when we began to address  this issue.    Carefully looking at the annex to the statement signed by  the  presidents, one can see that the Russian Federation for the  first time committed to service the nuclear warheads deployed in  Ukraine, and which, according to the agreement, will be  gradually transferred to Russia for dismantling. This is also  one of the problems which we had been trying to solve, but which  Russia had been refusing to solve, intending to exert pressure  on Ukraine through this or to force it to adopt certain  decisions. You know that we ourselves cannot maintain these  nuclear warheads. Now, one does not have to convince anybody  that the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine are our property.  As you remember, one had to do this until recently, because the  Russian Federation by no means wanted to admit that. It claimed  that these weapons once belonged to the Soviet Union, and now  they should be inherited by the Russian Federation. Therefore,  it considered itself the only inheritor of these nuclear  weapons. Now, when this problem has ceased to exist, another one  arises: What should our state do with these nuclear weapons  inherited after the downfall of the Soviet Union? For example,  what could be done with the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine?  Some people say that Ukraine should be a nuclear state. If  this problem is examined in the context of nuclear weapons  deployed in Ukraine, then how can Ukraine become a nuclear  state? If we agree with the Russian Federation that Russia will  service the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine, and that it  will replace nuclear warheads whose warranty and shelf life have  expired, and that it will hand over to us the systems of  control. However, while saying that, we should ask ourselves a  question: Will Russia agree with that? Will the United States  agree? Will other states agree? And a whole range of other  questions. This is unreal. To link our nuclear weapons to the  nuclear status of the state is the only way, however unreal.    Assuming that Ukraine should become a nuclear state, it will  be necessary to adopt a resolution to establish an entire  infrastructure which a nuclear state should have. We do not  have such a structure. Specialists should give their opinion on  whether it is possible or not to do this. Although they have  already said a lot about this, let them say more. What will  this involve; what problems will this cause; what costs are  entailed? What will be the consequences of this decision? Do  we need that? Will this increase our security? There are also  other problems we should resolve in this regard. Thus, the  nuclear weapons deployed on the territory of our state and the  nuclear status of our state are two different issues. Now we  should solve this issue. The declaration signed by the  president of our state and the annex to it concern nuclear  weapons that we inherited from the Soviet Union and we currently  possess. However, while solving this issue, we should proceed  from objective circumstances. No matter what we say and what  decisions are adopted, the circumstances are dictating [their  terms] now. What kind of circumstances? For example, every  nuclear warhead has a certain warranty period. You know that  President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk, at a news conference given  at Boryspil airport following his return from Moscow, said that  the warranties of all the nuclear weapons deployed in our state  will expire in 1999 or 2000. However, they begin to expire as  early as this year. Therefore, a certain number of nuclear  warheads will surpass their shelf life this year. This means  that we will have to deal with this problem every year. No  matter what decisions we adopt, we should resolve the problem of  nuclear weapons which have surpassed their shelf life.  Actually, nuclear weapons are one of the powerful security  guarantees for a state, but only if a state is really a nuclear  one.    For example, if we had all those elements, or all that  infrastructure that accounts for the status of a nuclear state,  this would unquestionably be a guarantee of our security.  However, the things are not like that. The nuclear weapons  deployed in Ukraine today cannot be a guarantee of our security  because these weapons are nothing more than our property. The  entire control system, the entire production system, the entire  servicing and testing system is in the Russian Federation. No  matter what our desires are, this is true. For some reason, we  have recently discussed only those nuclear weapons which are  deployed on our territory, having in mind the problems, or  aspects, of our security. However, we should not forget the  fact that, with regard to conventional arms, to conventional  armed forces, our state is the second power on the continent,  after the Russian Federation. Is this not an aspect of our  state's security? It is, and it is an aspect that we can  maintain on such a level of combat readiness, which would allow  our Armed Forces to defend our state. It could be done at the  expense of resolving the issue of nuclear weapons which are now  in Ukraine. First of all, I have in mind financial aspects,  when we will be able to allot larger funds to our conventional  Armed Forces. Therefore, I think that we should not forget  about this issue, too. Besides, the issue of our state security  is an issue of our integration with European structures,  including the Partnership for Peace program adopted during the  recent NATO session. We should participate. We should  integrate with NATO and other structures. It will also be one of  the guarantees of our security.    I do not want to mention such issues as friendly relations  with other states, in particular, with neighboring states, or  the resolution of our many heavy economic problems. The  resolution of these problems will also grant us security  guarantees. Having resolved the issue of nuclear weapons  deployed in our state, we will be able to resolve those other  problems and aspects that constitute the entire body of our  state security.    [Pohorelov] Ivan Vasylyovich, let us close our interview  with the following summation of the nuclear weapon issue in  Ukraine today: One cannot be a king for only one day; one must  also think about the future.    [Bizhan] Yes, you are right. Our status with regard to  nuclear weapons, which are actually our property, is a temporary  situation. This temporary situation will terminate at the end  of the year of 2000. The number of nuclear warheads will be  decreasing every year. No matter what resolution we adopt, the  objective circumstances will drive us toward a reduction of  nuclear warheads deployed on Ukraine's territory. It is because  of objective circumstances and the connection with serious  issues related to the nuclear and ecological security of our  state. I do not think anyone will adopt a resolution which  could bring tragedy, either nuclear or environmental.</p>

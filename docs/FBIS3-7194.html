To help them cope with the rigours of competition, academics  suggested that the education level of labourers as well as their  ability to take the initiative to learn new skills should be  improved.    In the seminar, "The Thai economy in the Year 2000", at the  Royal Orchid Hotel on Wednesday, Dr Pawadi Thong-uthai, an  associate professor of economics at Thammasat University, said  Thai manufacturing industries in the future will have to place  greater emphasize more on efficiency, cost reductions and the  adoption of new technology. [sentence as published] They will  have to respond quickly to market demand. With improved  communications technology, they may have to adapt production in  response to market orders and rely on fast delivery.    "Thailand will see growth in the adoption of the subcontract  system, such as in garments and jewelry. This will reduce  labour costs and help diversify risks. As the market will be  increasingly volatile, (under the subcontract system) the main  company will not have to invest (so much) in machinery. They  can rely on the facilities of small subcontracting factories,"  she said.    Pawadi said to add production flexibility, the main plant  will hire only the best workers and subcontract part of the  production to small factories. Employment will be separated  into two main categories. The first class labourers working at  the main plant will have higher wages and more job security.  The second class workers in subcontracting factories will be  hired temporarily to fill individual contracts.    The subcontract system has both advantages and  disadvantages.    It helps a company compete, if it can ensure strict quality  control and especially if the main factory assists the  subcontracting factories in utilizing new production techniques.    "But the downside is that labourers (in subcontracting  firms)  will not have job security. Even in Japan (where lifetime  employment is a common pattern) the second class workers are the  first to be laid off," Pawadi said. They tend to work longer  hours, and under pressure.    Most of these `second-class' labourers will have recently  left the agricultural sector.</p>

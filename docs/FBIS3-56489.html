I cannot see any security guarantees  from Russia and America. This simply is intended to deceive  Ukraine with Kravchuk's help. As for the $155 million allocated  to Ukraine by Bill Clinton, this is the money that has been paid  to American specialists who were on assignment in Ukraine."    Mykola Shulha, chairman of the Supreme Council Committee for  Issues of State Sovereignty and Inter-Republican and  Inter-ethnic Relations: "If after signing the documents Russia  does not comply with the obligations assumed, this could  undermine the global authority of such an influential state as  America, and would have negative consequences for the whole  world. As for the trilateral agreement, I shall endeavour to  convince the Supreme Council to ratify this document. I believe  that a compromise solution can also be found in settling the  issues of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol. Policy should be  made through understanding and respect for the interests of our  states."    Volodymyr Filenko, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman  of  the Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine: "I expressed my  opinion even before the documents were signed and can confirm  that my assessment is positive. First, Ukraine today is  economically unable to maintain this nuclear potential. Second,  as a result of signing the agreement it will be provided with  fuel for its nuclear electric stations, which will partly  resolve the energy problem. Third, it will become possible to  set up a certain stabilization fund to introduce the hryvnya.  However, this is Ukraine's last reserve, and political and  economic reforms are now badly needed."    Volodmyr Klymchuk, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party  of Ukraine: "I assess the signing of the Moscow agreement to be  a Ukrainian diplomatic success, implementing the Declaration on  the Independence of Ukraine. At last its primary provision on  non-nuclear status is being realized and Ukraine will receive  certain benefits which are badly needed. As for comments to the  effect that nuclear weapons will be handed to Zhirinovskiy, I  would like to stress that this figure is no doubt dangerous.  However, hidden national communists and national fascists are  an even greater danger."    Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, chairman of the secretariat of the  People's Movement of Ukraine: "What happened in Moscow is a  total betrayal of the Ukrainian people, and is bad enough to  stand trial for."    Mykola Bahrov, chairman of the Supreme Council of the  Republic of the Crimea: "My assessment of the Moscow agreement  between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the  elimination of Ukrainian nuclear weapons is positive. In  general, President Leonid Kravchuk's assets are the  international recognition of Ukraine. His liabilities are what  has happened to the Ukrainian economy."</p>

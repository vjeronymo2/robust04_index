			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 5 SCHOOLS GIVE PUPILS AND PARENTS HARD WORK;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: OLD-FASHIONED AND PUBLIC, THEY STRESS DISCIPLINE, ACADEMIC RIGOR AND  PROPER ATTIRE. NEARLY 600 CHILDREN ARE ON WAITING LISTS AT JUST TWO OF THEM.  </P> <P> Eileen and Bob Wyckhuyse of Simi Valley have seven children, the youngest born  just last week.  </P> <P> Four of their children, all elementary-school age, attend the Hollow Hills  Fundamental School in Simi Valley -- by their parents' choice. Each school day  last year, Eileen Wyckhuyse and a neighbor traded car-pooling duties, driving 2  1/2 miles each way and bypassing two neighborhood elementary schools to get to  Hollow Hills.  </P> <P> It's worth the trouble, said Wyckhuyse, 33, because Hollow Hills is a  "fundamental school," an old-fashioned, back-to-basics public school that  stresses discipline, high academic expectations, a strict dress code and daily  homework assignments -- even for kindergarten students.  </P> <P> "I felt that, overall, my kids would be going to a school with other children  whose parents are really concerned about their education," Wyckhuyse said. "I  think the atmosphere is almost like a private school."  </P> <P> Hollow Hills and Vista elementary schools in the Simi Valley Unified School  District are among five such fundamental public schools in Ventura County,  where teachers and parents talk a lot about responsibility, accountability, and  holding students to higher standards than those found at most other schools.  </P> <P> The concept is not new or unique. Fundamental schools proliferated in the early  1980s after a report from the National Commission on Excellence in Education  criticized the public school system for fostering "a rising tide of  mediocrity."  </P> <P> Unlike "magnet schools" established in some districts, Simi Valley's  fundamental schools are not aimed at the intellectually gifted or those who  want to specialize in a particular subject. According to parent handbooks for  Vista and Hollow Hills, the schools have "only two reasons to exist . . . to  provide a more rigorous educational program . . . and to hold a higher level of  expectation for all involved -- educators, students and parents."  </P> <P> "It's not the right school for everybody," said Hollow Hills Principal Susan  Parks. "Part of our focus is to be more academic, but with the kinds of  rigorous things we do, like homework every day, even when it's really simple  it's too much for some kids. Other kids really thrive."  </P> <P> Apparently, many parents in Simi Valley believe such schools are right for  their children.  </P> <P> The names of nearly 600 Simi Valley children are on waiting lists to get into  Hollow Hills and Vista for the next school year. About 200 of those names are  on waiting lists for the kindergarten programs, school officials said.  </P> <P> "It seems to be a very popular concept with parents," said Vista Principal  Sheila Robbins. Like the students, teachers and administrators must request to  be placed at a fundamental school.  </P> <P> "It's unique because everybody who is here wants to be here," said Robbins, who  recently completed her first year at Vista after serving as principal at other  Simi Valley schools for the past 10 years.  </P> <P> Funding and curriculum are the same as for traditional schools in the district.  But fundamental teachers said they often do more with what they have, covering  more ground and getting higher standardized test scores than at other schools.  </P> <P> At Vista, for example, scores on the California Test of Basic Skills are  typically in the 80th to 90th percentile range, depending on the grade level,  while average scores statewide are between the 40th and 50th percentile,  Robbins said.  </P> <P> The Simi Valley fundamental programs were started in 1982, after parents  demanded a more rigorous, basic education program. Initially, children were  enrolled on a first-come, first-served basis, but when parents started camping  out overnight to get their children enrolled in kindergarten, the district  started a computer lottery to determine who gets in.  </P> <P> Parents must sign a contract stating that they will abide by school  requirements for parents, including reviewing and signing homework assignment  sheets daily.  </P> <P> This year, parent Doug Stevens said, his son Devon, 5, a kindergartner, brought  work home Mondays through Thursdays. For homework, kindergarten students had to  ask their parents to read to them for 20 minutes, or solve word puzzles, or cut  out magazine pictures of objects that all began with the same letter.  </P> <P> Stevens said he doesn't mind that some assignments are easy.  </P> <P> "They're only 5 years old, and I'm not for pushing them too hard," Stevens  said. "This is their first year away from home."  </P> <P> Hollow Hills PTA President Gail Bennett was on a waiting list for six months  before the first of her three children who have attended the school was  admitted. Once a child gets in, his siblings get enrollment priority.  </P> <P> "I heard they were a structured school, and I believe in homework and the  basics," said Bennett, 50, who drives seven miles each way to bring her  children to Hollow Hills. "Kids need structure and responsibility. My other  child was in a regular school, and they had no homework. It makes a difference.  It shows."  </P> <P> Parent Grace Lu agrees. However, her son Timothy is still on the waiting list  to get into Vista. He has been waiting a year already, and there are 61  students ahead of him.  </P> <P> Although Timothy, 7, attended kindergarten at Vista, Lu and her husband, Rex,  transferred him to an even stricter private Christian school in Canoga Park  when he started having disciplinary problems in class, Lu said.  </P> <P> Now, the Lus are trying to get Timothy back into Vista. Grace Lu said the wait  is particularly frustrating because they live a block from the school.  </P> <P> "He's doing better now," she said, "but I feel he could learn better at Vista,  so we want him back in."  </P> <P> In the Pleasant Valley Elementary School District, there are fundamental or  "structured" programs at three schools, Dos Caminos, Los Primeros and Bedford,  an "open school" on the campus of El Descanso School.  </P> <P> Dos Caminos Principal Al Lane said half his school is devoted to a fundamental  program. There are usually fewer than 10 students per grade on the waiting list  for enrollment, he said.  </P> <P> Occasionally, school officials said, the fundamental program does not work for  some students. Sometimes the daily homework assignments prove too much, or a  student finds the atmosphere too restrictive, or a student is not meeting the  school's standard for passing on to the next grade. In those cases, students  may transfer back to normal programs.  </P> <P> Even students who stay in fundamental schools say that keeping up with the  workload can make extracurricular pursuits difficult.  </P> <P> Jenifer Bennett, a fifth-grade student at Hollow Hills, said she has to squeeze  in homework between dance and gymnastics classes twice a week. "It makes it  harder to do other activities," said Jenifer, 10, who transferred to Hollow  Hills after attending kindergarten at another school.  </P> <P> But, she added: "Even though it's harder in some ways, I think you learn more.  I think it's a better school."  </P></p>

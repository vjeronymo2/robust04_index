			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Jordan fears being left out: West Bank trade is a priority THE SPEED with which Jordan ratified its 'agenda' for peace with Israel, after months of waiting for the Palestinians to hammer out a settlement, indicates the kingdom's concern that it may get left behind in any Middle East economic regeneration. Having the longest common border with the occupied territories and with over half its population of Palestinian origin, Jordan has been perceived for many years as vulnerable to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The country is now in an ideal position to benefit from rapprochement, yet the government fears it will be economically marginalised under the present terms of discussion. The West Bank and Gaza Strip are potentially lucrative markets for Jordan. The kingdom imports goods worth some Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.40m) a year from the occupied territories. Government officials complain, however, that trade prospects are hindered by Israeli constraints which will impose a Dollars 15m ceiling on Jordanian imports. Further, they say that the Israelis are pushing for goods sold by Jordan to the West Bank and Gaza to be restricted to those exempted from Israeli tariffs. 'This basically leaves us with little else but headdresses and henna to sell,' jokes Mr Jawad Anani, a minister of state. Jordanian officials fear that Israel will continue to impose itself economically on the occupied territories. A recent World Bank report on the economic development of a Palestinian entity assumes that the monopolistic relationship of Israel over the occupied territories will continue. In Jordan's 'agenda' with Israel, trade with the West Bank and Gaza is said to be high on the list of priorities. Crown Prince Hassan says that free trade is the ideal. But Jordan's view that Israel intends to use a Palestinian entity as a Trojan horse to enter the Arab market, in tandem with Israel's protectionist stance over the occupied territories, bodes ill for future economic relations. The crown prince says a development plan for the region should be drawn up among all parties. He criticises the international community for restricting development aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip and calls on the World Bank and other international institutions to reassess the development needs of the whole region. 'Unless a regional perspective is sought which includes the Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis and Jordanians, then the Dollars 60bn economy of Israel will take the initiative to develop the hinterland, which is totally unacceptable politically as well as economically,' he says. He further expressed concern that development ideas such as the construction of an oil pipeline from Elat on the Israeli side of the Red Sea to the Mediterranean and a proposed canal from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea will be detrimental to Jordan and the region as a whole. 'You can't continue to ignore us (in such discussions) yet at the same time expect us to participate in peacemaking,' he warns. Having weathered the Gulf crisis along with a virtual embargo on Jordanian goods by the Gulf states, the kingdom's tiny economy (GDP was Dollars 4.8bn last year at current producer prices) has proved itself resilient. Thanks partly to remittances from Palestinians expelled from the Gulf, real GDP growth was over 11 per cent in 1992. But fears that the kingdom will be restricted from entering markets in the West Bank and Gaza which Jordanians feel are rightly theirs could strain relations with the Palestinians as well as the Israelis.</p>

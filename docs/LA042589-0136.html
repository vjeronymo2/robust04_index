			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAX ELECTION PLANS ADVANCE A NOTCH  </P> <P> Plans for a Nov. 7 election on a half-cent sales tax in Orange County were  advanced Monday with release of a proposed traffic improvement ordinance that  would control how the revenue would be spent.  </P> <P> The proposal would deny proceeds to any city failing to use the money for  transportation projects. The ordinance also would bar money to cities that fail  to tie future growth to traffic standards. Also, it would require cities to  spend the tax money within 3 years of receiving it.  </P> <P> The proposal was made public Monday by the Orange County Transportation  Commission.  </P> <P> Stanley T. Oftelie, the panel's executive director, called the provision  barring money to cities that do not spend them on transportation a "death  penalty" clause, enforcement of which could not be appealed to the Local  Transportation Authority that would be set up to administer the tax.  </P> <P> However, such a ban would last just 5 years, after which time a city could ask  the authority for permission to again receive sales taxes.  </P> <P> Tom Rogers, the San Juan Capistrano rancher who led a successful effort to  defeat a similar 1-cent sales tax in 1984, said Monday that he is concerned  about some provisions of the current plan. He wants to be assured that the  ordinance's citizens advisory group would have enough authority to see that the  measure is enforced.  </P> <P> "If it's going to be a rubber stamp for current officeholders, it won't work,"  Rogers said. "You can't just give the money to the same people who caused the  (traffic) problem in the first place."  </P> <P> OCTC officials want to use the sales tax to help pay for $11.6 billion in road  and transit projects over 20 years. The commission will hold a public hearing  on the 20-year plan at 9 a.m. on May 8 in the county's Hall of Administration  in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The 20-year plan would use $3.1 billion raised through the tax to supplement  $8.5 billion expected to come from traditional sources, such as state, federal  and local governments. The plan would pay for such projects as widening the  Santa Ana Freeway from six lanes to 12, increasing rail service and adding  car-pool lanes.  </P> <P> Assuming that the 20-year plan is adopted by the commission, the panel would  then approve the traffic improvement ordinance and call for an election. The  Board of Supervisors would then have until Aug. 8 to schedule a Nov. 7  election.  </P> <P> Oftelie said supervisors would be unlikely to refuse to schedule such an  election if the Transportation Commission calls for one.  </P> <P> Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy: "What May One Believe?"] </F>   [Text] In the few months since my victory at the Russian  parliamentary elections last December, the so-called opinion  industry all over the world has painted a strange picture of me,  which sometimes has little to do with reality and, more often,  nothing at all.  <H5>  Dirty Journalism </H5>   I have experienced the worst baiting from the media in the  FRG. The yellow press has surpassed itself in inventing events  in connection with me. Westdeutscher Rundfunk does not even shy  away from a movie about my assassination by the CIA and the  Federal Intelligence Service. As "justification" they cite, on  the one hand, my expected victory at the Russian presidential  elections and, on the other hand, the absolute lie that I am  compiling death lists and give orders to death squads.  Obviously, there is no lowest level for this kind of dirty  journalism.    Thus, I can understand that millions of Germans are  uncertain  and see me and my ideas as a danger to Germany. The readers of  DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG and DEUTSCHE WOCHEN-ZEITUNG, published  by my friend Dr. Gerhard Frey, have a right to truthful reports,  which I have the pleasure to fulfill here.  <H5>  What We Owe to Our Dead </H5>   It is in the nature of things that I, as a Russian  politician, advocate Russian rights and interests, but in my  view of the world German and Russian rights and interests do not  oppose each other, but run parallel. Whoever implies that I  want to restrict the German people in their rights, is turning  truth upside down. Rather, I am striving for a vital and  healthy, strong and large, but also German, Germany, as a stable  partner and lasting friend of Russia. What has proved its worth  a thousand times over for centuries and has proved to be a  blessing for both peoples, cannot be wrong.    It was, however, wrong, even crazy, that we permitted  ourselves to be thrown at each other in two murderous world  wars. Russians and Germans had to make by far the greatest  sacrifices. We owe it to our dead to learn lessons from that,  and these lessons can only be: return to the traditional  German-Russian friendship.  <H5>  Unprecedented Brainwashing </H5>   A Russia, which, in whatever form, gets involved on the side  of the German people's enemies or opponents, would contribute to  tying Germany to the so-called Western community of values and  to depriving it of its sovereignty. This is probably a key to  the immense media baiting against me, which is considered to be  anti-Russian even by those who are not voters of the Liberal  Democratic party, and which is obviously aimed at giving rise to  resentment both in the German and in the Russian peoples.    With sincere rage I note that the Germans are expected to  wander around repenting in sack cloth and ashes and to accept a  both immoral and unethical collective responsibility and  collective liability for things that happened long ago. The  requirements of the present and the needs of the future are to  be pushed away by a constant, extremely one-sided coming to  terms with the past.    I see the unprecedented brainwashing, to which the Germans  have been subjected for almost half a century, as the effort to  lastingly infect the people of poets and thinkers with the  bacillus of national masochism.  <H5>  Is National Masochism Healthy? </H5>   If, however, national masochism is already so good for  school  children and also so healthy for adult Germans, there arises the  question why for any other people in the world the opposite  standards apply and why, outside Central Europe, practically all  political movements agree to remember the positive and proud  parts of history and not to have the development of their own  people presented by the media like a catalogue of criminals.    The fact that foreign politicians make -- often  inappropriate  or excessive --suggestions or demands to the Germans, is already  party of the "normalcy" of our time and is usually cheered  enthusiastically by the FRG media. Logically, I, who strives  for Germany's friendship and care for the welfare of the German  people, am presented as a spawn of hell in the "German" opinion  industry, even though any thinking person can calculate my  prospects for becoming Russia's president.  <H5>  The Point of the Lies </H5>   The systematic reports of horror stories about me are to sow  discontent. This is tried to virtually poison the political  climate between our peoples and states. The calculation of the  instigators is probably also to gradually undermine my basic  pro-German attitude through constant slander and bedeviling, and  to slowly turn me into an enemy of the German people. However,  I am perfectly able to distinguish between the German people and  the FRG media, which are basically a work of the victors of  World War II.    All the more intense is my appeal to the German-thinking  Germans to overcome the resentments of the past, to remember the  wonderful common points of German-Russian history, and to follow  with all possible determination a course of eternal friendship  on the basis of full equal rights between our peoples and states.    Our friendship is not directed against anyone and does not  threaten anyone. However, it is the guarantee for a lasting  peace in Europe and is, therefore, in the interest of all  peoples on the continent and, basically, of all the world. Do  not give those who preach hatred any chance and defend  understanding among peoples and peace!</p>

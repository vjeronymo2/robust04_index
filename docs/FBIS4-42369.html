			<p>BFN     [Text] New York (DPA) -- German Environment Minister Klaus  Toepfer has given a positive view of the two-week session of the  UN Commission on Sustainable Development that he chaired. In an  interview with DPA at the end of the discussions in New York on  27 May, the minister said it was a success that proposals for 14  areas had been worked out -- ranging from financing and  technology transfer to sectors like water or chemicals.    He said, however, that private organizations wanting a more  intensive environmental and development policy criticized the  fact that the many words are still not followed by deeds. This  was urgently necessary both at the national and international  levels and had not been dealt with in New York either.    Toepfer said the developing countries had, "in particular,  urged" "a change in the consumption habits of the industrialized  nations." He said the Commission's work would be continued under  his chairmanship for a whole year, and to this end, the policy  course had been set. He said that good use had to be made of  this year in order to consolidate the profile and decisionmaking  power of the institution.    Regarding the preservation of forests, "we must and can make  progress and achieve more than we did in Rio," he said. The  Commission was created to convert the resolutions adopted at the  summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 into concrete action. The goal  remained an international convention for the preservation of all  forests in the world: "This is a heavily burdened field. Many  people in the developing countries believe that the developed  countries interfere in their own internal affairs and disregard  their sovereignty. I believe, however, that something has  changed here."    The minister described his work in New York as "incredibly  labor-intensive, difficult, and tough" -- even though the UN  bureaucracy had demonstrated much goodwill. "The largest  problems are clearly financial ones," he said, and added that  the developing countries emphatically mentioned the fact that  "new, predictable financial measures" had been promised in Rio.    Commenting on the meeting, German observers from  environmental groups and development initiatives said that  "hardly any progress" had been made in New York. "As long as  the governments confine themselves to continuously repeating  noncommittal appeals and are not prepared to assume concrete  political obligations, there is the great danger that the whole  Rio process will come to nothing."</p>

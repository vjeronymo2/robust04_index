			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LUGINBILL ORDERS SDSU TO SNAP TO ATTENTION;  </P> <P> MIDSEASON REPORT: SLOPPY, UNINSPIRED PLAY DURING THE SEASON'S FIRST HALF FORCES  COACH TO MAKE DISCIPLINE A PART OF THE AZTECS' DAILY DIET.  </P> <P> Halfway through his first season as San Diego State football coach, Al  Luginbill says he is perplexed. He wonders why the same Aztec team that played  UCLA to a virtual draw one week played Cal State Fullerton to a literal draw  the next.  </P> <P> Frustrated by his players' inconsistent play, Luginbill turned this week to the  one method left at his disposal.  </P> <P> He cracked down.  </P> <P> He closed the players' lounge. He made players run extra wind sprints. He  announced a new code of discipline: If one guy makes a mistake, everyone pays  the penalty. He turned what had been a tough practice regimen into a tougher  one.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to be a nice guy anymore," Luginbill said. "Those days are  over."  </P> <P> The first test of that new policy comes tonight at 7:05 when the Aztecs (2-3-1)  play Pacific (1-6) in a nonconference homecoming game at San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium.  </P> <P> Pacific is the kind of team SDSU should beat handily.  </P> <P> The Tigers have not had a winning season since 1977. Injuries have knocked out  their top two running backs. A former tight end is their leading rusher. Their  only victory was over Cal State Long Beach (26-25), a team the Aztecs defeated  last week, 30-26. And the Tigers earned the victory with the help of three  missed extra points by the 49ers.  </P> <P> The problem, Luginbill says, is that the less threatening the opponent, the  less inspired his team has played.  </P> <P> "It is time we handily beat a team we're supposed to beat," Luginbill said.  "This group just plays to the level of the competition."  </P> <P> Overcoming this tendency, Luginbill said, has been the most frustrating task he  has faced in his first six games as SDSU coach. Luginbill said that attitude is  the root of most of what is wrong with his team. He considers his sterner  approach a last effort to turn the Aztecs in the direction he has set.  </P> <P> "If this doesn't work, we are in serious trouble until I can (recruit) 25 more  athletes into this program to go along with the 25 we brought in this year,"  Luginbill said.  </P> <P> Luginbill is frustrated with his inability to turn the Aztecs around quickly.  Yet for all of his disappointments, there are signs of improvement.  </P> <P> By almost every statistical measure, the Aztecs are a better team than they  were last year. The record is improved, the offense is scoring more points and  the defense is allowing fewer. Outside of a 52-36 opening-game loss at Air  Force, they have avoided the kind of lopsided defeats that hastened the end of  Denny Stolz's tenure.  </P> <P> Much of the credit for the improvement should go to junior quarterback Dan  McGwire, freshman running back Darrin Wagner and senior wide receiver Robert  Claiborne. All three redshirted last year. This year, they are causing trouble  for the opposition.  </P> <P> McGwire has 2,082 passing yards and is on pace to break the school season  record of 3,932 yards set by Todd Santos in 1987. Wagner is second on the team  in rushing yards (424) and leads in touchdowns (10) despite being suspended  from last week's game against Long Beach for disciplinary reasons. And  Claiborne is second on the team in receptions with 31 for 532 yards and three  touchdowns.  </P> <P> "Never in my wildest dreams would I figure we would be averaging 500-plus yards  offensively," Luginbill said."And the scary part is we can get much better."  </P> <P> But while the improvement on offense has been dramatic, the defense continues  to struggle. It did not benefit from the same kind of infusion of ready-to-play  talent. The new player who was expected to help the most, cornerback Marlon  Andrews, has been slowed by injuries.  </P> <P> The defense continues to have problems stopping teams late. Only once --  against Air Force in a game in which the Falcons did not need to score -- has  an opponent failed to score in the final 2:39.  </P> <P> UCLA beat the Aztecs, 28-25, with a touchdown with 2:39 remaining. Fullerton  tied them, 41-41, the next week with a field goal on the last play. Hawaii  defeated them, 31-24, two weeks later on a touchdown with 29 seconds left. Utah  and Long Beach also scored touchdowns in the final two minutes.  </P> <P> "I don't like that," Luginbill said. "Our defense has got to understand that  whether we are up or down, that shouldn't happen. "  </P> <P> But there is some reason for optimism. The Aztecs' three losses have been by an  average of 8.7 points, compared with an average of 25 points in the five losses  in their first six games last year.  </P> <P> "As far as effort and playing hard, we have improved drastically in our  defense," Luginbill said. "You look at our last three ballgames -- Utah, Hawaii  and Long Beach -- and our defense has kept us in the football game until the  offense got going."  </P> <P> But statistics without context can be misleading.  </P> <P> The Aztecs have faced a much softer schedule this year. Last year's first six  opponents had a combined record of 13-2 when they played the Aztecs. This year,  opponents are 9-12 at the time they played the Aztecs and only one team, Hawaii  (4-1 two weeks ago), had a winning record.  </P> <P> There have been other areas of concern.  </P> <P> Special teams have disappointed Luginbill, especially because he said they  would be a priority.  </P> <P> The field goal kicking of freshman Andy Trakas has been inconsistent. Trakas  missed six of his first 10 attempts before making his last three against Long  Beach last week, including a career-best 49-yarder. Kickoff coverage has been  spotty. Long snapping has had problems. A bad snap against Long Beach prevented  the Aztecs from getting a punt off deep in their own territory and another  against Hawaii cost them an extra point.  </P> <P> Luginbill said he will put his secondary on the kickoff coverage team tonight  in hopes of improvement.  </P> <P> "We're making it a challenge to them," Luginbill said. "We've worked hard, but  we have to work harder."  </P> <P> That philosophy is a big part of Luginbill's coaching style. He has exacting  requirements and demanding practices. That has not suited everyone.  </P> <P> Since he took over as coach last November, 21 scholarship players have left the  team. Most quit, one had a career-ending injury, and others were removed by  Luginbill for disciplinary or academic reasons.  </P> <P> The majority of the players who left were expected to see little playing time.  Luginbill does not mourn their departure.  </P> <P> "If I have to start all over again, so be it," Luginbill said. "If we don't  have the type of football players who care about their teammates, who care  about being the best they can possibly be, then I don't think we can win  football games."  </P> <P> While Luginbill, 42, tries to instill in the Aztecs a winner's personality, his  own game-day style has been evident.  </P> <P> He waves his arms. He shouts. He greets players on the bench. Once, at Utah, he  was slapped with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after walking on the field  to argue an official's decision.  </P> <P> "I don't try to be a circus out there," Luginbill said. "I am an enthusiastic  guy. I do the same thing in practice. I get after our guys in a positive way. I  have always been that way. That's the only way I know how to coach. I'm not  (Brigham Young's) LaVell Edwards. I'm not going to stand there with my arms  folded. That's not me. That never will be me."  </P> <P> Also, he has developed a reputation as a gambler. If it is fourth-and-short,  expect Luginbill to go for the first down, no matter the field position, the  score, or the time remaining.  </P> <P> Results have been mixed. Some of his gambles have worked, such as a fake punt  that went for a touchdown against UCLA. Others have failed, leaving opponents  with good field position. Regardless, Luginbill says he will continue to take  risks.  </P> <P> But he said his plans for improvement hinge on inspiring his players to  eliminate selfishness.  </P> <P> To make his point, Luginbill cited an example from last Saturday's game against  Long Beach.  </P> <P> "I had a player come off the field the other night who had just caught a nice  18-yard out route," Luginbill said. "Before he goes back to the coach he is  supposed to be with, he sits around the 50-yard line and watches the instant  replay (on the stadium scoreboard). That is what I am talking about. If I catch  any of them watching instant replay, they can walk off the field, through the  gate and out the door because I'm not putting up with that.  </P> <P> "I don't know what creates it, but I know good football teams don't have it. If  I inherited it, then so be it. But that doesn't mean it has to stay that way.  The way you correct it is they either do it your way or you get someone who  does it your way. I know that sounds harsh. But that is also reality."  </P> <P> Halfway through his first season, that is life for Luginbill and the Aztecs.  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> San Diego State tight end Mitch Burton (lower abdominal strain) will be  available but likely will not play, Coach Al Luginbill said. Freshman  linebacker Eric Thompson, who made his first start last week against Cal State  Long Beach, should play despite a bruised shoulder. . . . Holiday Bowl  officials will scout six teams today. The bowl will look at Washington State  (6-1), Arizona (4-2), Michigan State (2-3), Illinois (4-1), Ohio State (3-2)  and West Virginia (4-1-1).  </P> <P> SDSU HALFWAY  </P> <P> 1988 SCORES (1-5)  </P> <P> at UCLA 59, SDSU 6  </P> <P> at SDSU 39, Air Force 36  </P> <P> at Stanford 31, SDSU 10  </P> <P> Oregon 34, at SDSU 13  </P> <P> Wyoming 55, at SDSU 27  </P> <P> Hawaii 32, at SDSU 30  </P> <P> 1989 SCORES (2-3-1)  </P> <P> at Air Force 52, SDSU 36  </P> <P> UCLA 28, at SDSU 25  </P> <P> CS Fullerton 41, at SDSU 41  </P> <P> SDSU 38, at Utah 27  </P> <P> at Hawaii 31, SDSU 24  </P> <P> at SDSU 30, CS Long Beach 26  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE NUMBERS: National rankings in selected categories (through six games) out  of 104 Division I-A schools in 1988 and 106 in 1989.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FOR AZTECS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Category  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net Yds.

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Formidable rivals on a shifting battleground - Despite growth in the size Europe's capital markets and the expertise of its investment banks, they are likely to continue to lag behind their US counterparts In the battle for dominance of global financial services, both the opponents and the battleground have changed since the turn of the decade. For much of the 1980s, European banks saw their main competitors as the Japanese, and the competitive arena as the mainstream business of lending money. Now receding competition from Japan has been replaced by an intrusion from the US, with banks competing to underwrite and trade securities rather than extend loans from their own balance-sheets. This time, it is the big US investment banks, enriched by a boom in US equity and bond markets, which have flocked to Europe to exploit the gradual liberalisation of financial markets. They are proving formidable competitors as Europe struggles to develop a more powerful and integrated financial services industry of its own. The battle to lend money overseas left many casualties. Many banks with international aspirations lost faith after becoming entangled in bad debts and, in many cases, retired nursing wounds. According to the Bank for International Settlements, international bank credit dropped from Dollars 465bn in 1990 to Dollars 80bn the next year. Banks which extended their domestic retail networks abroad lost money as they were too small to achieve economies of scale. Only a few European banks, such as Deutsche Bank and Credit Lyonnais, have maintained a policy of pursuing cross-border retail banking. At the same time, large companies have moved away from raising capital through bank borrowing. Especially in the US, companies have turned to bond and equity markets to raise finance, placing investment banks that help companies raise money from capital markets at the cutting edge. US investment banks start from a strong base. The US has a bigger pool of mobile capital because it is the world's largest economy and has independently-managed pension funds. Such pension funds are not as strong in Europe, outside the UK and the Netherlands. This means European companies - and governments which are privatising state-run enterprises - look to the US for capital, and often hire US investment banks as intermediaries. 'There is no doubt the US banks have an enormous edge there,' says Mr George Mallinkrodt, chairman of the UK investment bank Schroders. 'They talk all the time to a group of investors who are very powerful. There is no conduit like that in Europe, though it will come in time.' Mr Walter Gubert, head of the European management committee for JP Morgan, the US bank, says US capital markets are likely to remain dominant. 'Even if Europe develops stronger flows of capital, the US will, if anything, become a more important source of funds, and European companies will have to take account of that,' he says. Their strong position has allowed the New York investment banks to invest in technology and highly-trained professionals. This has helped to give them an edge in developing capital markets, and in pricing and trading new financial instruments. In the past two years, huge amounts of capital have been flowing out of the US, stimulated by low US interest rates and a search for higher-yield investments. About 5 per cent of US pension fund money - some Dollars 250bn  -has been switched overseas. A further Dollars 800bn would flow out if US funds allocated the same proportion of portfolios to other countries as UK funds. European investment banks such as Paribas in France, Mediobanca in Italy and Schroders and SG Warburg in the UK have strong domestic businesses. But they have drawn many techniques from the US. These include securities underwriting methods; the use of capital to trade on their own rather than clients' behalf; and computer-based pricing models to cal-culate the value of derivative products. Mr Rudi Mueller, chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland in London, says that the power of the US market helps its banks to export home-grown techniques to Europe. 'They still have the largest pool of top professionals, and that means that they can transfer their know-how faster,' he says. The lack of a large pool of mobile capital is not the only challenge facing Europe. Others include: Financial centres: Because Europe has several centres offering securities trading, demand for stocks is fragmented, and the methods of buying and selling them vary. Although competition between centres such as London and Frankfurt may reduce costs to investors, Mr Mueller argues that one market would attract liquidity. 'If we could create a more meaningful European bourse, the cake would grow for everyone,' he says. Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of Paribas, says that the fact that capital markets are not linked makes it difficult for Europe to act as a single force against Japan or the US. 'I think that is a crucial issue for Europe's chance of competing against other regions,' he says. The US, of course, has competing exchanges too, but the size of the US capital market means each can attract enough liquidity to make an efficient market. Conservative companies: European companies rely more on loan finance, and lack expertise in capital markets. Mr Mueller says that European corporate treasurers are catching up, but that 'in the past, the European finance director tended to be more conservative about trying something new'. One area in which European companies lag behind their US counterparts is in gaining ratings from agencies such as Moody's to encourage investors to buy their debt. Some Dollars 545bn was borrowed in the US commercial paper market in 1992, against Dollars 79bn in the Euro-commercial paper market. 'The credit issue is a serious issue for the Euromarket,' says Mr Charles McVeigh, co-head of European investment banking for Salomon Brothers. 'More credit work should be done by financial intermediaries to allow investors to have a broader appreciation of corporate credit risk. The unwillingness of some European companies to obtain credit ratings adds to the problem.' Asset fragmentation: Small assets such as home mortgages, which are often packaged into securities and sold to investors in the US, cannot be bundled together easily in Europe. Because of different jurisdictions and national customs, it is almost impossible to mix assets from various countries. Yet the multinational nature of European capital markets gives both them and investment banks operating within them strengths as well as weaknesses. The fact that they operate across borders within their home region helps to develop techniques that are transferable across the world. With London as the centre of the world's foreign exchange market, European investors have proved more sophisticated in understanding currency risk than US ones. The Eurobond market - through which Dollars 400bn was borrowed last year - is the only large multi-currency bond market. The development of a liquid global swaps market in the 1970s and 1980s, allowing borrowers to exploit cheap financing costs in one currency and then swap the proceeds into a second currency, encouraged opportunistic borrowers from all over the world to tap the Eurobond market. Europe's position between the Asian and US time zones has also proved an advantage. Underwriters of Eurobond issues can start selling into the Far East at 7am, and at 1pm address the US market. The advent of the global bond  -traded and settled in any time zone - has further enhanced this role. European investment banks have gained expertise by having to operate in such complex markets. The heads of such banks also argue that they gain by being consistent, rather than entering markets in profitable times and leaving them when they slacken - a tendency of US banks in the past. Mr Levy-Lang of Paribas says that the bank has an advantage in recruiting staff in volatile markets such as those in the Asia Pacific because of its consistency. 'We can attract some very good people out there who are afraid of the stop-go approach of some of the American banks,' he says. Europeans can also claim advantages from being less aggressive than US banks in using their own capital for trading. Mr Mallinkrodt says this encourages their clients to trust them. 'If you abdicate from putting your capital into markets, the first opportunity goes to the funds that you manage,' he says. Yet the uncomfortable fact is Europe still trails the US in terms of the size of capital markets; the strength and expertise of investment banks; and the amount of capital. In each, Europe's resources are growing, but not necessarily fast enough to catch up with the US.</p>

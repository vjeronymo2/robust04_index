			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by economic reporter Makoto Imazawa: "If </F> Remittances to North Korea Are Stopped, Impact Will Not Be  Small"]    [Text] While tensions are rising over the issue of the  DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear suspicion, the question of banning  remittances to North Korea is being raised. The Foreign  Exchange Control Law governs remittances overseas and, in the  past, there have been instances of remittances banned on Iraq  and Libya pursuant to UN resolutions on sanctions. But among  bank officials there are now growing voices saying, "An impact  from suspension of remittances to North Korea, with which Japan  has deep relations, will be different from those of the past."  <H5>  Ashikaga Bank Is the Sole Channel </H5>   Japanese banks, which want to remit money overseas, need to  have agreements with overseas banks on receiving and paying of  such remittances. This arrangement is called a "correspondent  contract." As far as dealings with North Korea are concerned,  there are now 18 Japanese banks that have such a contract with  Choson Foreign Trade Bank [CFTB] (main office in Pyongyang).    But the correspondent contracts agree only on how the  remittances are instructed and how payment is settled. For  people to be able to actually remit money, they have to have  payments settled at a bank that has an account with the CFTB.    The only Japanese bank that has a two-way deposit account  with the CFTB is said to be Ashikaga Bank (main office in  Utsunomiya city). A banking source explained: "It appears that  the arrangement is made so that not just the Japanese banks but  also all banks throughout the world have to go through Ashikaga  Bank when they remit money to North Korea. The currency dealt  with is not only yen, but all other major currencies, including  dollar and pound." The source added that until last year, money  had been remitted through several banks including London  branches of Asian banks, but "early in the fall last year, North  Korea asked all payments to be made to its account with Ashikaga  Bank.  <H5>  Dollar-Based Remittances Already Suspended </H5>   At the end of March, Ashikaga Bank notified all banks that  it  was suspending its functions as an intermediary for remitting  dollar-based money to North Korea. Until then, banks that  wanted to make dollar-based remittances to North Korea normally  asked Tokyo branches of U.S. banks to pay Ashikaga Bank for it  to make the remittances. But Ashikaga Bank is thought to have  stopped acting as an intermediary as it expected the U.S.  Government's watch on it to grow more wary as a result of the  nuclear issue. However, one said: "Dollar-based remittances to  North Korea were in small amounts to begin with; an impact from  it will be not much." Besides, remittances in yen and pound are  still possible.    A measure to control remittances that the government is  studying now envisions subjecting all remittances overseas from  Japan to government approval, thus tightening flows of money  into North Korea. Article 16 of the Foreign Exchange Control  Law provides that if neccesary, "for faithful implementation of  treaties and other international commitments," the government  can subject the remittances from Japan to other countries to its  approval, and this provision was exercised for the first time  against Iraq in the wake of the Gulf crisis. Since then, it has  been applied on Serbia, Montenegro, Haiti, and Libya.  <H5>  Remittances Through Third Nations Cannot be Controlled </H5>   Among bankers there are voices questioning the effectiveness  of a Japanese Government action intended to stop remittances to  North Korea. They note that if new channels of remittances --  going through such third countries as Hong Kong and China -- are  used, there will be no way of controlling flows of money into  North Korea. A man said: "If the government wants to control  those going through third countries, it will have to watch and  inquire into all remittances overseas. That will take enormous  costs, and it is questionable, despite all that, if the  government can determine what is really happening."    But if all the nations of the world do control remittances  into that country, there is no doubt that it will become  difficult for foreign currencies to flow into that country. In  particular, Japan's suspension of remittances means that the  payment account of Japan's only existing bank with a payment  account [with a North Korean bank] will become useless. As  such, "an impact therefrom will not be small by any means."</p>

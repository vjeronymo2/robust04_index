			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Kiev -- UNIAN has learned that Ukraine's State  Committee for Control of Work Safety in Nuclear Engineering  [Derzhatomnahlyad] disagreed with the safety level assessment of  the fire at the Khmelnitskiy AES given by the State Committee  for the Use of Nuclear Power [Derzhkomatom]. The head of  Derzhatomnahlyad's scientific and technical directorate, Vadym  Hryshchenko, told UNIAN that although the radioactive situation  had not deteriorated, a fire always posed a potential threat of  weakening safety control systems in the power unit. Therefore,  this case should be classified on the international scale of  incidents as first level, not zero level. Derzhatomnahlyad has  reported its verdict to the International Atomic Energy Agency.  [passage omitted]</p>

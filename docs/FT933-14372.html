			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: L&amp;G in demand General and life insurance group Legal &amp; General moved sharply ahead on a squeeze and positive sentiment from several brokers, ahead of the imminent publication of new business figures. The stock closed 13 ahead at 500p after relatively heavy turnover of 2m shares. Specialists expect the figures to be positive and Charterhouse Tilney yesterday joined other brokers in reiterating its positive stance on the stock. The good sentiment in the sector also boosted several other life stocks. These included London &amp; Manchester, which advanced 10 to 343p, and Prudential, 4 better at 339p. Bargain hunters in both General Accident and Commercial Union helped the shares bounce 9 to 622p and 11 to 615p respectively. Cazenove was also reported to have recommended both stocks. In a perky drinks sector, Bass was the outstanding performer, advancing 11 to 460p in good turnover of 3.4m. The shares had fallen heavily at the end of last week on derisory talk that a promotion by the company's Holiday Inn subsidiary had sparked a Hoover-type situation. But yesterday Bass was reassuring the market that the offer - involving discounts for US visitors to Europe - was going well and the shares responded accordingly. Storms in the US pushed corn prices higher and cheered Grand Metropolitan, the shares rising 7 to 415p. Greene King continued to respond to favourable comment after last week's results, closing 7 to the good at 415p. The White Paper on Sunday trading had little effect on consumer shares, with most of those affected already factoring in the government's positive stance. Rank Organisation lost 4 to 759p, with Hoare Govett underlining its caution on the stock ahead of tomorrow's interim figures. The market is forecasting a range of Pounds 88m to Pounds 94m. The expectation of a success on the BT3 sale attracted investors to SG Warburg, the global co-ordinator of the sale. The shares jumped 16 to 734p. Abbey National gave up 3 to 414p, with SG Warburg Securities said to have taken the stock off its buy list. Turnover in conglomerate Tomkins jumped to 10m as several brokers issued 'buy' recommendations on the shares. The stock, which on Monday achieved the dubious honour of being the biggest faller in the FT-SE 100 Index, after it reported figures, rallied 6 1/2 to 219p. NatWest Securities said: 'The continuing cost reductions in RHM should help to ensure good profits growth over the next two to three years.' Profit-taking in Lonrho left the shares 3 lighter at 131p. Water issues were mixed following the publication of the report by regulatory body Ofwat on water charges. Analysts said the 7 per cent real return on capital seen as necessary to secure adequate financial ratios in the sector could imply greater long-term profits in the sector than previously expected. There was relief that the timescale for costly improvements is likely to be longer than previously supposed. Among those staying in positive territory, Northumbrian added 5 at 573p and Yorkshire 7 at 497p. Strong bargain hunting lifted Tiphook ahead of today's eagerly awaited figures. The shares gained 12 at 286p. Solid demand from UK institutions saw British Steel put on 3 at 96 1/2 p in trade of 7.9m. Continued hopes that an order for Airbus aircraft will be accompanied by an order for Rolls-Royce engines to power the aircraft boosted the shares 1 1/2 to 144p. Worries over its European markets mentioned at the company's annual meeting hurt Johnson Matthey, discounting a recommendation from Hoare Govett. The shares eased a penny to 455p. The Sun's aggressive pricing campaign continued to inflict injuries on its competitors, with United Newspapers proving the market's main casualty. The publisher of the Daily Star and Daily Express lost 14 to close at 521p, while Mirror Group Newspapers dipped 2 to 151p. News International, owner of The Sun, moved up a penny to 216p. The successful outcome in the rights issue by Hammerson generated upward movement in property issues. The 97 per cent take-up of the Hammerson issue spurred the 'A' shares upwards by 7 to 305p. British Land appreciated 4 to 337p, Land Securities also moved up 4, taking it to 586p, and MEPC added 7 at 434p. One specialist said the take-up was a little better than expected after slight hesitation that Hammerson's offer would match those from other property companies in a long series of cash calls. Investors were unmoved by Great Portland Estates' plans to review its relationship with its managing agents after negative press reports on the arrangement. Its share price had moved ahead a penny to 173p in early trading on the Hammerson wave and stuck at that level after the plan was announced at the company's annual meeting. A buy note from James Capel stirred up brisk activity in Taylor Woodrow, which moved forward 5 to 100p in volume of 3m. In textiles, Jacques Vert, the women's fashions designer and retailer, strengthened 13 to 100p on the back of a bounce in profits and a large increase in the dividend. Sherwood Group dropped 11 to 136p. Recent downgradings and fears over its lace sales in Europe and performances in its sock division were blamed.</p>

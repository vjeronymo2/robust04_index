			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CAROL BURNETT'S COMEDY ANTHOLOGY BOWS ON NBC  </P> <P> "Carol &amp; Company" is more mystery than comedy, the mystery being why she  decided to do this series in the first place.  </P> <P> Before giving it a regular time slot at 10 p.m. on April 14, NBC is first  testing the waters with special previews of "Carol &amp; Company" tonight and  April 7 at 9:30 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39.  </P> <P> This is a comedy anthology performed in front of a studio audience, with  Burnett starring in a different sketch (it's really more that than a teleplay)  each week, supported by a regular company.  </P> <P> "Carol &amp; Company" affirms that even someone as skilled at comedy as Burnett  is only as good as her writers, and they let her down in the first two  programs, which are dreadful. Tonight she plays a woman who hires a company  from the Yellow Pages named Hit Parade Parties to murder her womanizing husband  (Richard Kind). The hit man (Terry Kiser) turns out to be especially  relentless.  </P> <P> Next week Burnett plays a transsexual, a former high school  quarterback-turned-female who jolts her old classmates at their 25th reunion.  The most shocked is the former man's former girlfriend, a drunk played by  Swoosie Kurtz.  </P> <P> Tonight's program is bad enough in being merely unfunny. Next week's is even  worse, for in addition to being unfunny, it clumsily attempts to be poignant.  </P> <P> Although it's hard measuring the abilities of a repertory company that's given  such little script support, everyone knows what Burnett can do. But she's not  given the chance to do it here. These are different times, and Burnett is an  actress who apparently wants to pursue a different brand of comedy than "The  Carol Burnett Show" that gave America such memorably funny sketches from 1967  to 1979 on CBS.  </P> <P> Just the same, when she's out there now, you somehow wish Harvey Korman, Tim  Conway and Vicki Lawrence were with her.

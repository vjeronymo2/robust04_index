			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew in Pounds 46.5m Nivea sale SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the healthcare and toiletries company, has sold its share of the Nivea skincare product brand to its joint venture partner, Beirsdorf of Hamburg, for Pounds 46.5m. The UK-based company will continue to distribute Nivea products in the UK, South Africa and Commonwealth countries where it owns the brand and it will continue to manufacture in Australia and South Africa where Beirsdorf has no production facilities. Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said that because profits from Nivea were relatively low, the interest on the sale proceeds combined with the profits from distribution would be greater than the profits stream from ownership of its part of the brand. 'This is part of a wider strategy to focus on our healthcare businesses and yet maintain our critical mass in the consumer business in the UK,' Mr Robinson said. Smith &amp; Nephew's Nivea sales were Pounds 20m last year. Beirsdorf had sales of over Pounds 300m in the rest of the world. Mr Robinson said the sale represented a p/e multiple of 29 times and his company was also retaining an income stream. Smith &amp; Nephew's consumer products division, which includes its Nivea brands, was hit by recession in the UK. This division helped restrict the increase in pre-tax profits to only 6 per cent. The group sees its greatest potential in its core orthopaedic and wound bandaging healthcare division.</p>

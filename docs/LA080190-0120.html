			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FUNDAMERICA FAITHFUL CHEER 'RESURRECTION';  </P> <P> INVESTORS: THOUSANDS FLOCK TO COSTA MESA HOTEL TO HEAR NEW LEADER SAY COMPANY  ACCUSED AS PYRAMID SCHEME WILL RISE AGAIN.  </P> <P> Thousands of Fund-America members poured into a hotel here Tuesday night for  what author and economic forecaster Howard Ruff called the "rebirth and the  resurrection" of the controversial company that was raided by security  regulators two weeks ago for allegedly being a pyramid scheme.  </P> <P> In his nearly two-hour presentation, Ruff, who replaced Robert T. Edwards as  president and CEO on Monday, said that he had not ruled out taking the company  into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, though he felt confident  he could restore the firm and had plans to actually take it public in the next  few years.  </P> <P> "That's the way I'm going to become sincerely rich," said Ruff, who disclosed  that he has cancer. ". . . The company isn't dead; it's just in a coma."  </P> <P> He said he'd decided to take over the company because "I had an obligation to  protect my friends." Some 1,500 subscribers to Ruff's financial newsletter, the  Ruff Times, have joined FundAmerica.  </P> <P> The audience was enthusiastic about Ruff's speech.  </P> <P> "I'm very positive," said Mark Guest, a 25-year-old FundAmerica member from  Monarch Beach, who says he has made a six-figure income with the company.  </P> <P> Ruff was greeted with a standing ovation and whistles. His circus barker-type  presentation was transmitted via telephone lines to 15,000 FundAmerica members  in eight states.  </P> <P> Ruff told all members they were not permitted to talk to the media under any  circumstances or they would lose their membership.  </P> <P> Edwards -- who founded the company in 1986 -- was arrested July 19 by Florida  authorities on charges he was running an illegal pyramid scheme. If he is  convicted, he could face more than 30 years in jail.  </P> <P> Released on a $1-million bond, Edwards has disputed the charges. He did not  attend Tuesday night's meeting.  </P> <P> Ruff disclosed that the company's cash crunch is even more severe than  previously thought. First Interstate Bank, which FundAmerica entrusted with $11  million in deposits, has seized those funds and is refusing to release them,  according to Ruff. He called on members to register their outrage with the bank  and said he would not hesitate to sue. "You cannot ambush us and not pay a  price," he said.  </P> <P> Even though money is tight, Ruff said, the company will refund dues to any  members who joined after May 15, if they want out of the company.  </P> <P> FundAmerica released a statement earlier this week saying that Ruff and some of  his associates intended to inject capital into the beleaguered company.  However, on Tuesday, Ruff declined to reveal the identities of his  "influential, wealthy friends" who were going to invest in the company.  </P> <P> He did announce his intention to overhaul the company's sales force, tightening  up some of its practices to ensure that they comply with state laws.  </P> <P> Ruff is best known for predicting a period of economic distress in the 1980s,  which turned out to be a prosperous period. He authored the 1978 bestseller  "How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years " as well as "Famine and Survival  in America."  </P> <P> FundAmerica -- which does business in eight states -- is under investigation in  at least three of them.  </P> <P> Florida officials charge the company has no real product and exists solely as a  pyramid scheme, using membership dues from new investors to pay bonuses to  existing ones. The company has vehemently denied the charge, saying its  principal business is obtaining cash rebates for its members. Because it has so  many members -- about 100,000 -- the company says it can get major discounts by  buying in bulk.  </P> <P> The entire rebate system is rigged -- according to regulators -- because  FundAmerica subsidizes the rebates offered by companies such as Citibank with  the money of new investors. Once the company failed to attract new investors,  it would have collapsed, according to regulators.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a federal judge in San Francisco modified a total freeze on  FundAmerica's assets, which was made following the filing of a class-action  lawsuit against the company seeking more than $150 million in damages on behalf  of its members.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel decided Tuesday that FundAmerica could spend  more than $1 million of $17 million in several bank accounts so it could meet  payroll and severance obligations.  </P> <P> But Patel refused a request by the company to pay some $5 million in  commissions to its sales representatives. She did say, however, that it could  pay each representative up to $3,000 in commissions.  </P> <P> FundAmerica charges $140 for a basic membership but pays bonuses to members  recruiting new blood. Bringing in new people is the principal way people  achieved overnight success through the company.  </P></p>

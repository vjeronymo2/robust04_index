			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Further inflow of capital gives boost to Lloyd's The flow of extra corporate capital into Lloyd's of London accelerated yesterday when two new quoted companies announced they had raised a total of nearly Pounds 40m and a third said it hoped to find Pounds 30m in the next week. However, the boost to Lloyd's efforts at increasing corporate investment was marred by the failure of Wellington Underwriting, whose share placing was delayed several times, to reach its Pounds 30m target. Wellington is the first 'dedicated' company - investing only in syndicates run by one managing agency and, in effect, an embryonic insurance company - to obtain a UK market listing. Mr Anthony Cooper, chief executive of the Wellington managing agency, blamed the unsettled state of the UK new issues market for disrupting its plans. But the failure of Lloyd's ruling council to approve new rules on corporate investors buying shares in each other prevented Wellington raising an extra Pounds 4m-Pounds 5m. Wellington managed to raise a total of Pounds 17.25m via a placing, including contributions from the US and Germany. The new Lloyd's companies have not been helped by the lacklustre share performance of similar investment vehicles launched last year. However, Euclidian, another new quoted company, raised Pounds 20m for a range of Lloyd's syndicates. Euclidian's attractiveness to investors was enhanced by an innovative risk-sharing agreement with Centre Re, the Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary of Zurich Insurance, which will allow Euclidian to underwrite insurance policies paying premiums of Pounds 80m, four times the gross capital raised. Separately, Kiln, one of the largest managing agencies at Lloyd's, launched a pathfinder prospectus for Kiln Capital, another dedicated company, which it expects to be listed in London. It plans to raise up to Pounds 30m via a placing and offer to some Names on Kiln syndicates. Kiln Capital plans to invest exclusively in Kiln syndicates and hopes to tempt investors by offering the prospect of higher returns than the market average. Mr Andrew Fleming-Williams, a Kiln director, said: 'We have been consistently better in the past and we will try very hard to continue to do that.' Head Insurance Investors, an affiliate of John Head, the New York merchant bank, has agreed to subscribe to about 10 per cent of Kiln Capital ordinary shares. Kiln has set next Thursday as impact day with dealings expected to start a week later.</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PIZZA HUT SUED BY FRANCHISER  </P> <P> National Pizza Co. has filed suit in Sedgwick County District Court against  Pizza Hut, which is trying to block National Pizza's attempt to acquire a chain  of fast-seafood restaurants.  </P> <P> National Pizza, based in Pittsburg, Kan., is the largest U.S. franchiser of  Pepsico Inc.'s Pizza Hut restaurants. Its sole business has been operating  Pizza Hut franchises.  </P> <P> The company last month made an unsolicited offer to buy Skipper's Inc. for  $9.25 a share, or approximately $27 million. Skipper's, which operates 213  restaurants in the western United States and British Columbia, has rejected the  offer.  </P> <P> On Monday, Pizza Hut officials advised National Pizza in a letter that the  acquisition of Skipper's would violate its franchise agreement with Pizza Hut,  said J. J. Fitzsimmons, chief financial officer for National Pizza, which  operates more than 225 restaurants.  </P> <P> "We responded asking for specifics on how it would violate the agreement, and  they declined to provide details," Fitzsimmons said. Rather than wait for Pizza  Hut to respond, National Pizza went to court on Tuesday in an effort to resolve  the matter, Fitzsimmons said.  </P></p>

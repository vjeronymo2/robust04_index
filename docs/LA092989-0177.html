			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCHEME CAME IN 'A DREAM,' BAKKER SAYS;  </P> <P> FUND-RAISING MOST BURDENSOME TASK, PTL FOUNDER TESTIFIES  </P> <P> PTL founder Jim Bakker testified today that the fund-raising technique at the  heart of his fraud and conspiracy trial occurred to him in the middle of the  night as "a vision or a dream."  </P> <P> "I think fund-raising was my most burdensome job," Bakker testified. "It never  left me. You never ever, ever get away from the pressure that you have to raise  funds for next week, next month, next year."  </P> <P> When he left PTL, the budget was $160 million a year, "which I think boils down  to $3 million a week," Bakker said in his first appearance on the stand.  </P> <P> Under questioning by defense attorney George T. Davis, Bakker described the  roots of his PTL ministry in a low voice. At one point, when he looked at  Davis, the lawyer pointed for him to look directly at the jury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wife, Children Absent  </P> <P> Neither his wife, Tammy Faye, nor his two children, were in the courtroom when  Bakker testified.  </P> <P> After describing his early years as an evangelist, Bakker talked about his  vision to build the 2,400-acre Heritage USA Christian retreat.  </P> <P> "The vision from God was to build a modern Christian campground where people  could worship, attend seminars and workshops," Bakker said.  </P> <P> As the ministry grew, he said, "we needed to build. In the middle of the night  I woke up. It was a vision or a dream, I don't know. God gave me the concept of  the Heritage Grand Partner Center, and I began to sketch it."  </P> <P> He later described the same event. "I woke up in the morning and began to write  down the concept of lifetime partnerships. I brought the concept to my staff  and showed it to some vice presidents and accountants. I asked them if it would  work and they said yes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Sales Transactions  </P> <P> Bakker is accused of bilking followers of $158 million through the sale of the  $1,000 partnerships, which typically entitled holders to three nights' lodging  a year in PTL hotels near Ft. Mill, S.C.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys have claimed that the partnerships were not sales  transactions and that the money paid for them constituted gifts to the  ministry.  </P> <P> In their presentation, prosecutors presented several PTL partners who said they  sometimes were turned away when they tried to use their lodging benefits.  Prosecutors contend that Bakker oversold the partnerships and diverted $3.7  million of the money to himself.  </P> <P> Bakker resigned from his ministry in a sex and money scandal in 1987 and is  charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.  </P></p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Period-instruments play at the Proms Wednesday's Prom offered Mozart's great if incomplete Mass K427 and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, both in C minor - which enhanced the contrasts between them. But what lent the concert a quite particular interest, obviously (for it was sold out), was the performers: John Eliot Gardiner, his period 'Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique' and his Monteverdi Choir, not to mention the distinguished soloists for the Mozart. Period-instrument playing is hugely, unrecognisably better than it was even ten years ago, let alone 20 or 30. Allowances no longer have to be made. The ORR, only four years old now, has been delivering memorable performances already for Gardiner. This is not a day-to-day orchestra; its concerts are special events, scrupulously prepared and repeated in various capitals. Beethoven's Fifth in the Albert Hall must nevertheless be a severe challenge for the relatively soft-toned instruments: in that vast space, would they sound tame and frail? I confess that I listened at home to Radio 3, expecting to hear more of them that way. Judging by the satisfied roar of the audience at the end, that was an unnecessary precaution. Anything the orchestra lacked in sheer weight (not much; their numbers were increased for the occasion) was fully compensated by swift, clean lines and confident purpose. Gardiner has been picking over a new edition carefully, and many details were freshly lit up - sometimes just by the period timbres. The modern piccolo in the Finale, for example, usually sounds like a steam-whistle; here, it was woody and gurgly, less shrill but more telling. We expected Gardiner to give full value to Beethoven's 'con brio' for the first movement, and he did. Quick and urgent, but crackling with controlled energy; still more for the 'con moto' Andante, which lost nothing of its gravity to the conductor's unhesitating tempo. The different instrumental choirs were pungently contrasted, excellently balanced. The Finale was not an excited race, but a steady build-up of exuberance that reached explosion-point just before the end. We hear the Fifth rather a lot, but it is rare to hear it brought off so excitingly. The Mozart must have been easier. In fact it was often idyllically beautiful. Gardiner is sometimes accused of a certain coldness, or at least coolness, in tender music; but with sopranos like Sylvia McNair and Anne Sophie von Otter - the one bright and limpid, the other darker, even slightly languid - there was no risk of that. The 'Christe Eleison' and the 'Et incarnatus' (at least one of them intended for Mozart's wife Constanze) were especially lovely passages in a continuously lovely reading of the score. In smaller roles the tenor Christoph Pregardien made his mark in the trio, and Alastair Miles provided a staunch bass; the Monteverdi Choir sang warmly and elegantly. One should have been there.</p>

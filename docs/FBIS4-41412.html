			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- The Russian Government has  approved amendments to the existing legislature at its session  today. A law on the status of servicemen was adopted  practically without debates and a resolution was adopted to  submit the law to the president for signing.    If the Russian president signs the law, amendments will be  made to Russian laws on pensions, freedom of religion, income  tax, tax on property and land, law on employment and the land  code of the Russian Federation.    These amendments will give a number of privileges in social  welfare to servicemen and their families, envisaged by the  Russian law on the status of servicemen, taking into account the  specifics of a military service.    In an interview to journalists after the government session  was over, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said that all  privileges earlier granted to servicemen will remain in force.</p>

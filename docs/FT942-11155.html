			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rwandan farming programme threatened Scientists working for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture, based in Colombia, are urging the resumption of one of Africa's most successful agricultural programmes - the growing of climbing beans, developed in Latin America in the Great Lakes region of Rwanda, Burundi and western Zaire. Beans are staple of the Rwandan diet and the introduction of climbing beans, which grow upward on stakes in farmers' fields, has tripled yields in a country where farmers average only one-half to one hectare each and 500 impoverished people live on each square kilometre of rural lend. Production has risen by at least 33,000 tonnes, worth USDollars 18m. The bloody civil war has put the entire scheme at risk. One plant breeder, Dr Wayne Youngquist, was evacuated in a convoy of 75 cars and then airlifted to Kenya. Dr Robin Buruchara, a plant pathologist, was in Kenya when the fighting began and has been unable to return. According to Dr Youngquist, most of the bean crop in southern Rwanda was lost to drought last year. When the fighting broke out early last month the rains were good. The next harvests are five to nine weeks away. 'If we can get back into Rwanda within a month - before the weeds take over  -we can continue the programme without losing much. But right now, people worry more about their lives than weeds,' said Dr Youngquist. To keep the bean programme going, the tropical agriculture centre temporarily moved operations to Burundi, where they are multiplying seeds to send to Rwandan farmers when the fighting ends.</p>

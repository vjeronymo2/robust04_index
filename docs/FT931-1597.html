			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Japan's banks under heavy pressure JAPAN'S leading banks plan to declare non-performing loans of about Y15,000bn (Pounds 87bn) at the end of this month, up from Y12,300bn in September, suggesting that the banking system is still under extreme pressure from the collapse of the property and stock markets. But the Y15,000bn figure, about 4.8 per cent of total loans, does not indicate the true burden on the leading 21 banks, which will not include bad loans carried by affiliated financial companies. The figure, to be formally published by the Ministry of Finance, also does not reflect the damage done to most Japanese banks by loans on which interest rates have been cut to almost zero in an attempt to prop up a collapsed company. Japanese banks, whose bad loans are unofficially estimated at Y30,000bn, plan to use an increase in operating profits this year to write off or make provision for these loans, but they are being discouraged from large-scale write-offs by a nervous Finance Ministry. Under the ministry's guidance to banks, 'restructured' loans, or those on which interest rates have been cut, do not show up in the non-performing figures and, for taxation purposes, the banks can claim the lost interest as a 'business expense'. That means a bank may have slashed the interest rate to 0.5 per cent or less for a company which may never recover from the financial excesses of the late 1980s, but the favourable tax treatment encourages the institution to sit on the loan in the hope that it may turn good. The leading 21 banks - 11 commercial banks, seven trust banks, and three long-term credit banks - are still finalising non-performing loan figures for the fiscal year ending this month, but three institutions said yesterday the total would be around Y15,000bn. Ms Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, said some of these banks would like to write off more of their exposure, but had no incentive to do so. She said the Finance Ministry was reluctant to highlight the difference between healthy and unhealthy banks by adopting a broader definition of 'non-performing'.

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Arts: Wrestling with ghosts - Poetry in performance THIS week the Poetry Society hosted a tribute to Sidney Keys, a poet who died exactly 50 years ago in the Tunisian Campaign at the age of 20, just two weeks into his active service. The evening was as much a meeting of old friends and an opportunity to exchange reminiscences as an account of the poet's life and work. Keys' editor Michael Meyer and the poet John Heath-Stubbs were the presenters. Both men had been friends of Keys at Oxford, where he read history for five terms until the war beckoned. Their memories of half a century ago were impressively sharp. According to Meyer, Keys, although a man who tended to prefer the companionship of books to that of the living, was amiable enough - if at times a little dour. In 1941, Meyer and Keys edited a volume of undergraduate poetry together entitled Eight Oxford Poets. Keys excluded from it the work of another Oxford contemporary, Philip Larkin, on the grounds of quality - a judgment with which the wearisomely uncritical Andrew Motion, Larkin's official biographer, concurs. This painful exclusion caused Larkin to speak with bitterness of Keys, and to denigrate his reputation, until the end of his life. Keys worked hard at his poetry and had developed a mature voice and manner by the time of his death. He described himself in a late letter as 'an uncomfortable metaphysical without roots', who would rather have been born in 19th century Oxfordshire than near London between the wars. That remark draws attention both to his achievements as a nature poet in the manner of Clare and Wordsworth, and to his interests in philosophy and symbolism, where his masters were the German poet Rilke and WB Yeats. Keys wrote much about death as his own approached, borrowing from Rilke the idea that it is a creature that lives within us with whom it is necessary to come to terms. In fact, his poetry as a whole wrestles as much with ghosts and angels as it does with men - which strikes the reader as strangely, if not disturbingly, premonitory. 'Poets who die in battle tend to get praised for the wrong reasons, especially by elderly non-combatants,' quipped Meyer. Sidney Keys, though sentimentalised after his death, has not so much been praised for the wrong reasons as largely forgotten, which is an injustice because his poetry at its best has enduring qualities and his war poetry, though none of it written during his brief period of active service, was driven, like Wilfred Owen's, by an identification with the helpless conscript. Michael Mayer, a powerful, stocky man who squares up to the lectern like an old-time pugilist, read the poems in a gruff, driving baritone. It was a reading quickened and rendered that much more poignant by his own fond memories of a long-dead friend who had 'an inner sanctum to which I couldn't penetrate'. It is three years since Sinclair-Stevenson launched its own poetry list, and the publication of four new titles was celebrated by a reading - also at the Poetry Society - this month. It was an eclectic occasion: the poet John Fuller read the last poems of his father (who died last year) with a dry, donnish restraint which seemed entirely appropriate to the material: casual philosophical reveries that explored such themes as the mysteries of the energies of art and the paradoxes of old age. These poems are the products of a mind taking wing after the third drink of the evening as dusk begins to settle over suburban Blackheath. The best of Sinclair-Stevenson's new poets was undoubtedly William Scammell  -who is scarcely a new poet at all, being 54 years old and having already published six collections. Scammell is a poet of wit and fixed intellectual convictions whose work encompasses politics, literature - and being a Lakesman, landscape poetry. Scammell looks boozy and disreputable; and he has put all this broad experience of life to good use in his robust, inventive and iconoclastic verse. Roy Fuller's Last Poems and William Scammell's Five Easy Pieces are published by Sinclair-Stevenson at Pounds 14.99 and Pounds 7.99 respectively.</p>

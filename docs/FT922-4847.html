			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Dentists' NHS fees to be cut by 7% DENTISTS' fees are to be cut by 7 per cent as part of a government package to bring their income closer to review body recommendations, Alan Pike writes. The British Dental Association warned last night that up to 40 per cent of dentists would turn away National Health Service patients as a result of the decision. Dentists' representatives will this weekend consider holding a ballot on whether to refuse NHS treatment to some patients. The government is imposing the reduction in fees and other restrictions because it says dentists' income is exceeding the intentions of the review body.</p>

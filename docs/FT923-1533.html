			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / People: Sir Eric Pountain steps back from full-time role Sir Eric Pountain is to become non-executive chairman of TARMAC at the end of this year. Until last year Sir Eric combined the role of chief executive and chairman, but relinquished day-to-day running of the company when Neville Simms was appointed chief executive. This followed criticism of Sir Eric's stewardship of Britain's biggest housebuilder during the late 1980s when the expansion of its UK housebuilding operations left it exposed to the collapse of house prices and sales. Yesterday Sir Eric said that the appointment of Neville Simms had worked out very well for both of them, but 'I have found lately that there is not enough for me to do on a full-time basis. I also intend to accept other non-executive directorships.' Sir Eric's career moves mirror those of Sir Clifford Chetwood, the former chief executive and chairman of WIMPEY who, in November 1990, stood down as chief executive in favour of Joe Dwyer who, like Simms, is battling to reduce group debt through a programme of disposals and tighter control over spending. The question is whether these are the final acts of both men. Sir Eric is 60 next year - the normal retirement age for Tarmac executives. Recently, there has been speculation over Sir Clifford's role as non-executive chairman of Wimpey following the appointment of Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays Bank, as a non-executive director. ***** Keith Egerton, md of TAYLOR WOODROW Property Company, has been appointed chairman following the resignation of Peter Hedges. ***** Philip Brown has been appointed group company secretary of HARRISON &amp; CROSFIELD. ***** Graham Wilson, managing director of United Newspapers and chairman of its Extel Financial subsidiary, has resigned from the board of Extel Group, which retains a small preferential share listing - a hangover from United's 1987 bid for Extel. Charles Stern, United Newspapers' new finance director, replaces Wilson on the board of Extel Group, a non-trading company. ***** Sheila Forbes, formerly group personnel director of Storehouse, has been appointed director of human resources at REED INTERNATIONAL.</p>

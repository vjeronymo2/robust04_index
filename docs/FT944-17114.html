			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Poor start to final quarter deepens gloom - London The spread of forecasts by City analysts for the FT-SE 100 Share Index on December 31 has widened to astonishing proportions as a poor start to the final quarter has deepened the market's gloom. Fund managers are at present invited to place their faith in a range of Footsie forecasts between 2,840 - well, 2,200 if we really want to get bearish - and 3,600. Such a wide spread suggests that the stock market is becoming a victim of its own nervousness. Shares are still reacting very sharply to the slightest hint of discomfort at the Federal Reserve and the futures markets continue to throw the underlying equities around as if individual companies were no longer of any significance. Nor is there much sign that this week will fare any better. Markets have to face a barrage of important economic data both at home and in the US, with the regular meeting of the Bundesbank policy council thrown in for good measure. And then analysts can brace themselves for the UK Budget scheduled for late November. However, there is still a strong bullish tendency in the UK market, willing and able to defend Footsie year-end targets in the 3,400 area. Technical factors in the market are by no means entirely negative. UK bonds, the recognised key to an equity recovery, have remained relatively steady, and there was a passive response to Friday's much-dreaded US payroll numbers. Derivative Securities, which tracks trends from the viewpoint of the futures markets, has repeated its belief that the UK stock market remains 'very oversold,' and that support levels are very close, indicating that further downside appears fairly limited. Trading volumes, while not exciting, have not been as poor as painted in some quarters. Retail business remains steadily above Pounds 1bn a day, and the fall-off in private investor business is no threat to big securities firms. The problems for market-makers have come from the risks of taking on trading programmes in these troubled times. These risks have fed through to the stock index futures market, where the unwillingness of the big institutions to play has left power and influence in the hands of the independent traders, the locals, who now stand accused, not for the first time, of being able and willing to move share prices at will. Experience would suggest that the market cannot be manipulated over anything but a very short time-span. If the bond market turns, then all the arguments about corporate earnings growth of nearly 50 per cent between 1994 and 1996, enabling companies to raise dividends by around 10 per cent in each of the next two years, will be back in focus. But first we have to survive this week's economic data.</p>

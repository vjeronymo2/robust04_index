NRC has made a determination that events involving an actual loss or significant reduction in the degree of protection against radioactive properties of source, special nuclear, and by-product material are abnormal occurrences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The report to Congress is for the first calendar quarter of 1994. The report identifies the occurrences or events that the Commission determined to be significant and reportable; the remedial actions that were undertaken are also described. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This report addresses seven abnormal occurrences (AOs) at NRC-licensed facilities. One involved inoperable main steam isolation valves at a boiling water reactor, four involved medical brachytherapy misadministrations, one involved a medical teletherapy misadministration, and one involved four lost reference sources. One AO that was reported by an Agreement State is also discussed; the information is current as of April 25, 1994. This event involved a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical misadministration. The report also contains updates on seven AOs previously reported by NRC licensees and one AO previously reported by an Agreement State licensee. For the period January 1 to March 31, 1994, no new ``Other Events of Interest'' were reported but an update to a previously reported therapeutic misadministration is included. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the report is available for inspection or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW.

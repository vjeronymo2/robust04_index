			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["A.B." report: "Europe: The Conference on the Continent's </F> Stability: Averting the Yugoslav Syndrome"]    [Text] The Conference on Stability in Europe started  yesterday in Paris with the wish expressed by Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur to make every effort to ensure that minority or  border conflicts in East Europe do not turn into open conflicts  as in the former Yugoslavia.    A little more than a year after proposing the idea in his  general policy statement, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur opened  the Conference on Stability in Europe in Paris yesterday, which  has the aim of establishing a preventive diplomacy on the Old  Continent. In a brief opening speech, Mr. Balladur argued for a  "pragmatic and preventive diplomatic method," which he  contrasted with the "big institutional maneuvers or arrangements  which are often ephemeral." Although the conference, which is  being attended by 53 delegations, seems inevitably haunted by  the Bosnian conflict, the French prime minister expressed the  desire to make every effort to ensure that minority or border  conflicts in East Europe do not turn into open conflicts like  the war in the former Yugoslavia. This war, in which Europe has  displayed its powerlessness to restore peace, is "a real lesson  of what we can no longer tolerate," Edouard Balladur said.  Referring to the criticisms of those who think that the  proposed Pact for Stability is not "ambitious enough," he said  that "we have experienced too many good intentions in the past  which were not followed through." Mr. Balladur recalled in this  connection the Kellog-Briand Pact concluded after World War I to  "outlaw war," or the "very complete range of provisions made by  the League of Nations at the same time to deal, unsuccessfully,  with minority questions [quotemarks as published]. The prime  minister also argued for a "different European society," adding  that we must "start by eliminating old quarrels, by dispelling  old fears." He also stressed that "nobody would be made to do  anything he did not wish to do" during the negotiations,  implicitly rejecting the criticism that the Pact on Security  could reopen old disputes in East Europe. The French Government  chief reaffirmed, in this connection, the principle of  "territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders." With  regard to national, ethnic, and religious minorities, the rights  of the individual must be accompanied by a "duty of loyalty"  toward the country of which they are nationals.    The prime minister also addressed his remarks to Russia,  which expressed once again yesterday its reservations about the  Pact for Stability. This plan, he stressed several times, is  not intended to push Moscow to the fringes. The desire of many  Central and East European countries to join the European Union  [EU] must go hand-in-hand with the development of "very close  relations with Russia," he said, adding that the "future big  Europe" should maintain "preferential partnership relations"  with Moscow.    However, Russia yesterday gave a cool reception to the Pact  for Stability in Europe at a time when Paris and Bonn are  proposing to strengthen ties between the Twelve and the  countries of the former Soviet bloc which want to be anchored  more firmly in the West.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said that his  country  gave preference to the CSCE process, which has involved all the  continent's countries since 1975.    "It is clear that the process launched in Paris on the basis  of the Twelve plus nine formula (EU and the East European  countries likely to join it) is unique. It does not create a  precedent for the future," Mr. Kozyrev warned. Russia has  several times expressed its anxiety at being pushed to the  fringes faced with the EU's power of attraction for its former  satellites.    In Edouard Balladur's view, the "objective" is to see the  Pact for Stability signed "by the beginning of next year, in  February for instance." However, the prime minsiter took the  precaution of adding that it might "possibly take longer."  Indeed, in European circles, some diplomats are casting doubt  on the ability to finalize the pact before mid-1995, and  especially before the [French] presidential election.  Furthermore, this is a period in which France will take over  the presidency of the EU. Mr. Balladur also stressed that the  proposed pact had "immediately received the president of the  Republic's approval" and thanked Alain Juppe, his foreign  minsiter, for the efforts he has made to ensure its success.    In addition, in an interview with LE MONDE, Chancellor  Helmut  Kohl and the French prime minister jointly suggested "inviting  the heads of state and of government of the candidate countries  once a year" to a meeting with the EU members to discuss  "questions of common interest and thus extend cooperation." The  two heads of government think that "the Union has the historical  duty and common objective of helping the Central and East  European countries which are implementing reforms to rejoin the  European family."    This initiative aimed at involving the candidate countries  in  the EU's work is, it must be stressed, a German initiative. In  practice it should result in the presence of the four members of  the Visegrad group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovak  Republic) at the next European Council meeting in Essen next  December.</p>

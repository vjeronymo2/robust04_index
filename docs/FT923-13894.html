			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Economics binds those whom politics divides - A look at the difficulties facing an attempt at co-operation by 11 Black Sea states IT required some skilful seating arrangements to accommodate 11 heads of government at the same table in Istanbul last month to sign an economic co-operation agreement between Black Sea countries, given that six of them are in open conflict with each other. That may well turn out to have been the easy part, as experts from Turkey and the eight former socialist states of the Black Sea, with late additions Greece and Albania, try to puzzle out how to turn this region of 400m consumers into a working marketplace. The framework agreement between Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Albania calls for co-operation on transport and telecommunications, infrastructure and the environment. Its broad objective is to improve on the current negligible trade ties between the former Comecon partners and their market-oriented neighbours. But at this stage the accord is still driven more by the politicians than businessmen, many of whom remain confused as to its purpose. Turkey has been the prime mover, clearly flattered that these newly emerging democracies should look to it as a role model. For Turkey, the project could provide, if not an adequate alternative to EC membership, at least a fall-back position. Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, says: 'If Europe is going to work it must establish strong ties with the co-operative schemes around it.' Behind Turkey's backing of the project lies the fear of growing ethnic tensions in the region. Economic co-operation is seen as a bridge-building exercise aimed at ameliorating political differences. Before the break-up of the Soviet Union, all roads led to Moscow. The task now is to redirect many of these economies not only to a different marketplace but to a market philosophy. The initial challenge is how to get off this 'first base'. The Istanbul meeting and a follow-up gathering of businessmen and government officials, organised by the Swiss-based World Economic Forum, raised more questions than answers. Should governments invest in infrastructure to encourage the region's trade? Would this require a new development bank? Is there a need for a secretariat? Should there be a common currency? Is the eventual aim to form a customs union? The politicians talk boldly about joint infrastructure development in ports, rail links and telecommunications. Many bankers are anxious to know how the politicians propose to finance such investment. Mr Sarik Tara, a Turkish contractor with a decade's experience working in the former Soviet Union, cites the dramatic fall in Russia's energy exports as evidence that the real problem is not the lack of infrastructure but the lack of a working market mechanism. Even in the area of telecommunications, which every businessman recognises as a key priority, western experts say there is insufficient 'traffic' to justify financing a big new network. To promote trade, some officials suggest the Turkish lira could become a common currency, using the example of the French franc zone in west Africa. The lira is, after all, now convertible. However, it is far from stable and has fallen against major currencies in the past year. It will be difficult to get commercial banks involved in trade finance in the region. Turkey's Eximbank has plans to extend credits to these countries. But as one leading banker asks: 'To whom? Can a commercial bank really assess a financial institution in those countries?' Moreover, the debt provision that a western bank would have to make in such a market would wipe out the returns on a commercial loan. Mr Demirel says the aim is the free circulation of goods and services, although officials concede that some of the newly emerging states may not be ready for the full blast of competition even if that competition is from Turkish goods. The best hope may be barter and counter trade. Turkish trade with the former Soviet Union and now with Russia has been underpinned by a Dollars 300m (Pounds 157m) gas deal. One minor snag - if Russia becomes a member of the International Monetary Fund, Turkey could find itself in breach of its own obligations with the Fund not to enter into non-cash transactions. Afghanistan's new govern-ment has applied to join Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and five former Soviet republics in an Islamic regional economic club, the Iranian news agency IRNA said Reuter reports from Nicosia.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bridon jumps 57% despite costs BRIDON, the Doncaster-based maker of ropes and other engineered products, lifted first-half pre-tax profits by 57 per cent, from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.1m, in spite of a rise in restructuring costs from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.2m. The advance in operating profits, from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4m, in the six months to June 30, was described by Mr Brian Clayton, chairman, as a 'useful improvement' and he predicted further advances as the benefits of the restructuring flowed through. In the short term, however, he said 'market conditions are expected to remain relatively unhelpful and continuing cost reduction remains the main driving force in our efforts to improve margins.' Bridon also announced yesterday that it had won two bridge contracts worth Pounds 2.5m for the second Severn crossing between England and Wales and a bridge in Sydney, Australia. Mr Clayton said that contract work was now making an increasing contribution to turnover at the wire ropes division. The group is planning to invest Pounds 2m in the next 12 months in this sector. UK exports also benefited from improved margins because of sterling's devaluation. Wire ropes contributed Pounds 112.6m (Pounds 107m) to group turnover of Pounds 163.8m (Pounds 162.5m). Operating profits from wire ropes doubled to Pounds 2.6m. Operating profits from fibre products fell to Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 900,000); industrial textiles contributed Pounds 200,000 following a Pounds 100,000 loss previously; and engineering profits were Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.3m). Earnings per share rose to 1.6p (1.3p) and the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.25p. The restructuring costs - incurred within the wire ropes sector - included the closure of the fish ropery in Beverley, Humberside. The full-year results will include further restructuring costs. The group has shed almost 1,000 employees in the last two and a half years, leaving 4,453 at June 30. Working capital fell from Pounds 73.7m to Pounds 59.9m through control on stocks and debtors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The governing coalition  parties and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social  Democratic Party of Japan] agreed Tuesday to open policy  dialogue Wednesday as a step toward the formation of a new  coalition government, coalition leaders announced. "We agreed  that all the parties should do their utmost to sort out the  current political turmoil and fulfill their duties," Komeito  Chairman Koshiro Ishida told a news conference.    The coalition parties and the SDP, a former coalition  partner, reached the agreement when coalition chiefs and SDP  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met to discuss the possibility of the  SDP's rejoining the coalition.    Departing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also attended the  top-level gathering as he heads Shinseito, a key coalition force.    Although the coalition parties and the SDP agreed to kick  off  talks to narrow their differences over key policy issues, this  does not necessarily imply the SDP's imminent return to the  ruling camp, political sources said. "We will move on to talks  to form a new government after reaching an accord on policy,"  Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party,  told the same news conference.    The policy talks between the coalition and the SDP, which  left the governing alliance in April, will begin Wednesday when  the SDP presents a fresh blueprint for a new coalition  government. The seven coalition party chiefs and Murayama also  concurred on the need for a more transparent and democratic  political management style, Ishida said.    In a related development, Murayama and Yohei Kono, president  of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), will  open talks at 8 p.m. Tuesday in what appeared to be an attempt  to explore the possibility of forging an alliance to form a new  government. The top-level meeting will be preceded by talks  between the secretaries general of the LDP and the SDP, party  officials said.    The seven coalition party chiefs and Murayama also confirmed  the SDP will call on new party Sakigake, also a former coalition  member, to join a new government, Ishida said.    The SDP's withdrawal stripped the coalition of its majority  in both houses of the the Diet.    To avert certain defeat in a no-confidence vote, Hata  resigned with his two-month-old cabinet Saturday, prompting a  flurry of plays for power over the framework of a new government.    The LDP continued efforts Tuesday to launch a grand  coalition  with the SDP, the LDP's archrival during its 38-year unbroken  rule that ended last August, in a bid to regain power. LDP  Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, in a meeting with SDP Secretary  General Wataru Kubo, proposed putting up Murayama as head of a  new three-party coalition government among the LDP, the SDP and  Sakigake, an LDP splinter party.    Kubo, however, did not respond immediately to the LDP's  offer  and instead told Mori that the SDP will give priority to talks  with the coalition.    Meanwhile, Murayama and Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura  agreed to hold another round of talks Wednesday, officials said.  Takemura, speaking at a Tokyo party commemorating the  anniversary of the establishment of Sakigake, criticized the SDP  for its moves to rejoin the coalition. "An increasing number of  SDP legislators are making moves by basing their judgments on  benefits they will be able to enjoy at the next election under  the single-seat constituency system, rather than on ideals and  policies," he said.    Takemura was apparently referring to anxieties among some  SDP  legislators that unless they were nominated as joint coalition  in single-seat constituencies, they might lose in the next  election. "I want the Social Democratic Party to become the  core" of a new coalition government, he said. "Sakigake will  not waver between the right and left spectrum of political  forces," Takemura said in an apparent appeal to the SDP not to  return to the fold of the present coalition.</p>

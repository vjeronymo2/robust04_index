			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dean &amp; Bowes acquisition move DEAN &amp; BOWES, public house refurbisher, which last year disposed of its loss-making furniture making and sinage businesses, has acquired Giles &amp; Co, a Sussex-based holiday centre and hotel construction company. Dean &amp; Bowes, which acquired EJ Reilley, snooker table manufacturer, last December for Pounds 1.7m, announced a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.71m to Pounds 301,000 in the first half of 1991. Mr Stephen Dean, chairman, said at the time of the results that there ' was no chance we would announce a loss' for the year, but he thought the group would only break even. The Giles deal involves a payment of 3 per cent of the next three years' turnover which is expected to amount to some Pounds 5m. The payment will be spread over the three-year period and the acquisition is expected to add some Pounds 350,000 to net profits of Dean &amp; Bowes over this time.</p>

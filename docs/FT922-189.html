			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Microscope put on small business culture Few areas of business can have received quite the degree of attention over the past decade as that accorded to the small business and its owner writes Charles Batchelor. Surprisingly, for all this scrutiny, large gaps still remain in the picture we have of small firms. A wide-ranging survey of the sector has now been completed by Cambridge University's Small Business Research Centre. The State of British Enterprise* provides the first comprehensive overview of Britain's small firms since the Bolton Committee Report 21 years ago, its authors claim. The study, which will be launched at a one-day conference in Cambridge today provides some unexpected insights into the small firms' community while at the same time confirming some of the conclusions reached by earlier research. The typical business leader was aged between 45 and 49 years and had headed the business for eight years at the time of the survey. The typical company board was composed of three directors, one of whom had a degree or professional qualification. On average, businesses made a pre-tax profit of 7.5 per cent of turnover, though this figure was higher for enterprises employing fewer than 10 people, fast growing businesses and those in the services sector. Among the areas covered by the researchers were: MARKETS AND COMPETITION Most of the businesses surveyed depended on a relatively small number of customers - a factor which may explain their reluctance to take a tougher line on the late payment of debts - and had few competitors. More than 70 per cent said they did not regard overseas competition as a serious threat. Business owners ranked 'personal attention to client needs' as the most important competitive factor followed by an established reputation, specialised expertise and product quality. They put a low priority on product design, cost advantage and marketing, while price was given a middle rating. Collaboration agreements were common with nearly one third of enterprises having agreed formal or informal partnerships with other organisations, mainly suppliers or customers. GROWTH OBJECTIVES AND CONSTRAINTS The availability and cost of finance remained the most serious constraint despite the range of government and bank schemes which have been launched. A lack of marketing, sales and management skills and a shortage of skilled labour were also barriers to growth, indicating a need for more action by Training and Enterprise Councils and the government. Most firms - 64 per cent - said they wanted to grow moderately over the next three years but 23 per cent planned substantial growth. This suggests that the small firms' sector has considerable potential despite the recession. Many of the companies used outside advisers, with a strong link apparent between the amount of external advice taken and the rate of growth of the business. Tax and financial management was the most common area in which outside advice was used (62 per cent of firms) followed by computer services (48 per cent) and marketing and business strategy (30 per cent). PROFITABILITY AND FINANCE Profit margins had declined over the previous three years, particularly when interest payments were taken into account. Despite their having identified raising finance as their main constraint, two-thirds of the businesses surveyed had sought additional finance in the previous three years and most had found it. Banks were the most important source of finance but hire purchase and leasing also played a significant role. There was some evidence that businesses were diversifying their sources of finance. Fewer depended exclusively on overdrafts and greater use was being made of fixed interest borrowing. ACQUISITIONS About one-fifth of the businesses surveyed had acquired one or more firms in the previous five years and between them, the total number of acquisitions amounted to 600. The main motives were to capture market share, to diversify and to achieve economies of scale. One in five had also been the target of a bid approach, usually from a larger company, though most were against being acquired in the short-term. ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNMENT POLICY Nearly one-third of the firms considered they had received no help from government policy over the past decade. The way the government had conducted interest rate policy was seen as particularly harmful. Lower taxes and improved incentives to invest were perceived as the most beneficial policy initiatives which government could take. The particular value of the Cambridge research lies in the number of enterprises questioned - more than 2,000 in both manufacturing and service sectors from throughout Britain - and the opportunity it provided to impose a common format on questions over a wide range of business issues. The research covered businesses which employed up to 500 people although half employed between 10 and 99. Half of the enterprises had been formed during the 1980s while 28 per cent had been set up before 1969. Densely packed with graphs and tables and with a text which makes no concessions to the casual reader, The State of British Enterprise is more a work of reference than a book to be read for its narrative thread. It should provide a valuable source of material for organisations which provide services to business and policy-makers in both the private and public sectors. *Small Business Research Centre, Cambridge University, Department of Applied Economics, Austin Robinson Building, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DE. 87 pages.

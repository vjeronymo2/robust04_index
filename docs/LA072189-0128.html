			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE COMMISSION BACKS CHIEF IN PARAMEDIC FEUD  </P> <P> Los Angeles fire commissioners backed Fire Chief Donald O. Manning on Thursday  over a paramedics union chief who had called for the chief's ouster and claimed  that improvements in the city's Emergency Medical Service system were not being  made quickly enough.  </P> <P> "We . . . are troubled by the call for the chief's resignation," Commissioner  Ann Reiss Lane, senior member of the commission and its newly elected  president, said after a review of the Fire Department's actions in improving  Emergency Medical Service over the last few years.  </P> <P> "The narrow view of the (United Paramedics of Los Angeles) president," she  added, "and his gratuitous comments to the press and the commission do not in  any way improve medical services to the citizens of Los Angeles or contribute  to the improvement of patient care."  </P> <P> Lane said that the city provides "outstanding quality care." What will improve  medical services and patient care is for unions representing Fire Department  firefighters and paramedics to cooperate in resolving differences, she said.  </P> <P> Fred Hurtado, president of the 421-member United Paramedics, touched off the  controversy late last month with charges that the Fire Department has been  "unacceptably slow" in making improvements recommended after a study of the  emergency medical system's performance over a decade. He accused management of  "foot-dragging."  </P> <P> While noting that improvements have been made, Hurtado has insisted that  response times are "too long in many cases" and that paramedics are still  overworked in some sectors of the city. He claimed that fire-suppression  elements of the Fire Department have been slow to embrace Emergency Medical  Service because they fear their status and mission will be diminished.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gains Cited  </P> <P> Ordered by the Fire Commission to summarize emergency improvements, Manning  offered a report citing, among other things, an increase in paramedic rescue  ambulances from 42 to 48, implementation of priority dispatch protocols to  improve responses, and the addition of nine rescue ambulances staffed by  volunteers.  </P> <P> Manning also noted at the commission meeting Thursday that 11 fire companies  have been equipped with automatic defibrillators to be used in heart attack  cases. And he said the department plans to equip all 117 of its engine  companies with the instruments by next year, if budgeting permits.  </P> <P> "I'm particularly pleased with the results," said Manning, in assessing his  department's Emergency Medical Service progress. "I don't mean to tell you that  I'm content. I'm pointing out that we have made some tremendous progress."  </P> <P> Reached later by telephone, Hurtado reiterated his charge that the reaction of  Fire Department management to a decade of reports and recommendations on  emergency service has been "begrudging, untimely, unnecessarily slow and poorly  managed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quality Question  </P> <P> When the question of the quality of management has arisen in the past, Hurtado  said, it has been "standard practice" for the fire commissioners and the chief  to stand up and say, "No, no. Our paramedics do a wonderful job."  </P> <P> Hurtado added: "In our view, this is simply a ploy to sidestep the fundamental  issue that we have continually raised. The fundamental issue is management. . .  . We have no reason to be proud of the management that is supposed to support  us. Ann Lane knows better."  </P> <P> Manning characterized Hurtado's demand for his ouster as "ridiculous."  </P></p>

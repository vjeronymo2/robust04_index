			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: SmithKline deal Pharmaceuticals group SmithKline Beecham jumped 6.5 per cent in a falling market as early US support was fuelled by news that the company was making a Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.57m) acquisition in the US. The shares were easily the best performers in the FT-SE 100 and led the pharmaceutical sector higher. The 'A's gained 25 1/2 to 415p on turnover of 7m and the Units, which tend to reflect US interest, leapt 28 to 384p with 10m traded. The purchase of Diversified Pharmaceutical Services (DPS) is expected to enable the company to compete more effectively with Merck of the US, which has recently bought MedCo. SmithKline said the acquisition would result in earnings dilution of around 3 per cent this year and be earnings enhancing after that. It is funding the purchase by the issue of commercial paper and existing cash reserves and analysts were enthusiastic. Mr Paul Krikler of Goldman Sachs, the US house which is advising DPS's former owner said it represented 'nothing less than a breathtaking example of a bold and creative management' and Mr Paul Woodhouse at Smith New Court 'It is a good move. DPS is the pick of the bunch.' The move enlivened a sector desperately in need of some focus after months of depressing news. And it followed a slight shift of focus on Friday and a Dollars 5.3bn agreed bid on Monday. The bid by Roche of Switzerland for Syntex of the US was considered expensive but whetted the market's appetite for further moves. Perennial speculative targets Fisons and London International group rose a penny to 155p and 8 to 112p respectively. Heavily sold Wellcome bounced 23 to 547p and hard hit Glaxo recovered 11 1/2 to 588p. The oil majors were hit by a flurry of US selling as many transatlantic investors locked in profits ahead of first quarter results from both BP and Shell. Shell, now the UK's biggest company measured by market capitalisation, slid 10 to 713p after turnover of 4.7m shares. BP, scheduled to announce results tomorrow, and whose shares hit an all-time closing high of 399p last week, fell 4 to 382p on turnover of 7.4m. The Lasmo takeover saga rumbled on with oil sector specialists noting the market's continuing dissatisfaction with Enterprise's all-paper bid and with Enterprise's strategy. 'Although it's early days in the bid timetable, there is definitely a feeling that Enterprise may already have blown its chances,' said one analyst. A counter offer is still expected by many oil sector observers. Lasmo slipped 1 1/2 to 148p on turnover of 7.2m shares and the nil-paids  1/2 to 44p on 4.6m traded. Enterprise fell 6 to 410p. Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to have been the driving force behind the weakness in Abbey National, which fell 9 to 427p. Hong Kong-sensitive banks received a rough ride following a steep overnight fall in Hong Kong stocks. HSBC plunged 27 to 679p. Standard Chartered settled 36 off at 959p. Water and electricity sectors came under renewed fire as dealers took fright at the latest big slide in gilts and on the prospects of a local election hammering for the Tories in tomorrow's elections. A series of presentations in the City were said to have lifted Upton and Southern, the ambitious regional retailer, 2 to 32p. Stores analysts were speculating over the scale of write-offs set to be announced by WH Smith and Boots for their Do It All home improvement subsidiary, expected shortly. The interest was sparked by weekend press comment, but reports in some newspapers of an Pounds 80m provision found little support. The consensus is that the two groups will make provisions of nearer Pounds 55m and announce the closure of around 50 of the 220 Do It All sites. Around half those earmarked for closure are thought to have been sold to other retail groups, including Asda, Dixons for its PC World stores, and furniture and bedding company Staples. Boots shares advanced on the back of the day's pharmaceutical activity, the shares closing 5 1/2 forward at 553p. Smith slipped 2 to 496p. Dixons slid 7 to 200p following the company's decision to treat its interest in Fretter of the US as a fixed asset investment. There were also said to be negative comments from Hoare Govett and Morgan Stanley. Asda shares were down  1/4 at 55 1/4 p. Other statistics, Page 31</p>

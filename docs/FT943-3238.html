			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Lies, damned lies and statistics It depends which figures you use. The workforce in employment has either fallen 9,000 or risen 137,000 in the past year, Peter Norman writes. The Department of Employment reported yesterday that the number in work fell a seasonally adjusted 34,000 to 25.23m in the three months to the end of June - a fall of 9,000 since June last year. However, its labour force survey showed a rise of 80,000 in employment between winter and spring and a 137,000 rise to nearly 24.99m compared with spring last year. The problem seems to be data collection. The labour force survey gathers information from households, while yesterday's data is based on returns from employers. Both cover much the same period. Perhaps understandably, Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, put his faith in the labour force survey. Yesterday's figures were 'in contradiction to just about every other statistic', he said. Officials said statisticians were working to resolve the differences.</p>

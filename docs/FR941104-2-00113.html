			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CSW Energy and the Partnership might incur certain expenses in connection with the development of the Project (``Development Expenses''), the total amount of which will not exceed $20 million. CSW and CSW Energy propose to fund the Development Expenses by capital contributions, loans, or open account advances from CSW to CSW Energy, from CSW Energy to Energy GP and Energy LP, and from Energy GP, directly or through Sweeny GP, and Energy LP, directly or through Sweeny LP, to the Partnership. All loans to the Partnership would have a final maturity not to exceed 25 years and would bear interest at a rate per annum not in excess either of the weighted cost of capital for CSW while CSW Energy indirectly holds all of the interests in the Partnership or the prime commercial lending rate as in effect from time to time at Mellon Bank plus 4%. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The prime rate plus 4% approximates the current market rate that the Partnership would be able to secure from nonassociate third-party lenders for loans of this type. CSW and CSW Energy state that to make loans or open account advances through Energy GP, Energy LP, Sweeny GP and Sweeny LP to the Partnership in the manner and on the terms described herein, they will avoid granting the nonassociate third party partners to the Partnership the windfall that would otherwise accompany an interest rate to such third parties set artificially low instead of an interest rate tied to the market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Central and South West Corporation, et al.

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Mayhew to meet Irish minister SIR Patrick Mayhew, the new Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday made clear that there was no place at talks on the province's political future for those who support violence. In spite of assertions by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, during the election campaign that it would have to be included at some stage, Sir Patrick said: 'The position of the British government has been made abundantly clear. There never is a place for anybody at any table who resorts to violence.' On his first day in office in Belfast Sir Patrick outlined his immediate priorities. These include meetings as soon as possible with Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign affairs minister, and with Northern Ireland's political leaders. Sir Patrick will also meet unionist and nationalist leaders. He is expected to meet Mr Andrews at an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting in Belfast shortly after Easter. A formal suspension of conference sessions may be announced at that meeting so that inter-party talks on the future government of the province can be reconvened. Unionists have welcomed the appointment of Sir Patrick to the Northern Ireland office. The new Ulster secretary was given a series of intensive briefings by political and security advisers at Stormont Castle yesterday. Sir Patrick yesterday dismissed potential Nationalist concern over his alleged refusal to prosecute police officers at the centre of the so-called shoot-to-kill investigations. The former attorney-general said the decision had not been his and that he had left the past behind him.</p>

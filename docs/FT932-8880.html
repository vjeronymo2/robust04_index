			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Prescription costs rise by 87% over 10 years THE AVERAGE cost of a national health service prescription rose by 87 per cent in real terms between 1980 and 1990. The increase in cash terms, published today in a report by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, is from Pounds 2.37 to Pounds 5.77. The number of prescriptions over the period rose by 19 per cent in real terms, taking the NHS drugs bill from about Pounds 855m to Pounds 2.5bn. It has now reached about Pounds 3bn, representing about 10 per cent of the NHS budget, and is expected to rise by between 11 per cent and 12 per cent this year. The growth in the bill was driven partly by new treatments, the report says. These are relatively more expensive, but also tend to increase the number of prescriptions as they are more effective. The study notes that the number of prescriptions against malignant diseases such as cancer increased during the 10 years by 834 per cent, almost entirely because new treatments were available. Higher levels of diagnosis, generated by an ageing population, more widespread and more effective screening, and higher incidences of some diseases also drove up the number of prescriptions, the report says. Pressure from more informed consumers was also a factor. Prescriptions rose from 361m in 1980 to 431m in 1990. The cost per prescription of cardiovascular treatments, representing about 20 per cent of all drug costs, increased by 59 per cent, with the cash cost rising from Pounds 3.46 to Pounds 7.13. The report says this was because cheap anti-hypertensives were replaced by more expensive beta-blockers, ace-inhibitors and calcium antagonists. The report warns that the drugs bill is likely to increase as new technologies bring more innovative compounds to market. It says that advances in molecular biology, human genome research and neuroscience will soon lead to many more new medicines. It concludes that the government could attempt to control drug spending by: Requiring companies to prove medicines are needed. Stricter controls on drugs groups' profits, as part of the renegotiation of the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme. This controls drugs companies' return on capital. Wider use of non-patented generic medicines. Controlling doctors' prescribing habits. The study warns, however, that there must be a balance between cost savings and the interests of the industry, which contributes substantially to the economy.

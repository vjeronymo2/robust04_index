			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: HARD TIMES HAVE THEIR GOOD POINTS  </P> <P> Don't you dare tell me that the good times are over. And especially, don't you  dare do it in the form of a commercial that says if I buy an Oldsmobile I can  still have fun.  </P> <P> Every day, the news is full of gloom and doom. Didn't we learn anything from  the '80s? Didn't we learn one of life's most important lessons: Money does not  buy happiness. Say it again: Money does not buy happiness. It just buys stuff.  </P> <P> Are you happier now than you were 10 years ago? Not "better off" -- I mean  smiling, relaxed, physically joyous. What was so great about the '80s? So you  got a VCR and a phone machine. Hey, I know how hard it is to give up the  necessities.  </P> <P> Let's put it another way. A recession means you won't be able to get a  dual-deck VCR and phone machine that prioritizes your calls. Where is the  tragedy?  </P> <P> Before you think I'm playin' Pollyanna on the piano, I'll grant you this --  unemployment is one of the most painful things to face. But there is a certain  cause for optimism in the demographics. The last massive phase of unemployment  came when the baby boomer bulge was poking its fat mass into the job market.  Now we are facing the baby bust.  </P> <P> There will be jobs. It's just that everyone won't be able to be what was known  in the '80s as a "player." We all know how happy those people appeared,  standing there on the floor of the stock market screaming, "Sell!"  </P> <P> So, put a smile on your face, put your Armani suit in the closet and start  practicing "How can I help you? . . . Would you like fries with that?. . .Have  you tried the McPizza?"  </P> <P> Better yet, learn to say it in Russian.  </P> <P> A downturn in the economy means you will not have to keep striving to get more,  more, more. The Joneses are in trouble too, so you won't have to keep up with  them. No more, "But honey, even the Lenins have a Mercedes." The feeling that  enough was never enough will be replaced with: Let's just hold on to what we've  got.  </P> <P> Bearish times shouldn't leave you growling. It just means putting the quest for  status on hold. Anyone who's ever been there knows that a status high lasts  about three minutes anyway -- the time between getting a job and realizing that  you will have to do the work.  </P> <P> So, come on, Bucky (or No-Bucky), look on the bright side. Recession -- not  what's in it for me, but how can I make it through?  </P> <P> We'll have to find other things to do besides going shopping. This means  freeing up hours that were previously spent driving in traffic jams, looking  for parking places, searching through schlock, dealing with the incompetent  clerk, getting the thing home and discovering that even if it does work, you  can't work it.  </P> <P> What will you do instead? You can still work out without health clubs, Air  Jordans and personal trainers. You can get around without a 15-speed mountain  bike. Remember, you're in no hurry; you're not going anywhere. You can still  walk, jog or lie on the floor and work those thighs without spending a dime.  Left, right, left . . . You don't need a Jane Fonda to tell you which way the  thigh goes.  </P> <P> And, need I remind you, this and falling in love is still cheaper than buying  an Olds? And you don't need $1.59 a gallon to ride.  </P> <P> Finally, here's the best news. Anger will be back in. The anger that everyone  was supposed to get rid of in the '80s can suddenly become our greatest form of  entertainment. We can get angry at the politicians who created the economic  mess, we can hate the rich, we can go after the market manipulators.  </P> <P> And we can enjoy watching Donald Trump lose more than we'd ever make.  </P> <P> Isn't that almost worth it? So find yourself a sweetie, learn to bake bread, be  nice to the man in the street and hang on.  </P> <P> The economy will rise again. In the mean time, ain't we got fun?  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government sent a telephone message to North Korea Wednesday  accepting the North Korean counterproposal to hold a  working-level contact in Panmunjom at 10 a.m. Thursday to  discuss problems related to the proposed exchanges of special  envoys. The message was sent in the name of Song Yong-tae, chief  South Korean delegate to the inter-Korean contact. Thursday's  meeting is to be held at "Peace House" on the southern side of  the border at the truce village. It has been four months since  South and North Korea last held the working-level contact on  Oct. 25 last year.    "We will go to the Peace House at 10 a.m. Thursday, as you  have proposed, hoping a successful outcome of the working-level  contact," Song said. "It is regrettable, however, that you have  placed responsibility on our side for the suspension of the  contact and failure to make any progress in the meantime," Song  said.    The exchanges of special envoys between Seoul and Pyongyang  have to be realized as soon as possible because they were agreed  upon by both sides for the resolution of the nuclear issue and  other pending inter-Korean problems, Song told North Korea.    "It is important for you (North Korea) to make a sincere and  productive approach to discussions for the exchanges of special  envoys, and respect and fulfill commitments you made," Song said.    After sending the message, Song told reporters that  Thursday's meeting could make progress if North Korea does not  offer preconditions and repeat its past demands that South Korea  suspend "a nuclear war exercise" and stop participating in "an  international campaign" against North Korea. Song also said that  he does not detect any signs of North Korea rejecting further  working-level contact blaming a delay by South Korea on the  announcement of the suspension of the joint U.S.-South Korean  military exercise Team Spirit. But Song said whether or not  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors who went  into North Korea on Tuesday have actually began their work has  not been confirmed.    In any event, if the inter-Korean contact is carried out on  Thursday, South Korea is expected to announce a conditional  suspension of the Team Spirit exercise while the U.S. Government  will make its announcement on a third round of the U.S.-North  Korean high-level talks tentatively slated for March 21 in  Geneva.</p>

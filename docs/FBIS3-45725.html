He  warned that the consequences will be grave if the Hong Kong  Government continues to act in violation of the principle of  consultation set out in the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong  Kong's airport and acts arbitrarily on relevant issues.    At a ceremony with the principal executives of the Hong Kong  airline, Dragonair, who are stationed in Beijing, Chen Zuoer  responded to the Hong Kong Government's request to the  Legislative Council to allocate a total HK$1.67 billion [Hong  Kong dollars] to the Provisional Airport Authority, noting that  the issue of Hong Kong's new airport should be dealt with in  accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's  airport. The construction of Hong Kong's airport could have  started smoothly following the signing of Memorandum of  Understanding by the two heads of governments in September 1991.  "It really makes people worry now that the issue has gotten  into such a mess. This is the last thing we wish to see." He  also pointed out that a very important principle had been set  out in the Memorandum of Understanding that all issues which  straddle 1997 and which require the government of the future  special administrative region to acknowledge and shoulder  responsibility for should be solved through consultations  between China and Britain. He warned the British Hong Kong  Government that "its continued arbitrary acts in violation of  the Memorandum of Understanding will have very grave  consequences."</p>

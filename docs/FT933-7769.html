			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: CRA agrees to sale of Taiwan mill stake CRA has agreed to sell its 48.02 per cent interest in the An Mau steel rolling and coating mill in Taiwan. The price remains undisclosed, but is higher than book value. The group's 1992 annual report showed an equity carrying amount of ADollars 67.1m for the An Mau interest, and a ADollars 4.1m net profit contribution. An Mau's 1992 sales were ADollars 320m. CRA's interest will be sold to one of its Japanese partners in the An Mau joint venture, Yodogawa Steel Works. The sale continues CRA's policy of divesting non-core assets. The sale is scheduled for completion by the end of 1993. CRA initially made its investment in An Mau because the mill was potentially a direct user of CRA products, but this is no longer the case.</p>

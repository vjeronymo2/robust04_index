			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Gilbert: "After Mitterrand, Chirac Has Come </F> `To Turn The Page'"]    [Text] Above all, the president of the RPR [Rally for the  Republic] highlighted international policy, though not without  denouncing the misdeeds of the bureaucracy, and reiterated his  commitment to human rights.    Like Francois Mitterrand, who came last February, Jacques  Chirac had never set foot in Vietnam. While the president of the  republic naturally began his trip in Hanoi, the mayor of Paris  was first received in Ho Chi Minh City, previously known as  Saigon. In fact, the entire government has just completed a  sitting lasting several days in the capital of South Vietnam.  Accordingly, it was at the Palace of Unity, the presidential  residence of the old regime, that Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet,  flanked by nearly 10 ministers and in the presence of the French  ambassador, welcomed Mr. Chirac with the words: "Mr. Mayor of  Paris, you are a great Frenchman. What an honor it is to  receive you!"    No reference here to de Gaulle, then, like in Cambodia, in  describing the visit of his "spiritual heir." The general has  no place in Vietnamese mythology. What the Vietnamese leaders  wanted to show is the relationship between the two trips made by  Mitterrand and Chirac respectively, the consolidation of a  rediscovered history between the two countries. The speech by  Vo Van Kiet, the words spoken by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van  Khai, the patron of economic "liberalization," during their  conversation, or the short speech by the mayor-governor of the  city were built up along the same lines: 1993 began with  Mitterrand, 1994 with Chirac, that is the real "evidence of our  cooperation."    Quite obviously, the trip by the president, sanctioning  France's return to Indochina, left behind an excellent memory.  Mr. Chirac paid him homage: "The president of the republic  said that a fresh page had been turned. I believe he was  right." And, just as Francois Mitterrand had evoked "the  regrettable chapter" of French-Vietnamese history by visiting  the site of Dien Bien Phu, Jacques Chirac added: "The year 1994  will also mark the 40th anniversary of the most regrettable  episode of our shared history. Let us take care not to forget  the past. However, let us also turn to the future, starting off  again hand in hand..." While the authorities, overcome with  gratitude, multiplied their thanks to France for its development  aid and support in reintegrating Vietnam into the international  financial community, Jacques Chirac assured them that "the new  French government certainly intends to continue, and even  consolidate, the policy of its forerunner in this respect."    If the Vietnamese leaders greatly stressed the relationship  between the dates of the two visits, it was because they  themselves felt the need to draw up the balance of their action,  a really self-satisfied balance, on the eve of the "national  congress" of their party, which is to be held before the end of  January. It is clear that the tempo of the "renovation" is  stirring up a debate among their executives. How can the  political conservatism, which they are keeping in place, and  economic activism, for which they are preaching the need, be  reconciled? Their faith in the system is expressed in a  language which today seems rather anachronistic, exalting the  "objectives of the struggle" and the references "to the  decisions made by the previous congress." Vo Van Kiet, 71, grew  up under the Vietminh apparat and knew how to play the smiling  front. He reminded the mayor of Paris that he had himself been  the mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, then hardened and dropped the  smile to affirm that "the preservation of political stability  remains the condition for economic development."    Mr. Chirac, who steered well clear of entering into the  ideological debate, limited himself to diversifying his message  depending on the function of his dialogue partners. In the  presence of the mayor of Saigon, he made a real charge against  bureaucracy "which is causing a great deal of time to be lost  and is costing the people very dearly. Given the political  will, this problem can be overcome....but everywhere bureaucracy  is the enemy of the people."  <H5>  The French Dream </H5>   Speaking with economist Phan Van Khai, he listed the  "interests" at stake in the relationship between the two  countries, highlighting the dual singularity of the French  contribution: investment and the transfer of technologies.  Full of praise, in passing, for Industry Minister Gerard  Longuet, who leaves for Vietnam on Friday in command of a  squadron of 40 industrialists, he said: "You will see, this is  a boy who probably has a future in French politics. He does not  belong to my party. He is the leader of our brother party...."    In fact, the RPR president devoted the lion's share of his  talks to international policy, especially the balance within the  Pacific region, incessantly reiterating the nuclear threat posed  by North Korea. Vo Van Kiet admitted that he had observed the  same concern in South Korea and Japan.    Would Mr. Chirac make a public observation on human rights  infringements in Vietnam? One sentence uttered to Vo Van Kiet,  reiterated that after opening up economically, "the road to a  new openness will then be free, an openness which concerns  relations between people." However, the French ambassador also  delivered a note concerning the "individual [human rights]  cases" already raised by Mr. Mitterrand, then by Mr. Juppe last  July.    The Vietnamese received Chirac: One year away from the  presidential election, they took their assurances from this  considerable French political figure regarding the continuity of  French policy. Jacques Chirac visited Saigon and Hanoi: In  both cities, he wanted to consecrate the French dream in  Vietnam, particularly by committing himself to joint projects  and undertakings using the vehicle of the French language: a  visit to the Lotus school (financed by the City of Paris) in  Saigon, and to the Viet-Duc hospital in Hanoi.</p>

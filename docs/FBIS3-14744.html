According to sources close to the Ukrainian Foreign  Ministry,  the visit was put off due to the legal proceedings against an  officer of the Ukrainian Security Service (the so-called case of  Lysenko) continuing in Warsaw from January 19.    Anatoliy Lysenko and his family left for Poland in August,  1993, on a private invitation and was arrested immediately after  he crossed the border.    Lysenko has been accused of spying for Ukraine. The  Ukrainian Security Service refutes the accusations.</p>

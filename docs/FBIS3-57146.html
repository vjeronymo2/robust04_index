			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts under the "Topic of the </F> Week" rubric: "Reformers Come and Go, But What Is Left for Us?"]    [Text] This week has brought evidence of a universal  revival of Russian national traditions. Not only our country,  but the whole world has been engaged in speculation: Who is  going to occupy the ministerial offices in Moscow in the end?  As is the custom, as the Christmas holidays approached,  everyone started trying to frighten each other. And very  successful they were, too.    It is said that the blackest day in the history of the Tokyo  stock exchange was the day of Stalin's death. On that occasion  shares fell by hundreds of points and there was ruin on a mass  scale. Naturally, Gaydar's resignation cannot be compared to a  "father of the peoples" departing this world. But it too had an  explosive effect. There was a disastrous fall in the ruble rate  and a sharp increase in prices within the country. The rate of  the West German [as published] mark against the dollar fell  markedly. As did the currencies of the states with the closest  economic links to Russia. Naturally, as always at a time of  instability, gold prices rose rapidly.    The simplest explanation for what happened is that the  threat  of the departure from the Russian Government of the people they  call reformers is causing doubts about the continuation of the  course of reforms. In short, it transpires that industrial and  financial circles, both in our country and elsewhere, did not  have too much faith in assurances from the Kremlin that the  policy of reforms will continue.    But surely the point here is not speculation about whether  or  not the reforms will continue. The government crisis is making  people think about what these reforms, now in their third year,  actually consist of. This is no idle question. After all, if  the purpose and strategy of the reforms were obvious, then  reactions would have been prompted by changes in that strategy  (about which nothing is yet known), not in the composition of  the government. But, as was the case 40 years ago, both for  citizens of Russia and for the world in general, this country's  economic policy is unpredictable. And this leaves no  alternative but to think in terms not of the policy, but of  specific individuals, be it Pavlov, Gaydar, or Chernomyrdin,  whose actions in specific situations can be predicted, at least  to some extent. And when those people go, the panic starts.    Maybe that is in fact the chief weakness of the Russian  reforms. Because these reforms do not constitute a concrete  program. They are a highly individual mix of slogans and  reactions to developing situations in the economy. I realize  that Gaydar and his team, when they took over the management of  the economy, had no time for strategy. A situation close to  chaos prevailed in the country: barter, empty stores, ration  cards. The reformers found a lever with which to lessen that  chaos -- price liberalization. And they tried to implement that  liberalization as strictly -- not to say cruelly -- as possible.  Basically, all the long-term loan bonds which past governments  had given out to the population were scrapped.    As a result, by bringing about a considerable fall in living  standards, the reformers managed to bring domestic prices into  line with world prices. This promptly uncovered a fact which  our economic isolation had concealed for a long time. Namely,  that virtually all sectors of our industry are cost-based and  not competitive. It was not a conspiracy, but the operation of  objective laws unleashed by the reformers, which made us see our  economy in its true light. It emerged that the majority of  goods produced in Russia are not only worse, but more expensive  than those produced abroad. That if you are guided solely by  the economic expediency of today, it is far more advantageous to  put large padlocks on virtually every sector. And to export  oil, gas, and other raw materials, and buy all you need with the  funds thus earned.    But Russia is not a Persian Gulf state. Although nowadays  even there they are trying to diversify the economy, making use  of the funds earned from oil sales. Our own reformers stopped  short of what should in fact have been the essence of the reform  -- restructuring of the economy. I cannot say whether this was  a strategic error or whether they simply could not do it,  because of the fierce political struggle which has become one of  the most important factors in our economy. In any case, it  transpired that hope was pinned mainly on the idea that the  required restructuring would take place of its own accord, under  the influence of objective market laws.    Yet the reformers knew that spontaneous market forces  brought  the Western world to crisis in the early thirties. Since then  the governments of developed countries, which have always had  market economies, have not let go of the economic helm. And if  we have decided to enter the world market, it was of fundamental  importance for the reformers to decide exactly what we were  taking to that market. That is, to decide exactly which  sectors, if not today, then tomorrow, are capable of producing  goods that will be in demand. And then to support those  specific sectors, not every sector. Today, when this kind of  support is mentioned, for some reason it immediately prompts  alarmist talk of concessionary credits and subsidies which the  government is going to start handing out right and left without  the reformers' supervision. Those who have political and  personal influence know how to raise the threat of strikes or  simply to shout loudly.    I agree that such credits do in fact stimulate only one area  of production -- the printing of money that is worth less and  less. But maybe this abnormal situation occurs because our  captains of industry are simply disoriented. They do not know  which sectors, apart from the fuel and energy complex, Moscow  considers priorities. If they had some idea of that, they would  be able to plan their own strategy right now. Curtail one area  of production and try to start up another. Move free capital  into sectors with a future. And citizens would not be in a  state of total confusion, not knowing where to go with their  vouchers.    After all, credits are not the only thing in the world. You  could support priority sectors through tax concessions, or even  not demand tax from them at all. Thereby promoting an influx of  Russian and foreign capital. That is, try to do everything that  is done by economic departments in the countries whose example  we are trying to follow. It would be the height of impudence  for me to embark on a concrete analysis of an economic program.  That is what the professionals should be doing. Instead of  trying to frighten each other with talk of impending chaos. A  citizen has a right to know what the reforms really mean for him  personally, apart from rising prices, declining living  standards, the threat of unemployment, and being splashed with  mud from the wheels of the proliferating Mercedes. If his  sphere of activity has no future from the government's  viewpoint, he should have been told this long ago. Along with a  suggestion of what speciality -- other than selling sausages in  the square outside the station -- might bring in a stable and  honest income.    Heaven knows, I have great respect for Yegor Gaydar, who  possesses a combination of determination and intelligence that  is rare in Russian politicians. But I do not want my well-being  to depend on whether he or anyone else is still in the  government. I want to be able to plan my own life. But I can  only do that if I know what the state wants to do.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Union of Serbian States will be snub to UN IN defiance of the United Nations peace plan, leaders of Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia today meet to create the 'Union of Serbian States'. The 'all-Serbian parliament' is due to meet in Prijedor, a Serb-controlled town in northern Bosnia, to work on the creation of the new state linking Serb-held territories in Croatia and Serbia. They propose to establish a joint army, currency and citizenship. Local Serb leaders are spurning the efforts of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the co-presidents of the Geneva Conference, to broker a peace in the former Yugoslavia. This occurs amid growing calls from Croatia, under President Franjo Tudjman, to assert control over the UN-controlled zones, which comprise a third of Croatian territory. Mr Cedric Thornberry, the UN chief of civil affairs, warned on Thursday of 'deteriorating anarchy' in one of the UN zones, where he said local Serb militia refused to hand over their weapons. While the UN peace plan is under threat in Croatia, hopes of ending the fighting in neighbouring Bosnia have also receded. Bosnian Serb and Croat leaders have rejected a new constitution proposed by peace mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen to set up a decentralised republic, which is not divided on ethnic lines. Serb forces yesterday seized another key city in central Bosnia. Belgrade radio announced the 'liberation' of Jajce, whose population of 40,000 is 81 per cent non-Serb. The loss of Jajce dealt another blow to the mostly Moslem Bosnian forces. The city was the headquarters of the Partizan resistance to German rule in the second world war. They proclaimed the formation of Communist Yugoslavia there in 1943. Jajce was earlier the seat of the last Bosnian king, Stjepan Tomasevic, in 1463. Bosnia's mainly Moslem government has appealed for foreign military intervention in the former Yugoslav republic, which was recognised by the European Community and the US on April 7. Serb forces now control 70 per cent of Bosnia and Croats about 25 per cent.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / People: Watkins turns up at Binatone Gulu Lalvani, multi-millionaire Asian entrepreneur, founder of privately-owned Binatone, the consumer electronics group, and the man who gave Alan Sugar his first break in 1966, has now poached one of the Amstrad chairman's key aides. This week Amstrad announced the resignation of Robert Watkins, technical director, in a terse statement. Now, less than 24-hours later, it emerges that Watkins, who has been Amstrad's technical and manufacturing director since April 1983 and was the second highest paid director after Sugar himself, is to be Binatone's new group managing director. Watkins, who joined Amstrad in 1976, is credited with helping develop many of Amstrad's 'blockbuster' products which fuelled the group's phenomenal success in the 1980s when turnover peaked at over Pounds 600m. At Binatone he will be responsible for UK and Hong Kong operations, reporting directly to the chairman. Yesterday Lalvani, a marketing wiz who has built Binatone into a Pounds 80m-a-year group now headquartered in Hong Kong, said: 'Bob's appointment will help accelerate Binatone's global expansion by maintaining our innovative edge and making our quality electronics products available to consumers worldwide.' The appointment appears to be a significant coup for Lalvani who has sometimes been described as Alan Sugar's mentor, but who looks increasingly like challenging Amstrad head on in the European consumer electronics market. Binatone has already toppled BT's dominant position in the booming telephone answering machine market in the UK. It also recently bought a significant share in Germany's Loewe Betacom joint venture - previously owned by Amstrad's Betacom subsid-iary. The old friendship between Lalvani and Sugar may therefore be becoming a little strained, although the two are still dining partners when the Binatone chairman is in town. Indeed Lalvani warned Sugar over dinner in November that his 30p-a-share buy-back bid for Amstrad would fail - and it did.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Technology: More than computer experts Xerox Parc was founded in 1970 and quickly established a reputation as a hotbed of new computing ideas. The company hired experts not only in computers but also in other disciplines such as linguistics, anthropology, psychology and social sciences. About a third of the 325 researchers have no academic qualifications in computer science or electrical engineering. Xerox Parc owes much of its creativity to its campus-like setting and a very informal atmosphere. Peter Redford, an electronics engineer and president of TV Interactive, worked there in the 1970s. 'It was an incredible place. If you ran into a problem, you could talk with all kinds of people in different fields. People would walk around barefoot and work 20 hours per day. It was a very comfortable work environment, like working at home,' he said. While Xerox Parc developed cutting-edge technologies, its parent group was not very good at marketing them. But others had little trouble in making money out of ideas born at Xerox Parc. When Steve Jobs, then head of Apple Computer, and Apple engineers visited Xerox Parc in the late 1970s, they were amazed. They saw workstations with graphical user interfaces equipped with a mouse. Jobs is reported to have asked: 'Why aren't you marketing this?' He had glimpsed the future and began to assemble a team to create a new Apple system. The team's work led to the Macintosh computer. Other companies also benefited from the technology at Xerox Parc, including laser printer makers like Hewlett-Packard, and Microsoft with its Windows graphical user interface. Xerox Parc staff have gone on to found their own companies or direct technology development at large computer concerns. Xerox has learnt from its mistakes in not capitalising on its innovations. It has a venture capital division which helps to set up spin-off companies such as ParcPlace Systems, the developers of the object-oriented SmallTalk language. Xerox has also entered into partnerships with other companies - as with its LCD technology - to develop commercial products. It has licensed its technology and formed new divisions, like the Xerox Advanced Office Document Systems division, which is developing commercial products based on its 'smart paper' technology.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 31 May (AFP) -- At least 72 automatic  pistols and 14,000 pieces of ammunition were stolen by  unidentified persons on the night of 29 May at the Gamboma  military headquarters, in central Congo, it was learned today  from military sources here. A commission of enquiry comprised of  Army and police officers is expected to leave today for Gamboma,  a town located 300 km north of Brazzaville, the same sources  added.    Gamboma is a stronghold of the Congolese opposition  coalition. Early this year, opposition militia stole a large  quantity of arms and ammunition from the noncommissioned  officers' school there. At the time, President Pascal Lissouba  accused, without mentioning any names, a senior Army officer of  having approved of the theft.</p>

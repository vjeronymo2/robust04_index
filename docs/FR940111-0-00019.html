			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Evidence, Documents and Translations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At times, an application or petition will meet threshold evidence requirements, but the evidence submitted, or other evidence available, rises additional questions. In such instances the Service usually provides the applicant or petitioner an opportunity to respond or to submit additional evidence about the points in question in support of the claim. Several commenters asked that the Service extend the 60-day period provided for response, as least where good cause was demonstrated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule has been revised to provide 12 weeks for such submissions. However, waiting for the applicant or petitioner to respond hampers the Service's ability to make a final decision. Since the applicant has already met the threshold evidence requirements, the processing clock will merely stop as of the date of the request. It will resume at the point where it stopped when the Service receives the requested evidence or a request for a decision based on the evidence submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter asserted that the Service should eliminate the distinction between primary and secondary evidence, and accept any type of credible document with an application or petition. However, historically there have been serious problems establishing the reliability of many kinds of documents. Further, it is important in judging a claim to know whether documents that should normally exist actually do. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, a woman who files a petition claiming someone is her adult son. There is no birth certificate or other civil or religious documents from around the time of the birth to support the claim, but she does have several documents issued years later that suggest that he is her son. After analysis the Service may accept the claim, but the fact the birth certificate and other documents dating from the birth do not exist is important to that analysis. We could not adequately review the case if the record was silent about the types of documents that commonly exist. Without evidentiary guidelines, the Service also would not know whether she merely forgot to attach them or whether they did not exist. This would mean the Service would have to go back and ask, delaying processing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as requested by several commenters, the Service has clarified the distinction between primary evidence, secondary evidence and affidavits. The Service has also clarified the rule to indicate that a certification from an appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not required where the Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual indicates this type of document generally does not exist. The Service has also revised the rule as requested to allow a person to file evidence showing that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain a required document or certification of unavailability along with less definitive evidence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above changes will also apply to secondary evidence. However, because secondary evidence and affidavits are inherently less reliable and, consequently, have less probative value than primary evidence, such secondary evidence and affidavits must overcome the fact that more probative primary evidence is unavailable, affidavits must overcome the absence of all other more probative forms of evidence that would normally be available. If the Service concludes that primary or secondary evidence should be available, the applicant or petitioner will be asked to obtain it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters requested that the rule be revised to only require a translation of the relevant portion of a foreign language document instead of a full translation. However, only requiring an extract leaves to the applicant or petitioner and the translator the judgment of what is germane. The Service has found that in many instances the applicant or petitioner's determination of what is germane is not consistent with the Service's. A full translation is necessary for us to fully analyze documents submitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Withdrawals, Denials, Appeals and Motions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter opposed the proposed bar to retracting a withdrawal, asserting that an applicant or petitioner may have a legitimate reason for again changing his or her mind. The rule does not question the legitimacy of a change of heart or mind, nevertheless, under the rule, a withdrawal is considered definitive. An applicant or petitioner who withdraws a case and later changes his or her mind again may refile a new application or petition. the Service has clarified this in the rule, and has also clarified that a petitioner may withdraw an approved petition until such time as the beneficiary has been admitted or has adjusted status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

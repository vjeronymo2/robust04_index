			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares unable to sustain early rally THE UK stock market tried hard to rally yesterday after the weekend round of public opinions polls proved less negative towards the Conservative government than Friday afternoon's rumours had suggested. But lack of genuine investment interest left share prices again vulnerable to developments in stock index futures, and the FT-SE Index shed a further five points in its fourth downward session since Budget Day. International factors were largely brushed aside by London traders, whose attention is now fixed on the UK general election to be held early next month. The stock market, which now fears a 'hung' parliament, made little immediate response yesterday to the first reports of the shadow Budget from the Labour opposition. The fall of 619 points in the Nikkei average, bringing the Japanese stock market to a five-year low, made little immediate impact in London, although some optimists sugg-ested that increased pressure for a reduction in Japanese discount rate might enhance the chances of a cut in UK base rates before the general election. However, neither sterling nor London money rates gave much encouragement to any lingering base rate optimism. The stock market this week faces important economic data on the UK economy which could have significant effect on the voting intentions of the UK electorate. These will in turn be scrutinised by the opinion pollsters. Publication of important opinion polls is expected today and tomorrow, while on Thursday two opinion poll results will coincide with the latest UK unemployment statistics, to be followed on Friday by the retail price index (RPI) for February. A satisfactory RPI number could offer the final opportunity for a pre-election base rate cut. Against this backcloth, the investment institutions were inclined to stay on the sidelines. One leading dealer commented that, while unwilling to buy, fund managers are afraid to sell because they fear that they will be unable to 'buy the stock back again if the market takes off after the election'. While most marketmaking firms kept trading books level ahead of the Budget, some erred on the bullish tack and have suffered losses as they have tried to reposition themselves through the stock index futures. Share prices opened higher on relief that the opinion polls had proved less alarming than feared on Friday, but an early gain of 8.9 on the Footsie was quickly reversed when the futures market opened. The March contract moved to a discount, and the underlying blue chip stocks were marked down, often in minimal trading. At the day's low point, the Footsie was down 18.3 at 2,457.7, leaving the 2,450 mark unchallenged. As the March future steadied and Wall Street came in with a gain of 15 points on the Dow in UK hours, the London market rallied in listless trading. At the close, the FT-SE Index was a net 5.3 down at 2,470.7. Seaq volume fell to 363.5m shares from the 555.7m registered in the previous session; retail, or customer, volume remained high last week, and was worth just over Pounds 1bn on Friday. Oil shares provided one of the few firm sectors among the internationals. UK retail and consumer stocks lacked support, reflecting the fading of base rate hopes.</p>

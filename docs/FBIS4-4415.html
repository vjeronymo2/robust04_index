			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Trade, Industry and  Energy Minister Kim Chol-su and Canadian International Trade  Minister Roy Maclaren held the 12th trade ministers' meeting  here Friday and agreed to form a working-level team to discuss  further development of a "special partnership."    The ministers said their countries first developed a special  partnership at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  summit in Seattle last November.    They agreed to hold the first meeting of the working-level  team headed by assistant ministers this month.    Kim called on Maclaren to extend Generalized System of  Preferences (GSP) status for Korean exports to Canada, scheduled  to expire at the end of June, and Maclaren vowed to consider the  matter positively.    The ministers also decided to form a Korea-Canada industrial  technology cooperation committee to boost bilateral links in  these areas.</p>

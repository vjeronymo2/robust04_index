			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Citicorp stems European consumer losses CITICORP, the leading US bank, has begun to contain the losses in its European consumer businesses, according to a new study prepared by banking analysts at Salomon Brothers in New York. Salomon estimates the expense base of the bank's European consumer operation is now about Dollars 300m less per year than the Dollars 1.5bn it was in 1990 as a result of asset disposals and restructuring. Ms Diane Glossman, the Salomon banking analyst, said yesterday she believed Citicorp's European consumer activities suffered a loss of Dollars 50m to Dollars 100m in 1990 but made a small profit last year, thanks largely to a Dollars 125m pre-tax gain on the disposal of a 48-branch Italian subsidiary. Ms Glossman also cited moves in the UK, France, Germany and Austria that have contributed to the improvement. Among these was the bank's recent move to consolidate its German retail-oriented operations under one holding company. 'We estimate that the investment in building the European consumer effort has equalled about Dollars 150m annually during the past few years,' the Salomon report said. The German investment alone will continue at an estimated rate of Dollars 50m during the 1992-1993 period, with the installation of another set of automated teller machines and development of new software. The revenues lost as a result of the sale of businesses should be replaced over the next couple of years, according to Salomon. Ms Glossman said she expected Citicorp to introduce a basic product-and-service package in four core countries - Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain. She also estimated that by year-end Citicorp would have a base of about 500,000 credit cards in Europe, reaching break-even in 1993 before achieving substantial returns in 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The two remaining NPFL [National Patriotic Front of  Liberia] cabinet nominees, Information Minister-Designate Joe  Mulbah and Agriculture Minister-Designate Roland Massaquoi, were  yesterday confirmed by the Transitional Legislative Assembly,  TLA, after going through the confirmation hearing.    In a testimony before the Assembly, Information  Minister-Delegate Joe Mulbah pledged to maintain press freedom  and ensure that the state media facilities are made available to  all candidates during the forthcoming general elections. Mr.  Mulbah further pledged to improve various state media  institutions, including the LIBERIAN NEWS AGENCY, LINA, the  Ministry of Information, as well as reallocate radio and  television services on to Liberia Broadcasting System. Mr.  Mulbah also spoke about plans to launch a new government-owned  newspaper called THE TRANSITION to help improve the  dissemination of information to the public.    For his part, Agriculture Minister-Delegate Roland Massaquoi  promised to persuade the international community to help  reactivate the agricultural sector, which is the backbone of the  Liberian economy.    With this confirmation of the two ministers, all the parties  to the Cotonou Accord are now represented in the LNTG [Liberia  National Transitional Government]. At the same time, TLA  members from the defunct NPFL have taken their seats in the  assembly nearly two months following their induction. At the  Capitol yesterday, they were formerly welcomed by TLA speaker  Mr. Morris Dukuly who said their acceptance to be seated signals  the beginning of the end of the country's quest to be reunited.</p>

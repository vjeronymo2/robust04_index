The newspapers quoted spokesmen of the Alex Boncayo Brigade  (ABB), the urban assassination squad of the insurgent New  People's Army (NPA), that they would target representatives of  these three groups unless President Fidel Ramos reversed a 22  percent increase in the prices of fuel products.    The formerly-dormant ABB, which killed over 200 soldiers,  policemen and civilians in Manila from 1987-90, earlier claimed  responsibility for the bombing of the offices of three oil  companies in this city on Tuesday. The ABB said the bombings  were intended to protest the oil price hike imposed last Friday.  The ABB added that if the government agreed to reverse the oil  price hike, they in return would agree to open peace talks with  the government.    The Communist Party of the Philippines, the political  leadership of the NPA, is already considering peace negotiations  with the Ramos government, but talks have been stalled by  numerous conditions imposed by the insurgents.    Meanwhile, an anti-Ramos newspaper, in an editorial  published  Thursday, called on the assassins to target local officials and  not foreigners. The Today, a broadsheet which began publishing  just last month, in reaction to the ABB's threat said: "Do we  have to remind the ABB that native insurgencies are supposed to  kill native officials, not foreign civilians or diplomatic  personnel?" The newspaper said that attacking foreigners would  only scare away foreign investment and would only give the Ramos  government justification to crack down on civil liberties, "so  it can steal in peace and stay in power."    The newspaper also said that the ABB "doesn't have the  discrimination and the balls to tackle its proper enemy -- the  government and its officials." "What a pity. Yet another golden  opportunity to prove the ABB's usefulness thrown out the  window," the editorial concluded.</p>

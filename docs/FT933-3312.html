			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (10): A line that suits tumble dryers - Case Study / Crosslee / The leading manufacturer in Europe is based in Halifax, Yorkshire MANUFACTURING, like the clothes on our backs, goes through fashions. Team working, flexibility and Just in Time are all flavour of the moment. But, as Crosslee, Europe's biggest tumble dryer manufacturer, shows, there is no single way of achieving these ends. Some companies have adopted cell-based manufacturing in the search for greater efficiency and flexibility, but Crosslee has moved in the last year in precisely the reverse direction, introducing a production line to meet high volume demand from big customers. While many suppliers are adapting to the notion, championed by Nissan, of locking themselves in with their major customers, Crosslee, says Mr Peter Kerrison, its manufacturing director, believes that when it buys components 'competition is more important than partnership'. Crosslee was created in 1986 when Mr David Ross and Mr Derek Clee, two former Philips managers, bought Philips' clothes washer and tumble dryer factory in Halifax, West Yorkshire, to focus on clothes dryer production. They inherited a modular manufacturing cell concept in which different models were assigned to cells manned mostly by eight-strong teams. The cells, with the ability to do short runs, were very flexible, but they proved less suited to volume production which the fast-growing company - now producing 500,000 tumble dryers annually and exporting 70 per cent of production to 55 countries - also required. Crosslee's founders decided that, with sales growing by 25 per cent a year, a mixture of cells and production line would be more appropriate to the output levels of their company, which now has a 17.5 per cent share of the European dryer market. So in August 1992, in the space previously occupied by three cells, Crosslee installed a production line, to be staffed by a crew of 32 or 64, depending on output level and model required. The line, says Mr Kerrison, has meant significant advantages in materials handling, by reducing the number of supply points and the amount of materials movement, and has more than doubled productivity per unit area of floor space. It can make 160 dryers in the same time the three cells which it replaced would have made 75. On an eight or nine-hour long shift the line, manned by a crew of 32, typically assembles 777 dryers. The production line has raised weekly total dryer production by 2,000 to 3,000 - an increase of around 20 per cent. At peak times, the plant can now produce a dryer every 12.5 seconds. The productivity gain is partly due to human factors; production line tasks taking 20-40 seconds each are much easier for new employees to master than the complex range of tasks, taking about three minutes, in a cell. This is important for Crosslee since it recruits all shop floor staff as temporary employees. The 30 per cent who make the grade and work at the required speed - Crosslee's founders readily admit their people work very hard - become permanent staff after about a year. The dual approach of production line and cells creates a career path for employees; operators can graduate to the cells, which are better suited to production of the more complex models, like the microprocessor-controlled version. Mr Kerrison, drawing on 22 years in manufacturing, does not, however support the theory that cell-based operations yield better quality than line production. 'I don't think there's any statistical evidence to suggest quality standards are dissimilar,' he says. 'Sometimes you can be on a consultant-driven bandwagon.' Crosslee's audit section checks a sample of finished dryers to monitor quality. But the company has abolished inward inspection of suppliers' components; shop floor operatives are primed to spot defects and the cost of substandard items is deducted from suppliers' bills. The production line is a step towards more automation, scheduled for next year. But Crosslee is pragmatic; it uses robots for welding, but also manual labour where it is cost-effective. 'Diversity means sometimes you need the unique flexibility of a human resource,' says Mr Kerrison. The proof that Crosslee's systems are delivering the required JIT performance lies in customers' response, he says; customers have shortened the company's peak season by three weeks because they are confident orders will be rapidly met. When Mr Ross and Mr Clee took over the plant, they immediately halved the number of indirect to direct workers. After their latest, just completed, recruitment drive, they have 550 on the payroll. All but 80 are production workers. One of their earliest and most effective changes was to introduce flexible working, based on annualised hours. As cyclical tumble dryer demand peaks in the winter months and falls away in summer, production staff work a four-day, 32-hour week in the summer and a five-day, 43-hour week from late August to Easter. This averages out over a year at 38.5 hours per week. 'It's very cost-effective,' says Mr Kerrison. Crosslee also makes domestic gas fires and condensing gas boilers at a North Wales factory acquired two years ago. And it has just launched a range of gas and charcoal barbecues - another seasonal niche market where it aims to become the dominant European producer. Pre-tax profits in the year to July 31 1992 reached Pounds 2.96m, on turnover of Pounds 39.26m. The rewards for the founders were substantial: Mr Clee and Mr Ross paid themselves nearly Pounds 1.2m each. Turnover in the year just ended will be some Pounds 43m and pre-tax profits about Pounds 3m. Mr Clee and Mr Ross hold 70 per cent of Crosslee's share capital; members of staff, present and past, hold the rest. The shares are a valuable asset; deputy AEEU shop steward Mrs June Kay, who retires this month, expects the sale of 20,000 of her 81,000 shares to fetch about Pounds 16,000. The AEEU says conditions for shop floor workers, paid Pounds 4.80 an hour, are good for the area. Crosslee has a reputation as a factory offering secure employment for those who can take the pace. After years in a multinational, joint managing directors Mr Ross and Mr Clee take pleasure in running a lean organisation. 'We know what's going on; we don't need memos or reports,' says Mr Clee. The production line concept was devised in-house and implemented in five months; product redesign, also done at the plant, can be achieved within three months. Plastic components are at present bought in, but Crosslee is investing 57,000 in moulding tool machinery to produce small plastic parts itself. All other parts are fabricated in-house. From last month, the toolroom is expected to bid for Crosslee work against outside quotes. Opening up export markets is the responsibility of Mr Ross and Mr Clee who spend six months a year abroad, assessing established and potential markets for their own-brand White Knight products, which accounts for 25 per cent of output, and their customers, including Whirlpool, Bosch-Siemens and Electrolux. To travel together might seem wasteful, but it means they thrash out policy and maintain their enthusiasm and drive. It also keeps them in touch with the marketplace. 'Unless you talk to the customer you can come unstuck', says Mr Ross.</p>

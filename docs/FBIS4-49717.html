The 25 daily necessities and services placed under price  supervision and control, as stipulated in the provincial  people's government circular, are as follows: Rice, wheat  flour, peanut oil, pork, eggs, milk, salt, soy sauce, mainland  vegetables, detergent, coal, liquefied petroleum gas, coal gas,  running water, electricity, public transportation, tuition and  miscellaneous fees, child-care fees, medical fees, food and  drink, rent, commodity residential quarters, hotel rooms, and so  on.

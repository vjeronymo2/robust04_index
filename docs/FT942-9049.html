			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / China's PM attacks US on dissidents China's prime minister Li Peng has maintained Beijing's tough stance on human rights, accusing the US of giving undue weight to the views of a 'tiny number' of dissident Chinese. Mr Li told Mr Zbigniew Brezinski, the former US national security security adviser, that China resented interference in its internal affairs and would not yield to outside pressures. The Chinese official was speaking just weeks before a deadline for President Bill Clinton to decide whether to extend China's 'most favoured nation' trading status in the US. China, meanwhile, continues to exert pressure on its dissident community with further detentions and little sign that its most prominent political prisoner, Wei Jingsheng, is about to be released. China yesterday briefly detained leading student dissident Wang Dan after he met a US TV reporting team. He was released by Beijing police after being held for an hour.</p>

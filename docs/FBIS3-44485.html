			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ling Yu (0407 1342): "China's Modern Weaponry </F> Development Tendency"]    [Text]What Offensive Weapons Does China Possess?    If judged by absolute figures, China has a total of  3,199,100  (by the end of 1991) active servicemen, first in the world.  Compared with a population of 1.17 billion, the proportion is  not big, accounting for around 0.3 percent. Let us look at the  proportions in other countries: The former Soviet Union, 1.9  percent; the United States (active and reserves), 1.3 percent;  United Kingdom, 0.59 percent; France, 0.94 percent; Germany,  0.79 percent; Japan, 0.24 percent; and India, 0.19 percent. Of  the eight countries mentioned, China's armed forces rank sixth.    In terms of potential wars during the 21st century, the  following "advanced offensive weapons" will be deployed:  <H5>  General Trend of Advanced Weaponry During 2000 </H5>   1. Strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and missiles of  mass destruction, such as intercontinental missiles, strategic  missiles, and cruise missiles;    2. Space defense systems;    3. Aircraft carrier and their planes;    4. Submarines;    5. Bombers and fighters which have the long-range capacity  to penetrate enemy defenses; and    6. Armored vehicles, such as tanks and infantry vehicles.    An advanced command, control, communications and information  system (C3I) [C cubed denoted as C with superscript three] is  required for the high-efficiency operation of the above  weaponry. Both the United States and the former Soviet Union  believe that C3I "is the multiplier of military strength" and  regard development and improvement of C3I as an urgent strategic  task in military building. Meanwhile, they have accelerated the  pace of making conventional weapons more intelligent and  invisible, and have vigorously developed kinetic and directional  weapons. This is the general trend of weaponry in all countries.    What is the situation with the above-mentioned weaponry in  China? The following is a brief analysis of each item:  <H5>  What is the Situation in New Chinese Weaponry? </H5>   1. Nuclear weapons and missiles of mass destruction.    Regarding limited wars, the nuclear capacity of the Chinese  military is sufficient to check nuclear threats from its  opponents. The offensive capacity of its ballistic missiles can  cover almost all neighboring countries. It is thought that the  armed forces can be equipped with cruise missiles by the year  2000.    2. Space defense systems.    Space is today's "high border" and tomorrow's "battlefield."  It is thought that China will lead the world in space  technology in the 21st century. By then, China is expected to  have its first space shuttle, which will enable China to  establish its own space defense system, and will have improved  its defense network composed of various underground and  space-based facilities, and will even be able to attack flying  objects or enemy facilities in space.    3. Aircraft carrier.    An aircraft carrier and its jets can form an all-directional  comprehensive combat force. The aircraft carrier group is  usually composed of the following different types of vessels:  An aircraft carrier escorted by two cruisers, four to six  destroyers or escort vessels, and two attack submarines. In  order to ensure supplies, there is also a supply vessel. As a  result, aircraft on the carrier can be offensive and defensive.  The combined and comprehensive combat effectiveness of the  aircraft and escort vessels prevail over the simple  multiplication of these weapons.    As is known to all, China does not yet have an aircraft  carrier or cruisers, the main components of the escort fleet.    Three key technologies are required to build an aircraft  carrier: First, carrier-borne aircraft and landing and take-off  technology; second, air defense, which includes the functions  and development of anti-radar and intercept weapons; and third,  the development of antisubmarine technology and removing  underwater threats to the aircraft carrier. However, the three  key technologies are precisely the weak point of China's defense  industry.  <H3>  Seize International Opportunity To Assimilate Advanced  Technology </H3>   China's defense industry has benefited a lot from the  flexible diplomacy adopted by the CPC in the 1980's, which  enabled it to obtain advanced foreign technology to improve its  weaponry. Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union in  1992, Russia reduced the price of sophisticated weapons and some  technology, which enabled the CPC to considerably improve its  weaponry and equipment. The CPC purchased advanced Su-27 jets  from Russia. The Su-33, an improved model of the Su-27, is a  carrier-borne jet. It has been reported that the CPC plans to  purchase the "Minsk" antisubmarine aircraft carrier from  Russia's Pacific Fleet, which will serve as a research model.  Provided that China's growing economic situation does not  suffer serious setbacks, it is estimated that China will have  enough financial resources and technology to build a viable  aircraft carrier within 10 years, and will be able to render it  combat effective within three to five years after it becomes  operational.    4. Nuclear submarines.    China now possesses nuclear submarines, but in limited  numbers. There are no indications so far how many more nuclear  submarines the CPC will build.    5. Long-range airborne troops.    The "Hong 6" bombers, which the CPC now possess, is based on  the Soviet model Tu-16, which is technically outdated and  inferior in penetrating enemy defenses. The new generation of  the "Jianhong 7," which is still under development, is more or  less the same as the "Tornado," jointly developed by Britain,  Germany, and Italy. It can penetrate enemy defenses at low  altitudes. Equipped with air-to-air refueling equipment, it has  a long range. It is estimated that the military will be  equipped with the "Jianhong 7" by 1996.    6. Tanks and armored vehicles.    The rate of the CPC infantry's equipment with armored  vehicles is not high. Troops are still equipped with outmoded  "T-59" tanks. However, the newly developed "85 II M" tank, which  is a rival to Russia's T-72, has gone into mass production. The  functions of the latest "90" model surpass the T-72, but because  of a lack of funds the tank is not yet produced in large numbers.  <H3>  First Step Taken in Satellite Weapons and Space Warning  Systems </H3>   In armored equipment, it seems that the CPC is not  interested  in the armored infantry vehicles used by the developed  countries. Instead, the CPC is still developing armored vehicles  of the previous generation, which will inevitably affect the  combat effectiveness of its ground forces.    Regarding command, control, communications, and information  systems, which play an overall role and increase the efficiency  of all types of weapons, CPC equipment in this regard functions  relatively poorly. But it is believed that this situation will  improve remarkably when its space technology develops to an  extent sufficient to deploy satellite weapons and space warning  systems. It is estimated that guided weapons will enter a  practical stage in 2008.  <H5>  Conventional Troops Make Preparations for Reunifying Taiwan </H5>   As China is a defensive nation, the fundamental purpose of  its conventional troops is to safeguard national security and  resist foreign aggression. So far, China has no intention of  expanding its military influence outside its territory. The  CPC's defense is based on ground forces. The Navy is a  relatively weak factor and it does not have the comprehensive  combat effectiveness to undertake the strategic tasks entrusted  by the state. Although the Air Force is not small, its quality  is not high, aircraft categories are not complete, and its  ability to offer air cover and support land and sea operations  is relatively low. As pointed out previously, CPC troops  account for only 0.3 percent of the country's population, which  is not a big proportion. Moreover, there is still a gap in  offensive weapons between China and the developed nations.  Therefore, the military strength of the CPC does not exceed its  defensive needs. In fact, there are still outstanding problems  related to the duties performed by CPC troops to defend the  country, such as the Nansha [Spratlys] Islands, Diaoyutai  Islands, and the Sino-Indian border.    It is noteworthy that the CPC has never promised not to  resort to force on the Taiwan question. One of the main tasks  of its conventional troops is to make preparations in this  regard.  <H5>  Navy Plans Offshore Development </H5>   The open economic policy has boosted mainland China's  maritime exchanges and economic activities with other countries.  Mainland China's economy is effecting a change from "internal  trade" to "external trade." Thanks to these developments and  changes, the security of shipping and marine communications  lines will be increasingly important. The CPC's Navy is  gradually developing towards the direction of enhancing its  offshore combat effectiveness. In the next decade or so,  China's Navy will be capable of controlling Chinese waters and  relevant shipping routes. When necessary, the Navy will escort  important shipping and oceanic scientific observation  activities. By then, China will be capable of sending troops  abroad, which will exert an influence on the world's military  situation.</p>

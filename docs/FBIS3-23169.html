No sooner had  ITAR-TASS reported that the criminal group arrested in St.  Petersburg had intended to carry out this attempt, and the St.  Petersburg Television evening edition of INFORM-TV refuted it,  citing an officer on duty at the Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FCS] St. Petersburg Administration.    So whose reports are more reliable?    At the beginning of February, IZVESTIYA told its readers:  Employees of the antiterrorist service at the FCS St. Petersburg  Administration, together with criminal investigation officers,  detained an armed group of five people. The arrest took place  when these robbers attacked the security premises of the "Zarya"  Science and Production Association, tied up the guards, and  seized the weapons there.    The FCS St. Petersburg Administration Press Center reported  at that time that those arrested belonged to a grouping which  "considers it possible to resolve complex political problems by  terrorist methods."    Today the materials gathered during the  operational-investigation work testify to the fact that the  members of this grouping did intend to carry out an attempt on  the life of St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak and attack the  Government House in Moscow. Aleksandr Kuznetsov, leader of the  antiterrorism service at the FCS St. Petersburg Administration,  stated this.    The failed terrorists are well known to those who were  present at rallies conducted by opposition political movements.  Aleksandr Bogdanov regularly participated in conducting these  rallies, and he conducted the registration to the "People's  Volunteer Corps." Maksim Izmailov collaborated closely with the  "Russian Communist Workers Party Young People's Workers Group"  and with Nina Andreyeva's brainchild -- "The Young Guard of  Bolsheviks of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)."  Captain 3rd Rank, Retired, Vladimir Khoukhlyantsev was an  activist in the St. Petersburg section of the USSR Officers  Union.    Some of them took part in the October events in Moscow.</p>

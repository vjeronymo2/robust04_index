			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Profits rise at Saudi bank SAUDI International Bank (SIB), the London-based bank which is half-owned by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, has announced a 24 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.1m (Dollars 5.27m) for 1991 and net profits, after a Pounds 3m tax credit, to Pounds 6.1m. Operating profits rose 87 per cent to Pounds 22.3m after record income of Pounds 48.1m, notably from strong Treasury earnings and increased fee income from fund management and advisory work, against a 3.8 per cent rise in expenses to Pounds 25.7m. After agreement with the Inland Revenue over the bank's tax computations for the preceding five years, SIB was able for 1991 to release Pounds 3m of provisions against possible tax liabilities into the profit column. The bank made a loan provision charge of Pounds 19.25m against loans in the US and Britain, reflecting the continued recession. This takes total provisions to Pounds 24.7m. Mr Peter de Roos, chief executive, said SIB would see further profit growth in 1992 in its core fund management, corporate finance, trade and Treasury activities. The bank's assets grew by over 8 per cent to Pounds 2.4bn, 78 per cent of which was in bank deposits and marketable securities, leaving SIB in excess of Bank for International Settlements risk asset ratios.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Sejm adopted today a government report on the  second stage of restructuring the hard coal mining industry (in  1994-95), presented yesterday by Industry and Trade Minister  Marek Pol.    The main goal of this stage of restructuring, according to  the minister, is to achieve profitability by coal companies and  to maintain it, to ensure competitiveness of Polish coal on  foreign markets, to clear the mining industry's debts, to make  funds for the modernization of collieries available, and to  create conditions for pay rises to miners, thus reducing their  uncertainty about job security. All this is to serve a supreme  goal -- the achievement of effectiveness and stability in the  hard coal mining industry.    There were 242 votes for adopting the report, 27 against,  and  53 abstentions.</p>

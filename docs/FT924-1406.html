			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Clash over pensions review THE National Association of Pension Funds may be on course for a clash with its second-biggest member over its submission to the government's Pensions Law Review Committee, published yesterday. The association has backed a compulsory compensation scheme for occupational pension funds in spite of fierce opposition from the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, the UK's second-biggest. That scheme threatened earlier this month to resign from the NAPF over the issue. The committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode, was established after Robert Maxwell's pension fund frauds. The committee invited responses to 81 questions on pension regulations. It received about 1,000 submissions. There has been a change in the NAPF's stance on compensation following submissions from its members. The association no longer believes that shortfalls should be met by the compensation scheme, however they occur. Instead, compensation should cover cases of fraud, theft and criminal negligence alone. Mr Brian Matthews, finance director of the Electricity scheme, said the NAPF had responded 'in part' to its objections. 'But it is still taking a position to which we object, that compensation levies should be paid by scheme members.' He added that the question of resignation would be considered further once the electricity scheme had studied the submission. The NAPF argues that a strengthened Occupation Pensions Board should be the regulatory body for all aspects of pension schemes except investment management and taxation. Several bodies including Prudential, the insurance group, and the Confederation of British Industry want a single pensions regulator. The Institute of Actuaries, which announced details of its submission to the Goode committee yesterday, argued for a compulsory compensation scheme to cover fraud and theft alone.</p>

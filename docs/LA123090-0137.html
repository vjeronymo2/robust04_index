			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> IN OFFICE, UNDER FIRE IN S. AFRICA;  </P> <P> BLACK TOWN COUNCILORS SEE A VITAL ROLE FOR THEMSELVES, BUT ACTIVISTS SEE THEM  AS A PART OF APARTHEID. THEIR HOMES HAVE BEEN ATTACKED, AND SIX HAVE BEEN  KILLED. HUNDREDS HAVE RESIGNED.  </P> <P> Let the record show that Joe Mphokeng did not want to be a township councilor  in the first place. He was closing in on retirement, living comfortably, and he  did not need the trouble.  </P> <P> Dozens of black councilors and their families had been killed over the years by  young radicals who said the councils were puppets of apartheid. But by 1988 the  government had locked up its opponents, the townships were quiet and Mphokeng's  friends persuaded him to run.  </P> <P> As he coasted to victory, Mphokeng vowed to use his seat on the Mamelodi Town  Council to do some good. At first, as he helped constituents caught in the web  of apartheid and fought development deals that put gold watches on other  councilors' wrists, Mphokeng thought he was succeeding.  </P> <P> Then the African National Congress was legalized, and it thought otherwise.  Anti-apartheid leaders in Mamelodi summoned Mphokeng to a meeting in June to  demand his resignation and, to their surprise, he showed up. But he refused to  step down.  </P> <P> A few weeks later, as the Mphokeng family was watching "Dallas" on television,  a hand grenade crashed through the living room window, rolled under a sofa and  exploded. Mphokeng's wife, Thembi, and their 12-year-old son, George, were  injured.  </P> <P> The only thing left intact that night was Mphokeng's resolve to remain a  councilor and a wall hanging that read: "Our home is open to God's friends,  guests and sunshine."  </P> <P> On Christmas Eve, though, after months of threats and fear, Mphokeng  regretfully resigned.  </P> <P> Black town councils across South Africa are increasingly under siege. Of the  1,867 black councilors elected in 1988, nearly half have resigned, most of them  in recent months. This year, six councilors have been assassinated and the  homes and property of 87 others attacked.  </P> <P> Councilors say that if they leave, whites will quickly take over the townships  and blacks will be deprived of any say or experience in local government. The  ANC wants the council system to collapse, arguing that it is based on apartheid  and ultimately controlled by whites.  </P> <P> ANC-aligned "civic associations" this month urged blacks to boycott businesses  owned by township councilors, shun councilors and their families and stage  protests outside councilors' homes. The associations say they are not  advocating violence, but some of their supporters have not gotten the message.  </P> <P> Mphokeng, a slightly built 59-year-old with graying beard and wire-rimmed  spectacles, was not a brave man so much as a stubborn one. Weeks ago, he  admitted privately that it was probably a mistake to run for office in the  first place. Of his vanquished election opponent, he said ruefully, "She must  be feeling very happy."  </P> <P> The Mphokeng family spent two years of restless nights listening for more  trouble. But the councilor always said that he would not be cowed.  </P> <P> "Look, people," Mphokeng told a hostile crowd a few months ago, "I was elected  democratically. I could understand if the people who elected me told me to  resign. But you are not the people who elected me. And I cannot disappoint  them."  </P> <P> He had held on a long time, longer than most.  </P> <P> The people who elected Mphokeng and those who wanted him to resign live  together in a crowded township wedged into the base of a short mountain range,  15 miles east of the clean, jacaranda-lined streets of the capital, Pretoria.  </P> <P> Mamelodi has a pretty name, which means "birds whistling," but a dusty and  characterless facade. Older residents call it simply "the location," as most  ghettos in South Africa were once known.  </P> <P> Mamelodi's wood-paneled council chambers resemble that of any medium-size U.S.  city and the coat of arms carries the generic slogan: City of Progress. The  seat of government is a single-story brick building surrounded by stone walls  frosted with rolls of razor wire.  </P> <P> The Mamelodi councilors are guided through their monthly agenda of zoning  changes and building permits by Mayor Sydney Mokone, a bulky man with three  large, shiny rings. ("One of my secretaries will give you my business card," he  told a reporter.)  </P> <P> Mphokeng worked in Room 54, one of the dimly lit offices assigned to the newest  of the 14 councilors. The desk was covered with a plastic tablecloth, in a blue  and red floral print. His brown felt hat rested on a peg on the wall, and  visitors sat on two wooden benches.  </P> <P> "I stepped into the furnace, and I hadn't expected it," he said in his office a  few weeks ago. "I thought I was going to help the people, not knowing that they  would start this nonsense.  </P> <P> "It's frustrating, you know," he added. "You want to do a good job, and we are  doing a lot. But the 'civics' are interrupting us. And if we don't do their  thing, they come and petrol-bomb us. This is democracy?"  </P> <P> In 1988, Mphokeng made an ideal candidate. He was widely known as Pae-Pae  (pronounced Pie-Pie), a character he played in a popular dramatic series on an  African-language television station. A father of five and grandfather of two,  he was well liked by neighbors, went to church regularly and sang in a  community choir.  </P> <P> About a quarter of Mamelodi's voters turned up on election day, and Mphokeng  won, 2,200 to 950, over a nurse in Ward 4. He read his victory as a sign that  Mamelodi wanted new, honest councilors. Then, while under attack from new  enemies, he was shunned by many of his friends.  </P> <P> "This is what I ask myself all the time: 'What have I done wrong? Why my  family?' " he said.  </P> <P> Mphokeng knew from the beginning that his was a dangerous, nearly impossible  job. Local elections have been widely boycotted, and black councils, being  segregated from the large tax bases of the next-door white communities, are  perennially starved for funds. As a result, many councils are corrupt.  </P> <P> Blood has been spilled on both sides of the issue. During 1984-86, some  councilors were murdered by angry mobs in fiery "necklaces" of gasoline-soaked  tires. Police killed 13 blacks in Mamelodi during a march to demand that the  council resign.  </P> <P> In August, 1989, a year after his election, a gasoline bomb came through the  Mphokengs' bedroom window as they slept, setting fire to the curtains and  carpet next to their bed.  </P> <P> No one was hurt that time and Mphokeng continued his work, drawing the monthly  council allowance of 720 rand (about $290). He began an unofficial small claims  court for domestic disputes in his office, deciding cases on noisy neighbors,  disobedient children and cheating husbands.  </P> <P> Most of the 350,000 Mamelodians are poor, earning less than $1,000 a year on  average, and housing is scarce. Crime is rampant; unemployed and unemployable  young men hang out at the local taxi rank. The next generation's prospects are  not much better; political disputes kept the schools closed for many weeks this  year.  </P> <P> In council meetings, Mphokeng criticized private developers who, under  lucrative contracts signed with the council, were building houses that, at  $20,000 each, were well beyond the resources of most Mamelodians. Some  councilors privately began to think of Mphokeng as an irritant.  </P> <P> "Joe is not an easy man," admitted his wife, Thembi. "He doesn't just agree  with everything. He is a hard nut and you must convince him."  </P> <P> Mphokeng thought the country's troubles were over in February, when President  Frederik W. de Klerk legalized the ANC and freed Nelson Mandela. Mphokeng  recorded Mandela's first Soweto speech, and he pasted a photograph of Mandela  into the family scrapbook.  </P> <P> But the new era of political freedom caused even more problems for Mphokeng.  Anti-apartheid leaders resurrected the civic associations, ANC-inspired  alternative governments that had been crushed by arrests and banning orders in  1986.  </P> <P> The most pressing matter was the rent boycott that the civic associations had  launched five years earlier to protest the township government's high fees and  poor services. Now residents were prepared to resume payments to the town  council, but they wanted the arrears, which amount to more than $500 million  countrywide, erased from the books.  </P> <P> The associations also resumed their dormant campaigns to pressure township  councils to resign. Their goal is to send a message to the government before  negotiations for a new constitution begin: Blacks will refuse to participate in  anything less than democratic, multiracial local governments.  </P> <P> When Mphokeng refused to step down in June, one young anti-apartheid activist  warned him that a "black car" would one day run over the obstacles to black  liberation, obstacles such as Mphokeng.  </P> <P> Three weeks later, Mphokeng's son, George, overheard several women in the  street saying that all the township councilors would soon be killed. He ran  breathlessly into the house.  </P> <P> "They say they are going to kill us and kidnap me," he told his mother.  </P> <P> Two days later, the hand grenade was lobbed over the Mphokengs' brick fence and  through the living room window. George dived for his mother, knocking her into  a hallway as the grenade exploded. A three-inch piece of shrapnel lodged in  George's abdomen and another shard seared Thembi's leg. Relatives rushed the  two to the hospital.  </P> <P> That night, Mphokeng watched glumly as his living room burned and delighted  young activists danced in the street outside.  </P> <P> "It was a terrible scene," Mphokeng said.  </P> <P> Pasty Malefo, an ANC activist and civic association leader who lives in  Mphokeng's neighborhood, came to the house later to offer his sympathy.  </P> <P> Malefo remembers Mphokeng asking: "What am I dying for? I'm not making money on  this council."  </P> <P> Malefo did not think any civic association members were behind the attack, but  he acknowledged that the angry youngsters in his organization can be difficult  to control.  </P> <P> "Much as we regret this, we can understand why they (councilors) are being  attacked," Malefo said. "And as much as we'd like to stand up and say, 'Stop  attacking councilors,' we can't do that unless we can stop the attacks by the  police on our comrades as well."  </P> <P> Mphokeng was not sure whom to blame, but he was wary of the civic association's  sympathy. "A python licks the victim's face very smooth, only to prepare for  the swallowing," he said.  </P> <P> Malefo said Mphokeng "may have good intentions. But he is very misguided. Even  the dumbest of these councilors must realize these councils don't work."  </P> <P> Like the angry youth of today, Mphokeng has deep emotional scars from a  lifetime of being black in a country controlled by whites. He was born in a  grass hut on a white man's farm in 1931, just as dawn turned the vast African  sky golden. On the same day, a son was born to the farmer, who decided to give  his and his farmhand's sons the same name -- Josiah Horace van der Merwe.  </P> <P> The black young Josiah started school on the farm, going to classes for six  months and spending the rest of the year in the fields of maize, peas, potatoes  and fruit trees. Children of black farmhands were expected to work without pay,  and white farmers discouraged workers from attending school.  </P> <P> Josiah and his 14 brothers and sisters wanted to go to school full time in  town, and their father agreed. But the children were harassed by white farmers  on their way to school each day. Mphokeng still has a scar on his leg from the  whip used by one of those men. "It is a mark I don't ever forget," Mphokeng  said.  </P> <P> Mphokeng's father, the third generation to work the Van der Merwe farm, moved  to the nearby township and took a job carving tombstones. It was there that the  black Josiah Horace van der Merwe took his father's last name and became Josiah  Mphokeng.  </P> <P> After high school, Mphokeng studied at a teachers college and moved to Pretoria  in search of work. At first, he scrubbed floors, washed dishes and worked in  the garden for a white family, earning about $1 a month.  </P> <P> One day, he remembers, he discovered a letter that was addressed to him but had  been opened weeks earlier by his employers. It was from the Native  Commissioner's Office, offering Mphokeng a job. He went to work as an  interpreter for the native commissioner, who traveled the country meeting with  African chiefs.  </P> <P> In 1953, Mphokeng joined the South African police and quickly rose to the rank  of sergeant. He soon became disillusioned.  </P> <P> "The law says you can arrest a person, any person, who is committing a crime in  your presence," Mphokeng said. In practice, black officers could not arrest  whites. He decided to quit after a judge dismissed charges against a white man  because Mphokeng, a black man, was the arresting officer.  </P> <P> "I said to myself, 'This is nonsense,' " Mphokeng remembered. "Then I just woke  up one morning and I said, 'Resign.' "  </P> <P> He went to work on an African-language radio station run by the South African  Broadcasting Co. He quit to help his wife start a driving school in their home.  He still works part time as a radio and TV actor.  </P> <P> "All my life we blacks have been told to carry out instructions and not given a  chance to think," Mphokeng said. "Every black man is against apartheid. But as  far as I'm concerned, any black person who lives in this country works for the  system."  </P> <P> He has learned, though, to bury his bitterness. In the 1970s and '80s, when the  townships were in flames, "we wanted to say something," he said. "But once you  talked bad about the government, you got detained. I didn't want to see myself  behind bars."  </P> <P> Not a day went by this year that Mphokeng did not think about stepping down.  Several township councils near Pretoria collapsed and he had begun to feel like  the only target left.  </P> <P> "We are the only ones still holding on," he said two weeks ago. "And these  people will definitely attack us."  </P> <P> Many of the people who pushed Mphokeng to run for office had fallen silent.  </P> <P> "He was their favorite before the ANC was unbanned, but now people have backed  away," Thembi said.  </P> <P> "It's not that they are against us," Joe Mphokeng said. "But they are afraid of  being victimized themselves."  </P> <P> Mphokeng had wanted to stay on because he did not like the alternative. If the  council resigned, he pointed out, a white administrator would just run the  township with residents' money. Would not it be better, he asked, for honest  black men to work for change from within the system?  </P> <P> Malefo, the civic association official, considered that question for a long  time. "I see his point," Malefo said. "But if he's on the people's side, he  should do what the people want him to do."  </P> <P> On Christmas Eve, Mphokeng was warned that another hand grenade attack was  imminent. Within hours, he and eight other councilors decided to announce their  resignations.  </P> <P> Since then, it has been quiet around the Mphokeng home. Mphokeng says his  convictions have not changed, but they do not seem worth the price anymore. He  laments the death of representative government in Mamelodi, and predicts that  township conditions will get worse.  </P> <P> "Please tell the people that Josiah was forced to resign," he said regretfully.  "It was the only way to save my life and my family's lives too."  </P> <P> Next: The black policeman.  </P></p>

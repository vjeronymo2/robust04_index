			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIAMATTI SHOULD CALL IN THE 'BULLPEN' TO JUDGE ROSE  </P> <P> Pete Rose will probably strike out in his attempt to get the federal courts to  prevent baseball's Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti from deciding his fate.  But "Charlie Hustle" does have a point in arguing that Giamatti may have  compromised his objectivity when he wrote a letter to a federal judge in  Cincinnati, commenting on Ronald Peters' cooperation with the baseball  investigation.  </P> <P> Peters, a convicted drug trafficker, was facing a stiff sentence. Giamatti  wrote to the sentencing judge, advising him of Peters' cooperation, calling it  "significant and truthful." The obvious purpose of the letter was to reward  Peters for his help in the baseball investigation.  </P> <P> In publicly declaring Peters' damning testimony against Rose to be "truthful"  -- without having heard from Rose himself -- Giamatti appears to have prejudged  the credibility of a major witness. This is simply unfair. Rose has essentially  called Peters a liar, and Rose's lawyers have alleged that the "betting slips"  Peters has provided to the media -- and presumably to the commissioner -- were  altered. Since Peters sought to trade his information for favorable treatment,  there is good reason to approach its veracity with several shakers full of  salt. It may well be believable -- especially if it is corroborated by  objective evidence -- but it certainly cannot be believed simply because Peters  says it is true.  </P> <P> If Giamatti is the judge and jury in the Rose case -- as he claims he is --  then he should not be making public (or even private) assessments of the  credibility of a crucial witness, before that witness has been subjected to the  truth-testing process of confrontation and cross-examination. Would Giamatti  really be open to the possibility of now disbelieving Peters? If so, would he  have to write a correcting letter to the judge?  </P> <P> Giamatti is not bound, of course, by the provisions of the Bill of Rights, or  even by the common-law system of determining truth. Baseball is a law unto  itself. It has a unique status as our national pastime, a status recognized by  its exemption from antitrust laws that are applicable to other big-time sports.  But the public has the right to expect that major league baseball will be fair.  </P> <P> There is nothing inherently wrong with the commissioner of baseball expressing  his opinion on the value of a witness' cooperation. Nor is there anything wrong  with him writing to a sentencing judge on behalf of a convicted defendant  awaiting sentence, even if that letter was part of a deal for that defendant's  cooperation with his investigation. Prosecutors do that all the time.  </P> <P> And that is the crux of the issue. Giamatti seems to be acting more like a  prosecutor -- a careful and fair one, to be sure -- than like a judge. The  investigation appears similar to grand jury inquiries being conducted by an  earnest prosecutor determined to learn the truth.  </P> <P> But under the American system of justice, a grand jury only indicts; it does  not convict. An independent judiciary, not involved in the investigation,  passes the ultimate judgment of guilt or innocence only after hearing both  sides. This "adversary system of justice" is widely regarded as the best  protection against bias, both conscious and unconscious.  </P> <P> Whether Giamatti eventually wins or loses the federal court suit filed against  him by Rose -- and I predict he will win -- he should take Rose's charges of  prejudgment seriously. In a high-profile case like this one, it is important  that justice not only be done, but also appear to be done. Of course, Giamatti  must believe that he can still be fair. And he may even be right. But Pete Rose  fans will never be satisfied if the commissioner relies on Peters' testimony  after having publicly prejudged his credibility.  </P> <P> Giamatti should proceed with his investigation. If, after hearing Rose's side  of the story, he concludes that Rose is guilty of betting, then he should issue  his report as an "indictment." That indictment should then be presented to a  completely neutral panel of distinguished arbitrators who had nothing to do  with the investigation. That panel, which could include such luminaries as  retired Supreme Court Justices Arthur A. Goldberg Jr. and Lewis Powell and  others of similar unimpeachable integrity, would make the ultimate decision.  They would hear both sides of the case, make credibility determinations about  the witnesses and render their decision of guilt or innocence.  </P> <P> Under that approach, everything Giamatti has done up to now would be perfectly  acceptable. He would be a strong advocate for the integrity of baseball. But in  America, it is regarded as unfair to be both investigator and judge. If and  when Bart Giamatti releases his indictment of Pete Rose, he should be taken out  for a relief pitcher.  </P></p>

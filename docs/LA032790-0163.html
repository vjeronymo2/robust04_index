			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STONE APOLOGIZES FOR FILM SCENE  </P> <P> Oscar-winning film director Oliver Stone has apologized for wrongly depicting  Syracuse police clubbing college protesters in his movie "Born on the Fourth of  July."  </P> <P> Stone apologized in a letter that was sent to the Syracuse Police Benevolent  Assn. and addressed to all city residents.  </P> <P> The film won two Oscars at the Academy Awards on Monday night, including one  for Stone for best director.  </P> <P> "I took creative license to make my point and sometimes sacrificed smaller  truths for larger ones," Stone wrote. "There is, I would like to point out, a  disclaimer at the end of the film to this effect."  </P> <P> The movie, starring Tom Cruise, is based on the life story of Ron Kovic, and  his passage from patriotic soldier to anti-war activist.  </P> <P> Based on a book by Kovic, the movie depicts city police officers beating  students during a campus protest at Syracuse University in 1970. City police  officials denied that officers used violence to stop college protests.  </P></p>

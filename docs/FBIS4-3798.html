			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The United States  today plans to launch the most expensive spy satellite it ever  made from Cape Canaveral, Florida, THE NEW YORK TIMES reported.    Quoting Pentagon officials and private analysts, THE TIMES  said the primary mission of 1.5 billion dollars new spy  satellite is to eavesdrop on Russia.    The satellite is expected to be put into orbit by the 300  million dollars Titan IV Rocket at 12:40 eastern daylight time.    John Pike, the director of space policy at the Federation of  American Scientists, said the satellite weighing five tons and  was equipped with a dish antenna 152 meters in diameter to  intercept the telecommunications of Russian military,  intelligence and political officials.    The spy satellite was built and will be operated by the  National Reconnaissance Office, the United States' largest and  most secretive intelligence service, whose existence the  government did not acknowledge until 1992, THE TIMES said.    The data collected by the satellite would then be collected  and analyzed by the National Security Agency, using a global  network of ground stations and an array of supercomputers, the  paper said.</p>

The  open session of the Majles was held yesterday with Hojjat  ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri presiding. In this session, the bill of the  Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]  budget were presented to the Majles. It is interesting that  before the bills were presented, the deputies of Tehran, Semnan,  and Baft made speeches.  <H5>  Seyyed Reza Akrami, Deputy From Semnan </H5> <H3>  For the Late Debts of the Country, We Must Have a  Comprehensive Solution in Order To Pay Them at the Appropriate  Time </H3>   The first pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Mr.  Akrami, the deputy from Semnan, who said: Today, the Second  Five-Year Plan of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the 1373  budget bills will also have problematic consequences.    The deputy of the people of Semnan, referring to the  importance of oil and oil revenues in the national economy,  said: Oil is the national capital of the country and it must be  used for capital investment. In other words, we must sell the  oil, train an educated, skilled work force, create work,  workshops, electricity and factories, and create suitable jobs.  Otherwise, in the long run, there will be problems.    He then suggested in this connection that in the Second  Five-Year Plan, the oil revenues be only used for national  investment. For the late debts of the country, we must have a  comprehensive solution in order to at least pay the debts at an  appropriate time, and in the future suitable ways other than the  oil revenues can be used for borrowing. Our Islamic country has  the potential for nonoil exports at a level several times the  present one. In this connection, does the Ministry of  Agriculture not import the equivalent of $1.5 billion in food  stuff. Is it not able to export an equivalent amount of fruit,  dried fruits, etc.? With proper planning, can we not become  self-sufficient in wheat, rice, fodder, meat, and cheese? Why is  the milk that is produced in the districts and villages wasted,  and then we read in the press that the Ministry of Construction  Jihad, with the help of the Ministry of Commerce, intends to  import 20,000 tons of cheese by the end of the year?    Why are 1.4 million barrels of petroleum products used in  this country? Can we not seriously revise this tremendous  consumption? Why should more than 50 percent of our cars carry  only one passenger and use 50 rials per liter of gasoline? He  suggested that a traffic plan be implemented in all the cities  in order to counteract the present trend of the consumption of  imported fuel.    He added: The speaker of the Majles and the president can  request that the ministries have an annual foreign currency  income of $10 billion [as published] from the export of  minerals, manufactured goods, fruits and dry goods, training of  students from other countries, offering medical services, and  the sale of software and hardware.    Referring to the recycling of goods by advanced industrial  countries such as Germany that, for example, obtains 52 percent  of its consumer paper through recycling paper, the speaker said:  In our country, only a seminar was held by the City Hall and the  issue was filed away. The recycling of paper in our country is  very small. The Planning and Budget Committee has included a  note in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget according  to which every province will be able with proper planning  through exports, the sale of land, and business taxes, to make a  deposit in the national treasury and allocate it to fundamental  projects or incomplete projects of its cities.    In conclusion, he said: Can only the province of Kerman have  the first rank in nonoil products by exporting pistachios,  carpets, and handicrafts and for other provinces to be ranked  lower or does this potential exist in other provinces of the  country as well? It only requires thought, initiative, planning,  management, and cooperation.  <H5>  Marziyyeh Vahid-Dastjerdi, Deputy From Tehran </H5>   Another pre-agenda speaker of the Majles yesterday was Ms.  Vahid-Dastjerdi, the deputy from Tehran, who expressed her  condolences on the death of the revered source of emulation,  Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani, and mentioned a present problem of  the country as the lack of a unified and correct management  system. Emphasizing the sensitivity and difficulty of the  present conditions, she said: Because of the lack of such a  system, the best instruction, decrees, and plans do not result  in the slightest action.    She said that the Five-Year Plan and the budget will be  successful, provided the preparations and means for the  implementation of these programs and also a strong management  for its organization are available.    The speaker then emphasized the necessity of the existence  of  a balance of powers in decision making and planning and said:  Our economic stability depends on the political and cultural  stability of the country.    Ms. Dastjerdi added: Our sworn enemies also do not deny the  fact that Iran has recently been the reviver of the religion of  Islam in the world, and all that we state in the various parts  of the world as the increasing property of Islam and even  spirituality is the result of the sacred divine revolution of  Iran.    She continued: The world today is ready to follow and  requires a model, a model of economy, politics, culture, etc. If  we are not able to offer the best practical models in these  areas, other Islamic nations and even non-Islamic nations will  win the match.    The speaker considered one of the most important issues in  Islamic economy as conservation and avoiding waste and added:  Unfortunately, despite all the emphasis by the Commander of the  Faithful to his officials in regards to conservation, what is  prevalent today is waste and what is not seen is conservation.  Just a few days ago, we witnessed that the Ministry of  Construction Jihad sent an invitation card on relatively large,  high-quality paper with gold print and English on the back to  270 Majles deputies for the first authentic Iranian Holstein Cow  Festival, inviting all the deputies to this so-called festival.  She pointed out: The annual import of 500,000 tons of paper into  the country is significant, and the result is that this kind of  useless paper distribution and printing of cards, invitations,  and small and large magazines takes place. How can we say we  obey Imam 'Ali, who at one time examined the treasury of the  Muslims with the light of one candle?    Go to the offices and government centers in the morning. You  will see most of the lights on in the bright daylight. Why is  the energy and the treasury of the Muslims wasted without any  consideration?    The speaker emphasized: The Majles must in its budgeting,  aside from all interests, reduce the budget of every ministry in  which there is more waste.    In conclusion, the deputy from Tehran said: It is clear that  when we control the flow of oil but others the price, it cannot  be relied on as an important and reliable lever in economic  planning, because it will create chaos and an imbalance in all  planning.    She emphasized proper supervision by the Majles over the  executive organizations.    In conclusion, with reference to the Ministry of Education,  even though it is an educational matter, and especially since 65  percent of its personnel are women, she said: Is it not  religiously and logically more proper to have a woman as the  minister of education? Even though we do not have a shortage of  administrative and creative women, they speak of lack of  experience of women at the upper management level. My question,  is were the gentlemen born as ministers, or have they come to  occupy these position gradually? What is wrong with some of the  deputy ministers of education being women?  <H5>  Ahmad Pishbin, Deputy From Baft </H5>   The third pre-agenda speaker was Ahmad Pishbin, the deputy  from Baft, who offered his condolences on the death of the  revered source of emulation of the Shi'ites and, speaking of  foreign currency situation, said:    The daily life of the various strata of people has been  disrupted. Who is to be accountable for such chaos? On what  basis have the economic planners deregulated the dollar and  placed the existing foreign currency of the country at the  disposal of capitalists, thereby causing problems and high  prices? Would it not have been better, instead of using  Western-style planning, for them to plan according to  capabilities? Is it not better to put our efforts into a variety  of exports and production? We must avoid unnecessary imports and  make use of the resources of the country. Among the most  important resources of this country are faith and belief of the  people in the revolution, Islam, and religious guardianship.  Through strong planning, the future must be drawn through  reliance on God and without attention to the ideas and  disruptions of global oppressors.    Referring to making agriculture active and creating jobs in  the existing areas of every city, he said: Today, we are  confused in the area of industrialization and the use of  appropriate tactics in the progress of industry in the country.    Every powerful person and group has engaged in importing  expensive machinery from various countries and displays the  mirage of machine-manufacturing factories to the people. We have  created a large consumer market for foreign countries. Hence,  every day, the number of the unemployed increases and the price  of the dollar increases. With the implementation of the  modification plan, the weakest strata of the society will be  sitting at home.    Referring to the discovery of embezzling gangs on various  levels, he said: The people are waiting to see how the judicial  organizations deal with these people. Would it not be better,  before false and apparently legal ways are found for these  individuals to be released by their partners, for the judicial  organizations to put these individuals on trial openly and  punish them, in order to both soothe the pain of the  revolutionary people and serve as a warning to these who would  continue the path of these individuals?    Referring to the problems of his constituency, Pishbin spoke  about the problem of the shortage of chemical fertilizers and  seeds, the high price of fodder, and the lack of government  support for animal husbandry products.    He made reminders regarding the failure to pay for damages  to  the houses of the flood victims, the failure to build flood  dams, the failure to distribute fuel in the region, and the  severe shortage of doctors.    In conclusion, he asked for more attention by the officials  to his constituency.  <H5>  Seyyed Morteza Nabavi, Deputy From Tehran </H5>   The fourth and last pre-agenda speaker of the Majles  yesterday was Seyyed Morteza Nabavi, the deputy from Tehran, who  spoke about the question of Hazrati, the deputy from Rasht, to  the minister of interior concerning the "reason for not granting  a march permit to the students of the Office of Strengthening  Unity." The details were published in a RESALAT editorial this  Monday.  <H5>  Speech of the Speaker of the Majles </H5>   After the speech of the president, the speaker of the Majles  thanked him and said: Mr. Hashemi kindly presented to the Majles  the Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] national budget for two continuous hours, with his usual  patience and perseverance. I also thank the honorable Cabinet,  who were inspired by the president and with perseverance and  24-hour efforts tolerated the burden more than in any other  year. Every year, we want to prepare the next year's budget, and  the gentlemen worked hard on the chapters this year. In  addition, the Second Five-Year Plan is added to it. First, it  appeared that examination of the Second Plan would negate the  need for us and the honorable government to have a 1373 budget.    But, as the honorable president pointed out, the projection  was that due to the fluctuation of the price of oil and other  issues the Second Plan might not be presented to the Majles on  time, and naturally in a short period of time it would be  impossible to attend to the people's plan. Fortunately, with  contacts and coordination with the president and his awareness,  he reached the conclusion, and we did too, that we need to have  the 1373 budget. This doubled the work of the honorable Cabinet,  in addition to adding to the examination of the Second Plan.  Hence, the generosity and kindness of Mr. Hashemi, the  government, and the honorable ministers and experts is worthy of  praise and gives us the opportunity to examine the budget bill  and the Second Plan on the basis of the amended bylaws of the  Majles (two rounds of discussion). This task will give the  opportunity for more expert examination in both rounds of  discussion in the Majles. We hope, as you pointed out and with  the same patience and care that your honor and the government  have used, God willing, our colleagues, with the same care and  coordination and with the active presence of the honorable  government experts, that we will be able to examine the budget  law in the Majles within the period allowed by the new law and  present it to the honorable government for implementation. Then  we will complete the Second Plan more carefully in a period of  one year.    In conclusion, the speaker of the Majles added: It seems  that  1373 is a completion for the First Five-Year Plan, or the fifth  year of the First Five-Year Plan, which in practice makes no  difference to us.  <H5>  Five Days With the Warm People of Khuzestan </H5> <H5>  Seyyed Amir Purfazeli, Dispatched Reporter. `Final Section' </H5>   The meetings of the speaker of the Majles with the nobel  people of the cities of Shadegan, Behbahan, and Ramhormoz were  among the trips of Mr. Nateq-Nuri to this province. In each of  these cities, the welcome was most enthusiastic.    Despite the deprivation that exists in Shadegan, this city  has good and pleasant people. In this region, prior to the  imposed war, the so-called Khalqi Arabs, whose purpose was to  inflict disunity and conspiracy against beloved Khuzestan, faced  the self-sacrifice of these same Arab people and were  eliminated. With the empty support of these mercenaries, the  Ba'thists wanted to separate Khuzestan from Iran, but they  failed.    In the city of Behbahan, the friendly people closed down the  city altogether and came to welcome the head of the Legislative  Branch, an action that was nearly unprecedented in the history  of that city. Among the interesting points in the city is the  implementation of the reservoir dam of Marun, which is located  19 km from Behbahan and was visited by the delegation.  Ramhormoz, also like other cities, made a great deal of effort  to host the friend and supporter of the Imam and the leader. In  this city, a large Khuzestan cement factory has been built,  which can expedite its economy.    In this city, a letter by a woman from Ramhormoz to the  delegation attracted everyone's attention. The letter stated:  "Despite the fact that all my possessions consisted of two  pieces of gold, I gave one piece in response to the call of the  leader for the people of Lebanon and I gave this one to the  treasury, even though I am embarrassed for it is very  insignificant." This woman could have stated her problems in  this letter, but with generosity showed that such actions are  higher than anything else.    On Wednesday morning, 17/09/1372 [8 December 1993], we left  Ramhormoz to visit the Petrochemical Complex of Bandar-e Imam  Khomeyni. This complex, which is one of the largest  petrochemical complexes in the world and if the agents of global  oppression would not cause disruption, our country would be  rescued from dependence now, finally after Japan refused to  complete this complex, our committed domestic experts along with  the participation of some countries took steps to develop and  operate it and were able to bring up to 70 percent of the  capacity of this complex to operation. Now, various kinds of raw  material for plastic industries, water pipes, plastic equipment  for cars, and PVC production in this complex have reached  operation.    On Thursday, that is, the last day of the trip, visits to  Khorramshahr and Abadan became possible for the delegation. The  heroism and resistance of the brave people of Khorramshahr and  Abadan will never be forgotten. All the visits to the cities of  the province are on one side, and the visit to these cities on  the other. The people of the province must allow us to praise  these two cities more, because Khorramshahr was the center of  the war action.    The trend of reconstruction, especially in Khorramshahr,  despite the fact that much work has been done, progresses slowly.    One of the reasons for the problems that Khorramshahr faces  is lack of wealthy immigrants to this city. The governor of  Khorramshahr told me: In this city, we have 10,000 people who  receive regular pay from the Emergency Committee. They do not  have the financial ability to complete the reconstruction of the  residential housing and commercial buildings. Unfortunately, the  immigrants who enjoy relative financial resources have not  entered the city yet. Of course, their coming may be due to lack  of treatment and health resources, water, sewage, recreational,  cultural, and other resources, which is true to some extent.    Haj Aqa Nateq-Nuri said: To eliminate the problem of water  and sewage of the cities of Khorramshahr and Abadan, 80 billion  tomans is needed, and if this problem is not eliminated, it will  be as if no reconstruction has taken place. In connection with  the recreational and cultural resources, it is necessary to say  that the speaker of the Majles inaugurated the construction of  the "Khorramshahr Martyrs" Athletic Complex with 1.2 billion  tomans in funds. Engineer Kamravi, deputy director of the  Reconstruction Crusade of the province, said: This athletic  center will be even larger than the large Azadi Stadium of  Tehran.    With the news that the speaker of the Majles announced on  behalf of the Cabinet, stating that the "government has  increased the reconstruction funds in the 1373 budget bill by 15  percent compared to last year," and also that the process of  reconstruction will continue to the end of the Second Five-Year  Plan, a wave of happiness overcame the people of Khorramshahr.    At 1900 on Thursday, 18/09/1372 [9 December 1993], in the  residence of the delegation, the news of the death of the  revered source of emulation, Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani,  overtook everyone with mourning, and no one felt like speaking.    In conclusion, it is necessary to express appreciation to  the  honorable speaker of the Majles, who was able to visit the  cities and centers without any rest on the five-day trip, from  0700 to 2030, to be with the people and officials. Also, during  this visit, with his behavior towards the reporters,  photographers, and cameramen, he showed that he especially  values journalism and journalists. Also, we thank his office,  the Security Affairs and News Affairs, who made their best  efforts, and it is hoped that this visit will bring prosperity  to the rich province of Khuzestan.</p>

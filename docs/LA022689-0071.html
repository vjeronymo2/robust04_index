			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WINTER WONDERLAND UNDER SIEGE;  </P> <P> MONARCH BUTTERFLY IN BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL  </P> <P> It could be a scene out of a fairy tale.  </P> <P> Nestled deep in the 10,000-foot-high mountains here, millions of monarch  butterflies drape the trees and carpet the forest floor.  </P> <P> Their fragile black-and-orange wings, recuperating after a six-week, 3,000-mile  trek from Canada and Northeast United States, are soothed by the morning light.  The sun slips behind a cloud -- and the butterflies flutter into flight,  creating the sound of a gently falling rain.  </P> <P> But the monarch's winter wonderland is under siege.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buzz of Chain Saw  </P> <P> Just a few hundred yards down the slope, the buzz of a chain saw cuts through  the crisp mountain air. Flat-bed trucks laden with pine logs rumble  continuously down the rugged roads. And near the sanctuary entrance, a mule  train guided by a band of illegal wood smugglers slips into the forest.  </P> <P> Widespread deforestation is the monarch's single biggest threat. Fueled by  poverty, overpopulation and reckless logging companies, it is already harming  the delicate ecological balance in the five small reserves here, the species'  only known winter habitat.  </P> <P> "If people continue cutting down trees at the same rate, the monarchs might  last only another 10 years here," said Jorge Martinez, a field biologist for  the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology. "The monarchs can't adjust  (to a changing environment) that quickly."  </P> <P> Scientists still puzzle over how the 120 million featherweight migrants know to  return thousands of miles to the same oyamel trees year after year --  especially since the butterflies here are five generations removed from those  that left last year.  </P> <P> But one thing is clear: The highland fir forests provide just the right mix of  heat and humidity to let the monarchs hibernate without freezing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protected by Canopy  </P> <P> Protected from extreme temperatures by the forest canopy, the inert insects  spend most of their time hanging from the trees in enormous clusters of up to  500,000 butterflies. During the warmest hours of the day, they float downhill  in search of water and floral nectar, with which they store up body fats for  the spring trip north.  </P> <P> But indiscriminate logging -- sometimes even clandestine cutting within the  preserve itself -- is making the habitat more vulnerable, according to several  scientists and zoologists studying the monarchs.  </P> <P> The gaps in forest cover, they say, expose the monarchs to slightly colder  nights and warmer days. And with fewer trees to retain the sporadic rainfall,  the damp forest is gradually becoming more arid.  </P> <P> "The water level in the streams has gone down considerably," said Maria Elena  Castro, director of the nonprofit Monarca Assn., which is devoted to protecting  the butterflies.  </P> <P> It is not just that pulp mills pay an average of $500 for a truckload of  precious pine logs, or about $150 per tree. It is not just that the forests  seem so plentiful that logging companies are reluctant to pay for proper  reforesting. But for thousands of peasants who live near the preserves,  including nearly 3,000 here in El Rosario, there is no other source of income  -- or fuel.  </P> <P> Their rocky, hillside plots do not yield enough corn and beans to feed their  own families. The local mining industry has laid off workers. And the big  commercial flower company in town has been on a rapid decline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alternative Offered  </P> <P> "It's obvious that there's a connection between poverty and deforestation,"  said Roberto Hernandez, who helps run the monarch preserves for SEDUE. "Our job  is not to restrict the people's only source of income but to offer some kind of  alternative."  </P> <P> For the peasants of El Rosario, that alternative has been tourism.  </P> <P> Twenty local residents work in the preserve as game wardens and guides.  Two-dozen food stalls are being constructed to accommodate hungry tourists. But  the main income comes from the proceeds of the park. Last year, when the number  of tourists doubled to 50,000, the community picked up $16,000.  </P> <P> "The people now don't see the butterflies as their enemy," said Jaime Montes de  Oca, subdirector of national parks for SEDUE, noting that 7,000 new seedlings  were planted in the preserve earlier this year. "They understand that  protecting the monarch's forest benefits them."  </P></p>

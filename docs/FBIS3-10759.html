			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani yesterday said the peace  accords are progressing normally -- in fact, some of them have  been stepped up -- and only the total deployment of the National  Civic Police (PNC), which is going along according to schedule,  will be left pending by the time he concludes his term.    The president announced the government is about to present a  plan to further expedite the land transfer program so it ends in  May, when the new agricultural cycle begins. Cristiani  explained the plan allows the possibility of issuing land  appropriation titles with a specific value for each beneficiary  -- whether he is a member of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front] or the Armed Forces -- and they can personally  expedite the negotiation with land owners who want to sell their  assets.    The document can expedite the negotiation with land owners  and the only remaining thing would be to sign a deed and grant  financial aid through the Land Bank. The goal is to define the  ownership of all the land, the president said. "Approximately  10,000 FMLN members have received these benefits and 10,000 are  still pending; while barely 2,000 Armed Forces members are still  pending," he said.    Regarding the compensation demands from demobilized Armed  Forces members, Cristiani said the government is complying with  the peace accords' stipulations, and the protests are the result  of a political movement.    The problem is that, in certain cases, persons show up and  demand compensation even though they are not registered to  obtain the benefits within a given period; and former fighters  are demanding their inclusion, and this is not foreseen in the  peace accords. "No country granted the necessary aid to pay the  compensation, which surpass the 200-million-colones mark, so the  funds come from the nation's general budget," he asserted.    Moreover, Defense Minister General Humberto Corado explained  the Armed Forces are not trying to influence the 20 March  electoral results; adding the corps' participation is  constitutional and its work will be to place 14 helicopters at  the disposal of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] for the  transfer of tally sheets from the most distant corners of the  country. "The TSE said the tally sheets' transfer will be  supervised by Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador], the  electoral boards, and the political parties," he emphasized.</p>

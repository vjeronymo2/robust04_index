			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Driving bargains along the road to privatisation: Russia starts to break up state-owned trucking monopoly by selling vehicles to a wary populace SIXTY battered trucks, parked around the Lenin statue in the Russian city of Nizhny-Novgorod, were sold off to the people at the weekend in a successful test run for the country's controversial privatisation vouchers. The theatrical flair of the bow-tied auctioneer in the city, Russia's third biggest and its unofficial laboratory for market reforms, made privatisatsia, usually a subject of fierce theoretical debates, an exciting reality for ordinary people. 'Here is Russia,' thundered Mr Sergei Maslov, pointing to the 500 participants, from struggling private farmers to smart new businessmen, as they raised their bidding cards at the start of Saturday's auction in a vast hall which once hosted provincial fairs in pre-revolutionary Russia. Flanked by two glamorous assistants in sequined dresses, Mr Maslov proceeded to sell the trucks with energetic swings of a large wooden gavel. The first Russian to spend a voucher was Mr Sergei Demyanov, a physicist turned businessman, who was so delighted that he said he did not care if his lorry failed to make it home. On the other hand, Yuri, a car plant worker who wanted a truck to carry produce to market from his small plot of land, left in despair saying the prices fetched were too high. Since the government began distributing vouchers to Russia's 165m citizens a month ago, they have been selling on the unofficial secondary market for well below their face value of Rbs10,000 amid criticism that the scheme is above the heads of ordinary Russians. Successful bidders however were able to obtain big discounts by obtaining Rbs10,000 worth of truck against vouchers they had bought from poorer citizens for Rbs2-3,000, or in some cases for just a bottle of vodka. 'It's a myth to say that the Russian people have no idea what to do with their vouchers,' Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the deputy prime minister, told a news conference after the auction. 'If somebody exchanges their voucher for a bottle of vodka, it's his problem, but he's no citizen.' The auction, at which half the price of a truck could be paid for with vouchers and the rest with cash, and which will be followed by more lorry sales, also marked the launch of a model plan to break up Russia's state-owned trucking monopoly. Ranging from a brand-new Kamaz lorry that fetched Rbs1m to the cheapest, oldest vehicle, which went for Rbs110,000, the trucks were described as excess capacity hived off from 42 local transport companies which are themselves due to be privatised. The new trucking companies, once locked into a single monopoly for the whole Nizhny-Novgorod region of 3.7m people, are to be allowed to set their own prices and compete with one another as part of efforts to improve the distribution of food and goods around bottle-necked Russia. The only snag with the use of the vouchers to buy trucks was that the government had initially planned to reserve them for the sale of shares in medium- and large-scale enterprises. That this is a more difficult undertaking was illustrated by the fact that the Nizhny-Novgorod authorities have yet to organise the sale of shares in the trucking enterprises which parted with the trucks. The obstacles facing any privatisation in Russia were underlined by the fact that Saturday's auction was only made possible thanks to tremendous lobbying by Mr Boris Nemtsov, the region's dynamic governor, and the organisational skills of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's investment arm, which has been piloting small-scale privatisation projects in selected spots around Russia.</p>

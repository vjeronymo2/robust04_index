			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (CNS) -- State Councillor and  Minister of National Defence, General Chi Haotian, speaking at a  meeting with a delegation of Thailand's Senate Military  Committee today, said that China was adopting a defensive policy  on national defence and would not seek hegemony when it gets  stronger. China, he said, hoped to develop its relations with  bordering countries.    The Chinese minister stressed that the Chinese army was  willing to promote its relations with its counterparts in  foreign countries. The so-called "threat" of China was totally  groundless.    General Chi spoke highly the friendly relations between the  two countries and their armies. [sentence as received]    The Thai guests told to General Chi that after watching a  military performance by the Chinese army, they were deeply  impressed by the Chinese army's fighting strength and spirit of  serving the people, adding that the might of China and the  Chinese army was an important factor for maintaining peace and  stability in the region.</p>

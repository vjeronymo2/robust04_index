			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: PAPA JOHN CREACH STILL KICKIN' AROUND  THE STYLES  </P> <P> Violinist Papa John Creach would like to record another album someday, but his  style seems too elusive for commercial tastemakers.  </P> <P> "They can categorize me, all right. They can say, 'He plays everything,' "  joked Creach, who opened three weeks at Elario's in La Jolla last night. "I  haven't recorded in a while, and I don't know which way to go. It's really a  confusing operation with me. I play sweet stuff, rock, blues and jazz. You  can't mix all that up together on a recording. It would be too confusing for a  commercial operation.  </P> <P> "I like all of it. It really keeps me kickin,' " said Creach, who turns 73 next  month.  </P> <P> Audiences don't have any trouble warming up to his wide-ranging sets. Although  he's best known to some for the soaring, electric sound he added to the  Jefferson Airplane in the early 1970s and the Airplane offshoot Hot Tuna,  Creach is a walking encyclopedia of jazz, rock and blues who first plugged in a  violin in 1943.  </P> <P> In recent years, he has slowed his touring pace, but still likes to work with  young musicians. He goes on the road regularly with such rock bands as the  Dinosaurs, visits Elario's annually and plays regularly in clubs not far from  his home near Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Over the years, Creach has arrived at the ideal formula for producing his  trademark warm, fat sound.  </P> <P> "I need a violin that cuts through the music. A soft tone is too mushy. I  usually use a Romanian fiddle made in the 1800s. Lots of guys take one song and  they wear out a bow. Doug Kershaw's a good example. But I don't press too hard  on the strings. That gives me a nice, big, fat, round tone."  </P> <P> When Creach taped one of KPBS-TV's (Channel 15) "Club Date" programs in San  Diego two years ago, he was backed by a trio of locals. For this visit, he  imported regular band mates Duane Smith on piano and Maurice Miller on drums  from Los Angeles, to be joined by San Diegan Bob Magnusson on bass.  </P> <P> Trombonists generally function as background players, but singer Aubrey Fay has  made the big brass a mainstay of his stage act. Fay, who plays the B Street  Cafe in downtown San Diego tonight through Saturday, first realized the horn's  potential when he heard one of the greats.  </P> <P> "I'm talking about my idol, J. J. Johnson. He redefined the instrument with  speed. Before him, Kid Ory was more of a slur-gliss player," Fay said,  referring to the slow, sliding style of playing that was popular during jazz's  early years. "When I was learning, all parts with sixteenth or eighth notes  were omitted for trombone. Then J. J. came along and changed all that with the  shotgun style of staccato, short notes."  </P> <P> Fay, both a singer and a horn player, grew up around music.  </P> <P> "Jazz took over for me at an early age. My dad used to play it a lot. The guy's  a nut over jazz -- not a musician, but a big fan. When I said I wanted to play  trombone, it didn't knock him out, but he was kind of excited. At 5 years old,  I knew who Basie, Ellington and Glen Miller were.  </P> <P> "There was a guy named Mr. Coady who ran Coady's School of Music on Broadway in  downtown San Diego. I was in parochial school, and they came to demonstrate the  instruments. I remember this guy, Bart Hazlett, had a Dixieland band, and he  came in and played 'Stars and Stripes Forever' with these great slides, and I  said, 'I gotta have that.' "  </P> <P> Fay continued with the trombone at St. Augustine High School, San Diego City  College and San Diego State University.  </P> <P> It was a fluke when he discovered his singing talent. As a young professional,  he was working with a band in San Diego clubs, and one night the male singer  didn't show up.  </P> <P> "Lou Rawls was real popular at the time, 'Your Good Thing Is About to Come to  an End.' I thought I could sing it. Well, I brought the house down, and that  was the beginning right there."  </P> <P> These days, the Aubrey Fay Band mixes diverse music, from bop to popular tunes.  </P> <P> "People will hear mainstream, be-bop stuff like 'Billy's Bounce,' I'll play  that on trombone, then I'll turn around and sing a blues like 'I'd Rather Drink  Muddy Water' or 'Every Day I Have the Blues.'  </P> <P> "The scat thing seems to be popular. I take 'On Broadway' or some other  contemporary tune and incorporate improvising. Or songs like 'Stormy' or 'Me  and Mrs. Jones.' I've got my own style, but it reminds people of Lou Rawls."  </P> <P> Beyond the club scene, Fay recently played on the sound track for a children's  TV pilot called "Down Munchkin Alley," taped in Fallbrook. He writes his own  music and hopes eventually to self-produce a CD of all-original tunes.  </P> <P> RIFFS: The San Diego Jazz Society appears to be the leading contender to run  the city of Carlsbad's summer series of nine outdoor Friday night jazz  concerts. The rival San Diego Jazz Festival was also invited to submit a bid,  but didn't. . . .  </P> <P> Fattburger plays the "Jazz Trax" concert at the Catamaran on Wednesday. . . .  </P> <P> Guitarist Peter Sprague and longtime musical associates Kevyn Lettau, John  Leftwich and brother Tripp Sprague will celebrate Earth Day with a concert from  7 to 9 p.m. Sunday at the library on San Diego State University's San Marcos  campus, 800 W. Vallecitos. . . .  </P> <P> Singer Cath Eckert, who has sung with Joe Pass, Don Menza and Freddie Hubbard,  appears this Friday at 8 p.m. at Words &amp; Music Bookstore in Hillcrest,  joined by Bob Morss on piano and Tom Azarello on bass. . . .  </P> <P> At 7:30 p.m. Monday, pianist Dave Mackay and flutist Lori Bell play a tribute  to Duke Ellington at the Chula Vista Public Library, 365 F St., in honor of  Ellington's April 29 birthday. . . .  </P> <P> This Saturday, the John Culbertson Winery in Temecula opens its spring jazz  series with a 4 to 6 p.m. show featuring the San Diego State University Jazz  Ensemble. . . .  </P> <P> Flutist Holly Hofmann and guitarist Mundell Lowe team up this Friday and  Saturday night at the Horton Grand Hotel downtown.  </P></p>

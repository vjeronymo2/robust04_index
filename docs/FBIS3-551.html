This brings to  four the number of soldiers killed in the ethnic conflict which  has been raging for the past six weeks in the Northern Region.  Lieutenant Colonel Richard Debrah, task force deputy commander  in charge of operations, said the military vehicle with seven  soldiers on board was returning to Tamale from Salaga with some  arms seized in the conflict when it was ambushed and fired on,  resulting in the death of the officer. When the soldiers  returned fire the attackers ran into the bush. Lt. Col. Debrah  said the attack on the vehicle was intended at getting the  military hardware it was carrying. [passage omitted]</p>

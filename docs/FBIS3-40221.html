Saishite [6357  0013 3676] Electronics Ltd. of Shenzhen has pioneered domestic  batch production of the cards, and authoritative sources say  that this demonstrates China is now in the world's front ranks  in the field of computer high-speed [100 Mbits/s] local area  networks, or LANs.    In the past, China has had to expend large amounts of  foreign  exchange for imports of fiber optic network cards. But in  September 1993, the Shenzhen firm put out its first card,  filling a domestic void. Now, the FDDI cards have been  authenticated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, and  have rapidly entered the domestic and foreign markets.</p>

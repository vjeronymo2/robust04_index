			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Management: Growing NHS casualty list An unwelcome aspect of the drive for greater efficiency in the NHS has been the tendency to imitate the private sector's more ruthless employers. The increase in job insecurity in the National Health Service can be gauged by the response to a helpline run by the Institute of Health Services Management. Calls from managers asking for legal advice on mainly employment issues have now risen to 50 a month. General managers with 20 or 30 years' experience are being 'written off', says Pam Charlwood, lHSM director, with no attempt at retraining or personal development and despite widespread shortages of managerial skills. She cites examples of managers leading their hospitals to self-governing trust status - in the teeth of fierce local opposition - only to be denied the post of chief executive without so much as an interview. 'I think we flatter ourselves and abuse private-sector management by assuming it does things more crudely than we do,' says Charlwood. 'Sometimes it is almost the reverse.' At the same time the fashion for merging health authorities means managers are effectively competing for their own jobs. The prospect of further mergers and another round of trusts means the casualties will continue to mount, she believes. Amid the battlefield, though, one region's approach is being heralded as a model of good practice. North West Thames regional health authority has reorganised into seven health commissions, causing 20 managers to compete for seven new posts. But the bloodshed has been minimised by a programme designed to balance the future of individuals against the needs of the organisation. Personnel manager Janet McKeown examined practice in both public and private sectors before opting to develop her own system. This gave existing general managers first call on the new posts. Only if a suitable candidate was not selected would outsiders be allowed to apply. Before competition began all were guaranteed every help in continuing their careers within the region or elsewhere in the NHS. Each underwent an independent assessment with a top company of occupational psychologists followed by career counselling. If the region could ultimately offer no job it guaranteed 'fair' severance terms. 'It has been enormously powerful in persuading managers that we would deal with them decently and with dignity,' McKeown says. Sound business reasons were one motive. 'We need to attract high-calibre managers in the future so it is important we have a good reputation as an employer.'</p>

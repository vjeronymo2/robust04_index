DPR&hyph;57 and NPF&hyph;5, issued to Georgia Power Company (GPC or the licensee), for operation of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Appling County, Georgia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of the Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendments will replace the existing Technical Specifications (TS) in their entirety with the Improved Technical Specifications (ITS). The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's amendment request dated February 25, 1994, and supplemented July 8, August 8 and August 31, September 23, October 19, and November 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been recognized that nuclear safety in all plants would benefit from improvement and standardization of TS. The ``NRC'' Interim Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors,'' (52 FR 3788 dated February 6, 1987) and later the Final Policy Statement, formalized this need. To facilitate the development of individual ITS, each reactor vendor owners group (OG) and the NRC staff developed standard technical specifications. For General Electric (GE) plants, the standard TS (STS) are found in NUREG&hyph;1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4,'' dated September 1992, which formed the basis of the Hatch ITS. The NRC Committee to Review Generic Requirements (CRGR) reviewed the STS, made not of its safety merits, and indicated its support of conversion by operating plants to the STS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Description of the Proposed Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed revision to the TS is based on NUREG&hyph;1433 and on guidance provided in the Policy Statement. Its objective is to completely rewrite, reformat, and streamline the existing TS. Emphasis is placed on human factors principles to improve clarity and understanding. The Bases section has been significantly expanded to clarify and better explain the purpose and foundation of each specification. In addition to NUREG&hyph;1433, portions of the existing TS were also used as the basis for the ITS. Plant-specific issues (unique design features, requirements, and operating practices) were discussed at length with the licensee, and generic matters were discussed with the licensee, GE, and other OGs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The proposed changes from the existing TS can be grouped into four general categories, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Non-Technical (administrative) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  changes were intended to make the ITS easier to use for plant operations personnel. They are purely editorial in nature or involve the movement or reformat of requirements without affecting technical content. Every section of the Hatch TS has undergone these types of changes. In order to ensure consistency, the NRC staff and GPC have used NUREG&hyph;1433 as guidance to reformat and make other administrative changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relocation of requirements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  includes items that were in the existing Hatch TS, but did not meet the criteria set forth in the Policy Statement for inclusion in TS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL KILLS PLAN TO BAN JUNK MAIL SENT BY CONGRESS  </P> <P> A House-Senate conference committee voted Monday to spend at least $83 million  on mail to constituents next year, even though both the House and Senate  favored cutting the perk and using the savings for pregnant women addicted to  crack cocaine.  </P> <P> The conference committee vote retaining mass mailings came just two hours after  the House voted 245 to 137 to instruct House negotiators to cut the  congressional perk. The House vote was non-binding.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the Senate voted 83 to 8 to stop the newsletters and spend  the savings on reducing the number of babies born addicted to crack. Proponents  on the House side said it was time for them to make a contribution to the fight  against narcotics by eliminating mass mailings of newsletters and town meeting  notices that traditionally have been sent to every postal patron in a  congressional district.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opponents' Argument  </P> <P> Opponents, mostly Democrats, argued that the Senate should not be allowed to  decide how the House allocates funds for postage or whether congressional  newsletters are essential to communicating with constituents.  </P> <P> Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), sponsor of the Senate provision that sailed  through, hailed the House action as a victory for his campaign against Capitol  Hill junk mail. But he correctly predicted it would not survive a conference  committee vote.  </P> <P> "Don't be surprised if the use of tax funds for these thinly veiled campaign  ads is too strong an addiction to overcome," he said.  </P> <P> Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), the chief House negotiator in the conference,  made plain his cool attitude toward the instructions approved by his  colleagues.  </P> <P> "It's pure demagoguery but it's great politics," Fazio told reporters. "Pete  Wilson's in his element."  </P></p>

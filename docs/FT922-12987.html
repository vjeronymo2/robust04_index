			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Goodyear expects record sales GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last of the big US tyre-makers, yesterday said it expected to post record first-quarter sales and put forward an accelerated timetable to reduce its debt. Wall Street responded enthusiastically to the news by marking Goodyear's shares Dollars 2 1/8 higher to a 52-week high of Dollars 70 3/4 . The stock has traded in a range of Dollars 21 to Dollars 69 1/4 in the past year. Mr Stanley Gault, who took the helm at Goodyear last year and is widely credited with masterminding the company's improvement, predicted first-quarter sales of about Dollars 2.7bn with net income reaching Dollars 60m to Dollars 65m. This compares with a net loss of Dollars 90.1m a year earlier on sales of Dollars 2.5bn. Mr Gault said Goodyear was aiming for a sustainable 10 per cent profit margin, although this was partly dependent on an improvement in the general economy. 'However, the priorities I have outlined for Goodyear are designed to improve the operating performance of the company by managing it to make money and without the benefit of strongly improving economic conditions,' Mr Gault said. Reducing Goodyear's debt, which the company took on in 1986 to thwart a takeover attempt by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, is one of Mr Gault's main concerns. At the end of 1991, Goodyear had reduced its debt by Dollars 1bn to Dollars 2.6bn. The company expects to have a debt-to-debt-plus-equity ratio of less than 40 per cent this year, falling below 35 per cent in 1993 and below 25 per cent by 1994. At the end of 1990, the ratio was more than 63 per cent, and stood at 49.2 per cent at the end of 1991. 'We expect to obtain in the neighbourhood of Dollars 400m to Dollars 450m from additional assets sales for further debt reduction,' said Mr Gault. In addition, he said marketing agreements had increased the number of locations selling Goodyear's tyres by 23 per cent in 1991. 'A significant part of this new business will be incremental unit growth,' he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Marketable Resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A contract among Reclamation, the Water Users, the Weber River Water Users Association, and PacifiCorp dated December 20, 1938 (1938 Contract), provides for diversion of water from the Weber River into the Provo River for storage in Deer Creek Reservoir and for use by the Water Users. Because PacifiCorp operated generating units on the Weber River below the point of diversion to the Provo River, PacifiCorp's ability to generate was reduced when water was diverted. The 1938 Contract provides that PacifiCorp is to receive all of the electrical generation of the PRP during the period of time that water is diverted. This means that for up to 6 months, from October 15 to April 15 of each year, there may be no marketable energy generated by the PRP. Historically however, marketable energy has averaged 23,000,000 kilowatthours (kWh), with 15,000,000 kWh generated during summer months, and the remaining 8,000,000 kWh from winter surplus energy. Typically, about 3,000,000 kWh are available in each of the 3 peak summer months of June, July, and August; approximately 1,000,000 kWh are available in April; 2,500,000 kWh in May; and another 2,500,000 kWh in September. ICPA and UMPA would receive all of the marketable energy generated by the PRP each year in return for paying all of the PRP powerplant expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> c. Marketing Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the size of the resource, Western proposes to limit the marketing of this resource to preference entities within the drainage area of the Provo River. All eligible utilities are members of ICPA and UMPA, and are located in Utah and Wasatch Counties. Members of ICPA are the cities of Heber City, Lehi, Payson, Springville, and the Strawberry Electric Service District (Strawberry). Affected members of UMPA are the cities of Provo, Salem, and Spanish Fork. It is anticipated that marketing of the PRP resource to these potential contractors would assure that each would receive a beneficial amount of power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> d. Class of Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PRP generation is dependent upon water releases that are dictated by minimum stream flow requirements and the Water Users' needs. No load following ability exists. Since April 1, 1994, the PRP has been included in Western's Upper Colorado Missouri Basin control area. With the PRP in Western's control area, Western is able to enhance the usability of the product and to allow it to be scheduled, even though it has no control over PRP generation. Western provides control area and regulating services for several other customers and has a developed methodology to share the expenses of operating a control area and providing for regulating capacity. Under the revised proposal, the PRP would be required to pay for its share of these services. These costs will be included in the PRS as an operating expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy will be scheduled to the potential contractors in megawatts in accordance with anticipated generation levels from the PRP. When variations occur, the hourly schedules will be adjusted to reflect actual operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western will maintain an energy deviation account between the PRP and the Integrated Projects. At the end of each year, an accounting of scheduled and generated energy will be made. Differences between the two projects will be made up by adding to or subtracting from the following year's schedules to the potential contractors. The potential contractors will be responsible for reserves in accordance with Inland Power Pool requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> e. Resource Allocation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western proposes to allocate PRP resources in proportion to the historical sales of each of the ICPA and UMPA members. UMPA members serve approximately 70 percent of the load in the marketing area, and the city of Provo is by far the largest member. ICPA members serve approximately 30 percent of the marketing area load. Proportional allocation of the PRP's average annual output of 23,000,000 kWh would mean UMPA members could expect an average of 16,100,000 kWh and 3,500 kilowatts (kW) of contingent capacity, and ICPA members could expect an average of 6,900,000 kWh and 1,500 kW of contingent capacity. Of ICPA members' 30 percent, Heber City would receive 6 percent, Lehi 2.7 percent, Springville 12.9 percent, Payson 4.8 percent, and Strawberry 3.6 percent. Of UMPA members' 70 percent, Provo would receive 60.9 percent, Salem 1.4 percent, and Spanish Fork 7.7 percent. Western would develop firm power sales contracts with ICPA and UMPA on behalf of their members which would specify the terms and conditions of receiving PRP power. The power sales contracts would be structured such that if a member withdraws from either ICPA or UMPA, it would be able to retain its entitlement of PRP power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

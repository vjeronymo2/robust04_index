			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 23 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese  trade official said here today that China will import 1,000  billion U.S. Dollars worth of goods in the next seven years.    The country's import value in 1993 amounted to 104 billion  U.S. dollars, said Zheng Silin, vice minister of foreign trade  and economic cooperation, at the '94 China Trade Investment  Conference which opened in Hong Kong today.    He admitted that China had a trade deficit of 12 billion  U.S.  dollars last year, noting this was led by a big growth of import  as a result of rapid economic development in China.    China's basic policy for foreign trade is to strike a  balance  between import and export provided it has necessary foreign  reserve, the vice minister said.    So far, China ranks in the world as the 11th largest trader  with a total import and export value of 195.8 billion U.S.  dollars last year.    The country has approved 170,000 enterprises built in the  forms of joint venture, cooperation or exclusive overseas  investment. The actual foreign investment used in China  surpassed 60 billion U.S. dollars.    Starting from this year, Zheng said, China began to carry  out  a series of reforms in the fields of taxation, monetary, foreign  exchange management and foreign trade. This demonstrates a  breakthrough in the reform of China's economic mechanism and  will be of a far-reaching significance in setting up a socialist  market economy, Zheng said.    He reiterated that China will take foreign investors into  full consideration in its economic reform and strike to create  an investment climate wherein enterprises operate in  international norms.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Dollar firmer after surprise US inflation figures The dollar made further gains yesterday as good inflation figures helped the currency build on improved sentiment, following Republican gains in mid-term congressional elections, writes Philip Gawith. The October producer price index fell by 0.5 per cent, against a market expectation of a 0.1 per cent increase. It was the first time in more than three years that producer inflation had fallen for two consecutive months. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5348, a gain of a pfennig from before the PPI figures, and at Y98.04 from Y97.79 at Wednesday's close. The firmer tone in the US currency came as an increasing number of analysts suggested that the US currency may have turned, after a nine month fall. Two dollar bloc currencies that profited from the firmer dollar, and favourable market perceptions of domestic monetary policy, were the Australian and New Zealand dollars. Elsewhere, the Bundesbank council left official interest rates, and the repo rate, unchanged. Sterling continued to weaken against the firmer dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5968 from Dollars 1.6036. Against the D-Mark, it finished at DM2.4506 from DM2.4534. With US markets closed today, traders are not expecting any sharp moves in the dollar ahead of the important Federal Open Markets Committee meeting on Tuesday. There is increasing optimism, however, that a decisive increase in interest rates at the meeting could confirm an upward trend for the dollar. Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, commented: 'Sentiment has definitely turned over the past week. The Fed has an opportunity to put one more piece of the puzzle in place.' 'I don't think positions have yet changed to match the change in sentiment, but the dollar is certainly vulnerable to good news,' said Mr Stewart. He said he would be much more confident if he believed the Fed would lift interest rates by more than 50 basis points. 'If it raises by only 50 basis points, the dollar will still be vulnerable to strong data.' Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank in London, said: 'The election result impacted on a market that had already gone too far. We think the dollar has bottomed. It will take something fundamental for this market to reverse its direction and go to the downside again.' He said the dollar should reach DM1.57-1.60 on a three month view. Chemical Bank is expecting the Fed to raise interest rates by 150 basis points by the end of the first quarter of 1995. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, also said the first signs of a change in the dollar's trend had emerged. 'The whole sentiment seems to have changed from selling on rallies to buying on dips.' Mr Parsons said a graph showing the difference between the Dollars /D-Mark rate, and Dollars /Pounds (cable), was a good proxy for dollar sentiment. From a high of nearly thirty units, in late January, this gap had shrunk to minus fourteen units on October 25. Since then the trend has reversed, breaking through the trend line. He ventured that if the Fed were to intervene again now, supporting rather than opposing the market, 'it could firmly and conclusively establish that the dollar has turned.' UK cash interest rates softened markedly following the large net injection of funds into the money market at the two-weekly gilt repo on Wednesday. One week money was offered at 5 1/8 per cent, from just under 5 3/4 per cent before the repo. One month money was offered at 5 per cent, also down from 5 3/4 per cent before the repo. Overnight money was also easy, as the Bank of England cleared a small Pounds 250m shortage at established rates. It traded between 4 and 5 1/4 per cent. In recent weeks, daily shortages have often been above Pounds 1bn, with a high portion of liquidity provided in the form of late assistance. Mr Parsons said that up to one month out, lending rates were below the current base rate of 5 3/4 per cent. In Europe, the Swedish krona appreciated to SKr4.769 against the D-Mark, from SKr4.81, buoyed by optimism about a yes vote in Sunday's referendum on joining the EU. The Italian lira was also firmer, at L1,024 against the D-Mark, from L1,027.</p>

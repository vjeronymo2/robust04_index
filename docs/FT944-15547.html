			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Technology: On time and to order / A look at Compaq's upgrade of its Scottish computer plant Compaq Computer's plant at Erskine in Scotland is just a few miles from the village of Houston, a coincidence that symbolises its connection with the company's headquarters in Houston, Texas. Until recently Compaq's Scottish manufacturing operations have largely focused on assembling technology developed in the US. However, Erskine's role is being upgraded as part of the company's worldwide review of manufacturing efficiency, started four months ago in a bid to become the personal computer world market leader by 1996. Already, Compaq is well on the way to achieving its goal. The company doubled its profits in the first half of this year. It has also continued to cut the prices of its PCs, which have stolen a lead from IBM and Apple Computer in terms of unit sales in the US and Europe for the first half of this year. Third-quarter results are due tomorrow. George Devlin, managing director at Erskine, has led the project team examining the company's manufacturing and delivery operation, nicknamed 'make and move'. However, he acknowledges that shortcomings have recently emerged across the company's plants in producing its Elite line of notebook computers. 'We couldn't get some new products to our customers in the quantities they wanted, at the time they wanted them,' he says. This, he observes, was due to 'design issues' and 'supply issues'. The rethinking of the company's processes from manufacturing to delivery has now gone through what Devlin calls its diagnosis phase, ending last week with a presentation in Houston to Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president and chief executive. Compaq plants are now implementing the conclusions of the review. Compaq has been transformed since Pfeiffer was appointed in late 1991. Between November 1991 and November 1993 Compaq quadrupled its global output volume, producing cheaper PCs, without increasing the manufacturing space of its core factories at Houston, Singapore and Erskine. This year it has opened plants in Brazil and China. The 540,000 sq ft Erskine plant outside Glasgow, which supplies 80 per cent of Compaq's European, Middle East and Africa market, had to make changes in manufacturing systems, some of which are now being adopted across the company. 'We used to think of ourselves as a high volume manufacturer,' says Devlin. 'In reality we've become one only recently.' Erskine's output increased two and half times between 1991 and 1993, while unit production costs fell by 76 per cent. There has been a further 60 per cent rise in output volume over the past 12 months. Greg Petsch, senior vice-president in Houston for corporate operations, set the Erskine plant the target of cutting costs to the level of the Singapore plant, which has the advantages of more component suppliers located nearby and lower labour costs. If it succeeded it would earn the right, enjoyed by Singapore, to manufacture its own mother boards - a printed circuit board which includes the microprocessor and other tiny components, and are at the value added end of making PCs - and to produce notebook computers. First, Erskine's PC assembly area abandoned progressive production lines and moved to a station build system - instead of a moving production line, one person assembles most of the central processing unit at one station. Ken McQuade, manufacturing manager, says this gives workers more satisfaction because they partially finish a product. Erskine then introduced a cell build system alongside station build and now uses it for 40 per cent of its output. Workers in cells of five operate as a team, carrying out all the jobs of PC assembly to boxed product ready for the customer. This enables PC testing and software installation to be carried out in one place, cuts out travel round the plant and releases valuable space. There are manpower savings as all members of the cell can be continuously occupied. Partly because of successful cost-reductions at Erskine, Compaq has installed five new production lines using surface mount technology (SMT) to produce the PC's mother board. The first line began operating in July. A month earlier Erskine began production of its notebook products. By the end of the year Erskine will have invested Pounds 17m in SMT lines, producing 40 per cent of its boards in-house. It has taken on 250 extra staff, taking total numbers to around 1,100, in addition to which there are up to 500 temporary staff. To justify the capital cost of the new lines the Erskine plant has begun working 24 hours a day seven days a week. Devlin says the new production processes at the plant 'collapse part of the supply chain'. The remaining boards will continue to be imported from Compaq in Singapore with some supplied by PCB assemblers nearby in Scotland. By 1997 Erskine hopes to make all its mother boards in-house. Devlin admits that the Scottish plant has less control over its supply chain than Houston or Singapore, but says 50-60 per cent of its components are delivered on a daily, just-in-time basis. Most sheet metal products come from Fullarton at Irvine, Ayrshire, and disc drives from Quantum in Ireland as well as Conner at Irvine. But the flat-panel displays for the company's notebook still have to be imported by sea from Japan, requiring a 24-week ordering lead time. 'Scotland should get someone to invest in a Dollars 1bn plant making displays and monitors,' he says. As the plant moves towards PC production to order, a short supply chain is essential and would complement its improved manufacturing efficiency. 'We want to move the company from being a 'push' organisation in which we determine what we build and you the customer use it, to becoming a 'pull' organisation in which we build what the customers tell us they want,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: A MYSTERIOUS MOTHER WHO FORGOT TO LOVE: ERMA BOMBECK IS ON  VACATION. SHE LEFT A FEW OF HER FAVORITE COLUMNS BEHIND.  </P> <P> All my life I've heard about "Everyone Else's mother."  </P> <P> Every time I told my kids they had to have the car home by 11, I was informed,  "Everyone Else's mother said they could stay out until 2."  </P> <P> When I stood firm that they could not have a phone of their own or a separate  listing, they grumbled, "Everyone Else's mother lets them have their own  phone."  </P> <P> No bathing suit was too revealing for Everyone Else's mother to put her stamp  of approval on. No allowance was too generous for her to shell out. She was the  Good Fairy of children everywhere.  </P> <P> My friends and I used to talk about this mother a lot. Was she a myth created  in the minds of children who wanted to be free from parental decrees, or did  she really exist? All I really knew was that she was always with us, following  us around from city to city, school to school, year in and year out.  </P> <P> You cannot imagine my surprise recently when I met Everyone Else face to face.  She called herself Jan, but I knew from the moment she opened her mouth she was  Everyone Else with the famous mother. She told me her story.  </P> <P> From the moment she was born, she got to do whatever she wanted to do. She went  to bed and got up when she felt like it. If she craved jelly beans and coffee  for breakfast, she got it.  </P> <P> No one nagged her to shut the door, sit up straight, clear the table or make  her own bed. She could drink out of everyone's glass at parties if she wanted  to.  </P> <P> She drank milk out of the carton, and no one yelled at her. She was rude to  people and never had to apologize. She made mistakes and never had to be  accountable for them.  </P> <P> She picked her own clothes, her own schools, her own friends. She was the envy  of all her contemporaries.  </P> <P> Finally, I could stand it no longer.  </P> <P> "Jan, for years I've heard about your mother. Somehow, she's the perfection  that none of us has been able to touch. I would love to meet her."  </P> <P> Everyone Else just looked at me and slowly repeated the word love. You'd have  thought it was the first time she had ever heard it.  </P></p>

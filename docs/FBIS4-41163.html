			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Igor Borisenko and Vitaliy </F> Chukseyev]    [Text] Washington, 23 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Federation  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice President  Albert Gore -- cochairmen of the Russian-American commission for  economic and technological cooperation -- marked the signing of  the project to develop deposits on the Sakhalin shelf with a  toast to its success. The document, known as Sakhalin-2, was  signed by Yuriy Shafrannik, the Russian minister of fuel and  power engineering, (D. Daffind), president of the Sakhalin  Energy Investment Company, and representatives of the American  and Japanese firms which formed a consortium to implement this  major project which promises significant economic benefit to the  Russian Far East.    "The Sakhalin-2 project can truly be called crucial if one  assesses it from the point of view of its underlying  principles," Yu. Shafrannik said in a conversation with an  ITAR-TASS correspondent. "For the first time, work on a Russian  shelf will be carried out by a consortium of Western firms. The  project is very advantageous for Russia. Almost 70 percent of  subcontracting work will go to Russian firms and also 25 percent  of profits. This is a very serious project. If, after such a  first step we are able to take another -- and of this I am  certain -- then there will be capital investment in this region  in the course of the next year and one can expect serious  changes in the region of the Far East within the next few  years." In particular, the minister said, some of the gas  extracted on the Sakhalin shelf could be sent to the mainland.    "This project is really crucial," Ronald Brown, U.S.  Secretary of State for Trade, said in a conversation with an  ITAR-TASS correspondent. "I hope that its implementation will  stimulate development of trade between our countries and open up  opportunities for capital investment. This project is indeed  important and, what is most important, it has gotten off to a  good start."</p>

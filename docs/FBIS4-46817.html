			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Feliksas Telksnys: "The Ministry of the Interior </F> Has Not Yet Promised a Peaceful Sleep"]    [Text] A session of the Seimas tonight will deal with the  maintenance of law and order in Lithuania. Yesterday the members  of the Seimas received materials prepared by the Ministry of the  Interior, surveying the present state of criminality in  Lithuania and attempting to predict the future. One member of  the Seimas jested sadly that after these facts and forecasts,  the average inhabitant of Lithuania might as well shoot himself,  because otherwise he will be shot dead anyway.    Several numbers and facts. Seventeen thousand two hundred  fifty-seven crimes were registered during the four months of  this year. This is 20 percent less than during the same period  in 1993. One hundred forty-four crimes are registered daily on  the average, or 36 crimes less than last year.    The largest number of crimes for 10 thousand inhabitants has  been registered in the cities of Neringa (74.1), Klaipeda  (73.8), and Vilnius (60.3), and in the districts of Lazdijal  (65.7), Kedainial (63) and Panevezys (62.3).    This year, every sixth registered crime was of a serious  nature, last year it was every tenth one. The increase in  serious crimes this year is linked with the increase of crimes  of violence per person, in particular of intentional murders,  robberies, public thefts. One hundred fifty-eight intentional  murders were committed, there were 20 attempts at murder. This  is, respectively, 61 intentional murders (62.9 percent) and 5  attempts (33.3 percent) more than last year. Deliberate  relatively grave bodily injuries have increased more than two  times (from 97 to 207).    Every seventh stealing of citizens private property was  accomplished by open theft or robbery (last year -- every ninth  one). The number of robberies of private property has increased  from 136 to 239, or by 75 percent, this year, as compared with  1993. Twenty-four such crimes were registered during the four  months of this year, while there were only 4 of them during the  same period last year.    Firearms are being used more frequently in committing  crimes.  One hundred seven such crimes, or 11 cases more than last year,  were registered during the four months of this year. Five cases  of destruction of property or injury due to the use of explosive  devices were registered each month, on the average. There was a  total of 77 cases of deliberate destruction of property by way  of arson. This is 36 cases, or 87 percent, more than last year.    Cases of violence against the citizens private property have  increased almost three times this year: from 43 to 127. Ten  cases of violence against state or public property were  registered. No such cases were registered last year.    Cases of fraud have become more numerous. Two hundred  seventy-five such cases of larceny involving citizens' private  property, or 45.5 percent more than last year, have been  registered. Fraud in the area of economy has become more  frequent. Twenty-four cases of larceny by way of fraud involving  state or public property were registered. This is six times more  than in 1993.    This year, every sixth crime has been committed in public  space (only every ninth one last year). Street crimes have  increased in particular -- 36 percent more of them have been  committed than in 1993.    The Ministry of the Interior forecasts that in view of the  large quantities of illegal firearms and the relatively easy  acquisition of explosives, the ratio of dangerous crimes per  person shall increase as the consumption of alcohol and  narcotics increases.    Considering the minimal level of wages paid to the employees  of state institutions, a conclusion is made that corruption and  abuse of the official positions will not decrease.    It is believed that because the frontiers are poorly  controlled, the smuggling of narcotics and weapons should  increase.    Thefts of automobiles are not likely to diminish, since this  is a very profitable variety of criminal enterprise.    The Ministry of the Interior considers as its most important  task the struggle against organized crime, the creation of a  system for the prevention of crime and the violations of law, as  well as the strengthening of the material base and the prestige  of the police.</p>

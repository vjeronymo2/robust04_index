			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNGARY TEARS DOWN SECTION OF 'IRON CURTAIN'  </P> <P> Frontier guards on Tuesday began dismantling part of Hungary's portion of the  symbolic "Iron Curtain" that has divided Europe for four decades as they  started to remove the electrified barbed wire fence along the border with  Austria.  </P> <P> The removal began outside the border village of Hegyeshalom, 85 miles northwest  of Budapest, and at Sopron and Szombathely farther south, the three busiest  crossing points into Austria.  </P> <P> "The political conditions are ripe," Col. Balazs Novaki, deputy chief of staff  of the National Command of frontier guards, told a news conference.  "Restructuring in Hungary and the process of democratization does not make it  necessary to maintain it."  </P> <P> Novaki said that Hungary, once a partner in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, has  "traditionally good relations with Austria," and the presence of the menacing  watch towers and barbed wire fences has disturbed local inhabitants since they  were erected in 1949.  </P> <P> The move is also likely to improve Hungary's image.  </P> <P> About 160 miles of the eight-foot-high fence along Hungary's western border  with Austria will be removed by Dec. 31, 1990. The border is actually 225 miles  long, but roads, rivers and rail tracks take up about 75 miles where no fence  has been raised.  </P> <P> Watchtowers and other control facilities will also be removed in the project  estimated to cost $700,000 to $800,000. But periodic border patrols will  continue.  </P> <P> The mayor of Hegyeshalom, Zoltan Vincze, said residents are "pleased to see the  fence going because its removal restores the unity of the landscape."  </P> <P> The barbed-wire fence runs between one and 1 1/2 miles east of the geographical  border along the Danube plain. It was built in 1949 after the Communist  takeover.  </P> <P> Significantly, Hungary consulted neither Austria nor its Warsaw Pact allies  about its decision.  </P> <P> "Nor did we consult our Western neighbor when we decided to erect the fence,"  Novaki noted.  </P> <P> In Vienna, Foreign Ministry spokesman Walter Greinert said Austria regarded the  dismantling of the fence a "very positive sign."  </P> <P> But Austrian government sources fear that other East Europeans, especially  Romanians now flooding into Hungary because of ethnic strife, could use Hungary  as an easy transit route to the West by simply walking into Austria.  </P> <P> Hard-line Czechoslovakia and East Germany, both heavily resisting Soviet-style  reforms, are likely to resent the removal of the physical barriers along  Hungary's western border for fear it will attract their citizens who might  escape while on vacation in Hungary.  </P></p>

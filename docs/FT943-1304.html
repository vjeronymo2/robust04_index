			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Survey of Residential Property (9): A tour of the towers - Heritage Which came first, the tower or the church? This is a conundrum that has taken Bill Goode up many a church tower. Goode, an 81-year-old retired pork butcher, has ascended and measured all but a handful of Britain's round church towers and can usually tell whether a particular tower is Saxon, Norman, or a later rebuild. He is also the founder of that splendid example of the British love of obscure but worthy causes, the Round Tower Churches Society, which comes of age this month. To celebrate the event, the society has published a new edition of Goode's guide to all the round-tower churches in the country. Goode became interested in churches at the age of 52. He was looking for something to photograph with his new camera and when he chose the round-towered churches of the Waveney valley, inland from his native Lowestoft, Suffolk, he realised what a poor condition many of them were in. Eight years later he turned his enthusiasm into a national society, with a membership that has just topped 400. In the intervening years it has raised several thousand pounds which has been dispensed as grants to help restore the round-tower churches that give their name to the society. There are 175 complete round-towered churches in England, and a handful of others in a ruinous state. Goode and his fellow enthusiasts aim to make sure no more are allowed to deteriorate, by raising funds and creating interest in these remarkable buildings. Preventing others falling into ruin is an uphill task. Of the 162 round-towered churches in Norfolk and Suffolk, most are in isolated hamlets, or even sitting alone in fields at the site of a former settlement. Of the remaining 13 round-towered churches, six are in Essex, two in Cambridgeshire, three in Sussex and two in Berkshire. These church towers are round, and are found in only these six counties, because they are areas in which the stone was not good enough to build corners. The faithful had to gather flints and puddingstone, a dark iron conglomerate from the surface of the fields, to build their churches. Some are very low (the average height is 35-40ft), others a little higher and built in clearly-visible 10ft 'bands', which are the result of the short building season between Easter and Michaelmas in which mortar was able to set in frost-free conditions. By examining the tower in detail - and Goode has ascended and measured all but a handful of the round towers - he can usually tell its age and origin. His conclusion is that 90 per cent of the East Anglian round-towered churches were built before 1066, with some of the churches dating back to 800. The towers themselves tend to be a little later, he says, because in most cases they were added to the churches. 'People often think the tower came first because it often looks older than the adjoining church. But what I believe is that the Saxons built a church of flints and rubblestone - in many cases to replace an earlier wooden church - and then added a round tower,' says Goode. 'In later centuries the faithful would reface the church with superior knapped flints and update the earlier buildings using superior dressed stone. But if the tower was sound they would leave it.' Round Tower Churches of South-East England by W E Goode is available from C P Marchant, 4 Finchley Court, West End Street, Norwich NR2 4ET. Price to non-members is Pounds 24 hardback (plus Pounds 2 post and packing), or Pounds 15 paperback (plus Pounds 1.50 p+p).

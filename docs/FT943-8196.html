			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf Foods expects to show modest expansion The lingering effects of the recession are still holding back Maple Leaf Foods, but Canada's biggest food processor expects to report modest profits growth for the full year, said Mr Brent Ballantyne, president. Maple Leaf, 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings of the UK, reported second quarter net profit up from CDollars 16.9m to CDollars 17.9m (Pounds 8.3m) or 22 cents (20 cents) per share. Sales rose to CDollars 798m (CDollars 742m). First half profit declined from CDollars 27m to CDollars 25.9m - 32 cents (33 cents) per share - on sales of CDollars 1.46bn (CDollars 1.37bn). Mr Ballantyne said he expected difficult trading conditions to continue for the rest of the year. However, he anticipated that the company would show modest growth for the year. Maple Leaf is concentrating on new products and marketing improvements, besides further cost reductions and heavy capital spending in its main businesses. Agribusiness and bakery operations were strong in the first and second quarter, said Mr Ballantyne, but the consumer foods business contributed less, reflecting strong price pressures and tight consumer budgets. The cost reduction programme includes moving a high-cost Toronto meat processing plant to new facilities in smaller centres. Interest income for the second quarter was lower than last year as a result of lower cash balances - down from CDollars 215.4m to CDollars 128.9m - but analysts expect Maple Leaf to use its remaining substantial cash resources to make acquisitions.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Northrop to shed 3,000 jobs Northrop, the US defence company which is engaged in a Dollars 2bn battle for control of Grumman, plans to cut 3,000 jobs this year, or 10 per cent of the total. The cuts mark the latest in a series of steps to shrink the company to cope with falling US defence spending. Its workforce has fallen to 30,000 from more than 48,000 in early 1988. Northrop's cost-cutting has been driven by declining sales. It expects total sales this year of Dollars 4.4bn, compared with Dollars 5.1bn in 1993 and Dollars 5.6bn in 1992. The company's main product is the B-2 bomber, which employs 11,400 staff. Around 1,300 people will go from this division, with roughly the same amount from the separate aviation division, which employs 9,300. The remaining losses will be in electronics. Northrop is itself widely seen as a potential takeover target, following its emergence as a bidder for Grumman in competition with Martin Marietta. Grumman, which agreed earlier this month to a Dollars 55-a-share merger with Martin Marietta, said yesterday that its board had decided to start talks with Northrop, which has launched a rival bid for Grumman worth Dollars 60 a share.</p>

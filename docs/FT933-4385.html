			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Rivers authority hit by falling grants THE National Rivers Authority, the pollution watchdog, is to peg its spending for the next three years. Presenting the watchdog's annual accounts, Lord Crickhowell, chairman, said the squeeze would not affect its efforts. The watchdog said 'savings need to be made' and that staff numbers need to be cut by 300. In the year to March 1993 it spent Pounds 437.4m, nearly Pounds 8m less than the previous year. Half of the spending was on flood defence, and more than a third on improving water quality. A quarter of the watchdog's income - Pounds 462m last year - comes from government grants. Mr Edward Gallagher, chief executive, said that the government had made it clear that grants would steadily fall. The watchdog has also decided to rein back charges to local authorities and companies. The charges, some of which rose by 20 per cent last year, will rise at the rate of inflation or below it. But new legislation would be needed in order for the authority to charge polluters in line with the amount they pollute, Mr Gallagher said. Last year saw fines totalling just over Pounds 1m, the same as the previous year. However the number of successful prosecutions of the most serious category on incident fell from 115 to 99. Coal mines are threatening to contaminate water supplies, the NRA warned yesterday. Potential 'hotspots' are the Easington and Vane Tempest pits in the Durham coalfield, and the Parkside colliery at Warrington, Cheshire, said Lord Crickhowell. Consultants are now investigating how to protect water supplies from the mines.</p>

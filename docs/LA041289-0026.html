			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Singer-actress Grace Jones was freed from jail Tuesday in Kingston, Jamaica,  after a court granted her $2,700 bail on a charge of possessing cocaine. Jones  had been held in a police station cell since Saturday, when police say they  found 0.006 ounces of cocaine wrapped in two $2 Jamaican bills in her purse.  The singer was not asked to enter a plea. If convicted, she probably will be  fined rather than jailed because of the small quantity of the narcotic  involved, court observers said. Her lawyer told the court the entertainer is  not a drug user, and is involved in the campaign against drug abuse. ALEENE  MacMINN  </P></p>

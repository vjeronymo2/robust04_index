			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Threat to strikers The Jamaican government has threatened to send the army into the island's central bank, which has been closed by striking clerical workers since last week, writes Canute James in Kingston. Mr Hugh Small, finance minister, told parliament the strike was disrupting the financial services sector and was threatening to cripple the economy. The bank workers are protesting at what they say is a delay in concluding wage contract negotiations with the government.</p>

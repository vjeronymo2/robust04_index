			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL CZAR GIAMATTI DIES OF HEART ATTACK  </P> <P> A. Bartlett Giamatti, the seventh commissioner of professional baseball and a  former president of Yale University, died of an apparent heart attack Friday.  He was 51.  </P> <P> Giamatti was stricken in mid-afternoon at his vacation home in Edgartown,  Mass., on Martha's Vineyard.  </P> <P> State police responded to a call from a family member and found Giamatti  unconscious and in full cardiac arrest, officer Byron Rizos said.  </P> <P> "CPR was initiated but there was no response," Rizos said.  </P> <P> Giamatti was taken by ambulance to Martha's Vineyard Hospital where he was  pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m., "after all-out efforts to resuscitate him  failed," Matthew Stackpole, the hospital's director of development, said.  </P> <P> Giamatti, a chain smoker who once said that cigarettes were his primary vice  and who resisted the efforts of a number of baseball owners who tried to get  him to quit smoking, had left New York Friday morning to spend the Labor Day  weekend on the popular vacation island.  </P> <P> "I dropped him off at noon on Martha's Vineyard and he seemed fine," deputy  commissioner Francis T. Vincent Jr., who traveled to New England with Giamatti,  said. "This is a tremendous shock. He was a uniquely talented man who had great  friends and admirers. It's a serious loss for the country, the sport and his  family." Giamatti was an authority on Renaissance literature and a man who  could discuss Dante and the infield fly rule with equal ease. He spent two  years as National League president before being elected to a five-year term as  commissioner in a unanimous vote of the 26 owners Sept. 8, 1988.  </P> <P> He succeeded Peter V. Ueberroth on April 1 of this year. He is the first  commissioner to die in office since Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who died  Nov. 25, 1944.  </P> <P> Like Giamatti, Landis made his mark with a lifetime ban, against Shoeless Joe  Jackson and seven other members of the infamous Chicago Black Sox who were  accused of taking money from a gambler to throw the 1919 World Series.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ueberroth Comments  </P> <P> "Baseball has been deprived today of the services of its finest commissioner in  history," Ueberroth, vacationing in Paris, said in a statement released through  his Newport, Calif., office. "Bart Giamatti encompassed everything that is good  and enduring about America's favorite pastime. For this man of words, courage  and deeds . . . no words can express the loss."  </P> <P> Giamatti's five-month tenure was three years shorter than any of his six  predecessors and was dominated by the investigation into the alleged gambling  activities of Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose, who received a lifetime  suspension from Giamatti nine days ago.  </P> <P> Atty. Robert A. Pitcairn Jr., in a statement issued Friday on Rose's behalf,  said Rose was "deeply saddened" by the news of Giamatti's death.  </P> <P> "In spite of their dispute, Pete had great personal respect for the  commissioner. He extends his deepest sympathy to Commissioner Giamatti's  family."  </P> <P> Rose, before agreeing to the terms of his suspension, contended that Giamatti  had pre-judged his case and sought an injunction that would have prevented  Giamatti from ruling on it. The long dispute was believed to have created  stress for Giamatti, but he denied that in a recent interview.  </P> <P> "While it's a serious matter, it doesn't take up that much of my time," he  said. "Most of my time, 80 to 90% of it, is spent on other things. The way it's  been played (by the media) would make you think that I've been sitting here all  day worrying about it, but that hasn't been the case for months."  </P> <P> President Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Me., said Giamatti "in a short  time made a real contribution to the game, standing for the highest possible  ethical standards."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spoke With Giamatti  </P> <P> Bush said he had talked with the commissioner, a fellow Yale alumnus, "at great  length" about the Rose case and just missed a call from him at Kennebunkport a  few days ago.  </P> <P> Giamatti was trying to contact the President, Bush said, because "I told him  I'd like to, just as a baseball fan, know the aftermath, know exactly how this  matter had been resolved. But all through that I was thinking of the difficulty  that he had in setting these standards that high and staying with it."  </P> <P> Baseball's rules provide for the Executive Council, comprised of the two league  presidents and eight club owners, to carry out the commissioner's duties until  a successor is chosen. An owners' meeting, previously scheduled for Milwaukee  Sept. 13-14, will now focus on that objective, a spokesman for the  commissioner's office said.  </P> <P> Among those likely to receive consideration, baseball sources said, are  American League president Bobby Brown, National League president Bill White,  Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, New York Mets president Frank Cashen and  deputy commissioner Vincent.  </P> <P> Vincent's position was created in a reorganization of the commissioner's office  by Giamatti. He becomes interim commissioner until a successor is named.  </P> <P> Vincent, a longtime friend of Giamatti's, is an attorney who formerly was  chairman and chief executive officer of Columbia Pictures Industries Inc., as  well as senior vice president of the Coca-Cola Company and president and chief  executive officer of Coca-Cola's entertainment business section. He served as a  liaison to Giamatti on the Rose case and heads the commissioner's corporate,  licensing and broadcasting divisions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strong Ties to Boston  </P> <P> Angelo Bartlett Giamatti was born in Boston on April 4, 1938. His father,  Valentine, was a literature professor at Mt. Holyoke College and an avid Red  Sox fan, Giamatti recalled in an interview.  </P> <P> "I was probably 7 or 8 years old when my father and uncle took me to my first  baseball game," he said. "I'd been listening on the radio often enough, but  going to Fenway Park, I just was astonished at the whole thing."  </P> <P> The memory and the loyalty stayed with him. He often wore a Red Sox cap and  carried a transistor to listen to the team's games while serving as Yale  president. He grew up with the romantic's view that baseball is best played on  grass in the afternoon, but he lacked the talent to play it himself and  gravitated to literature like his father.  </P> <P> He received a bachelor of arts degree in English from Yale in 1960 and a Ph.D.  in comparative literature in 1964. He taught Italian and comparative literature  at Princeton before returning to Yale in 1966. He became a full professor there  at 33 and director of the Division of Humanities at 37.  </P> <P> He was elected president of the university in 1978 -- the youngest in two  centuries -- and served for nine years, providing Yale with its first balanced  budget in a decade and ultimately healing the wounds of his hardline stance in  the face of a 1984 strike by clerical and technical workers.  </P> <P> "He gave of himself magnificently as a teacher, scholar and leader," Benno C.  Schmidt Jr., Giamatti's successor at Yale, said Friday. "This university will  be a better place because of his service. He will never be forgotten here."  </P> <P> He wrote a number of books, essays and articles on Renaissance literature, but  he also wrote about baseball, which attracted the attention of the game's  owners and executives. He became the 12th president of the National League on  Dec. 11, 1986, and said:  </P> <P> "Dante would have been delighted."  </P> <P> He added at the time that "people of letters have always gravitated to sport"  and that he had long found baseball to be "the most satisfying and nourishing  of games -- outside of literature, of course."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Schools of Thought  </P> <P> Asked what his colleagues at Yale thought about his decision to become a  baseball executive, Giamatti laughed and said: "One group thought it was nifty.  The other thought it was the ultimate proof of my essential unsoundness."  </P> <P> In a sport that holds the lexicon of the clubhouse sacred, Giamatti displayed  wit, literacy and a youth's affection for the game.  </P> <P> "The prism through which I see things is the prism that understands baseball is  an enormously important American institution with long and deep roots whose  purpose is to provide pleasure and fun for the American people, and whose  integrity and authenticity are essential in order to provide that pleasure," he  said in a recent interview.  </P> <P> "The pace of the game allows for rumination even at the moment instead of just  in retrospect," he added. "And it is a game with a history and mythology so  intimately connected to America that in some idealized and mythological sense  it is virtually synonymous with America."  </P></p>

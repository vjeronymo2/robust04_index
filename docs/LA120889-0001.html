			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Having been in the nursery industry for 30-plus years, I have had more than a  passing interest in the media's coverage of the latest efforts to eliminate the  widespread Medfly infestations in Southern California. The news media as a  whole, including your newspaper, have contributed to the public's concerns and  fears of the chemical malathion. It is disturbing to me to have reporters  interview citizens about their concerns over increased aerial sprayings,  inferring it is the malathion that may damage their possessions. The fact that  the molasses bait is the casual agent seems to be neglected or overlooked.  </P> <P> Malathion has long been the plant protection chemical recommended for the  control of a host of chewing and sucking insects in home gardens. For instance,  when aphids attack your rosebushes, you mix a few tablespoons of malathion in a  sprayer and saturate the plants. This takes place on quarter-acre properties.  For the aerial sprayings, less than 3 ounces of malathion are used to cover an  acre! This isn't any stronger than the spray used on roses.  </P> <P> During a previous Medfly outbreak, when aerial sprayings of malathion were made  in East Los Angeles, Latinos were widely quoted as saying, "If this was Beverly  Hills they wouldn't be spraying us." I submit that Beverly Hills has had more  malathion sprayed within its city limits than any other community, because the  affluent homeowners there employ professional gardeners who have used malathion  to control insects in home gardens -- for decades.  </P> <P> Sure, we know malathion is effective, but is it safe? There have been so many  conflicting stories generated by the media of late it should be apparent this  safety question won't be resolved soon. The media quote one expert, then seek  out another to refute or challenge the first person's opinion. The media have  perpetuated the question of malathion's safety -- and fostered or substantiated  citizens' fears -- with the practice of pitting "expert" vs. "expert."  </P> <P> HAROLD YOUNG  </P> <P> Editor-Publisher  </P> <P> Pacific Coast Nurseryman  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

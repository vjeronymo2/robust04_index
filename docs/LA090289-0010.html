			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARKS, HOMES, BIKES, TRAINS? DEBATING RR RIGHTS OF WAY  </P> <P> Laura Lake expresses her dissatisfaction with a light-rail system as a solution  to traffic problems.  </P> <P> She claims that light rail is an "eyesore." The stream made by a ten-lane  highway is by no means beautiful, and the consequential pollution is ugly,  unhealthy, and damaging to the environment.  </P> <P> If $70 million seems like a lot for the right of way on Exposition Boulevard,  how appealing is $100 million per mile of highway? Light rail is an investment  in the future and serves to reduce pollution and traffic, something no amount  of freeway will ever do.  </P> <P> If developing these already existing rights of way into housing is any  solution, are the new homeowners going to travel on the already congested  roads?  </P> <P> DENIS ALAN DEMOND  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Moslems relent on Srebrenica refugees MOSLEM authorities in the besieged Bosnian town of Srebrenica last night relented and said they would let 1,600 women and children be evacuated today. .Their move follows determined action by General Philippe Morillon, commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, to break the humanitarian impasse in Srebrenica, where twice in the last few days local Moslem commanders have refused to allow convoys bringing in food and medicines to the besieged eastern Bosnian town to evacuate thousands of old and wounded people, women and children on their way back. The local Moslem leaders had taken their decision in spite of the suffering of the inhabitants of Srebrenica, whose population has swollen to 60,000 by refugees from nearby Serb-occupied areas, because they believed it contributed to the Serbs' policy of 'ethnic cleansing.' The Serbs make no secret of their desire to incorporate the Srebrenica region, which has been allocated by international mediators Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen to the Bosnian Moslems, into a Serb-dominated province. Last night Gen Morillon was heading for Srebrenica with four armoured cars, followed by a contingent of Canadian troops. Moslem officials have indicated that, if Srebrenica can be assured of UN protection in the guise of a Canadian 'blue helmets' unit, they would be prepared to allow resumption of UN evacuation. The Bosnian Serb army command had been informed of Gen Morillon's mission, but had not yet given its reply. In Brussels meanwhile, the approval by Nato ambassadors of final plans for using alliance fighters to enforce the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia, hit a last-minute snag as a result of French concerns about the rules of engagement. French officials said France was anxious to make sure the no-fly zone was not enforced in such a provocative way that it drew everyone into a war. As a result, it is possible that final approval will be delayed until today or next week. In Sarajevo, snipers killed four civilians trying to cross the airport runway after Bosnian commanders failed to sign a safe passage deal.</p>

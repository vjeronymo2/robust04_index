			<p>BFN     [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari,  has reiterated that Pakistan's nuclear program is peaceful, and  we have taken a conscious decision not to use our nuclear  capability for weapon production unless our security is  threatened. Addressing the Pakistani community in New York, he  categorically rejected any inspection of Pakistan's nuclear  facilities, saying that the government's policy in this  connection is very clear. The president said Pakistan's nuclear  program enjoys national consensus, and it is not possible for  any government or leader to accept anything imposed from outside  contrary to the wishes of the people of Pakistan. He said that  reports accusing the government has agreed to open up its  facility for any kind of inspections are baseless and frivolous.  [sentence as heard]    The president said Pakistan has told the United States that  no unilateral solution could be imposed on Pakistan. Any  solution to the nonproliferation problem in South Asian region  has to be resolved in the regional context. He said that  Pakistan has proposed several concrete plans to achieve nuclear  nonproliferation in the region, but India has rejected all of  them. Under the circumstances, the United States or the world  at large could not expect realistically that Pakistan would  accept any unilateral obligation.    Replying to a question, he debunked the reports that  Pakistan  has entered into any secret talks with the United States on the  nonproliferation issue. He said Pakistan is pursuing a quiet  diplomacy, but not secret diplomacy, as has been done by others.  Referring to his talks with the U.S. Administration, the  president expressed the confidence that these talks would yield  good results.</p>

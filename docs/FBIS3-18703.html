The 20 planes will replace the Chilean British planes which  date from the fifties. It's not known exactly how much the  Chileans are paying for the planes, but an amount of three  billion francs was mentioned earlier. The planes are up for sale  as a result of the cutbacks in the Belgian Army. The planes  were previously refurbished.</p>

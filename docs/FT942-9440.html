			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Another plunge into the red: With Lloyd's due to unveil further losses tomorrow, Richard Lapper examines the market's prospects Lloyd's of London is going through what its iconoclastic deputy chairman, Mr Robert Hiscox, refers to as its annual 'mid-year wobble'. For the fourth spring in succession the insurance market's future has been brought into question by the prospect of another devastating loss for hard-pressed Names, the individuals whose personal assets have traditionally supported the market. The forecast Pounds 2.5bn loss for 1991, which Lloyd's will report tomorrow in line with its system of reporting three years in arrears, would bring the cumulative loss since 1988 to more than Pounds 8bn. The 1991 loss is substantially greater than predicted by Lloyd's last year and is the latest in a number of blows to hit the market in the past six months which together make Mr Hiscox's 'wobble' sound like an understatement: In February, Names seeking compensation for losses of some Pounds 3bn rejected an out-of-court settlement worth Pounds 900m which had been negotiated under Lloyd's auspices. Their decision set the scene for a succession of court cases. The first and biggest of the current round is being fought by 3,095 Names belonging to Gooda Walker syndicates, one of the worst performing business at Lloyd's in the late 1980s. Two separate reports have suggested that Lloyd's exposure to multi-billion-dollar asbestos and pollution claims in the US will far exceed the insurance market's reserves. The latest report, published last month by US lawyer Mr Randolph Fields, indicated the market faced a shortfall of at least Pounds 11bn, although the cost would be spread over many years. It also suggested that plans to form a reinsurance company into which Lloyd's aims to transfer most of these historic liabilities would be frustrated by difficulties in finding sufficient capital for its launch. Critics have recently claimed that the 1991 loss may impair Lloyd's ability to pass the 'solvency' test set by the Department of Trade and Industry each August in which the assets of Names are matched against outstanding liabilities. If Names are found to have liabilities exceeding their assets, Lloyd's has to earmark money from its Pounds 1bn Central Fund, which meets claims when Names are unable to fulfil their obligations. But last month Lloyd's annual report showed that more than two-thirds of its fund was already set aside for such purposes, raising the spectre of the market having to call for even more money from Names to replenish the fund. The setbacks appear marked since they follow a period of optimism over the winter. Following management changes over the past two years, Lloyd's was able to persuade the City to provide Pounds 800m of limited-liability corporate capital - for the first time in its 300-year history. That success, however, has persuaded many of Lloyd's top managers that the latest gloom is being overdone. 'It is so easy to attack us. So easy to wound the great elephant,' says Mr Hiscox. Lloyd's is confident its plans to form the reinsurance company will be implemented: some underwriters acknowledge in private that many US pollution claims will be settled at less than their full face value, so avoiding legal costs for both sides. Negotiations may reduce some pay-outs to as little as five cents in the dollar - particularly if policy holders decide Lloyd's difficulties mean that is the best they can realistically expect. Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, is also optimistic that negotiations might re-open between Names and agents over possible out-of-court settlements later this year. Above all Lloyd's is confident that it can survive its more immediate pressures on solvency by stepping up efforts to collect debts from Names and by borrowing against profits expected in 1994. Insurance rates increased sharply in 1993 and Lloyd's believes both that year and this year will be profitable. Last year Names were allowed to borrow against their projected 1993 profits to meet part of their liabilities. Last week Lloyd's announced these 'exceptional measures' would also apply in 1994. Lloyd's is also moving to soften the impact of the 1991 losses by eliminating so-called 'double counting'. This happens when Names that have made losses in turn claim on their 'stop loss' policies (which provide cover for losses over pre-set limits), 'errors and omissions' policies (which give cover if agents are successfully sued for negligence) or 'estate protection policies' (which cover the losses of deceased Names). Even so the 1991 loss is expected to force many Names out of the market. Members' agents, who allocate Names to syndicates, forecast the capacity (the amount of business that can be underwritten) available from Names - as opposed to the new corporate members - will fall sharply in 1995, possibly to about Pounds 7.5bn compared to the current Pounds 9.3bn. Though corporate investors could make up part of the shortfall, most observers believe that the total amount of capital will decline next year. 'There just isn't the institutional demand out there at present,' notes one agency chief executive. At the same time, reforms planned by Lloyd's could aggravate the market's difficulties over the next year or two. Changes to Lloyd's rulebook could mean many syndicates have to seek more capital simply to underwrite the same amount of business. Earlier this month the Lloyd's council indicated that during 1995 and 1996 it intended to introduce a system of 'risk weighting' which would link the amount of capital required by a syndicate manager to the riskiness of the underlying business. For instance, syndicates underwriting motor business would need less capital, those underwriting catastrophe reinsurance more. The consequence of the scarcity of capital is likely to be a more rapid restructuring of the market. The number of syndicates has already fallen from 401 in 1990 to 179 this year and further rationalisation seems inevitable. The main casualties are expected to be the smaller and less successful syndicates and agents. Already there are indications that larger managing agents are using their greater influence to secure as much capital as possible for their own syndicates - at the expense of smaller operators. The restructuring is not just about the number of syndicates and agents operating at Lloyds: it is also about the way the market works and how it raises capital. Many large agents, who have been among the quickest to introduce new technology and improve their management standards, are now seeking closer links with corporate investors. Some agents are moving towards setting up 'dedicated' investment funds which will channel capital into just one agent's businesses rather than, as now, a spread of different agents and syndicates. By doing so, they are creating a framework for embryonic 'insurance companies' operating within Lloyd's rules but with greater long-term stability than existing syndicates. 'Mr Middleton and Mr Rowland (Lloyd's chairman) have unleashed a process of change which is accelerating like a turbocharger,' says one leading underwriter. Mr George Stevens, managing director of Brockbank, one of the biggest agents at Lloyd's, predicts that the market will be dominated by between six and 10 corporate syndicates before the end of the century. Such upheavals may ensure the long-term survival of Lloyd's and its businesses, notwithstanding the latest 'wobble'. But the market that emerges when 1993's expected profits are reported in two years, will be radically different from the one that slid into loss in 1988. Names, trading on the traditional basis of unlimited liability, are likely to play an increasingly marginal role.</p>

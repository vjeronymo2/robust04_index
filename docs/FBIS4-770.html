A police spokesman  said in releasing the report in Pretoria that measures would be  implemented nationally to prevent disturbances at polling  stations. No weapons or firearms will be allowed within a  1,100-meter radius of voting stations, and people will be  searched before being allowed in to vote. No party tents,  political activity, flags, or banners will be allowed within the  same radius. The polling stations will be searched for  explosives or other undesirable objects before people will be  allowed to go in, and only voters will be allowed within a  600-meter radius of polling centers.</p>

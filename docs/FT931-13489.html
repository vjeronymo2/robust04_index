			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Firm recovery 'may take time' JAPAN'S economy will not start to recover until the second half of this year, the Bank of Japan warned yesterday in its quarterly economic outlook. But the economy will avoid a severe credit crunch threatened by a financial system weakened by bad debts. The bank said private-sector demand would not recover in the first six months, with personal consumption stagnant and corporate investment depressed. 'It may be some time before business sentiment exhibits any firm recovery,' it warned. The report said the economy would gradually recover as last year's cuts in interest rates and the recently approved supplementary budget of public works filtered through into the economy. Economists believe the bank will soon come under new pressure to cut interest rates further, as inflation abates and consumer confidence wanes. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is preparing a spring economic package to boost the economy. But the Tokyo stock market could fall again if companies start to sell some of their holdings of securities to boost profits towards the end of the financial year in March. The bank insisted there would be no credit crunch, because the hard-pressed Japanese banks are ready to expand lending as the economy recovers. Low bank lending has been one of the main reasons why the money supply fell 0.5 per cent in the last three months of the year. Big companies have had no problems funding borrowing needs by issuing bonds and commercial paper. However, smaller companies, which are exhausting their capacity to fund investment through selling liquid assets are starting to increase their loan demand. Commercial banks are relaxing lending policies for their branches partly because they are alarmed at the decline in the volume of business. The report also predicts that the money supply will soon begin to recover as spending on public works increases. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said at the opening of the Japanese parliament the economy was in a grim state and Japan was in the midst of political and social upheaval. He called for the country to increase its international contributions, for social reforms to create a better quality of life for consumers, and for political reforms to eliminate corruption from the political system.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHRYSLER CLOSER TO MITSUBISHI  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp. may deepen its relationship with Japanese car maker Mitsubishi  now that talks between the nation's No. 3 car maker and Italy's Fiat Auto SpA  have collapsed, Automotive News said today.  </P> <P> Chrysler and Mitsubishi are likely to increase joint product development and  production in the United States and possibly the Far East after Chrysler's  failed bid to strengthen its presence in Europe via Fiat, the weekly industry  paper said in its Nov. 12 edition.  </P> <P> The talks between Chrysler and Fiat collapsed Nov. 2, with both sides blaming  poor global economic conditions for thwarting a deal.  </P> <P> Chrysler, the only top U.S. car maker without a major presence overseas, has  been looking for a way to enter Europe and break its dependence on the North  American market.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Kwang-hyon] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy [MTIE]  on 4 March issued a statement reporting: "If the United States  seeks to impose Super 301 trade-sanctions on the ROK, the ROK  intends to refer the issue to the World Trade Organization  [WTO], which is slated to begin in 1995 for the settlement of  disputes."    In the statement entitled "the MTIE's position on the  revival  of Super 301 authority on trade-sanctions," Kim Chol-su,  minister of Trade, Industry, and Energy, said: "The MTIE calls  on the United States to restrain from invoking the authority  arbitrarily [chauijogin]."    The minister also warned that: "The reinstatement of the  Super 301 provision runs counter to the spirit of Uruguay Round,  which concluded at the end of last year. We express concern  that this may hinder the world's free trade order at a time when  the WTO is about to begin."</p>

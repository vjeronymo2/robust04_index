			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Construction Contracts: Leeds regeneration project A Pounds 3m contract for a 60,000 sq ft office development beside the historic Leeds Bridge on the river Aire has been awarded to CLUGSTON CONSTRUCTION by Sovereign Quay, a joint venture by Ploughland Estates and Yorkshire Rider. The Sovereign Quay development comprises two adjacent buildings, Windsor House and King House. Windsor House, which fronts on to the river and Bridge End, will provide 20,000 sq ft of offices on five floors with basement parking for 18 cars. Original features will be retained such as the riverside boardwalk and the facade of the Victorian building, which appears on what is believed to be the world's first ever moving film, made by Louis Le Prince in 1890 on Leeds Bridge. King House, the adjacent building which fronts on to Sovereign Street, will be vacated by Yorkshire Rider and the interior completely refurbished to provide 40,000 sq ft of office space.</p>

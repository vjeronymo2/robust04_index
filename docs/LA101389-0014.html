			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: MENU AT DEL MAR BISTRO GARDEN MORE LIKE AN  EPICUREAN FASHION PLATE  </P> <P> As the decade lazes to a close, the menu at the Del Mar Bistro Garden at the  new and agreeable Del Mar Inn suggests a minor if fascinating revelation about  the cooking of the 1980s: ingredients have become comparable to hemlines.  </P> <P> A glance down the list of entrees reads something like a Fifth Avenue fashion  parade for foods. Those ingredients that may as well have come off the designer  shelf are noted here in italics, and are numerous. In the 1990s, at least a few  of them presumably will go the way of the mini or the maxi, perhaps to return  in a later age.  </P> <P> There are, for example, Wisconsin duckling with cepes, and a "California coq au  vin" of chicken braised in Zinfandel with pancetta, onions and carrots. The  sauteed boneless breast of chicken arrives stuffed with goat cheese and basil,  the Norwegian salmon mesquite grilled with cilantro beurre blanc. Grilled jumbo  shrimp may be naked and unsauced, but they garnish a bed of angel hair pasta  dressed with tomato concasse, herbs, lemon juice, shallots and olive oil.  </P> <P> In '80s terms, the menu would be incomplete without five spice baked halibut  with black and pink peppercorns. It also gets the necessary accents from the  morels that garnish the veal chop, and the onion confit that glamorizes the  otherwise Plain Jane New York steak.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Ageless Classics  </P> <P> However, just as a few very proper ladies always wear their hems at mid-calf,  the menu concludes with two ageless classics, a rack of lamb roasted with  rosemary and garlic, and filet of beef with goose liver pate and truffled brown  sauce.  </P> <P> The nice thing about this roster of ingredients is that it has greatly expanded  our eating options, both by introducing novelties that formerly belonged only  to specific ethnic cuisines (pancetta is Italian belly bacon, for example), and  by internationalizing others, as in the cilantro beurre blanc, which puts a  Mexican accent on a quintessentially French butter sauce.  </P> <P> These dishes add up to a fine menu for the Del Mar Bistro Garden, a  descriptively named eatery that encompasses a pair of dining rooms and a  handsome outdoor terrace. Dinner is possible outside, but because Southern  California restaurant patrons generally disdain the great outdoors at night,  the garden terrace sees most of its action at lunch; the dining rooms, with  their high pitched ceilings and white walls, have a sort of French country look  but the casually chic atmosphere typical of the North County coast.  </P> <P> Trendiness is the watchword in all departments of the menu, which starts out  calmly enough with an appetizer of oysters on the half shell, but plunges  immediately into ahi sashimi (thinly sliced raw Hawaiian tuna with Japanese  seasonings), gravad lax (Scandinavian cured salmon), a casserole of snails and  cured ham and, for the nutritionally nervous, a plate of mesquite grilled  vegetables with garlic mayonnaise.  </P> <P> Tradition returns briefly on the soup list with the onion soup gratinee, but  vanishes again with the lobster and leek bisque en croute. This soup had the  potential to be good, but it tasted of commercial lobster soup base, included  far too much leek and was canopied by soggy, half-baked commercial puff pastry  that would have been happier had it remained in its box. Caesar and spinach  salads dominate the greenery patch. But the less assertive Bistro salad is  really quite nice, because it stylishly tosses the best greens with fresh  herbs, lemon and a mixture of oils.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blended and Balanced  </P> <P> Pizza and pasta also appear, as they virtually must these days, and  occasionally in wild guises, such as the moo shu shrimp pizza and the  lobster-stuffed ravioli with cream, Port and rosemary. The angel hair pasta  with sauteed scallops and a lightly creamy sauce elaborated from decent  Chardonnay is calmer and quite tasty, the flavors beautifully blended and  balanced.  </P> <P> Among the entrees, the grilled veal chop is outstanding. All that really is  required here are a thoughtfully cut, well-trimmed piece of meat and a cook who  knows how to grill it, both elements usually lacking with restaurant veal  chops. The Del Mar Bistro Garden did send out a carefully done chop, however,  and the forest-perfumed morel mushrooms, so perfect for the meat, were lavishly  apportioned. The plate garnish included a fancy arrangement of crisply cooked  tiny yellow squash, waffle-cut carrots and pea pods, as well as a small cake of  gratin dauphinoise, or cream-scalloped potatoes.  </P> <P> The grilled giant sea scallops also pleased, not only for the lightness of the  kitchen's touch (they were barely done, and ever so juicy), but for the  brilliant, emerald-colored tarragon puree that gave them such a lift. Color and  much additional flavor also came from the topping of grilled red bell pepper  bits, which were arranged in decorative crowns atop each of the shellfish.  </P> <P> The dessert cart offers mostly catered products and is of limited interest. But  guests who plan ahead and order the Belgian chocolate souffle when they give  the dinner order will find themselves, at meal's end, dipping up a Sybaritic  soup of gooey puffed chocolate and velvety custard sauce.  </P> <P> This restaurant's luncheon menu also is quite attractive. Many items repeat  from dinner, but the composed salads are served only at lunch and are sometimes  stunning.  </P> <P> The finest salad is the Del Mar Cobb, which substitutes crab, shrimp and tiny  scallops for the traditional turkey and bacon and carefully decorates them with  avocado, tomato and a wonderfully generous sprinkling of crumbled blue cheese.  The California chicken salad also is handled well, the sliced breast meat  tossed with raspberry vinegar and deliciously musty walnut oil for moistening,  and with snow peas, lettuces and shredded vegetables for substance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Unusual Sandwich  </P> <P> None of the sandwiches were sampled, but the list includes an ahi "burger" of  grilled tuna steak on a bun with marinated roasted peppers and avocado; a  sandwich of roast turkey carved from a whole roasted turkey rather than from  one of those insidious commercial turkey rolls, and an unusual club sandwich of  mesquite grilled chicken breast with pesto mayonnaise, bacon, lettuce and  tomato.  </P> <P> Among the entrees, the only dish that does not also appear on the dinner list  is the crab and spinach omelet. The kitchen included plenty of crab in the  fluffy egg mixture (James Beard said that shellfish must be served lavishly or  not at all, and it is impossible to disagree), but the flavor overall was quite  flat. The simple addition of an herb -- tarragon would be ideal -- would have  brought up both the crab and the eggs, and melded them into something far  better than this workmanlike but dull omelet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEL MAR BISTRO GARDEN  </P> <P> Del Mar Inn, 1540 Camino Del Mar  </P> <P> 259-1515  </P> <P> Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Meals for two, including a glass of wine, tax and tip, average $25 to $40 at  lunch and $35 to $80 at dinner.  </P></p>

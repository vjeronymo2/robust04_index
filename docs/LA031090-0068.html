			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEAN AIR BILL STALLED BY PROPOSAL TO AID COAL MINERS  </P> <P> Senate leaders and the White House faced new obstacles Friday to passage of  clean air legislation because of discord over providing $700 million to help  coal miners who lose their jobs because of stricter pollution controls.  </P> <P> Unable to resolve that dispute, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell  (D-Me.) put off further votes on the bill until the Senate returns from its  upcoming weeklong recess.  </P> <P> "It has become apparent that we cannot complete action on the bill . . . this  week," Mitchell said.  </P> <P> The senators adjourned late Friday and will not reconvene until March 20, when  the clean air bill will be the first order of business, Mitchell said.  </P> <P> Senate leaders had been prepared Thursday night to bring the coal miner  amendment to a vote, but action was postponed when they grew uncertain about  their ability to defeat the proposal.  </P> <P> The amendment is one of a string of proposed changes that would alter the  compromise reached between Senate leaders and the White House in closed  negotiations. Senate leaders have said they would oppose any such amendments.  </P> <P> The coal miner amendment was offered by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.), who  described it as a "safety net" for up to 5,000 miners who stand to lose their  jobs because of tougher acid rain pollution controls. It would provide miners  with up to four years of full or part salary if their job loss is attributed to  the new controls.  </P> <P> Byrd originally had sought assistance costing nearly $1.4 billion over six  years, but then cut that by half in a bid to gain support. But the Bush  Administration told Senate leaders that the measure is still too expensive.  </P> <P> "If this amendment is passed, it's over," Senate Minority Bob Dole of Kansas  said during debate Thursday night. He said Administration officials had told  him that President Bush could not support a compromise bill that includes the  coal miner provision. "The Administration doesn't like this amendment one bit,  and that would be an understatement," Dole said.  </P> <P> Mitchell said Friday that negotiations were under way among Senate leaders,  Byrd and the Administration to try to work out a settlement but that no vote  would be taken on the amendment until after the Senate returns.  </P> <P> "I'm willing to let the dice role," Byrd said on the Senate floor Friday,  noting that he was prepared to put the matter to a vote.  </P> <P> Mitchell had threatened to hold the senators in session into today if necessary  to work out key provisions of the clean air legislation. But he canceled those  plans Friday because of the impasse over the coal miner assistance issue.  </P> <P> Among amendments still pending are several that would strengthen pollution  controls, including those on automobiles.  </P> <P> Several of those measures, especially a call for a second round of auto  emission controls and broader alternative fuels programs, are opposed by the  Administration.  </P></p>

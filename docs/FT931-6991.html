			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Owners refutes claims OWNERS Abroad yesterday aimed to refute claims made during the hostile bid from rival holiday group, Airtours, ahead of its final defence document which due to be produced today. Owners said it had not included details of a Pounds 6.5m contingent liability with its preliminary results because it was not usual practice to do so. The liability, in any case, related to the possibility that London properties vacated as part of the reorganisation of the group in Crawley would have to be carried for the full period of their leases. Owners had taken full provisions of Pounds 1.7m for two years, covering rental and other costs up to the time of their anticipated disposal. Owners said that contrary to what Airtours claimed, it had provided Pounds 7.5m for additional payments for the acquisition of Olympic and Extrawelcome holiday companies that might fall due. It also said it had Pounds 40.9m of distributable reserves in the group, of which Pounds 8.8m was currently held in the parent company. There was no legal restriction on subsidiaries making the balance distributable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Avinash Alok: "Does Uruguay Round Hold Good for </F> India?"]    [Text] The last phase of Uruguay Round of talks on global  trade liberalisation has been dominated by the question of  European farm products' access to the US and other farm  exporters. It is the same United States which had secured an  important concession in the post-war years; the granting of a  waiver that agricultural policy and trade in agricultural goods  should be exempted from the GATT rules. This was a time when the  US pursued a policy of extensive subsidies that kept the  American farm prices high, a policy that led to the generation  large farm surpluses.    India as one of its founder-members is among the 116 which  are likely to reach an 'agreement' by December 15. What is in  store for it? It has been estimated by the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that a GATT  agreement could enrich the world by as much as $270 billion by  the year 2002 AD.    Indian economy is apprehensive about most of the  liberalisation aspects. So, there is no denying that the Indian  pie out of the amount estimated is likely to be very small and  the cost of getting that pie also remains unestimated. But, we  are likely to be one of those signatories whose voices were not  heeded.    The Draft Final Act (DFA) or the Dunkel Draft, as it is  popularly known, envisages for patents rights to be available to  both products and processes. At present, the Indian Patents Act  of 1970 gives patent rights for processes and not for products  in cases of food, medicines and substances produced through  chemical processes. Even for the processes of these products,  the patent period seven years from the date of application or  five years from the date of sealing of the patent, whichever is  earlier. The DFA stipulates a minimum of 20 years for every  process and product.    It is feared that the market prices of various medicines,  which are lowest in India, will go beyond the reach of the poor  class. In the field of agriculture it means granting of products  and processes patent to all bio-technological innovations. This  means that all plants and animals growing outside purely natural  surroundings can be patented, and further that, even natural  plant varieties should be protected by a sui generis  system. This has the potential implication of disallowing Indian  farmers to keep aside a part of their products for seed.  <H5>  Right to seeds </H5>   GATT Director General Peter Sutherland has though put this  fear to rest. In his recent visit to India, he has said that  farmers' right to retain a part of their crop as seed in  subsequent crops would be completely protected, since the DFA  did not envisage any change. He clarified that even informal  exchanges of seeds, as exists in the country, could continue.  But, commercial sale would not be possible.    In the area of subsidies of agriculture it has been pointed  out that the aggregate support measures (subsidies) calculated  on the basis of norms suggested in the DFA, amounts to either  negative or negligible for most of the crops cultivated in  India. The DFA provides for a maximum limit of 10 per cent of  aggregate subsidies. In this case too, Mr Sutherland has said  that agricultural subsidy in India would not be affected as  Indian concern to maintain the food security system was fully  understood by the contracting parties to the GATT.    Textile being one of the most important segments of our  exports sector is causing more anxiety than anything else. India  demands higher percentage of integration of the clothing and  textiles sector in GATT in the beginning of the transition  period, once the Uruguay Round results are put in place. India  has termed the present DFA proposal of 10 years transition  period for integration as a back-loaded one. The demand for a  front-loaded arrangement received a setback when Mr Bill  Clinton's administration conceded to its Congressmen from  textile-producing States, during NAFTA debate, that it will  demand the 'longest possible phase-out' of an integration of the  textile and clothing sector into GATT.    Trade in services is another area which is being debated.  The  DFA proposals require that foreign service enterprises be  treated at par with the domestic enterprise. But ruling out of  free cross-border movements of persons, (except some vague  provisions for temporary migration of skilled labour, hedged by  requirements of reciprocity) ensures that this benefit goes  entirely to the development countries. Although services  contribute more to the national income than industry and  agriculture in India and are developing fast, it is still at a  very pre-mature stage vis-a-vis developed countries.    The requirements under the Trade Related Investment Measures  (TRIMS), like waiving of restrictions on multi-national  companies, stipulate use of a minimum of local content in  production or impose on them any export obligations which have  already been done away with.    Although, it sounds like succumbing to the masters of the  unipolar world, one point is noteworthy. The DFA proposals offer  a much better deal on patents than the countries like South  Korea, China and Mexico, which went into an agreement with USA  to avoid trade retaliation under Special 301. China, for  example, has agreed to provide protection to all the drugs  patented in the US since 1986.    As India will have to bring these into force only in the  year  2003 AD, after the 10-year transition period is over, it is  getting a clear advantage of 17 years. And the fact that the  Indian bargaining power in the trade is very low, the best which  can be expected is that some of its demands on patents, textile  and services are incorporated.</p>

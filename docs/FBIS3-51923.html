			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The installation of a modern 10-kilowatt radio  transmitter for the Villa Clara CMHW provincial network will be  concluded shortly. This new transmitter will allow optimum  signal quality on 840 khz and it will cover a transmitting range  which is almost three times the current range. In other words,  it is three times superior to the current equipment. This is  the first 10-kilowatt Canadian-made transmitter installed in the  country. The work was begun last week by a group of  Communications Ministry engineers and technicians.    In addition to the Villa Clara CMHW transmitter, a similar  one is being installed for Radio Rebelde on 1180 khz. This will  improve the signal of this national radio station in our  territory [no specific location given].</p>

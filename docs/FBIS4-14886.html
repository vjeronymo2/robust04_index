			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Elmar Guseynov report: "Last 15 Israeli Policemen Remain </F> in Jericho To Hand Over City to Palestinian Security Forces.  Russian Diplomats Deliver Special Messages from President  Yeltsin to Damascus and Amman"]    [Excerpt] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and  the Russian president's special representative Viktor Posuvalyuk  brought Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad a personal message from  Boris Yeltsin. The Russian diplomats are keeping the text of  the message a secret.    The outcome of the Palestinians' peace talks with Israel  depends on Syria' stance. It was owing to Syria's and Jordan's  refusal to continue the talks following the Hebron massacre that  the Arab-Israeli negotiating process ran into delay five weeks  ago.    What is more, it has not proved possible to organize  bilateral talks between Syria and the Jewish state, prompting  Russia -- as one of the two sponsors of the Near East settlement  process -- to pay particular attention to President Hafiz  al-Asad.    Following his visit to Damascus I. Ivanov returned to Moscow  while V. Posuvalyuk went on to Amman to hand the King of Jordan  a message from Yeltsin.    The high-ranking Foreign Ministry staffers' visit to  Damascus  and Amman obviously marks a fresh attempt by Russian diplomacy  to preserve its role as one of the patrons of the Near East  negotiating process after Moscow's recent peace initiative  failed to meet with support from the parties to this process.    The boost to Russian foreign policy in the region is  occurring amid the resumption of the peace process. Talks  between the Israelis and the PLO have continued in Cairo.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Josip Manolic, former Croatian Democratic </F> Community official and current vice chairman of Croatian  Independent Democrats, by Davor Butkovic; place and date not  given: "War Between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina  Costs Croatia 3 Million German Marks a Day!"]    [Text] Beginning with this issue, GLOBUS will  publish, in several installments and in the form of thematic  interviews, the most important remembrances of the cofounder of  the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]; former prime minister;  chief, until recently, of all Croatian intelligence services;  president of the Assembly House of Zupanijas; and a short time  ago one of the founders of the Croatian Independent Democrats,  concerning the political figures and events in Croatia from 1989  to 1994. In the first part of his memoirs, Josip Manolic for the  first time reveals a bewildering fact: The war between the  Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina costs Croatia three  million German marks a day!    In the first installment of GLOBUS's feuilleton "Political  History of Croatia from 1989 to 1994," the vice chairman and  founder of the Croatian Independent Democrats, Josip Manolic,  who five years ago, together with Dr. Franjo Tudjman, founded  the Croatian Democratic Community, and who from 1990 to present  occupied a series of very important state and party positions,  talks about how the Croatian currency came to be named the  "kuna" [marten], how preparations were made for introduction of  the Croatian dinar, how much the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina cost  Croatia, and who actually oversaw the money that Croatian  emigres collected for the needs of national defense.    At last year's final session of the Assembly on 29 July  1993,  prior to the annual vacation, the Law on Changes in the Law on  the National Bank of Croatia was adopted. One of the changes was  in the name of the Croatian currency: The expression "Croatian  kruna" was replaced by the word "kuna," while "banica," as  one-one hundredth of the Croatian kruna, was replaced by "lipa."    The original text of the Law on the National Bank, with the  designations "Croatian kruna" and "banica," which were replaced  by "kuna" and "lipa" last summer, was adopted in early November  1992.    Thus, the Croatian Assembly changed the name of the Croatian  currency twice in only nine months!    "Historically, the Croatian currency has never been called  the kuna," says Mr. Manolic. "Marten furs were only one form of  exchanging goods back when currency did not even exist in the  Croatian region, just as sea shells, goats, or sheep were also  used. Thus, marten furs were only a means of barter payment, so  that the name `kuna' for Croatian money cannot be derived from  any genuine tradition. By the same token, the currency could be  called `koza' [goat] or `ovca' [sheep] just as easily as  `kuna,'" Manolic believes.    "Prior to last year's decision on changes in the Law on the  National Bank of Croatia, the kuna had been legal tender only in  the Independent State of Croatia [NDH--World War II fascist  state]. Personally, I feel that historically speaking there is  in fact no reason whatsoever to call Croatian money kuna, but  also that the name of money is not a critical political  question. That certainly did not appear to be the case when the  decision on the name of money was adopted, when the state  leadership obviously did not consider all the consequences of  the name `kuna' for the new Croatian currency."    [Butkovic] Do you think that it is a good thing politically  for the money of the new Croatian state to be named after the  money of the state that was on the wrong side in World War II?    [Manolic] No, of course that is not good. We here have not  yet confronted the fact that during that period of history, in  only four years, there were a very large number of pogroms  against members of other nations who lived and live in Croatia,  but also against many Croats. We must now be realistic. Neither  Jews nor Serbs will be able to accept the kuna as their  currency. In addition, although it was a state, the NDH was not  a bright spot to which anything in present-day Croatia should be  linked.    [Butkovic] How was the name "kuna" even selected? Who  insisted upon it?    [Manolic] It is obvious that some people felt nostalgia for  the symbols of a certain period that was not the happiest one  for Croatia. But that was not the only reason. Specifically, in  the initial period after the Croatian Democratic Community  victory, in 1990, the prevalent conviction among the party  leadership due to the euphoric--and nationalistic--attitude of  the victors was that all the symbols of the new state must have  a radically Croatian quality to them, so that the majority of  HDZ leaders at the time were in favor of the kuna, as a symbol  of something Croatian that was banned for 45 years. After the  homeland war and amid international recognition of Croatia, the  mood became more sober. Then, the prevalent conviction was that  it is more sensible and useful to call the Croatian currency the  Croatian kruna, which was in fact enacted in the Law on the  National Bank of Croatia of November 1992. But then the attitude  that the kuna is a better solution came to prevail.    Mr. Manolic remembers well who decided that the Croatian  currency should be called the kuna, and when.    [Manolic] During the period of initial discussion of changes  in the Law on the National Bank of Croatia, a meeting of 14  prominent deputies of the Croatian Democratic Community--the  majority of whom are not currently in my new party--was held at  the Assembly. Of the 14 of them, 12 were opposed to the kuna,  and only two were for it! Shortly thereafter, at a meeting of  the Presidency of the Croatian Democratic Community, Dr. Tudjman  said that the new Croatian currency must be called the kuna and  that the Law on the National Bank of Croatia must be changed to  that end. At that meeting, Dr. Tudjman instructed the chairmen  of HDZ parliamentary caucuses that all deputies of the Croatian  Democratic Community must vote for the kuna!    [Butkovic] Thus, the president himself insisted on the name  kuna?    [Manolic] Yes, at a meeting of the Presidency of the  Croatian  Democratic community held last year, he stipulated that the new  Croatian currency be called the kuna. The Assembly deputies  simply executed his decision.    [Butkovic] How did Dr. Tudjman explain his insistence on the  kuna?    [Manolic] He said that the kuna is one of the expressions of  the Croatian nation-building tradition. Specifically, although  Dr. Tudjman participated in the war against the NDH, he  nevertheless regarded the Independent State of Croatia as an  element in the Croatian nation-building tradition, and for that  reason he wanted the kuna specifically, as the currency of that  regime and as a symbol of that nation-building approach, to  become the official Croatian currency.    [Butkovic] How did Dr. Tudjman defend the kuna against the  objections of international and domestic public opinion?    [Manolic] At the time of the adoption of the decision by the  HDZ Presidency, but not by the Assembly, he did not accept any  negative consequences whatsoever of the name kuna--not only from  an international, but also from a domestic-policy viewpoint. I  repeat once more that we cannot serious count on reintegration  of the occupied territories with things like the kuna.    [Butkovic] Who was for the kuna in the Croatian Democratic  Community, and who was against it?    [Manolic] Pressure to rename the currency the kuna was  exerted by the Herzegovinan lobby. At the time, I got the  impression that Tudjman made that decision under pressure from  the Herzegovinans, as a concession to the Herzegovinan lobby.  However, there were many other prominent HDZ figures besides the  Herzegovinans who defended the kuna. One of them was academician  Dalibor Brozovic, by no means an ardent rightwinger or  nationalist, but who did support the kuna. On the other hand,  Ivan Aralica presented arguments against the kuna. Almost no one  from the President Tudjman's innermost circle, including the  president himself, was willing to listen to him. I spoke out  openly against the kuna on several occasions, contending that  such a name for the Croatian currency will only be politically  damaging to the Republic of Croatia.    [Butkovic] Still, at the end of last July, after bitter  parliamentary debate in which nearly all opposition Assembly  deputies cogently challenged the HDZ bill on changing the Law on  the National Bank of Croatia, that proposal passed, thanks to  the unanimous support of Croatian Democratic Community deputies.  It is interesting that the HDZ, in which bitter factional  infighting had been going on for some time, was unwilling to  split over the name of the currency. Why?    [Manolic] We felt that the name of the currency was too  minor  an issue to provoke a serious political split in the HDZ. That  is why we preferred to remain silent, so that the majority of  HDZ deputies voted with the party's--i.e., Tudjman's--decision.  We felt that it was much more important for our money to be  solid and stable than for us to quarrel and expose our positions  in the then-internal struggle on the issue of what the currency  is called....    [Butkovic] Speaking of the name of the currency, what did  the  leaders of the government have to say about that?    [Manolic] No one asked the government anything about it. I  repeat: The decision on the name of the Croatian currency was  made by Dr. Tudjman under pressure from the Herzegovinan lobby,  and the government was given the task of implementing that  decision. It is a major illusion to think that the government  could have had any degree of autonomy in that regard. Both the  government and the National Bank of Croatia had to obey  President Tudjman's decisions, and they have never been  autonomous in making important political or personnel decisions.    [Butkovic] The Croatian currency first began to be discussed  in earnest at the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991, during  the first attempts at a Yugoslav coup against the legally  elected authorities of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic  of Slovenia. Shortly thereafter, Serbia conducted the famous  raid on the SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]  monetary system, when more than $1 billion "disappeared," which  dealt the death blow to the convertibility of Ante Markovic's  dinar. Soon the war broke out, so that it became necessary to  introduce a Croatian currency. However, it is a less-known fact  that the founders of the HDZ were thinking about the need to  introduce Croatian currency back while the communists were still  in power in Croatia....    [Manolic] When we founded the Croatian Democratic Community,  our goal was to emancipate Croatia from Yugoslavia. That meant  creating all the instruments of an independent state, including  Croatian currency. Thus, we were planning the introduction of  Croatian currency back in the early 1990's....    [Butkovic] When was it decided to actually introduce the  currency? Did the first armed fighting with Serb rebels around  Easter 1991 influence the final decision to introduce Croatian  currency?    [Manolic] In my judgment, the war did not begin at Easter  1991, but rather on 17 August 1990, when the Serb rebels erected  the first barricades at Knin. Even then, what was going to  happen had to be clear to all mature people in Croatia. But as  far as currency is concerned, we had to follow our other  political decisions. As you know, we did not simply want to  leave Yugoslavia. We wanted to separate from Yugoslavia in order  not to leave a huge amount of property in Belgrade's hands,  so-called federal property, in the creation of which Croatia  played the biggest role. Negotiations on distributing that  property are still going on, and have been very unsuccessful.  Similarly, no peace agreement detailing compensation for war  damages has yet been signed since the end of this war.    Thus, we wanted to separate from the SFRY, with maximum  protection of all those rights, all that property that we  created in the SFRY. The decision to introduce an independent  monetary unit could be made only in the context of that  separation process, and that is why I think it is unjustified to  claim that Croatia could have introduced its own--albeit  temporary--monetary unit, the Croatian dinar, before the end of  1991.    [Butkovic] How long did it take to prepare for introduction  of the Croatian dinar?    [Manolic] The intensive preparations took around six months.  The main role in these preparations was played by the minister  of finance at the time, (the now late) Marijan Hanzekovic.  During that time, there was much discussion of the economic  justification of introducing Croatian currency, about printing  costs. I recall that there were negotiations with numerous  foreign money printers, that an effort was made to reduce costs  as much as possible.    [Butkovic] Who made the decision on the exact date for  introducing the Croatian currency? Is it true that in the  Government of Democratic Unity, under the prime ministership of  Franjo Greguric, there was a desire to introduce the Croatian  dinar for use as soon as possible?    [Manolic] It is true that there were tendencies in the  government to speed up the introduction of our own currency. But  it was really impossible for preparations to take less than six  months. At that time, Croatia was in the middle of the homeland  war, and was unable to function normally. Naturally, the  decision on when to introduce the Croatian dinar was made by the  president of the republic.    Even though it had a multiparty composition, the Greguric  government too was by no means autonomous in relation to the  president of the republic, even though that impression existed  among the public.    [Butkovic] During the period when the currency was being  replaced, rumors circulated to the effect that large quantities  of the replaced Yugoslav money was ending up in Croat towns in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is that true?    [Manolic] It is true that there was a great deal of  manipulation present during replacement of the currency. I  cannot tell you about the nature of those manipulations. There  are still living witnesses to those events who could tell you  exactly what happened.    [Butkovic] As head of the Office for the Protection of  Constitutional Order at the time, do you really not know where  the bags of Yugoslav dinars ended up?    [Manolic] The intelligence and counterintelligence services  were unable and unauthorized to deal with that problem. Other  people were responsible for placement of the Yugoslav dinars,  and they can now give you all the necessary explanations.    After the first eight almost idyllic months of the Croatian  dinar's existence, amid Greguric's "programmed inflation" of 10  to 15 percent a month, hyperinflation erupted in Croatia after  the Croatian Democratic Community won the August 1992 elections,  and that hyperinflation completely devalued the Croatian dinar  and lasted nearly 14 months. Josip Manolic, at that time the  head of the intelligence service and President Tudjman's closest  associate, explains now that entering into hyperinflation was a  necessary political move.    [Manolic] Hyperinflation was the only way to finance the  Croatian state. Croatia exhausted all its financial resources on  the homeland war, and one must not forget that the Dubrovnik  seaboard was not liberated until June 1992. All funds and all  reserves were exhausted, and there was no chance of borrowing  money from anyone. In order to survive, in order to be able to  pay for the state's most elementary needs, such as weapons and  maintenance of the armed forces, we had to enter into  hyperinflation. That is why I think that it is important to say  that the supposed weakness of the Croatian dinar was not the  cause of the hyperinflation. The state simply had no money, so  that hyperinflation was the only possible political decision. At  that time, we had no opportunities whatsoever for foreign loans  or revenues from tourism, nor for any real revival of the  economy. That is why we decided to finance the state through  inflation....    [Butkovic] But during that time, when the state had no money  for the most elementary needs, so that it had to cause  hyperinflation, state institutions decided to purchase a  presidential airplane and a number of luxury cars. Who made the  decision to buy the Challenger, worth at least $12 million?    [Manolic] The decision to buy the presidential airplane was  made by the president himself. The president felt that as a  statesman, he must have a corresponding airplane, that such an  airplane is a symbol of Croatian statehood. I actually do not  know how much the presidential airplane cost. As far as the cars  are concerned, however, I must say that they were acquired at an  exceptionally favorable price. Specifically, used cars were  bought for the needs of the Assembly. For example, my official  BMW Series 5 cost no more than 7,000 German marks [DM].    [Butkovic] At a time of hyperinflation, the Croatian state  not only enriched its motor pool and housing fund for state  officials, but also--which is much worse--entered into the war  with Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina through the HVO [Croat  Defense Council] and Herceg-Bosna. In recent public appearances,  you have alleged that that war cost Croatia an exceptional  amount of money. Thus far, however, you have not mentioned any  concrete figures.    [Manolic] The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina contributed  essentially to the impoverishment of the population of the  Republic of Croatia. At the beginning of open Croat-Muslim  fighting, wages in Croatia were below DM200. It can be proven  that the state funds would be incomparably fuller, that various  beneficiaries of the budget, from teachers to doctors, would  have at least somewhat higher wages, if the Republic of Croatia  had not had to finance the Croatian Defense Council's war  against the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Butkovic] Can you estimate how much money Croatia spent on  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Manolic] There are only unofficial estimates of how much  was  spent on the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But I do think that a  more or less accurate figure can be calculated. There were  63,000 to 64,000 soldiers fighting the Muslims. All those  soldiers had to be paid. All those soldiers consumed a certain  amount of ammunition each day. A certain number of shells were  launched, and the average price of a shell is DM50. To all of  that you must add logistical costs.    All together, the war with the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina  cost the Republic of Croatia at least DM3 million a day! Since  the war lasted nearly one year, it can be estimated that that  war cost us a total of nearly DM1 billion. The question is how  impoverished Croatia could allow itself to finance such a  politically and economically suicidal war!    [Butkovic] One of the most important sources of financing  Croatian defensive needs was money sent to the homeland from the  diaspora. Today, however, it is unclear what actually happened  to that money, how much money actually arrived in Croatia, on  what it was all spent, and who controlled the bank accounts to  which the money from the emigre community was deposited....    [Butkovic] Not one state or party body ever received a  report  on the money that arrived from the emigre community for  defensive needs. Recently, at one of the last meetings of the  National Security Council, at which I was present, the issue of  this money was raised. As in the past, we did not get a single  concrete response....    [Butkovic] How did the money arrive in Croatia from the  emigre community?    [Manolic] Our emigres began sending money back while  Yugoslavia still existed, because it was seen immediately that  Croatia must prepare for defense. During that period, we opened  several accounts at foreign banks, because we did not want that  money to go to the SFRY, to be seized by the Yugoslav  authorities. After Croatia became definitively independent,  there was no longer any need for our emigres' money to be  deposited in secret accounts abroad, but that practice continued  nevertheless. The money was never moved to Croatia from the  foreign accounts, and not a single state body ever received any  explanation of why that was so!    [Butkovic] Who oversaw that money?    [Manolic] From the very beginning, Minister Gojko Susak was  responsible for gathering money from the diaspora. He is  probably the only person who knows what all happened to the  money gathered for national defense, and he has not submitted an  account statement for that money to anyone. Minister Susak and  the president of the republic were the only ones with authority  to sign on all the accounts into which money for the defensive  needs of Croatia arrived. The majority of other state officials  knew nothing about that. We were unable to get any more detailed  information about the spending of that money, or even about the  actual amounts.    [Butkovic] Can you give at least a ballpark figure for how  much money Croatian emigres sent in for national defense?    [Manolic] Most likely it involves at least several hundred  million dollars, about which almost no one in the state  leadership knows where it was spent. That is a question to which  Minister Susak, who from the very beginning was the only one  overseeing the collection and spending of that money, must in  fact respond.    [Butkovic] Speaking of money spent for defense, what  happened  to the money earmarked for Vukovar, because of which Vukovar  commander Dedakovic was in prison?    [Manolic] Dedakovic was not arrested because of the money  for  Vukovar, but rather for other reasons. However, during his  arrest a certain amount of money was found on him, which he said  was collected from Croatian emigres for the defense of Vukovar.  The Dedakovic case has been dealt with by the criminal  investigation system, and I think that there is nothing else  mysterious in connection with the money for Vukovar.    [Butkovic] Is it possible that some of the money gathered by  the diaspora for the state's needs ended up in the accounts of  the Croatian Democratic Community? On several occasions the  opposition has hinted that the HDZ has used this money to pay  for its extravagant election campaigns....    [Manolic] I think that that is utterly impossible. The  election campaigns of the Croatian Democratic Community have  been very modest in relation to the amount of money that has  arrived from abroad. Moreover, the HDZ has never had problems  finding sponsors for its election campaigns. I really do not  believe that money collected for the defense of Croatia has  ended up in the accounts of the Croatian Democratic Community.</p>

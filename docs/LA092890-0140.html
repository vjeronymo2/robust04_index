			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> LADY TOROS SEARCH FOR WINNING FORMULA  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills opens its California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  women's volleyball season Tuesday, days short of a dubious anniversary.  </P> <P> The Lady Toros started the week with a 3-6 record and last won a CCAA match on  Oct. 19, 1987, defeating Cal State Los Angeles, 3-1. Since then, Dominguez  Hills has lost 30 consecutive league matches.  </P> <P> Sadly, despite major improvements made by second-year Coach Nancy Fortner, this  year's outcome could be a repeat of the past three seasons.  </P> <P> Even Fortner, charged by Athletic Director Dan Guerrero with rebuilding a  program that was all but dead, admits it will be an uphill struggle. Her goal:  "I hope that we can take some games off some of these teams this year."  </P> <P> That's games, as in 15 points. Not matches. The NCAA ranked Dominguez Hills  sixth out of eight teams in the Southwest recently. Ahead of the Lady Toros  were the other five CCAA teams, including top-rated Riverside, which plays host  to Dominguez Hills on Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> This is a school that considers it a victory to win a game or two. In CCAA  play, Dominguez Hills won only one game last year and that came against Cal  State L.A., which, according to Fortner "has improved a lot this season over  last."  </P> <P> The Lady Toros have shown promise in two tournaments, however, taking single  games from defending national champion Bakersfield and Cal Poly Pomona, ranked  second in the region.  </P> <P> "We have a new attitude here," Fortner said. "Things are more positive, the  kids are stronger and they come from good, strong club backgrounds."  </P> <P> The near demise of volleyball at Dominguez Hills has been especially painful  for Fortner. In 1978, she coached the Lady Toros to their only conference  title. But a year later, after a 13-14 record, she became the coach at Loyola  Marymount. In 1986 the Lady Lions were champions of the West Coast Athletic  Conference and opened the playoffs with an upset victory over powerhouse UCLA.  </P> <P> Then Fortner, frustrated that Loyola would not give her a full-time teaching  position, walked away from volleyball altogether. She worked odd jobs and drove  a bus for a retirement home. When Coach Jennifer Gorecki resigned at Dominguez  Hills in 1988, Fortner returned to coaching.  </P> <P> In Fortner's absence, however, Dominguez Hills struggled. It has had only one  winning season since she left in 1979, a 15-14 mark in 1984. Going back to  1986, the team has lost 35 of 36 CCAA matches. You can count the number of  games the team has won on a single hand.  </P> <P> Down the line, however, Guerrero sees improvement.  </P> <P> "In two or three years, Nancy will have done the things necessary to make this  program more competitive," he said.  </P> <P> Fortner, hired in July of 1989, had no time to recruit players for last year's  team, so she took what she could get -- leftovers from a pair of teams that  lost 53 matches and some walk-on freshmen. Although Dominguez Hills was 7-22  overall, the number of victories was better than either of the two previous  seasons. A total of 23 team or individual records were broken in 1989.  </P> <P> Quite an accomplishment, points out Guerrero, for a team that was basically  thrown together.  </P> <P> However, sports information director Kevin Gilmore adds: "If you look at most  of our records against the records of other schools, our records don't even  come close."  </P> <P> Discrepancies in performances point out that even the best efforts in things  like kills, digs and aces at Dominguez Hills fall short of those of other  players in the CCAA. For example, the school record for most kills in a season  is only 205, an average of only four per match, although it has stood since  1983. The season record at Pomona, a middle-echelon team, is 486. The Dominguez  Hills record for blocked kills is 28. At Pomona it is 124.  </P> <P> Three marks have already been set this season and Fortner said more are on the  way.  </P> <P> Freshman setter Jeanna Price of Lake Elsinore has broken the school set assist  record twice. Sophomore hitter Gale Derricott of Riverside recently broke the  school record for match kills.  </P> <P> "Jeanna has a good work ethic. She has helped us get rid of that (losing)  attitude from the past," Fortner said.  </P> <P> According to Fortner, Derricott could develop into one of the top Division II  players in the nation.  </P> <P> "Her club team folded so she didn't get a lot of recognition," Fortner said.  "My timing in signing her was right. She was just overlooked by everyone else."  </P> <P> Sophomore hitter Angela Hamer, who missed most of last season after she was  injured in an auto accident, is the heart and soul of the team, according to  Fortner.  </P> <P> "She has good fighting spirit," Fortner said. "She's not afraid to attack or go  after any ball. She's our team leader."  </P> <P> Also playing well is sophomore Lourdes Estrada of Wilmington, a utility player  last season who has moved into the starting mid-hitter spot.  </P> <P> Six-foot Julie Berthiaume, who holds the school record for most blocked solos  in a match (5), is the only senior on the team. She has been rotated with  defensive specialist Michele Newman, a junior transfer from El Camino College.  Melissa Lynch, a junior transfer from Cerritos College, has started most of the  year at a hitter position.  </P> <P> Said Fortner: "Realistically, we won't be on top this year . . . But I hope  that in the next three or four years that at least we will be in the middle,  rather than on the bottom.  </P> <P> Guerrero is confident that will be the case. Anything Fortner does will be an  improvement over past performances, he said.  </P></p>

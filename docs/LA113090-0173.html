			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOYUZ TO LIFT OFF AFTER WORD FROM SPONSOR  </P> <P> A Soyuz rocket plastered with Japanese advertising was rolled into position  today to carry a Japanese broadcaster into space Sunday after a truce was  reached on money squabbles.  </P> <P> The Tokyo Broadcasting System, which is paying $10 million for the launch in a  contract with the Glavkosmos space agency, complained that the Soviets were  demanding huge sums of extra money for everything from spacesuits to $10,000 an  hour for Soviet cosmonauts to hold a video camera during the eight-day mission.  </P> <P> "It is not settled yet, but because the launch is so important to us and to the  Soviets, we have stopped the negotiations and will return to them later, after  the launch," said Ichiro Sasasi, a TBS executive.  </P> <P> By tradition, all Soviet rockets leave for the launch pad at 7 a.m., because  that is when Yuri Gagarin's Vostok rocket rolled out to make him the first man  in space on April 12, 1961.  </P> <P> And precisely at 7 a.m. today, the Soyuz rocket that will make Toyohiro Akiyamo  the first journalist in space left its assembly plant on a rail line leading to  launch pad No. 1.  </P> <P> Truck-mounted projector lights sliced through the morning darkness and lighted  up the Soyuz as some of about 150 Japanese journalists scrambled to the rail  bed to snap pictures of the booster emblazoned with advertisements for Sony,  Ohtsuka Chemicals and Unicharm, makers of women's hygiene products.  </P> <P> Akiyama, 48, will be accompanied to the Mir space station by two seasoned  Soviet cosmonauts -- Musa Manarov, a joint holder of the record of 366 days in  space, and Viktor Afanasiev.  </P> <P> Akiyama's backup, Rioko Kikuchi, 26, the TBS network's first female camera  operator, suffered appendicitis Monday and was operated on, increasing the  pressure on Akiyama to stay healthy.  </P></p>

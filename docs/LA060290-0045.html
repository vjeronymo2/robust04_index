			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRAZIL HANDLES U.S. IN WORLD VOLLEYBALL MATCH  </P> <P> It was the drums Bill Neville was worried about.  </P> <P> The coach of the U.S. men's national volleyball team had a surge of confidence  upon arrival in San Diego Wednesday. But his team had the worst record (1-9) in  the Federation Internationale de Volleyball World League.  </P> <P> Still, there was hope. Neville said his team showed a lot of improvement after  a sweep through Italy, France and Brazil, the countries that make up Pool A of  the league.  </P> <P> But the fans of the Brazilan team were a cause for concern. Their rowdiness  during earlier matches in Brazil, which included beating large drums, proved to  be distracting.  </P> <P> They left their drums at home for Friday night's match at the San Diego Sports  Arena, but the United States still lost to Brazil, 13-15, 15-9, 15-8, 15-6.  </P> <P> The United States also dropped matches to Brazil on May 25 in front of 15,200  in Brasilia and with a crowd of 17,150 on May 27 in Belo Horiozonte.  </P> <P> Neville said of the Brazilian fans:  </P> <P> "They are rabid," he said. "In timeouts my lips could have been pressed against  my players' ears and they still couldn't have heard me. A lot of them know  nothing about the game, they just come to make noise."  </P> <P> He had hoped the civility of the American fans would leave a bad taste in the  mouth -- and somehow rub off on the play -- of the visitors.  </P> <P> "This place will seem like a library to them."  </P> <P> Brazil didn't have to study the Americans very long.  </P> <P> An intense U.S. team came out fired up and hungry, winning the first game  behind the play of hitter Jon Root and setter Uvaldo Acosta.  </P> <P> "The first game we came out and played well," Neville said. "We started on a  positive note."  </P> <P> The momentum changed quickly. The U.S. appeared to miscommunicate on plays  often and got tricked with stuffed blocks at the net often.  </P> <P> "'Brazil turned it up a notch and we got into a finger-pointing mode," Neville  said. The setters started to pull back and get tentative and the hitters got  frustrated, and it all snowballed.  </P> <P> Brazil's brash and aggressive style was expected, but Neville said he had hoped  the U.S. could overcome it with organization and planning, the American style  of play.  </P> <P> It wasn't to be. The closest the U.S. got after the first game was closing a  13-5 deficit to 13-9 in the second game, but Brazil closed it out on another  stuffed blocked.  </P> <P> Root, who led the U.S. with 21 kills, was stuffed 11 times at the net.  </P> <P> "He's one of those guys who can get easily frustrated," Neville said. "He can  put a lot of pressure on the setters, but he's not good with a low set."  </P> <P> Brazil (8-3) is now tied with Italy for first in Pool A, and will meet the U.S.  (1-10) tonight at the Forum in Los Angeles at 7:30. The top two teams from Pool  A and Pool B will advance to the league championship tournament July 14-15 in  Osaka, Japan.  </P> <P> The United States was hurt by the absence of Mark Arnold, who had a 102 degree  temperature earlier in the day.  </P> <P> Leading Brazil was Alexendre Ramos, who finished with 15 kills.  </P> <P> "He did the best tonight," Brazil Coach Paulo Freitas said through an  interpreter. "He was the most important player and he had a sore ankle."  </P> <P> Ramos was the best on this night, but Brazil changes its lineup and positions  so often, one player never dominates, Freitas said.  </P> <P> "'Because we're so young," Freitas said, "they alter."  </P> <P> "I am worried," said Freitas. "It's difficult to win against the Americans."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sarlos Claims Centrum"] </F>   [Text] Canadian businessman Andrew Sarlos will arrive in  Hungary next week and, from what we have heard, he intends to  raise the 5-billion-forint [Ft] capital of the Centrum  Department Store Company by more than Ft2 billion.    The present visit by Sarlos, who represents a group of  Canadian investors, could have a special significance because an  agreement is expected to be reached within a few weeks between  the State Property Agency and the department store chain. As is  well known, the mbo [management buy-out] and mrp [worker share  program] organization is going to buy 51 percent of the shares  in the value of Ft2.5 billion.    The investors had several alternatives to come up with the  necessary amount. Of these, the leadership of the Centrum  mrp-mbo organization accepted a version which was familiar to  many people: They will take out a business loan in the amount of  Ft1.3 billion from the Bank of Commerce, and they intend to pay  for the remaining Ft1.2 billion with compensation vouchers and  cash. According to the present state of affairs, cash in the  amount of Ft420 million was collected, and the employees intend  to buy shares for compensation vouchers in the value of Ft756  million.    The employees can receive dividends only after the debt is  repaid, which, in an extreme case, can take as long as 18 years,  we learned from Gyula Galla, trade union secretary of the  Centrum Department Store Company. Since Hungarian law at the  present does not allow the payment of dividends as long as the  business has outstanding debts, Centrum will not be able to pay  dividends until it has paid back its loans. This means that  there is a chance that the approximately 4,000 employees who  will obtain property through privatization will have no access  to profit from the company's operation for 18 years. At the same  time, they cannot sell the company's shares as long as there is  a debt.    Galla emphasized that they do not plan to downsize in the  long run.</p>

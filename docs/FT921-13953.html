			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / International Company News: Dassault launches bid for Cessna DASSAULT Aviation, the French maker of business and military jets, has launched a bid for Cessna of the US, the world's leading supplier of medium-sized business jets. Dassault is not revealing the price of its offer for Cessna, which was put up for sale last October by General Dynamics, the US defence group, as part of its strategy of curbing debts and concentrating on core businesses. Analysts then valued Cessna at Dollars 600m-Dollars 900m, as against the Dollars 660m which General Dynamics paid for it in 1985. If accepted, the deal will mark Dassault's most ambitious step yet in its attempt to diversify away from the defence industry, where a squeeze on spending has moderated the outlook for the Rafale, a fighter bomber due to come into service from 1996. Mr Serge Dassault, the chairman, estimates that sales fell last year by 17 per cent, to FFr14.3bn (USDollars 2.6bn) from FFr17.1bn in 1990, said officials. This compares with estimates of roughly stable sales in the 1990 annual report. In addition, orders fell by 25 per cent last year to FFr12bn. The group will still be profitable in 1991, officials said. Dassault had made 'a precise offer, at a normal price, without a date limit,' said Mr Bruno Revellin-Falcoz, vice-president of the French group, of the Cessna bid. There could be a problem with the price, he hinted. Dassault's Falcon range and Cessna's Citation series are broadly complementary, even if the new Falcon 2000 medium-sized jet, due for sale in 1994, and the Citation X, due out in 1993, aim at a similar market. Dassault estimates it holds roughly a third of the world market for medium-sized and large business jets through its Falcon range. The aim is to lift business aviation to 35 per cent of sales over the next few years, to compensate for a fall in the share of military sales from 71 per cent, to 55 per cent, said a Dassault official. Cessna has an estimated 60 per cent of the world market for medium-sized business jets and is about the same size, in turnover terms, as Dassault's civil aviation division.</p>

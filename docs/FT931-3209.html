			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Yeltsin in call for aid to stave off 'threat' to reforms MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Rus-sian president, yesterday called for immediate and substantial western aid to stave off what he called 'the serious danger of reaction' in Russia. Mr Yeltsin, speaking at a joint news conference with French president Francois Mitterrand, said: 'There is a very, very serious threat hanging over democracy and reforms.' He said last week's session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's top legislature, showed that communist forces were intent on avenging their defeat in the 1991 coup attempt. Mr Mitterrand suggested Group of Seven leaders meet as soon as possible after Mr Yeltsin's summit with President Bill Clinton in Vancouver on April 4 to discuss Russia's problems. Mr Yeltsin added: 'We cannot wait for Tokyo in June or July. It may prove too late.' When asked if the west would continue its support for Mr Yeltsin if he introduced authoritarian measures, Mr Mitterrand said: 'If we must choose between camps in the country, then we will choose the camp which continues democratic and economic reform.' Mr Yeltsin had 'proposals to make to the Russian people and I am certain he will do so in a democratic way', he said. Mr Yeltsin has said he will hold a plebiscite next month. In doing so, he will directly challenge parliament, which has ruled such a move unconstitutional and has voted itself the powers to strip him of office. The French president said there were differing views among G7 countries on aid. France and Germany believed in the need for urgent action; Japan, by contrast, had so far refused to take part in a high-level G7 meeting before the heads of state conference in Tokyo in July. Mr Yeltsin also said there could be several changes in the cabinet of ministers. In the meantime, he has signed a decree expanding his cabinet to include central bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko, who has been accused of undermining economic reform with easy credits. But it was not clear whether this would strengthen Mr Yeltsin's grip on the central bank. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced it had signed a Dollars 43.8m technical co-operation loan to aid privatisation in Russia.

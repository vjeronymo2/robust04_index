			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUD SCANDALS UNCOVERED  </P> <P> I have been attempting to persuade HUD to change its policy concerning the  "County-wide Waiting List Rule." Local facilities are prohibited from marketing  vacant units to qualified seniors in the immediate area and must offer them  instead to seniors throughout the entire county.  </P> <P> Many seniors in east and south Los Angeles have turned down units in Valencia  because of its remote location, and despite newspaper ads, posters and flyers  in public facilities they still remain unoccupied.  </P> <P> Not only does this archaic practice affect the vacancy rate, require repeated  notification, costly processing and administration, it also results in a  precious loss of desperately needed space in subsidized units for the ones who  need it most -- our low-income elderly.  </P> <P> Repeated complaints to HUD have fallen on deaf ears because they are bound by a  higher authority in Washington. It's time to change this antiquated practice  and allow applicants the choice of first being placed in their local area.  </P> <P> JO ANNE DARCY  </P> <P> Mayor Pro-Tem  </P> <P> Santa Clarita  </P></p>

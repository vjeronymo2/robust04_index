			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: An end to the battle of forms - A H Hermann examines a set of terms to help standardise domestic and international trade contracts When businesses enter into contracts for the supply of goods, there are two dangers to avoid: either too little legal input, or too much of it and of the wrong type. The first danger looms whenever the deal is made by word of mouth or by a short letter, such as: 'Ship 100 units as last time'. If it comes to a dispute, it will be a veritable feast for lawyers, particularly when the contract is governed by a non-codified law, such as English law. The second danger, too much law of the wrong type, takes two forms. One is an antique, standard contract of the respective market, such as the charter party, about which the courts have been complaining in vain for 100 years, to which shipping lawyers retort: 'What would we do if it was all clear and certain?' The second form of too much law of the wrong type appears in the small print on the back of the form used by the other party for ordering goods or confirming orders. These sale or purchase 'conditions', often long and drafted in legalese which few businessmen have the patience to read, can sometimes be summed up in one sentence: 'We have all the rights and you have none.' A particularly nasty mess results if both parties use their own pre-printed forms, one for the order, the other for its confirmation. This can lead to a 'battle of forms', and when the forms differ substantially, the court may find that there is no contract at all. A set of International Trade Terms (Intraterms), produced at the Centre for Commercial Law Studies of the Queen Mary and Westfield College in the University of London, aims at avoiding, or at least substantially reducing these dangers as well as some new ones resulting from the adoption by 34 countries, including the UK's main trading partners, of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna Convention). Though designed primarily for application by reference to contracts for international sale of goods, Intraterms are equally suitable for domestic contracts with the exception of consumer sales. If used by both contracting parties, they can form the basis of a continuous trading relationship where individual deals are concluded over the telephone or by a short letter. Alternatively, they can be used selectively, for drafting a contract with the help of computer software supplied with the book which also contains a running commentary relating the terms to the national laws of the main trading nations and to the Vienna Con-vention. The Intraterms incorporate into a contract many of the improvements to English law which have been for some time advocated by English judges or academic lawyers. In the first place, they require interpretation and performance according to the principle of 'good faith and fair dealing', which in its generalised form is absent from English commercial law, but which, nonetheless, English commercial judges try to substitute by a variety of devices. That they do not always succeed is evidenced by the many judgments introduced with the ominous phrase: 'With the greatest regret, I must hold that . . .' While English courts are only slowly moving away from the 'parole rule' which excluded evidence of statements not contained in the written document, the Intraterms prefer an interpretation which makes the contract effective and the result reasonable and which takes negotiations preceding the conclusion of the contract into account. While English law treats the post office as the agent of the addressee, the Intraterms reduce his exposure by requiring the receipt of communications to be confirmed and limit the adverse consequences for the parties of delayed or distorted communications. English commercial law accepts that a change in circumstances may frustrate a contract but the success of such claims is very difficult to predict. Various theories enable the court to consider whether the parties made the bargain on the assumption that a particular state of things will continue to exist. The element of uncertainty is further increased by the assumption that in such cases the discharge of the contract occurs not by an act of the parties but by the operation of law. By contrast, Intraterms do not rely on an automatic operation of the law, but give the parties the possibility of discharging the contract by a notice if its purpose can no longer be achieved. The inclusion in the Intraterms of clearly defined rules concerning force majeure is of particular importance because such rules do not exist in English commercial law. Moreover, the Intraterms also provide detailed rules for a fair apportioning of loss caused by frustration of the contract or force majeure. No less important are rules assuring the survival of contracts which provide that 'price is to be agreed' and rules protecting the debtor who made an agreed part payment in full settlement from further claims. Both parties are assured contractual interest on overdue debts and the buyer is protected against the consequences of the House of Lords 1982 decision in 'The Chicuma' case where it was held that payment made on the agreed day to the creditor's bank was not made on time if the bank credited it, according to continental custom, with 'valuta next Monday'. The Intraterms are also aimed at protecting the seller against the anticipated insolvency of the buyer - an issue which, according to the law lord, Lord Mustill, has been exposed to almost every conceivable error by the courts and for which there are no generally accepted principles for the courts to follow. Other controversial or unclear issues with which the Intraterms deal are fundamental breach, reservation of title, passage of risk and claims against the carrier, the merchantability and fitness for purpose of goods, indirect damages, and buyers lien in prepaid but rejected goods. The chapter on resolution of disputes provides for alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and more flexible, faster and cheaper arbitration, in line with the thinking of the Department of Trade and Industry committee now considering this subject.

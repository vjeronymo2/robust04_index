			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] says  it will maintain its noninterference stance on internal matters  of other parties to the Liberian conflict. The NPFL says it  believes as the parties still exist in the transitional  government, it remains their prerogative to make positive moves  to achieve peace and reconciliation at all levels.    The NPFL is reacting to reported fears that the front and  other factions may object to changes in the composition of ULIMO  [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]  representatives to the Liberian National Transitional  Government. The NPFL says it has no objection whatsoever to any  change within the rank and file of a faction to stop the  bloodshed and bring about peace and unity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Precarious Start of the Administration Without </F> the Social Democratic Party of Japan"]    [Text] After the Hosokawa coalition cabinet's resignation  en masse, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign  minister and leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], was  nominated as the 51st prime minister of Japan.    However, the formation of the cabinet has been substantially  delayed, and the unexpected secession of the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition government has taken  place. This was the result of the SDPJ's strong protest over the  sudden materialization of the plan to form a large parliamentary  group to unify the coalition parties. Thus, the new  administration has set sail amid a raging storm.    The plan to form a large parliamentary group was proposed  repeatedly by Shinseito and Komeito even during the previous  administration. This time it was Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], who made the suggestion.  Apparently, the purpose is to form a group around Shinseito and  a group which is larger than the biggest ruling party, the SDPJ,  to consolidate the power base of the administration. This is  also linked to plans to form a new new party [shin shinto].    Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa will probably be the central figure  in the new parliamentary group. This ambush of the SDPJ  immediately after the election of the prime minister in the Diet  came after the attempted exclusion of the SDPJ to permit some  coalition parties to support Michio Watanabe's candidacy for the  premiership and after the recent meetings to reach a policy  accord.    SDPJ Diet members would rather not leave the coalition, and  they are also being enticed with the chance to become the "joint  candidate of the ruling parties" in the next general election to  be held under the single-seat constituency system. Therefore,  Ozawa and his associates were very confident about their plan.  <H5>  Added Momentum in the Realignment of the Political World </H5>   However, even supporters of the coalition in the SDPJ were  incensed by the series of arbitrary actions taken. The decision  to leave the coalition was a matter of course because the SDPJ  had had serious policy differences with the coalition in the  first place. The SDPJ is now expected to strengthen its  cooperation with Sakigake [Harbinger], which had left the  coalition earlier, and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is  also expected to make its own moves. Thus, the outlook for the  realignment of political parties remains volatile.    The Hata administration is expected to be Shinseito-led,  with  the chief cabinet secretary and other key cabinet ministers, in  addition to the prime minister, all coming from this party.    The new administration faces many difficult policy issues.  One urgent issue is to start deliberations on the FY 1994  budget. Solutions acceptable to the people are also needed on  the issues of an economic recovery, mending the stalled  Japan-U.S. economic relations, and tax reform. Work remains to  be done on deregulation, the decentralization of power,  information disclosure, and economic and administrative reforms  advocated by the previous administration.    How to deal with the DPRK (North Korea), with which  relations  have been shaken by its suspected development of nuclear arms,  is also a serious problem. The government has to act cautiously  on this issue and avoid creating unnecessarily a sense of crisis.    It is indeed difficult to expect strong leadership from  Prime  Minister Hata, who admits to "acting out the scenario written by  Ozawa" and who has always acceded to the bureaucrats' wishes.  While he probably intends to exercise political leadership  through "Shinseito's domination," the administration is expected  to be extremely unstable without the SDPJ's participation.    Ozawa and his group's tendency to adopt an arbitrary style  and methods is not unrelated to what is happening right now.  Hata, a coordinator type of personality, is said to have subtle  differences with Ozawa in terms of political style and the  concept of the state. He has, however, consistently gone along  with Ozawa in the end. This way of dealing with things leaves  serious concern when it comes to handling an issue such as the  Korean peninsula.    Even in Shinseito, which has relatively more experience as a  ruling party, there are no elder politicians who have served as  prime minister. It is, therefore, difficult to take advantage  of such people's profound political and diplomatic experience.  As a result, control of the bureaucrats will be weakened.    As for the other ruling parties, even the DSP has joined  Shinseito's bloc, as if forming an encirclement of the SDPJ.    The opposition LDP is also unhelpful. President Yohei Kono  is constantly on guard against Shinseito, and many LDP members  follow his political line. Thus, the party is unable to come up  with a viable rival political line. The present circumstances  may possibly trigger further splits in the LDP.  <H5>  The People Need To Keep a Close Watch </H5>   It goes without saying that only the people can truly check  on the political authorities. The citizens should watch and  reflect on the words and deeds of each party and faction  carefully in preparation for a possible dissolution of the Diet  and the ensuing general election.    The present political situation resembles the nebulous  postwar period, which experienced two coalition governments.  The current case may be even more volatile. If the Hata  administration is but a transition to a further principled  political reorganization, then all the commotion about the new  parliamentary group may still be meaningful.    The Hosokawa administration which was upholding political  reform was pulled down by the prime minister's own money  scandal. Hata, who is termed "Mr. Political Reform," should not  forget his original convictions. Although laws have been passed  on a reform of the political system, there is still a long way  to go in the purification of the political sector. If Prime  Minister Hata intends to exercise his own style of leadership,  he should champion the cause of political reform.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): A helping hand for horse-racing without picking the pockets of the punters - Betting Levy A ONE-THIRD increase in funds flowing to horse-racing from the betting levy should result from yesterday's budget, according to government officials. The change is an attempt to ease the problems of horse racing. General betting duty is being cut by from 8 to 7 3/4 per cent, at the same time as the racing industry's tax from the Horse-Race Betting Levy Scheme is to rise. The government is gambling that the effect of the two measures will leave the punter paying out the same amount - 10 per cent on stakes and from winnings - but that racing will get more money. The Home Office calculates that the levy will now yield about Pounds 48m up from Pounds 35.5m. The Jockey Club, the sports governing body, had asked for Pounds 50m. The money is dispersed throughout the sport but is spent principally on prize money and subsidies for racecourses. Mr Kenneth Baker, the Home Secretary, said yesterday that, assuming betting turnover of some Pounds 4.3bn, his scheme aimed to produce a total estimated levy yield of about Pounds 48m. 'I am satisfied that the bookmakers can make their levy payments under the scheme without any increase in their deductions from punters,' he said. Ladbroke, Britain's biggest bookmaker, said the reduction in betting duty was a step in the right direction, even though its own recommendations - to reduce the burden on gamblers, to boost betting turnover, and to increase the levy yield - had been different, however. Last year, the Commons home affairs committee noted the impact of the recession on horse-racing. 'The fat years are gone,' said the committee's report. Sir John Wheeler, the committee's Conservative chairman, said that higher contributions to racing should not be paid by small bookmakers, or by customers. 'We believe that the three big bookmaking firms can and should pay.' The industry generates Pounds 10bn a year and employs 150,000 people. The fillip comes at an opportune time because the Budget coincided with the start of the three-day National Hunt festival at Cheltenham.</p>

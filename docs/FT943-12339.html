			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Management (The Growing Business): The softly, softly approach - Alternative funding for fledgling companies To borrow money for small business expansion you must prove that you already have it. This fact was discovered by Denise Lane Quality Garments, a bridal gown manufacturer and industrial seamstress service in North Kesteven, Lincolnshire, when it approached an investment trust company for a business loan to expand to new premises. It was turned down because its turnover was below Pounds 500,000. 'Unfortunately, we are looking at Pounds 130,000 annual turnover now but if we get the second site we will increase to Pounds 500,000,' says co-owner 29-year-old Mark Faria. 'So we can't have the money to expand until we expand and get the money.' Faria and his partner, Denise Lane, have since been awarded a low-cost Pounds 5,000 loan from a local scheme sponsored by the North Kesteven District Council, the Lincoln Enterprise Agency, the South Lincolnshire Enterprise Agency and Midland Bank. They are using this money to buy industrial sewing machines but they still need Pounds 38,000 to complete their expansion plans. For many small businesses run by young owners and with turnovers under Pounds 500,000, financing the growth of the business can be as difficult as finding the money to start it. Banks and other corporate lenders are often reluctant to issue commercial loans to small businesses run by young people, even with viable proposals for future growth, because they are unable to provide sufficient capital or have few assets to offer as security. Youthful business owners are turning increasingly to alternative sources of funding. A number of soft loan schemes like the one which aided DL Quality Garments have sprung up around the country. Many of these schemes - lending organisations which offer finance to small businesses at either no interest or below market rate levels of interest - also lend money on no security or with generous repayment holidays. These lending organisations will look seriously at business plans rejected by the banks. 'We look at businesses that do not have enough security or a track record to interest a bank,' says John Petherbridge, director of the London Business Growth Fund, a loan scheme of Greater London Enterprise, a regional smaller-business development agency, for small companies that have been trading at least one year. The schemes do not want people to think they are just giving the money away to anyone with a half-baked idea. 'We see ourselves as hard on the business and soft on the terms of the loan,' says David Irwin, director of Project Northeast in Newcastle. 'We would take the same view as to whether a business is likely to succeed as a bank would.' Sponsors of soft loan funds are drawn from the public and private sectors, including the high-street banks. Many of the soft loan schemes now have enough cachet to help young business borrowers obtain traditional commercial finance in addition to soft loan funding. The Prince's Youth Business Trust, for example, which gives expansion loans of up to Pounds 5,000, has negotiated links with three high-street banks. It is developing a commercial loan scheme for its entrepreneurs with Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, National Westminster and TSB. Midland has also agreed to make expansion capital available to PYBT-sponsored proprietors through soft loan schemes which the bank supports. Many of the schemes provide training and advice to the business owners, and the kind of one-to-one advice that counsellors at these organisations offer is one of the reasons why banks have agreed to go into partnership with enterprise agencies and local councils to sponsor soft loan schemes. 'If a loan is approved the local enterprise agency can provide on-going help to the owner and reduce the chances of that business failing,' says Neil Harle, manager of business sector marketing for Midland Bank, which co-sponsors 30 soft loan schemes around the country. Advice is perhaps most crucial when the company is pursuing finance. A business plan has to be pitched correctly if a fledgling company is to solicit a loan successfully. It must also have a financial perspective, one that the banks will understand. Knowing the language of finance is one of the keys to a successful funding proposal.</p>

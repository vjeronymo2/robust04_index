It is expected that the position of some parties regarding this  matter will become clear today and tomorrow. Mennam reports:    [Mennam] The National Liberation Front [FLN] has been  holding  an emergency meeting in Hotel Aurassi since this morning. The  meeting is due to last for two days. The meeting was preceded  by a session of the political bureau to decide on the meeting's  agenda, which will focus on studying the general situation in  the country and the progress of the national dialogue. In this  context, the meeting is expected to make a decision on the FLN's  participation in the national conference which is due to be held  on 25-26 January. A further report on this morning's session  from the radio team in Hotel Aurassi:    [Correspondent] The FLN's Central Committee emergency  meeting  is being held this time amid circumstances characterized by the  gravity of the prevailing situation in the country at all  levels. In this context, FLN Secretary General Abdelhamid Mehri  dealt with the situation in his opening speech in which he  talked about his party's stance vis-a-vis the process of the  dialogue and the developments in the country since the  resignation of former President Bendjedid and the appointment of  what was described by Mehri as an effective authority to run the  transitional phase.    Mehri's statement included a critical view of the way the  dialogue has been handled and the way the Higher State Council  [HCE] has been running the country's affairs. In the opinion of  the FLN's leading official, the results reached have been  negative in all spheres. The HCE assumed the role of leading  the corrective [tashihiyah] movement and did not confine itself  to the limits of the presidential post, according to Mehri. It  sought to create better political parties, a better constitution  and, in a sense, to shape the political map that has been  created by the society. The result was that in place of what  has been removed there is a vacuum, and this has not been  replaced by anything better -- so much so that the authority is  about to lose channels of communication, leaving the opportunity  for the emergence of a lack of clarity in all the stances taken  with a view to resolving the crisis, in Mehri's opinion.    Generally, Mehri repeated to the FLN Central Committee his  previous statements regarding the absence of a debate on central  issues, such as ways of stopping the chain of violence. As far  as he is concerned the dialogue has focused on ways of dividing  up posts as a means of raising the issue of how to extend the  transitional phase. The logic applied by the FLN's leadership  to the process of the dialogue made the secretary general regard  the dialogue meetings as a series of meetings which were far  away from public debates among the various sides.    Mehri's perception moves toward a rejection of what he  termed  as bearing responsibility for disinforming public opinion and  officials. He added that his party cannot say that the dialogue  has succeeded while thousands of families are experiencing  helplessness and hunger, and, furthermore, the people have  become afraid of the state.    We have noted the absence of former Prime Minister Mouloud  Hamrouche and the participation of other traditional members of  the FLN in the meeting.    Regarding participating in or boycotting the national  conference, the dominant view among members is that there is a  possibility that the Central Committee will recommend the  political bureau to make the FLN's final decision.

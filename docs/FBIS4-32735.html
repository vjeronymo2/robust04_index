			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Michele Kayal: "Slovakia Tries To Repackage </F> Itself To Impress International Investors"]    [Text] Caught in a tense game of political beat-the-clock,  Slovakia's new leaders are jetting around the world, pitching  the country to business people, and juggling laws to line up as  many foreign investors as possible before September's elections.    The new government, which took power in mid-March after a  vote of no-confidence toppled former Prime Minister Vladimir  Meciar, has made attracting foreign investment one of its main  goals. Success here could mean success at the polls and,  ultimately, success for Slovakia's ailing economy.    "The long-term goal is to bring our factories up to world  standards, to make our products more acceptable," said Fred  Nicholson, adviser to Slovakia's privatization minister. "And  without foreign investment, it would be very hard to get our  economy going."    Leaders admit that they can only begin the economic  turnaround process before facing the possibility of being voted  out of office in the fall. But they hope that they can make some  permanent changes in the country's economic profile.    Spearheading a worldwide whistle-stop campaign by Slovak  politicians, Prime Minister Josef Moravcik told the National  Council of French Employers in Paris last week that his country  was safe territory for Western investors. Moravcik's economics  minister, Peter Magvasi, traveled with him and put out the word  that more than half of the Slovak companies to be privatized in  the next round are earmarked for foreign investors.    On the same day, Slovak President Michal Kovac praised his  country's 1993 economic results to an Austrian business group in  Vienna and promised investors substantial tax breaks. At the end  of May, he will make the same pitch in Switzerland, but there he  will add "more concrete details" about how investors can get  involved, said presidential spokeswoman Anna Turenicova. In  June, Kovac will cross the Atlantic with a message for American  business.    Slovakia has long been the orphan child of the Visegrad  nations. Of the $8.8 billion in foreign direct investment  received by Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia  since 1989, only $366 million--or 4 percent of the total--has  found its way to Bratislava. The country offers the cheapest  labor force in the region, but its political instability and the  Meciar government's hostile attitude toward privatization has  scared off many would-be business partners.    Roughly 300 enterprises worth 220 billion SK ($7.7 billion)  will be privatized in the next round, privatization adviser  Nicholson said. About 80 billion SK ($2.8 billion) worth of  shares have been set aside for coupon privatization, and the  remainder will be for sale.    "Foreigners are more than welcome," Nicholson said.    Nearly three-quarters of the companies being considered are  heavy industrial concerns, such as steel mills, chemical plants,  rubber manufacturers and the entire Slovak electric company.  Nicholson said sales could begin as early as June. Only about 15  percent of the Slovak economy is currently in private hands, and  Nicholson said the goal is to unload 60 percent by the end of  this round.    The Slovak National Agency for Foreign Investment and  Development, an investor liaison organization, is blanketing  embassies and governments around the world with promotional  materials. Politicians are drafting laws to eliminate double  taxation and offer extensive tax breaks. Legislation protecting  investments already has been prepared and should be debated in  parliament's next session.    Brigita Schmognerova, deputy prime minister for economic  affairs, currently is in the process of trying to streamline the  bureaucracy by cutting back on the number of hoops investors  must jump through and by locating all the responsible people in  a single office.    "We're trying to make it easier," she confirmed.    Schmognerova said the strategy also includes landing the  support of international financial institutions, such as the  International Finance Corp. and the International Monetary Fund.  Slovakia and the IMF are in the final stages of negotiating a  "standby loan," an expression of the fund's confidence in the  country's economy. Schmognerova has also been lobbying business  people from other countries, inviting them to visit before the  elections.    The government's aggressive methods are already showing some  success. A mission from the American Overseas Private Investment  Corp. will arrive in mid-June, and another American delegation  is expected in July, Schmognerova said.    The number of tenders from abroad for Slovak companies has  risen considerably over the last two months, according to  several privatization and economics officials. And Nicholson  said he receives five or six inquiries from foreign investors  every day. "The ministry is trying to come forward to these  people, which didn't happen before," he said. "The word is out  that we want to do this."    Nicholson said he estimates that nearly half of the  inquiries  have come from Americans. Sweden, Germany and Austria have also  figured prominently, and Nicholson said he expects more interest  from the French after Moravcik's visit.    But financial consultants say that while the changes are  encouraging, most investors are moving with caution. "The  presence of the elections really means everyone is adopting a  wait-and-see attitude," said Geoff Upton, a partner at Price  Waterhouse in Prague. "If [the new government's] campaign  requires specific investments before the elections, they may be  disappointed."    Schmognerova said she and her colleagues feel that the work  they are doing now will pay off, with or without a victory at  the polls. "We really do have a long-term interest in developing  the country," she said. "Even if [the current government falls  in September], some of the investors will decide to come anyway."</p>

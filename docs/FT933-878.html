			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: Looking for signs of a Japanese upturn - Economics NEW light may be shed during the week on the degree to which the Japanese economy is getting back into gear following the long spell of sluggishness. Those looking for the country to help propel the world economy into a phase of sustained expansion by the mid 1990s will be hoping for a reasonably positive number tomorrow when the Japanese government releases latest estimates of the year on year change in retail sales in August. However on the back of estimates by international economists, the retail data will be less than encouraging, showing a 3.8 per cent year on year drop after one of 5 per cent in July. Other data from Japan will provide the latest details of consumer price inflation and industrial production. In the US, revised second quarter gross domestic product data on Wednesday, August personal income and consumption figures on Thursday and leading indicators on Friday will be monitored. The financial markets will also be looking out for news from the International Monetary Fund annual meeting in Washington. The gatherings may provide some indications of the latest progress or lack of it in talks on freeing global trade and also on how Europe should try to re-create some degree of exchange rate stability after the fiasco of the virtual breakdown of the exchange rate mechanism. In the UK, there will be no significant economic data. Attention will focus on Wednesday's auction of Pounds 3.25bn of 11-year gilts required to help finance the 1993-94 Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. The price of the stock sold in the auction will indicate to what degree overseas institutions continue their recent fairly strong support for gilt purchases. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is showing signs of wanting to listen to the business world for advice on economic strategy. So the publication this week of reports by the Institute of Directors and Confederation of British Industry on what they want to see in the chancellor's budget strategy will attract more than the unusual amount of attention. Finally, today sees the publication of the latest report on what to expect in the German economy from the respected economics group IFO. The main events of the week are as follows. Median market forecasts from the financial information company MMS International are in brackets. Today: US, International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington until Thursday; US August home sales. Germany, business climate report by IFO economics institute.

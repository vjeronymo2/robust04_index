			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, April 11 (AFP) -- Delegates of Sudan's  southern rebel movement fighting the Khartoum government held  their first conference since the group's creation in 1983, rebel  sources said here Monday.    More than 500 delegates of the Sudan People's Liberation  Army  (SPLA) and its political wing, the Sudan People's Liberation  Movement (SPLM), participated in the convention, which was held  in southern Sudan and ended Friday, the sources said.    SPLA leader Colonel John Garang attended.    The conference was called in a bid to reinforce Garang's  authority in the face of an internal power struggle with  SPLA-United, a breakaway faction formed in 1991 and led by one  of his former aides, Riek Machar.    The sources said the conference's resolutions would be  published in the next few days.    They added that one of the meeting's objectives was to  modify  the SPLA charter, which stipulates that the rebels are fighting  for a share of power within a united Sudan.    The movement has in recent years shifted towards a  separatist  stance favouring a division of Sudan into two independent states  -- a Moslem north and a Christian south.    The SPLA and the Sudanese Government held brief and  inconclusive talks last month in Nairobi within the framework of  wider peace negotiations brokered by the regional  Inter-Governmental Authority and Drought and Development, which  comprises representatives from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and  Uganda.    The negotiations are scheduled to resume mid-May.</p>

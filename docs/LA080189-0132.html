			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> More than 50,000 rock fans celebrated the final day of a congress of  Mozambique's ruling party Sunday in Maputo's National Stadium with British  rocker Eric Clapton. Clapton, heading a bill that included artists from Zaire  and South Africa, kept the crowd on its feet while police and soldiers in  fatigues patrolled the perimeter of the stadium. Scores of white South  Africans, international aid workers and foreign embassy officials also attended  the concert, which was a stop on the final leg of Clapton's Southern Africa  tour. Observers said the crowd surpassed the turnout in September for Pope John  Paul II. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian Seimas [parliament] National  Security Committee has adopted a decision banning any commercial  activities at the Ministries of National Defense and the  Interior, except in cases subject to law.    This decision was prompted by the proceedings on the  purchase  of arms for the National Defense Ministry from Russia instituted  by the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office. With the  investigation underway, searches were carried out at the  apartments of former Defense Minister Audrius Butkevicius and  other top ministry officials.    Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas National  Security Committee, has stated at a press conference that as  long as the ministries themselves engage in arms purchases,  corruption will not be prevented. The National Security  Committee is working on a draft law under which relevant offices  will be supplied with arms by a special institution -- the  Lithuanian Arms Fund.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (CNS) -- A survey shows that the  number of millionaire enterprises has considerably increased in  the mainland.    A sample survey of 1,432 privately-run enterprises has  revealed that four percent of such enterprises, each with  registered capital of over RMB 1 million at the very beginning  of their business and those with registered capital of over RMB  1 million, grew to become 23.8 percent of the total number by  late 1992. The actual involvement of capital, put at more than  RMB 1 million, made up 33.7 percent of the total, a phenomenon  showing a rapid gain of assets owned by privately-operated  enterprises.    Dramatic changes have been seen in recent years in the  privately-owned business sector and limited liability companies  have grown quickly in number. The survey indicated that by late  June in 1993 there were 41,549 individual limited liability  companies, accounting for 23 percent of the total number of  privately-run enterprises, or a rise of 380 percent over the  same period in the year before.    The pattern of privately-run enterprises has tended to be  reasonable with involvement in the high technology industry.  The survey revealed that the number of individual enterprises  specializing in science and technology consultation rose from  1,209 by late June, 1992 to 3,871 by June, 1993.    There were 184,000 privately-owned enterprises by late June,  1993, 66 percent up over the same period in the previous year  with employment of 2.94 million workers, a rise of 57 percent  while the registered capital was put at RMB 45.2 billion, 200  percent up over the year before.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CHAMBER GROUP SALUTES LUIGI NONO  </P> <P> In 1976, Luigi Nono wrote a funereal work prompted by a series of deaths that  had swept his family and that of his friend, pianist Maurizio Pollini. Thursday  night, at Salmon Recital Hall on the campus of Chapman College, the Southwest  Chamber Music Society offered ". . . sofferte onde serene . . ." as a tribute  to its composer, who died last May.  </P> <P> According to the artistic director of the society, Jeff von der Schmidt, the  piece -- for piano and prepared tape -- invokes church bells ringing throughout  Venice. The live piano part typically exploits a single range at a time,  occasionally two very separate sections of the keyboard, while tape and piano  mingle as expansions of one another.  </P> <P> In the capable hands of pianist Gloria Cheng, accompanied by a tape of Pollini,  ". . . sorrowful yet serene waves . . ." emerged as a series of clusters slowly  evolving in nervous rhythms. Cheng's minute exploration of the sonic and  rhythmic possibilities of her instrument demanded and received an attentive  hush for its full 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Beethoven's Sonata for piano and cello, Opus 102, No. 2, and his "Ghost" Trio  flanked the contemporary work. Both gave ample opportunity to their  protagonists -- violinist Peter Marsh, cellist Richard Treat and pianist Cheng  -- to wring out every drop of Angst appropriate to this program.  </P> <P> The trio, in particular, thrived amidst a larger-than-life conception marked by  pristine rhythmic precision and lean, pointed tone. Opening movements of each  opus commanded an exciting sense of competition.  </P> <P> Ensemble members paid rapt attention to one another, indulging in relentlessly  intense soul-searching for the Largo of the trio, charging forward through  dynamically shaped phrases propelled by emphatic accents in the Presto.  </P> <P> Only in the Adagio of the cello sonata did ensemble seem less than flawless.  Here, much of the repartee between the duo passed unnoticed, though,  individually, the players remained involved and absorbing. SUSAN BLISS  </P></p>

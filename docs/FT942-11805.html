			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Treasury's undignified retreat Sir, The UK government's cultural bankruptcy and moral impoverishment is surely complete with the announcement that the Treasury is to sell up and beat an undignified retreat from the corridors of power ('Treasury mandarins' cost controls strike home', April 29, 'Des res for buyer with Pounds 60m', April 30). The contrast with the Foreign Office could not be more complete. The FO stiffened its lips, tightened its belt, and produced what must be one of the most magnificent and uplifting restorations of government buildings at home or overseas, demonstrating yet again its knowledge of the way the wider world really works. By all means let the Treasury mandarins send themselves and their servants off to the Lubyankas of Croydon or Docklands - many would claim they deserved no less; but hand the buildings over to some more worthy department that understands their worth. Brian Gill, 261 Grove Street, Deptford Wharf, London SE8 3PZ</p>

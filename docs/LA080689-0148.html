			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: DORSETT, 35, MAY BE THROUGH AFTER HAVING MAJOR KNEE SURGERY  </P> <P> Tony Dorsett of the Denver Broncos, the National Football League's No. 2  all-time rusher, underwent major reconstructive knee surgery Saturday, leaving  his football future in jeopardy.  </P> <P> Dorsett, 35, injured his left knee Thursday in a non-contact passing drill. He  suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament, a torn lateral cartilage and a  partial tear of the medial collateral ligament.  </P> <P> Dorsett, who spent 11 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before going to Denver  last season, will miss the entire season -- which he said earlier would be his  last. No announcement was made about his plans after the surgery.  </P> <P> Also Saturday, the Pittsburgh Post-Dispatch reported that in an uncorrected  proof of his autobiography, "Running Tough," Dorsett said he was represented by  three agents while enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> The report said "the events decribed would appear to violate NCAA rules dealing  with extra benefits and agents, although the statute of limitations has  expired."  </P></p>

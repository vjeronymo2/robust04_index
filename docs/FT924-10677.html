			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Danish train order for Germany DSB, DENMARK'S state railway company, has placed an initial DKr600m (Pounds 61.7m) order with Linke-Hoffman-Busch/Siemens, a German consortium, for eight trains for the Copenhagen suburban network. The consortium now appears likely to provide trains for the whole DKr8bn order for the network. The opposition Social Democrats had argued the contracts should go to Denmark's ABB Skandia. But yesterday, the opposition agreed it would be unable to stop DSB giving the order to LHB/Siemens without breaking EC public tendering law. The first trains are to be delivered in 1995. By 1997, DSB will decide whether to order 120 trains, worth DKr8bn. The German trains are lighter than ABB Skandia's. DSB says trains supplied by the German consortium would be more fuel-efficient than Skandia's. But Skandia claims the choice of new technology in the German trains means the consortium may be unable to deliver on time.</p>

Tertiary industry, including transportation, posts and  telecommunications, commerce, the catering business, the supply  and marketing of materials and financial as well as insurance  business tended to go further. The added value in this sector  was 57.207 billion renminbi for the whole year, a rise of 13.2  percent over the year before. This added value in tertiary  industry made up 37.9 percent of the GNP.    The municipality saw massive construction of infrastructural  facilities in the urban area last year when improvements to  urban road traffic facilities were given priority. Year-round  spending on roads, electricity, gas, supply and drainage of  water, and posts and telecommunications services was 16.419  billion renminbi, an increase of 94.7 percent over the previous  year.

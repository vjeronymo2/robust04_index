			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UN chief to warn Nato on troops MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, is expected to tell Mr Manfred Worner, the secretary general of Nato, that the UN will be unable to provide the estimated 40,000 additional peacekeepers needed to enforce any Bosnia settlement because of lack of funds. Mr Boutros Ghali will meet Mr Worner in Geneva next Monday, when talks between the warring parties are scheduled to resume. Mr Boutros Ghali has already given this message to Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, his representative in the peace talks. Also, the secretary general believes the proposed number would be unacceptable to the UN Security Council, although it is substantially lower than the 50,000-75,000 troops envisaged in an earlier, now defunct, plan drafted by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. Addressing an emergency meeting of the budgetary committee last night, the secretary general spoke of a 'grave financial crisis' in which the UN was 'living from hand to mouth'. While costs ran at Dollars 310m a month, only seven of the 184 members had fully paid their dues and reserves were totally depleted. There was enough cash in hand only for the next two weeks, after which all UN operations would be in jeopardy.</p>

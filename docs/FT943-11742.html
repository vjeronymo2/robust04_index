			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Exchange-traded currency products 'face slowdown' - Derivatives 'There is little potential for success of new exchange-traded currency futures, options on futures, or direct options on currencies, particularly on exchanges other than the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's dominant currency futures exchange.' This is the conclusion of a recent study by Professor S. Craig Pirrong of the University of Michigan School of Business Administration. The study, 'Prerequisites for success of currency derivatives', was commissioned and distributed by the Catalyst Institute, a midwestern think-tank that is backed by contributions from, among others, the CME. Despite its Chicago-centric bias, Prof Pirrong's study usefully points out that two decades of explosive growth of exchange-traded currency derivatives has now slowed appreciably, and that the introduction of new currency contracts on the world's futures and options exchanges frequently fail. Meanwhile, volume in underlying cash markets (worldwide foreign exchange turnover is estimated at Dollars 1,000bn daily) continues to grow, and the use of off-exchange derivatives, like swaps and over-the-counter options by Forex traders is flourishing. A successful new exchange-listed contract, the study concludes, must have acceptable liquidity levels and low transaction costs. The best contracts, he says, are 'natural monopolies' that focus trading and liquidity in one market. The study is interesting because two exchanges are engaged in a cross-Atlantic struggle for market share in the same currency options products. Matif, France's futures exchange, launched US dollar/French franc and US dollar/D-Mark options in May, and after two months of dealing, have kept the contracts viable. Its primary competition is the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which prior to the Matif's challenge, was the only exchange in the world that did a flourishing business in options on foreign currencies. Much of the PHLX's business comes from France and other parts of Europe, making the exchange much better known abroad than it is at home. The CME trades options on currency futures rather the currencies themselves, and unlike the PHLX, its currency options and futures volumes have been eroding this year. To remain competitive the PHLX keeps its markets open late into the night and early in the morning to serve customers in the European time zone. The PHLX established its currency options business long before the Matif became a strong financial centre, and managed to defend its market share against a challenge from London's Liffe in the 1980s. Liffe has since delisted its currency options contracts. In launching their own challenge, Matif officials reasoned it was time to bring some of the currency dealings done by French banks in Philadelphia back to Paris. So far, they have attracted a respectable amount of trading, while doing little damage to the much larger PHLX market. During June, the first full month of trading, Matif currency options traded more than 70,000 contracts, with open interest, which reflects positions held longer than one day, rising steadily to more than 23,000 contracts. Activity in D-Mark options outpaced French franc turnover by about five to one. Volume continued to grow during July, with D-Mark options turnover at 78,000 contracts by the 14th trading day of the month, and franc options turnover at 6,564. PHLX, in contrast, traded more than 1.6m options contracts in 10 different currencies and crosses during June. That included a 1m French franc options that were mostly traded in the last week of the month. The PHLX regularly trades more than 300,000 D-Mark options per month. And if Matif business grew in July, the PHLX's flourished. On July 12, when global foreign exchange markets hiccuped, the Philadelphia exchange had a record single-day turnover of 278,764. Mr Randy Kelsey, an assistant vice-president at Cargill Investors Services, a brokerage house that is a member of both the Matif and PHLX says that the new Matif options have done remarkably well given the stiff competition from PHLX and the scepticism that greeted the Paris contracts. 'To date I don't see a loser in this. Its a big plus if the Matif can sustain the business,' says Mr Kelsey.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "State Brings in New Law for Legal </F> Eagles"]    [Text] The State is bringing in a new system to improve  the management of lawyers and increase their role in the  country's development, a top legal official said yesterday.    It will reduce the part the central government plays in  their  business and leave them to be managed by bar associations, said  Justice Vice-Minister Zhang Geng.    And the move will give lawyers more freedom to open up  businesses and offer the public better services, Zhang told a  council meeting of the All China Lawyers' Association (ACLA).    Bar associations will handle lawyers' registration, training  and exchanges and protect their legal rights. This will divorce  them from the decades-old system under which they served as  government employees and were assigned work by judicial  administrations.    The new system will make judicial organs responsible for  approving law offices and mapping out official policies, Zhang  said.    Work to introduce bar associations began several years ago,  leading to the establishment of the ACLA, and 29 provincial  associations.    The change was necessary as China switched to the socialist  market economy, said Zhang.    For lawyers and law offices would have to serve as counsel  for the government, enterprises and individuals.    And more and more lawyers and law firms would be needed as  the economy continued to develop.    Last year, 20,000 lawyers began practising and 900 law  offices were setup -- rises 46.3 percent and 22.8 percent  respectively from 1992. At the end of last year there were  66,700 lawyers in 51,000 offices.    Zhang called on Chinese attorneys to learn laws and  regulations thoroughly, and master the theory of the market  economy to serve their clients better.</p>

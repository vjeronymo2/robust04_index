			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERSHISER FACES LONG ROAD BACK TO MOUND;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: HE IS FINISHED FOR SEASON AND HIS FUTURE IS CLOUDED. JOBE SAYS  SHOULDER INJURY CAME FROM PITCHING TOO MANY INNINGS.  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser's 1990 season ended and his baseball future was placed in doubt  Friday when doctors, finding major damage, reconstructed the major ligament  structure in his right shoulder.  </P> <P> "We found more damage than was evident on the MRI exam," said Dr. Frank Jobe,  referring to the Magnetic Resonancy Image examination, which revealed  Hershiser's problem Thursday. "The decision was mandatory to reconstruct."  </P> <P> In a 3 1/2-hour procedure at Inglewood's Centinela Hospital Medical Center,  three surgeons reconstructed a torn anterior labrum and anterior capsule, a  structure that keeps the shoulder stable.  </P> <P> Jobe said some parts of the shoulder were in such bad shape, "It was as if  somebody had pounded them with a hammer."  </P> <P> The procedure has never been performed on a major league pitcher, and Hershiser  has been ordered not to throw a ball for four months, nor pitch competitively  until next season. Jobe said it will take even longer for Hershiser to regain  the form that enabled him to win the Cy Young Award in 1988.  </P> <P> "A year is required before he can return to a game," Jobe said. "But it will  take longer than that for the shoulder to reach its maximum ability."  </P> <P> Hershiser, whose career record is 99-65 with a 2.71 earned-run average, had not  missed a start in his seven-year career, a span of 195 starts. He has led the  National League in innings pitched each of the last three seasons, pitching 788  1/3 regular-season innings over that time.  </P> <P> But Jobe said the stress of those innings resulted in his problems.  </P> <P> "Pitching a lot was his problem," Jobe said. "After a while, there is a limit  to what people can tolerate. It may have been better not to pitch so much. But  sometimes, I guess, the team needed him to do things (the shoulder) really  didn't want him to do."  </P> <P> With those innings, an uncomplaining Hershiser has helped the Dodgers to two  West Division titles and a World Series championship.  </P> <P> "I think it shows how well we take care of our pitchers that he lasted as long  as he did," trainer Bill Buhler said. "I don't see how we can be any more  conservative than we were."  </P> <P> Said Manager Tom Lasorda: "It's like watching a tire and trying to guess when  it's going to blow. If Orel or anybody ever told me their arm was hurting, I  would take them out of the game immediately. If anybody says a lot of innings  can hurt somebody, I would ask them to look at Nolan Ryan.  </P> <P> "Each person is different and, unless somebody tells me they are hurting, it is  impossible for me to guess."  </P> <P> Pitcher Mike Morgan added: "They do more stuff to help pitchers here than any  place I've been. I think it goes to show, when your arm is ready to go, it  goes, no matter what. I want to pitch until I drop, and I know a lot of guys  feel that way."  </P> <P> Jobe said the factors exist for Hershiser eventually to pitch normally.  </P> <P> "I know Orel will get his full range of motion back and his strength back and  his rhythm back," Jobe said. "So the principals are all good. We think he can  pitch again. . . . We just don't have any precedent to base it on."  </P> <P> Jobe said the operation has been performed on minor league pitchers, none of  whom have made the major leagues.  </P> <P> The procedure, which Jobe said will leave Hershiser with a 4 1/2-inch scar near  his armpit, involves using new, smaller instruments to bypass the muscle and  operate directly on the ligaments. Jobe said Hershiser had to accept the  procedure, because to operate on the muscle would have ended his career.  </P> <P> "I guess the question is, why do this new procedure on a major league pitcher  if it's never been done before?" Jobe said. "Well, the alternative was to do an  operation we have done for 50 years that had a 100% failure rate.  </P> <P> "We can't promise success here, but we really think we got it all. We really  think this gave us a good chance."  </P> <P> Jobe said Fernando Valenzuela may have required the same surgery during his  shoulder problems of 1988, but said Valenzuela refused even to undergo an MRI  exam to determine the damage.  </P> <P> "He chose to go the rehabilitation route, which is fine and seems to have  worked out OK," Jobe said.  </P> <P> At least one Dodger is wondering if Hershiser has second thoughts.  </P> <P> "I'm sure there are a lot of things Orel is thinking about, maybe about some of  the times he stayed in a game," said Tim Belcher, who referred to his own  performance of Thursday, during which he allowed St. Louis six runs in 6 1/3  innings that included a three-run homer by Pedro Guerrero after walking two  batters in the seventh.  </P> <P> "I know I'm thinking about it from Thursday night," Belcher said. "I walk two  batters in the seventh inning and red flags are going up all over the stadium.  But no way am I going to put up that white flag myself. When we get  competitive, we get stupid. No way would I ask to come out of that game.  </P> <P> "Looking back, maybe I should have told Perry (pitching coach Ron Perranoski),  'I've got to get out of here.' But it's so hard to say that. I think restraint  has to exercised by somebody independent of the athlete himself."  </P></p>

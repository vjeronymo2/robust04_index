After the meeting, Qian Qichen and Christopher told  reporters  that the meeting was "positive" and "constructive."    At the talks, the two foreign ministers said that although  the international situation has changed dramatically, they  believed China and the United States are important and  influential countries in the world.

The two sides agreed that Chinese  Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu will hold official talks with  U.S. Under Secretary of State Davis on 26 January in Washington;  that U.S. Under Secretary of State Tarnoff will visit China in  the near future for continued political consultation. Moreover,  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck will soon make a  visit to China.    Qian Qichen handed to Christopher a letter from President  Jiang Zemin to President Clinton. Qian Qichen reiterated an  invitation for Christopher to visit China, to which Christopher  expressed appreciation, noting that he was looking forward to  visiting China at an appropriate time.    Present at today's meeting were Vice Foreign Minister Liu  Huaqiu and U.S. Assistant Secretaries of State Lord and  Shattuck.

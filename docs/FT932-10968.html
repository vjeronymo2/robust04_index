			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: Local hero in a pariah state THE WARM welcome accorded Mr Asil Nadir on arrival in his native Cyprus should cause no surprise. He was, until his arrest two years ago, the most successful Turkish Cypriot outside the island and the main private backer of the ruling party in the Turkish-controlled north. This fact might be thought embarrassing now that he is a fugitive, but most Turks, and especially most Turkish Cypriots, are more than willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, assuming him to be the victim of British prejudice and Greek machinations. To Mr Rauf Denktash, president of the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Mr Nadir's arrival may even seem like a diplomatic windfall. He may feel inclined to tell the British authorities that, while he would love to help, the fact that Britain does not recognise his republic makes matters extraordinarily difficult. Britain recognises Mr Denktash as leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, and indeed as vice-president of the Cyprus Republic (a title he no longer uses). But, along with the rest of the international community - with the important exception of Turkey - it recognises only one state and one government in Cyprus, the one elected by the Greek Cypriot majority and now headed by President Glafkos Clerides. The Turks have argued ever since 1963, when the late President Makarios unilaterally amended the constitution in order to override their veto, that the government is no longer legitimate and represents the Greek population only. In 1974 Turkey intervened in response to a coup against Archbishop Makarios by mainland Greek officers, seizing the northern two fifths of the island and regrouping the Turkish Cypriot population there, while the Greek inhabitants fled to the south. The de facto partition has remained ever since, with a UN force policing the line between the two zones. Mr Denktash, always heavily dependent on mainland Turkish support, proclaimed the TRNC at a moment of flux in Turkish politics in November 1983, when President Turgut Ozal had just won his first general election and was about to become prime minister. Mr Nadir later became a close ally of Mr Ozal, backing him through the newspapers he owned (when other Turkish papers were almost unanimously hostile) and lending money to his son. It was widely assumed that Mr Ozal returned the favour by pledging continued support for Mr Denktash. But the Turkish foreign ministry regarded Mr Ozal as dangerously soft on the Cyprus issue, especially in 1988 when he appeared close to doing a deal with Mr Andreas Papandreou, the then Greek prime minister. More recently, since Mr Nadir's fall, Mr Ozal broke a taboo by referring publicly to the cost of supporting northern Cyprus for the Turkish exchequer. For his part, Mr Suleyman Demirel, the present Turkish prime minister and now the leading candidate to replace the late Mr Ozal, has rebuked Mr Denktash for claiming that a quarrel with his prime minister, Mr Dervish Eroglu, prevented him from negotiating a solution with the Greek Cypriots. Mr Demirel even pointed out that the total population of northern Cyprus is less than that of a small provincial town in mainland Turkey. Only this week, however, Mr Denktash, who had threatened to resign as negotiator unless the Turkish-Cypriot parliament reaffirmed its faith in him, obtained a parliamentary resolution in support of the UN-sponsored peace talks and himself as negotiator.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from UN Headquarters] </F>   [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is visiting  New York, held consecutive individual contacts with  representatives of the permanent member states of the UN  Security Council [SC] on 6 June to discuss cooperation on  sanction measures on North Korea.    Minister Han explained the ROK Government's position that  sanctions on North Korea are inevitable and exchanged views with  representatives of the UN Security Council permanent member  states regarding the objective, timing, and methods of  sanctions. Particularly, Minister Han reportedly asked for  cooperation in implementing sanctions on North Korea during his  meetings with Representatives Li Zhaoxing of the PRC and  Vorontsov of Russia.    A high-ranking official of the ROK mission to the United  Nations said that the UN Security Council is likely to adopt a  sanction resolution rather than a warning resolution and that  the United States will lead discussions on sanction measures  sometime this week.</p>

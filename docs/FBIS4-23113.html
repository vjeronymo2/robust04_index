			<p>SUMMARY                                              The Japanese Government continues to favor a cautious approach to  imposing sanctions against North Korea, preferring to resolve the  DPRK issue through negotiations if possible and to invoke  sanctions only gradually and in stages if negotiations fail.  However, some leaders of the ruling coalition and some government  officials appear to be arguing for a more forceful stance.  There  have also been signs in the Japanese press that the coalition is  trying to build a consensus around the necessity of supporting  sanctions, but its weak political position and opposition to  sanctions from the Social Democratic Party of Japan are  continuing to hinder this effort.                                       END SUMMARY     In their public statements on the DPRK nuclear issue over the  last week, Japanese Government leaders have continued to advocate  caution in imposing sanctions against Pyongyang for its failure  To allow full-scale inspection of its nuclear facilities by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  They have also  remained vague about what steps Japan would take to support any  sanctions imposed by the United Nations.     -- On 14 June, in comments on North Korea's withdrawal from the  IAEA to the Diet Upper House Budget Committee, Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata stated that Japan would continue to try to persuade  Pyongyang to agree to a negotiated settlement.  "We still have  hopes," he said in portions of his remarks broadcast on NHK  Television, "that they will open their doors to the international  community as soon as possible to eliminate suspicions about their  development of nuclear weapons."     -- The same day, Kyodo reported that Hata told President Clinton  during a telephone conversation that Japan would "take  responsible action within the bounds of our constitution" if the  United Nations voted sanctions against North Korea.  Hata and  other senior Japanese officials have been publicly reiterating  this vague and cautious formulation of Tokyo's position for a  number of months.     -- On 15 June, after a meeting with Prime Minister Hata on the  draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea that the United  States plans to submit to the UN Security Council, Chief Cabinet  Hiroshi Kumagai summarized the Japanese Government's position on  sanctions, stating that "Japan has been extremely cautious about  sanctions against North Korea.  Japan has maintained that  sanctions should not simply be a punishment for North Korea, but  should encourage North Korea to return to the starting point"  (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 16 June).     --  During talks in Seoul on 11 June, Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa and his ROK counterpart Han Sung-chu agreed that any  sanctions should be "gradual," according to a Kyodo report the  same day.  Kyodo also quoted Kakizawa as telling Han that Japan  "will make the utmost efforts within its Constitution" to support  any UN sanctions.     Domestic, Foreign Policy Concerns     Tokyo's caution is the result, in part, of several domestic and  foreign policy concerns.  Tokyo apparently believes that China is  unlikely to support a UN resolution imposing sanctions against  the DPRK, and that sanctions would be ineffective without support  from China.  In its July issue, the influential journal Bungei  Shunju published what it said was a top secret government report  on the DPRK situation prepared last November by an unidentified  government agency.  Examining the possible impact of sanctions  against Pyongyang, the report argued that "if the DPRK can  acquire vital goods such as oil and food from China . . .  economic sanctions cannot be expected to yield results."  It  concluded from this that "as long as China does not go along with  economic sanctions and show a cooperative response, economic  sanctions may be less effective."  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  reportedly told the Budget Committee of the Lower House of the  Diet on 3 June that the Security Council might not be able to  reach agreement on sanctions because China was likely to oppose  them.     In addition, the government appears to be worried that Koreans  living in Japan would provoke unrest and possibly engage in acts  of terrorism if Tokyo supports sanctions against Pyongyang.  The  top secret document published in the July Bungei Shunju described  at length the types of actions that the Chosen Soren (North  Korean Residents Association of Japan) might take if sanctions  were imposed.  These ranged from "furious protest activities at  Japanese Government organizations, UN agencies in Japan and the  U.S. Embassy;"  attacks on people in these installations; and  damage or destruction of property at these or "related  facilities" to "violent counterattacks" in reaction to criticism  of the DPRK and the Chosen Soren by the Japanese media and right-  wing organizations.     Divisions Within Government     As tension with Pyongyang has increased, some officials within  the coalition and within the government appear to be arguing that  Japan should take a stronger position on the issue of sanctions  to preserve its relationship with the United States and its  credibility in the international community.  During an interview  on Tokyo's FNN Television Network on 11 June,  Ichiro Ozawa,  Secretary General of the Shinseito, the largest and most  influential party in the ruling coalition, said that although the  international community should initially try to resolve the DPRK  nuclear issue through "dialogue," if this failed, "we will have  to take a firm stand."  He added that while sanctions should be  implemented "step by step," it was "very important" that Japan  take "action in the preliminary stages," even before sanctions  are imposed, to gradually discontinue monetary remittances and  trade with the DPRK.  He argued that Japan would "lose the trust  of the international community" if it failed to do so.  He also  asserted that the Japanese Constitution would not prevent Japan  from either stopping remittances to the DPRK--which he described  as "a matter of domestic economic policy" that "has nothing to do  with provisions in the Constitution limiting Japanese  participation in overseas military activities"-- or supporting UN  sanctions against the DPRK.     There also continues to be considerable support for a stronger  Japanese posture toward sanctions within the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs (MOFA).  A senior MOFA official told the 15 June Mainichi  Shimbun that although Japan has been advocating that sanctions be  imposed gradually, "this does not mean Japan wants to hinder the  efforts of the international community."  Similarly, the 15 June  Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted another senior MOFA official as  arguing that Japan "has no option other than to sincerely carry  out what the United Nations decides."  The same day, Yomiuri  Shimbun reported that a mid-level MOFA official described  sanctions as "unavoidable."  On the question of whether Japan  could support sanctions within the framework of its current laws,  unidentified MOFA sources told the 10 June Yomiuri Shimbun that  there is no legal obstacle to Tokyo's taking steps to enforce  sanctions as soon as they are imposed.     Continued Divisions over Remittances     The issue of stopping remittances to North Korea by Koreans  living in Japan remains a highly charged issue, however, and the  Japanese Government appears to remain sharply divided over the  extent to which Japan could comply, particularly in the absence  of a UN resolution imposing sanctions against the DPRK.  Parts of  the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister's office seem to be  arguing that Japan would have no problem complying with a UN  decision to cut off remittances.     -- On 11 June, Saneto Uchiyama, Deputy Director of the Cabinet  Information Research Office's Second Foreign Affairs Division,  reportedly told Kyodo that the Japanese Government could "block  6O or 7O percent" of the annual remittances from Japan to North  Korea just by more closely monitoring tax returns of pro-  Pyongyang businessmen in Japan and could take steps to prevent  these businessmen from sending remittances through third  countries.     -- The 15 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that MOFA officials,  upset by U.S. press reports that Japan was reluctant to support  sanctions, stated that Japan would have no problem halting  remittances.     -- According to the 16 June morning edition of the same paper, an  unidentified MOFA source refuted the argument--made by Japanese  opponents of sanctions--that cutting off the remittances through  Japan would be ineffective because many of them go through banks  in third countries.  The source reportedly stated that if the  United Nations votes to adopt sanctions, third nations would have  to stop remittances also. "All nations involved are obliged to  comply" with the sanctions, he was quoted as saying.     Within the powerful Ministry of Finance (MOF), however,  opposition to cutting off remittances in the absence of a UN  resolution remains strong.  The 15 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun  reported that MOF recently sent a senior official to Washington  to inform the Treasury Department that it would be "difficult to  completely halt remittances under current laws."  Similarly, the  16 June editions of both Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Mainichi  Shimbun quoted an unidentified government source as stating that  it would be "difficult" to stop the remittances under Japan's  current Foreign Exchange Management Law without a UN resolution.  Perhaps because of sensitivity to and disagreement over halting  remittances within the government, Kyodo killed within hours of  its release a report quoting the Cabinet Information Research  Office's Saneto Uchiyama as stating that Tokyo could bloc large  portions of the remittances.  The news service initially asked  its customers to hold the story because it contained "some  information to be checked" and later announced the retraction by  saying only that "under the circumstances, we have to retract the  story."     Consensus-Building     The Japanese Government may be taking steps to forge a consensus  in favor of sanctions and prepare the Japanese public for their  implementation.  For example, on 14 June, the Justice, Finance,  International Trade and Industry, and Transport ministers all  testified before the Upper House Budget Committee that the  government was studying a number of specific measures that it  plans to take if sanctions are imposed.  According to a 14 June  NHK television report, these include bans on travel and  remittances, restrictions on trade, and surveillance of ships.  On 16 June, unidentified "well-placed" government sources sought  to play down the impact that the imposition of sanctions would  have on Japan, telling Kyodo, Japan's largest news agency, that  in their first phases, sanctions would have only a "minimal  effect on Japan," causing mainly the curtailment of limited  cultural exchanges and travel between Japan and North Korea.  The  15 June Mainichi Shimbun carried a similar report stating that  sanctions would have little effect on Japanese industry because  of the limited scope of Japan's trade with North Korea.  (The  report noted that mushrooms were the major product air freighted  to Japan from North Korea).     Political Tensions     Despite the support for sanctions among some politicians and  officials and despite the government's apparent efforts to build  consensus, the fundamental obstacle to Japan's full support of  sanctions, especially in the absence of a UN resolution, remains  the opposition to sanctions by the Social Democratic Party of  Japan (SDPJ), one of the key opposition parties, and the weak  political position of the minority ruling coalition.  Over the  past week, the SDPJ has continued to indicate that it will oppose  any effort to impose sanctions against the DPRK.  According to  the 14 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun, an SDPJ delegation that  recently visited North Korea to discuss the nuclear issue with  North Korean officials told Hwang Chang-yop, secretary of the  Central Committee of the Korean Workers Party that the issue  should be resolved "through dialogue."  Upon the delegation's  return to Japan, its leader, Kazo Watanabe, Director of the  SDPJ's General Affairs Bureau, told the Japanese press that the  SDPJ will oppose the imposition of sanctions against Pyongyang  (Kyodo, 16 June.)     Outlook     The minority ruling coalition will probably find it politically  easier to gain support for sanctions in Japan, especially from  the SDPJ, if the United Nations votes to impose sanctions against  North Korea.  If the United Nations does not vote in favor of  sanctions because of opposition from China, the coalition,  whatever its own policy proclivities, will have difficulty  winning SDPJ support for sanctions.   If the coalition were to  take steps to support and enforce sanctions without SDPJ support,  it would be vulnerable to a no-confidence motion from the SDPJ at  a time when there are moves within both the SDPJ and the largest  opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party, to bring down the  coalition.

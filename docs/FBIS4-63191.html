			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov quoted  Yeltsin as saying that the administration did not believe the  Duma-approved 37 billion rubles defence budget was adequate  enough to meet all of the Army's outstanding requirements.  However, despite verbal declarations of sympathy with the  Russian Army's hardships, it was this budget that opposition  parties such as Liberal Democrats, Communists and others had  approved in its first reading, Kostikov said.    In his words, there is a ploy behind the parliamentary move  aimed to put the Army on a ration so as to bring it into head on  collision with the president. "The president is well aware of  this behind-the-scenes political gambling".    On the country's further defence spending, Kostikov said  that  it would make no sense to increase military expenditure given  that the Russian Army was to be trimmed down. But to try to  keep it at last year's level proceeding from the 1993 prices was  a different matter altogether, Kostikov said.    However, he made it clear that an increase in this year's  defence budget would not be made at the cost of public spending.</p>

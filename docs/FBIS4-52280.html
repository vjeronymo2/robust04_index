			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- Led by blue-chip issues,  the bull run at the Korean stock exchange pushed share prices  near the 940-point mark this week.    The all-share composite stock price index ended the week at  936.41, up 27.69 points or 3 percent from a week earlier amid  heavy trading.    Securities experts predict a bullish market this month,  noting the purchase ratio of institutional investors has hit 46  percent and daily trade turnover is surpassing 1 trillion won  (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) these days.    The week started off on a strong and healthy note thanks to  both high- and low-cost shares. The leading index was up 10.54  points from the weekend to close at 919.26 Monday.    Advancers more than doubled retreaters, 528 to 241, with 175  hitting the daily permissible ceiling as 40 million shares  changed hands, the most active trading in a month.    Amid a hectic tug-of-war between selling and buying, the  composite index lost 1.71 points to finish at 917.55 Tuesday.    Issues of Hyundai affiliates attracted investment on  expectations of a reconciliation between the business giant and  the government after the group's honorary chairman, Chong  Chu-yong, announced his retirement from active business  management.    The index started Wednesday with a gain of 10 points during  the morning session based on high hopes for improved market  supply and demand, but profit-taking and anxiety put a brake on  the bull run.    The index instead stopped at 922.33, up 4.78 points on heavy  trading of 49.9 million shares.    Blue-chip issues emerged as popular choices again in the  Friday session, pushing the index up near 930 points. The  market was closed on Thursday for children's day, a national  holiday here.    The composite index marched up 5.51 points to reach 927.84,  due to the popular issues of Daewoo Electronics and Goldstar.    Medium- and small-sized issues easily pushed the index above  930 Saturday despite hectic profit-taking. It ended the week up  8.57 points at 936.41 as 30.1 million shares changed hands  during the half-day session.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Midlands councils appeal for EC funds LOCAL authorities in the west Midlands are appealing for European Community regional funding to help regenerate the economy. The authorities hope both the UK government and the EC will adopt their strategy in their definition of regional spending policy over the next five years. In their document the authorities say EC funding 'has been a mainstay of urban regeneration policy in the West Midlands'. But they acknowledge that previous EC funding - more than Pounds 300m since 1988 - failed to make 'any real inroads into combating . . . inner-city poverty' or to counteract recession. Spending was also often poorly integrated with local development priorities. The focus of new spending should be on arresting the decline of manufacturing, improving communications, helping small and medium-sized businesses, developing tourism and enhancing research and development capacity. The government's new map of areas eligible for regional assistance raise Birmingham from intermediate to development status, widening the scope of funding for which companies can apply. The West Midlands Region, European Development Strategy. West Midlands Regional Forum of Local Authorities, PO Box 11, Martin Street, Stafford ST16 2LH. Pounds 20.</p>

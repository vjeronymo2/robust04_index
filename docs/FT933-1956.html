			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (3): A case of horses for courses - After the rush to 'downsize,' the computer industry now talks about 'rightsizing' as the solution to the conflict between mainframe and PC technology - Downsizing AT the dawn of the microprocessor age, Professor Edsger Dijkstra, one of the great pioneers of computing, said that he could not understand the euphoria about the new technology. He was especially confused by the financial justification for its appeal. In a controversial speech to the 1977 IFIPS meeting, Professor Dijkstra said: 'A quarter of a century ago we were told that computers were so expensive because they were so great. Now we are told that microcomputers are great because they are so cheap]' This argument is still used today to persuade computer users to throw out their big, old, expensive computers and replace them with small, new, cheap ones. Known as 'downsizing,' it promises, once again, to produce better information technology systems cheaper and quicker than before. The catch is, as Professor Dijkstra suspected, that replacing a large, central computer resource with many smaller, distributed computers is not a simple task. Downsizing may well bring benefits in the form of better user interfaces and exciting new applications like multimedia and workgroup computing. The essence of these applications, of course, is the distribution of computer power to where it is needed to support business functions. Downsizing has been caught up in this because of the dramatic difference in hardware costs between mainframe and PCs. The real issue is to find the right sized system to support the function. Increasingly, therefore, the industry talks about 'rightsizing' as the solution to the conflict between mainframe and PC technology. Either way it costs money. The savings which come from using PC hardware technology can easily be consumed by software integration, communications and training costs. This often means that a 'downsized' system might not save as much the low hardware costs would indicate. This is a strong argument for mainframe users to carry on as before. Mainframe manufacturers argue that users can gain the benefits of modern technology by replacing their text-based terminals with PCs and keep the mainframe as a central database server. Indeed, this is the route that most medium to large corporations have chosen and is a good example of 'rightsizing.' They can satisfy their users demand for better front-end interfaces, while keeping control over their central data resources. The front end of the system is 'downsized' but the back end remains on the big mainframe. There is a strong argument, however, that the mainframe's role as a central server will also disappear to be replaced by banks of high-performance, 'super-servers' based on multiple PCs. 'The way things are going, you can see a finite life for the mainframe. PC or 'bottom-end' computing power is increasing at a phenomenal rate,' says Steve Crawley, product manager with PC builder AST Europe. While he acknowledges that mainframe still possesses an important edge, Mr Crawley sees it as only a matter of time before PC technology catches up and overtakes current mainframe technology. Currently the mainframe's edge comes from an important difference in design. Mainframes have a mechanism called a channel which lets them move data around inside the computer much more quickly than current PCs. This is especially important in large systems like those used for flight reservations or banking, but it applies to any business system where many users need access to the same database. PCs are designed differently. In place of a channel they have a 'bus' for moving data around inside. This means that, while a PC processor may be as powerful as a mainframe, it is not well-suited to traditional data processing. This can be solved by re-designing the PC, of course. But the need for compatibility between successive generations of PC has meant that progress towards a faster bus has been held back. New standards for faster bus speeds promise to break down this barrier, however. This will let the PC compete with the mainframe on equal terms. 'The need for compatibility has held back the technology in some ways. But we are approaching a time with the new standards where this is going to change. Intel's PCI and VL bus standard open up the potential for much faster PCs,' says Mr Crawley. AST, in common with other PC manufacturers, is working towards multiple processor systems which can harness the power of several microprocessors. Mr Crawley says that such systems make it possible to offer equivalent performance, storage capacity and reliability as a mainframe: 'Our Manhattan 'super server' brings multiple processors together with new storage technologies to create a viable competitor to a mainframe system,' he says. He goes on to add that such systems can be made as reliable as a mainframe by duplicating components and functions. The processors are relatively cheap, so such systems can be engineered with 'redundant' components to ensure reliability. Mr Crawley also dismisses criticisms that the problems of co-ordinating software in multiple processor systems: 'All sorts of people are working on this problem with some success. Compaq and ourselves are doing a lot of work. And so is Microsoft with its NT operating system and Novell with its Netware product. Both of these are dripping with network management features,' he asserts. There is no doubt that, in the short term, the mainframe will continue to occupy an important role in business systems. There are certain processes - like the administration of large numerical databases - which it performs adequately and, sometimes, well. More important, most businesses have enormous investment in their mainframe systems and cannot afford to replace them. PC superservers pose a real threat, however, and over the next few years as bus bandwidth and processor speeds both increase, they will be able to match and overtake mainframe systems. Ironically, the PC superserver will not look much different to what we now call a mainframe. Perhaps, the distinction will disappear altogether and it won't matter what they are called - as long as they are cheap.</p>

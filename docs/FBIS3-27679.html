"The EC not only shows its admiration for China's  development, but is willing to promote it through trade and  economic cooperation with China," said Brittan. "it is  unreasonable to exclude China, the 11th largest trade country in  the world in 1993, from GATT," Wu said.    The China-EC Joint Committee exchanged views on GATT matters  and expressed its satisfaction regarding the successful  conclusion of the Uruguay Round.    A release at the press conference said that the EC supports  the successful conclusion of the negotiations on China's status  as a contracting party to GATT as soon as possible.    China reaffirmed its intention to continue the reform of its  economic and trade regimes to meet the internationally accepted  rules, in particular those of GATT.    The two sides agreed to intensify their efforts, both  bilaterally and multilaterally, to achieve a satisfactory  outcome in these negotiations.    China and the EC decided to launch bilateral discussions for  the liberalization of non-tariff measures in China. The first  meeting will take place next March in Geneva in the framework of  the GATT working party on China.    The EC side insisted on the elimination of the  discriminatory  provision on automobile joint ventures of the Sino-U.S.  Memorandum of Understanding on market access of October 1992.    China stated that the provision on imports of auto parts  does  not affect the production of Sino-EC joint ventures. Both sides  agreed to continue discussions on this issue.</p>

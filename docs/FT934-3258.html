			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: YPF plans Dollars 1.25bn investment programme YPF, Argentina's privatised oil company, plans to invest Dollars 1.25bn next year to increase output, modernise production capacity and upgrade its retail network. It announced an Dollars 850m bond programme, the largest of its kind by an Argentine company. The company plans to invest Dollars 650m to increase production by 20 per cent in 1994. Output is 380,000 b/d, and YPF aims to produce 450,000 b/d by 1995. It said much of the increased production would be exported to Chile through a trans-Andean pipeline to be inaugurated next year. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF president, said the company would invest Dollars 300m in exploration to lift reserves. A further Dollars 100m would be used to upgrade operations to meet tougher environmental standards as part of a Dollars 500m five-year plan. The remaining Dollars 200m would be used to expand and modernise refinery capacity and retail network. YPF was partially privatised in June when the government sold 45 per cent of the company for Dollars 3.04bn. The investment programme is to be financed from cashflow and debt. In the nine months to September, YPF reported net income of Dollars 394m, against Dollars 145m in the same period of 1992. Mr Cedric Bridger, vice-president, said YPF would launch Dollars 850m-worth of bonds, to be spearheaded early next year by a Dollars 350m fixed rate, 10-year Yankee bond programme. Mr Bridger said the Yankee bonds, to be placed by CS First Boston, would be used to retire Dollars 200m-worth of costly local and World Bank debt and replenish working capital. He said pricing would be decided after the government had placed Dollars 750m-worth of Global bonds today. YPF hopes to achieve similar or better terms for its bonds. The Yankee bonds will be followed by a Dollars 500m medium-term global note programme.</p>

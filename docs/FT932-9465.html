			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kamchatka prepares to open competition for gold mining rights The local administration of Kamchatka, in the far east of Russia, is preparing to open competition for gold mining rights in the southern part of the Kamchatka peninsular, writes Hugh Fraser. The tender will mark the first occasion on which foreign companies have been invited to bid for rights to mine precious metals in Russia. It will be held in conjunction with the Russian Federation's geological committee. The three deposits contain about 90 tonnes of gold held in quartz. Interested companies will be able to buy packets of geological data this summer. The Russian government holds a purchasing monopoly on all gold produced in the country. If a foreign company wins the tender the government will pay 25 per cent of the purchase price in hard currency and 75 per cent into a rouble account inside Russia. The criteria for judging the tenders have yet to be announced but the administration says environmental safety is its top priority.</p>

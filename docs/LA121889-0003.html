			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVING OUR WATER  </P> <P> Your editorial "A Taste of Shortages to Come"(Dec. 4) correctly addressed the  impending water crisis and pointed out the most effective immediate solution:  water conservation.  </P> <P> What your editorial completely ignored may well be one of the most effective  long-term solutions to Southern California's water deficit: I refer to water  reclamation and reuse for a wide range of applications such as landscape  irrigation, industrial uses, ground-water recharge, toilet flushing in new  commercial high-rise buildings and other uses short of direct potable use.  </P> <P> The technology for safe, dependable water reuse is here, now, as demonstrated  by our own neighboring communities in Las Virgenes, Long Beach, Cerritos,  Walnut, and several locations in Orange County and other California localities.  The city of Phoenix, Ariz., is planning potable reuse and is designing a  pilot-scale project now. California law does not permit potable reuse at any  level of treatment at the present time, due to lingering health concerns.  </P> <P> While health concerns persist in spite of demonstrated safety of water reuse  for the less-intimate uses, reclamation will become an increasingly important  part of our future water supply picture.  </P> <P> Here is a consistent source of potentially usable water being dumped out to the  ocean every day that could be further treated, placed into a separate  distribution system and sent back to irrigate parks, supply many types of  industries and free up the potable water that is now used for those purposes.  The extra water thus freed would serve as a reserve to meet our shortages, just  as if a new reservoir, canal or pipeline had been constructed.  </P> <P> Water reclamation on a large scale, as I am suggesting, would require much  advance planning, user cooperation, legislative muscle and political support.  But, above all, it needs public awareness of its potential to reduce future  water shortage.  </P> <P> The Times would do the public a great service by indicating the relative  significance and potential importance of water reuse among your list of  solutions to this immense and immediate problem.  </P> <P> BAHMAN SHEIKH  </P> <P> Director, Office of Water Reclamation  </P> <P> Board of Public Works  </P> <P> City of Los Angeles  </P></p>

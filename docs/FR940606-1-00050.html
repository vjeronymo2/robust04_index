			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While no data were available for the effect on emissions from the housekeeping measures, it is expected that emissions will be reduced based on the data from California facilities for keeping cleaning solvents in closed containers. Consequently, housekeeping measures were used as the basis for the proposed standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, existing RCRA regulations govern handling and storage practices for certain types of wastes. Since the EPA did not want to create a situation where possible conflicts with the RCRA regulations could arise, the proposed rule exempts wastes covered under the RCRA regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Selection of the Format of the Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several formats could be used to implement the control techniques selected as the basis for the proposed standards. Section 112(d) of the Act requires that emission standards for control of HAP be prescribed unless, in the judgment of the Administrator, it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce emission standards. Section 112(h) of the Act defines two conditions under which it is not feasible to prescribe or to enforce emission standards. These conditions are: (1) If the HAP cannot be emitted through a conveyance device or (2) if the application of measurement methodology to a particular class of sources is not practicable due to technological or economic limitations. If emission standards are not feasible to prescribe or enforce, then the Administrator may instead promulgate equipment, work practice, design or operational standards, or a combination thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Cleaning Operation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cleaning operation for which the EPA is proposing standards emits a variety of organic HAP. For many of these organic HAP, emission measurement methods either do not exist or would be very expensive to implement. In addition, the nature of some cleaning operations (e.g., hand-wipe cleaning) makes collection through a conveyance device difficult if not impossible. Therefore, the EPA determined that emission standards are not feasible for these operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA then considered design, equipment, work practice, and operational standards for these operations. The EPA examined the California regulations, which had been determined to represent the floor level of control, to identify the specific types of measures adopted for hand-wipe cleaning, flush cleaning, and spray gun cleaning. An analysis by the EPA of the aerospace facilities' data showed that facilities subject to the California requirements emitted approximately 48 percent less organic HAP from their operations than non-California operations in ozone nonattainment areas. The EPA concluded that the formats of the California regulations are effective in providing quantifiable and achievable emission reductions. Therefore, the same formats are being proposed for the NESHAP as follows: (1) For hand-wipe cleaning operations, use of solvents that conform to the approved composition list or vapor pressure limits, and housekeeping measures, (2) for spray gun cleaning, an equipment standard and housekeeping measures, and (3) for flush cleaning, housekeeping measures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is also proposing standards to limit the organic HAP emissions that may occur from leaks from enclosed spray gun cleaners. A format based on emission limits was not possible, since there were no data to determine the emissions from leaks. Also, no design, equipment, or work practice standards were identified that would prevent leaks from occurring. Consequently, the EPA determined that the only format that would ensure a minimum of organic HAP emissions from leaks was an operational standard that required leaks to be repaired within a certain amount of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Primer and Topcoat Application Operations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The formats selected by the EPA for the proposed organic HAP emission limits for primer and topcoat application operations are: (1) A limitation on both the VOC and organic HAP content, (2) a percent reduction and performance standard for control devices, and (3) an equipment standard for the application of primers and topcoats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Blue Arrow Trial: Warning to jury on verdicts THE JURY in the Blue Arrow fraud trial will today retire to consider their verdicts - exactly one year to the day after court proceedings began. Completing his summing-up yesterday, Mr Justice McKinnon, the judge, repeatedly warned the 11 men and one woman not to convict the five remaining defendants if unsure of their guilt. He said the prosecution's remaining allegation was that in agreeing to buy shares in the 1987 rights issue after the passing of the official deadline - so increasing the take-up level from 38 per cent to 48 per cent - the defendants had conspired to dishonestly mislead the markets. When summing up the evidence against four of the defendants, the judge listed a series of tests in each case. Unless these tests had been met by the prosecution, the jury had to acquit, he said. The case against Mr Jonathan Cohen, County NatWest's former chief executive, depended on whether, in a telephone call to Mr David Reed, County's former corporate finance head, he had been told of and approved the 'late take-up' before the shares were bought. In his evidence, Mr Reed, another defendant, had denied telling Mr Cohen of this. Mr Nicholas Wells, a former County director, had given evidence that he had thought the late take-up was both legal and against nobody's interests. Mr Wells' approach to both the Bank of England and his superiors might be thought positive points in his favour, the judge continued. Mr Martin Gibbs, a former head of corporate finance at Phillips &amp; Drew Securities, had checked whether the late take-up was legal and obtained authority from his chairman, Mr Bryce Cottrell. The jury would want to bear both points in mind in deciding Mr Gibbs' honesty, he said. Mr Christopher Stainforth, a former P&amp;D director, should be compared with Mr David Roper, another corporate financier present at the meeting when the shares were bought. Both had relied on the late take-up being approved by their superiors and the prosecution had not sug-gested Mr Roper was a conspirator. 'Is not Mr Stainforth's position identical to Mr Roper's?' the judge said. If the jury felt there was no difference between the position of the two men they might feel no alternative but to acquit Mr Stainforth, he continued.</p>

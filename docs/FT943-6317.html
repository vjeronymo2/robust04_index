			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Ivax buys Zenith in generic merger Ivax, a generic drugs manufacturer based in Miami, announced the purchase of rival drug maker Zenith Laboratories in an all-stock deal valuing Zenith at nearly Dollars 600m. The transaction, if completed, will create what the companies claim will be the world's biggest maker of generic, or non-branded, pharmaceuticals. The two had generic drugs sales of Dollars 570m last year. Generic drug makers produce low-cost variants of branded drugs that have come off patent. Patent expiries and pressure for lower-cost drugs have made the generics sector one of the fastest growing in the pharmaceuticals industry, with the US market put at Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6bn last year. Together, the two companies will constitute 'a powerful force in a fragmented industry,' said Mr Steven Gerber, an analyst at Oppenheimer in the US. Mylan, the biggest independent US generic drugs company, had sales of Dollars 250m in the year to March. Ivax and Zenith had a pipeline of products awaiting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, bolstering their prospects for future growth, said Mr Gerber. Ivax said they made 63 drugs between them and had applications for 40 more before the FDA. Zenith had sales last year of Dollars 96m and net income of Dollars 18.4m. Ivax, which had total revenues last year of Dollars 976m, generated around a quarter of its generics sales outside the US. Its principal overseas operations are in the UK, where it owns Norton Healthcare. It has operations in the Czech Republic, Germany and China. The company has gained a reputation for skills in the manufacturer of time-release drugs, which are absorbed into the body over a period of time. This technology gives it an edge over other generics companies, to some degree protecting its profit margins. Under normal competitive circumstances, generics drugs sell for as little as 10 per cent of the price of the branded alternative. The purchase of Zenith, which has been rumoured for some months, is likely to increase competition for other independent manufacturers. Branded drugs companies have also shown interest in acquisitions in the generic area, most recently with Marion Merrell Dow's purchase of the Rugby-Darby group.</p>

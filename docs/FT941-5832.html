			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fraud detection possible for the vigilant auditor Sir, Thank you for Andrew Jack's excellent article (Recruitment: 'Duty to report may not put the heat on fraudsters', February 24) in the aftermath of the BCCI affair, about the duty of auditors to report fraud; and the differing views of those who think auditors ought to be made responsible for detecting fraud and those who believe this cannot be done, eg because of the lack of access to the third-party bank accounts and records. Fraud involves transferring cash and assets out of a business, by whatever means. This process upsets the established patterns of behaviour, of assets to liabilities, of costs to income, of working capital to turnover, of margins to overheads ('break even') etc. Detecting changes in these patterns does enable fraud (or error) to be highlighted, sometimes quite quickly and nearly always to a high degree of certainty, as a normal part of the audit. Only audit firms and investigating accountants who are not using such methods (and some are not) need fear the extra responsibilities which are now being thrust on them by the inevitability of events. Likewise for bankers, shareholders, investors, sup-pliers, depositors, customers, staff, and all others who depend on their vital work. Brian Warnes, managing director, Business Dynamics, 13 Blackheath Village, London SE3 9LA</p>

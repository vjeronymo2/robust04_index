			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Shake-up on road costings The government may in future award road-building contracts to companies which guarantee to keep down future maintenance costs rather than to those which submit the lowest bid. The Department of Transport yesterday announced the first contract to be awarded under a new 'whole-life costing scheme' which takes expected maintenance costs and traffic delays into account. A Pounds 34m contract for the construction of the 3 1/2 -mile Brockworth bypass near Gloucester went to Wimpey Construction. The department has spent the past two years devising a computer model to assess the total costs of different road surfaces. Contractors are given the figures for future costs to help them frame bids. Wimpey said it had submitted three bids for the Brockworth contract involving different road surfaces. This was normal practice, it said. Tarmac roads need strengthening halfway through their 40-year lives while concrete roads do not, but this does not mean concrete will automatically be cheaper. Whole-life costing did not make a great deal of difference to the Brockworth bypass contract because Wimpey was the lowest bidder anyway, the Department of Transport said. Mr Robert Key, roads minister, said: 'The aim of whole life costing is to tell us if it is worth providing roads that give longer life and need less maintenance.'</p>

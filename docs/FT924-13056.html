			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Census shows fall in London population THE POPULATION of London and the six metropolitan counties fell between 1981 and 1991, according to provisional census results published yesterday by the Office of Populations Censuses and Surveys. The estimates from last year's census, however, show that the changes were generally small - with Merseyside falling the most at 5 per cent - and the inner London boroughs registered a slight increase. Outside the cities, all but three shire counties increased in population. Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire, Cornwall and Dorset were the fastest-growing counties in England and Wales. Overall, the resident population of England and Wales rose by 1.32m to 50.95m. Two thirds of this was caused by the excess of births over deaths and the remainder by net immigration. There was a surge in the very youngest and the oldest: the number of pre-school children rose 422,000 (14 per cent); and there was an increase of 507,000 (6 per cent) in the number of people over the retirement ages of 65 for men and 60 for women.

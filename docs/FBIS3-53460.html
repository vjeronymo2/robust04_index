Before his departure, Sha'th said that the  Palestinian-Israeli talks will be resumed in Taba on Tuesday  morning.    Sha'th said he submitted to President 'Arafat and the other  Palestinian leaders in Tunis a comprehensive report about the  progress of the negotiations, especially in light of the problem  that Israel caused with what it called "the Cairo agreement"  between the two sides. This problem was solved when Egyptian  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, acting in the interest of the peace  process, backed the Palestinian stance.    Dr. Sha'th added that the report he submitted to the  Palestinian leadership included his expectations about the  future of the Taba talks with the Israelis. He said that the  Palestinian leaders held lengthy discussions on this issue,  adding that he was given the necessary instructions about it.    Explaining his instructions, Sha'th said they included  commitment to continuing the peace process and to achieving  results on the specified dates so that there can be no  retraction of the schedule set for withdrawal. He pointed out  that the dates are an important part of the agreement.    Sha'th explained that Palestinian and Israeli negotiators in  Taba are about to formulate a protocol of civilian powers in  Gaza and Jericho in a process known as the transfer of powers to  the Palestinian National Authority.    He announced: We are about to complete this protocol this  week, indicating the transfer of all civilian powers to the  Palestinian National Authority.    Sha'th noted that during the round of talks that will begin  tomorrow the negotiators will focus on complex issues, including  the border crossings, the size of the Jericho area, the Gaza  settlements, and the presence of international forces, an  important part of the Declaration of Principles.    Sha'th added: If we succeed in settling these issues, we  will begin concentrating on the details of other security  matters.    Sha'th described the Syrian-U.S. summit as a positive  development that brings Syria back to the negotiating operation,  something that is bound to help attain a comprehensive peace.  He noted that Syria will be returning to the negotiations armed  with a full commitment on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the  Golan Heights and the restoration of Syrian sovereignty there.    Sha'th remarked that this is good for the peace process  because it emphasizes an important precedent, namely that a real  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242 means full  withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967. He  pointed out that Egypt got as much in the Camp David accords.    He said Syria is now repeating the Egyptian achievement and  the same will be applied to the Palestinian territories when  negotiations over the final status are held.    Sha'th said that the Clinton-al-Asad meeting was useful as a  precedent and was beneficial because it stressed the principle  of comprehensiveness.</p>

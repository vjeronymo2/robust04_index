			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> CALL BOX MYSTERY: Call boxes on Orange County freeways average 32 calls over a  three-month period, but the phones on the Riverside Freeway in Santa Ana  Canyon, the San Diego Freeway in Seal Beach and the El Toro Y are averaging  twice as many. . . . No one knows why, but officials are working with the CHP  on a computerized system that will be able to identify types of calls by call  box and determine "if there is any significant correlation between the high-use  call boxes, the type of calls and the road environment."

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERAZA RESIGNS OXNARD POSITION  </P> <P> George Peraza has resigned only two weeks after completing his first season as  baseball coach at Oxnard College.  </P> <P> The Condors finished the season 16-15 overall, 11-9 in the Western State  Conference, which was good for a third-place tie with Moorpark College and a  berth in the conference's Shaughnessy tournament.  </P> <P> Peraza, a Spanish teacher at Thousand Oaks High, said his decision stemmed from  the difficulty of performing what was, in effect, two full-time jobs.  </P> <P> "It was too hectic," said Peraza, who was paid a stipend for coaching the  Condors on a walk-on basis. "Being a head coach is an enormous amount of work,  and not all of it is coaching baseball. It's a lot of paper work."  </P> <P> Peraza said his best years at Oxnard were the nine he spent as an assistant to  Jerry White, who resigned a year ago citing health reasons.  </P> <P> "That was nice," he said. "All I did then was come to the field and coach."  </P> <P> Peraza said he would like to remain in coaching, but does not have any  immediate plans.  </P> <P> "If any full-time jobs open you'll see me there going for it," he said. "But  for now I'm going to take care of the job that pays most of my bills."  </P> <P> The opening for a baseball coach at Oxnard is the second among the three  schools in the Ventura Community College District.  </P> <P> Ron Stillwell resigned last month as coach at Moorpark after five seasons for  similar reasons. Stillwell, who is also a teacher at Thousand Oaks High, said  that serving as a walk-on coach at the community college level had too many  drawbacks.  </P> <P> White said Tuesday that he has no interest in either the Moorpark or the Oxnard  opening.  </P></p>

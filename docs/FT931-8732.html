			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Suharto in army rejig PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia has named a new head of the politically powerful armed forces three weeks before presidential elections in which he is expected to stand for a sixth five-year term of office. Gen Edi Sudrajat, at present army commander, will replace Gen Try Sutrisno as armed forces chief, overseeing the army, navy and airforce, in a move which will leave Gen Sutrisno free to stand as vice-president in March. Gen Sudrajat's appointment is a further step in a wide-ranging reshuffle of top military personnel which began last July. Favourite to fill Gen Sudrajat's post of army commander is Major-Gen Wismoyo Arismunandar, a brother-in-law to President Suharto and currently deputy army chief of staff.</p>

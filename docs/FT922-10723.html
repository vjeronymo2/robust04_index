			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: BCE buoyed by cost controls THE continuing recession slowed growth in BCE's telecommunications business in the first quarter this year, but tight expense control, especially in long distance service, helped to cushion the impact.

Total operating revenue was CDollars 4.86bn against CDollars 4.72bn. Bell Canada, the telecommunications subsidiary, earned CDollars 241m against CDollars 243m on operating revenues of CDollars 1.95bn, against CDollars 1.89bn. It contributed CDollars 222m, or 71 cents a share, to BCE's profit against CDollars 227m, or 74 cents. BCE Mobile Communications, the cellular telephone subsidiary, had a first-quarter loss of Dollars 5.6m, or 8 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 6.4m, or 10 cents, a year earlier.</p>

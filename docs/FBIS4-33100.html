			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Huang Kwang-chun, Low Kwang-jen, and Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] San Salvador, June 1 (CNA) -- Republic of China  [ROC] Premier Lien Chan attended the inauguration of Salvadoran  President Armando Calderon Sol Wednesday [1 June] morning.    During the two-hour inauguration ceremony, Lien and his wife  were seated as guests of honor next to other Central American  leaders.    Calderon was named president of El Salvador under the  witness  of Salvadoran congressional leaders. After his inauguration, he  delivered a 45-minute speech calling on his countrymen to help  rebuild El Salvador, ravaged by 12 years of civil war.    After the ceremony, Lien met with Nicaraguan President  Violeta Chamorro and Panamanian Vice President Guillermo Ford.    Meanwhile, during a television broadcast of the ceremony, a  private El Salvador television station mistakenly aired a photo  of the Communist Chinese flag alongside the photos of the ROC  delegation.    The ROC Embassy in El Salvador immediately demanded an  apology from the TV station.    Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Victor Manuel Lagos later  apologized to ROC Ambassador Andrew Shen on behalf of El  Salvador for the mistake.    Shen told CNA that the station also apologized for the  mistake and agreed to make a correction during a news broadcast  to be shown later in the evening.    Lien and his 21-member entourage will travel to Guatemala  June 2 and is scheduled to return to Taipei June 7.</p>

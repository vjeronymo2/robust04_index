			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Cut in discount rate prompts Nikkei upturn SHARE PRICES rose for the first time in five trading days on the wider than expected cut in the official discount rate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 200.62 at 20,466.65 on index-linked buying and purchases by investors who held short positions. The index opened at the day's low of 20,347.43, before rising to the day's high of 20,564.86 in the afternoon session. The Bank of Japan announced an official discount rate cut of 0.75 percentage points to a record low of 1.75 per cent. While the news surprised some investors, it did not lead to a rush of buy orders. 'People were weighing the 1.75 per cent against the 0.8 per cent dividend yield of the Nikkei average,' said a fund manager at Nippon Life, the country's largest life assurer. Volume was 351m shares, against 213m. Advances led declines by 707 to 301, with 172 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 10.90 at 1,649.80, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.65 to 1,262.96. The stock market will be closed tomorrow for a national holiday. Market participants commented that rather than place funds into equities, institutional investors were committing money to the bond market. The yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark government bond fell 10 basis points yesterday to 3.86 per cent. Interest rate-sensitive large-capital issues gained some ground. Nippon Steel, the day's most active stock, put on Y1 at Y331, Sumitomo Metal Industries rose Y6 to Y322 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y12 to Y688. High-technology issues were firmer, with Hitachi up Y10 to Y818, Fujitsu rising Y10 to Y802 and Sony climbing Y70 to Y4,400. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone firmed Y7,000 to Y874,000, the first rise in six trading days. Financials were also stronger. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank appreciated Y10 to Y2,240 and Nomura Securities improved Y10 to Y2,050. But Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y40 to Y3,360 on profit-taking. Investors also took profits on retailers, with Daimaru falling Y24 to Y641 and Marui declining Y10 to Y1,720. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 153.16 to 22,536.65 in volume of 110.3m shares. Roundup THE contrast between overnight losses on Wall Street and the gains in Tokyo left the region with a number of active markets, in share price terms, but no discernible trend. HONG KONG gave the credit to high liquidity, via China funds set up overseas, and to defensive stocks as the Hang Seng index moved forward 104.71, or 1.4 per cent, to 7,495.31. Turnover eased from HKDollars 3bn to HKDollars 2.9bn. Utilities led the advance, with HK Telecom adding 30 cents at HKDollars 12.80, Hongkong Electric 90 cents at HKDollars 21.30 and China Light 75 cents at HKDollars 43. Hang Seng Bank rose HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 53.50 but its parent, HSBC Holdings, declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 79.50 - the strike price of covered warrants on the bank issued by Peregrine late on Monday. SINGAPORE's first day of extended trading hours left it with the Straits Times Industrial index little changed in flat volume, 2.63 lower at 1,995.74 in turnover of 367.1m shares. NEW ZEALAND ended soft as a 155m-share placing in Telecom at NZDollars 3.82 sucked funds from the market. Telecom ended 12 cents lower at NZDollars 3.99 as the NZSE-40 index fell 20.85 to 1,917.07. Turnover was NZDollars 620m, with Telecom accounting for about NZDollars 599m of that. TAIWAN saw another wave of profit-taking from gains established after the central bank's credit easing last week. The weighted index moved narrowly before late selling left it 23.43 lower at 3,904.38. Turnover fell from TDollars 19.3bn to a modest TDollars 15.9bn. MANILA, too, lost further ground as investors took profits after last week's record highs, and positioned themselves for pending new issues. The Manila composite index closed 28.26 down at 1,939.71 as combined volume rose from 1.46bn shares to 1.70bn.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: CK Acquisition Wins Circle K A FEDERAL bankruptcy court in Phoenix has declared CK Acquisition the winner of an auction to purchase Circle K , marking an important step toward the end of Chapter 11 proceedings for the Arizona-based convenience store chain, AP-DJ reports. 'There has been a modified agreement, a hand-shake deal, that increases the price to Dollars 402.5m from Dollars 375m,' said Mr Bart A. Brown, chairman and chief executive. CK Acquisition is made up of four investors led by Bahrain-based Investcorp. Mr Brown said the modified agreement has the support of Circle K and three of its creditor groups. A fourth group of bondholders opposes the plan. The chairman added that the 'hand-shake' agreement would be translated into a formal, written agreement over the next week or two. Circle K hopes to file a plan of reorganisation on or about September 15 and hopes to emerge from bankruptcy about December 31. Mr Brown expects CK Acquisition to reduce the number of Circle K stores to about 2,800 from the current 3,300.</p>

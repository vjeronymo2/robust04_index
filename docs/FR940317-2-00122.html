			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another focus of this program could be to identify international students having leadership potential whose experience in this program could make a substantial contribution to mutual understanding and communication between the U.S. and their home countries in the future. In this regard, workshops to develop such leadership skills as public speaking and conflict resolution for future international leaders should be included in the program. Organizations must provide a program outline demonstrating their ability to enlist the participation of informed lecturers, keynote speakers, and/or recognized experts whose credentials and experience are evidence of in-depth knowledge of workshop topics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Guidelines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals should include a listing of names and titles, of the executive officer(s) of the organization and of the person(s) directly responsible for the project.

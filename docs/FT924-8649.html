			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / BAA rises 46% and increases dividend BAA, the privatised UK airport group, yesterday shrugged off the recession by reporting a 46 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to Pounds 220m and a 9 per cent rise in its interim dividend to 6.25p a share. The performance reflected a 30 per cent rise in productivity, lower property write-downs and restructuring costs, and a recovery in passenger traffic after the Gulf war slump last year. The productivity improvement followed a 20 per cent cut in the workforce in the past financial year from 10,733 to 8,730. Exceptional charges covering property write-downs and staff reorganisation fell to Pounds 11.5m compared with Pounds 54.5m a year ago. Excluding these charges, pre-tax profits rose 12.6 per cent to Pounds 232m. Group revenues rose 5 per cent to Pounds 541m. Although passenger numbers increased 11 per cent in the first half, passenger growth for the year to the end of March 1993 was expected to be between 6 per cent and 8 per cent. Sir John Egan, chief executive, said this reflected continuing recession in the UK and other industrialised countries and the fact that the Gulf war recovery had been absorbed by the traffic figures. In spite of the 11 per cent rise in passengers, income from landing fees rose only 3 per cent in the first half to Pounds 246m because of tougher regulatory pricing imposed last year by the Civil Aviation Authority. But Sir John said BAA managed to cut debt by Pounds 78m and for the first time since privatisation it was in a positive cash-flow position. Traffic at Heathrow, the group's biggest airport, grew nearly 11 per cent largely as a result of increasing numbers of passengers using Heathrow to transfer between flights. Transfer passengers accounted for a third of the growth in passenger numbers during the first half. Sir John said the transfer market had become 'the frontline in the competitive battle between Europe's major airports'. Although commercial income rose 7 per cent to Pounds 163m in the first half, passengers were spending on average about 3 per cent less than last year, largely due to recession, more transfer passengers with less opportunity to shop, and the weakness of the US dollar this summer.

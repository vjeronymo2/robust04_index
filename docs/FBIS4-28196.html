			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Michele Cooper] </F>   [Text] Rangoon, June 9 (AFP) -- Burma's military  government, fearful of possible social unrest, has taken a  conservative approach to the economy that will limit the  potential for growth, foreign analysts here say.    Realising it is short on economic and financial expertise,  the military leadership has wisely sought professional advice  abroad. But it has proved reluctant to implement that advice in  full, the analysts say.    The fear, they say, is that the drastic steps that would  benefit Burma in the long run would have serious short-term  repercussions on an already low standard of living among the  populace.    "The military leaders are moving along at a snail's pace,  adjusting here and twiddling there, when they should be taking  some hard decisions for the country's future," a Western  diplomat commented.    "No one wants to be another Mikhail Gorbachev," another  diplomat said, referring to the former Soviet leader whose  attempts at economic reform helped bring about his downfall.    A key issue is the devaluation of the kyat, which outside  experts have said is essential to promote business and  investment. One Rangoon-based businessman described the inflated  kyat as a "tremendous barrier" to trade.    (The official exchange rate is about six kyats to the US  dollar, but the widely-used black market rate is 100-120 kyats  to the dollar.)    Lieutenant General Tun Kyi, minister for trade and a member  of the ruling junta, known as the State Law and Order  Restoration Council (SLORC), is among those who rule out a  devaluation.    In a recent interview with AFP, Tun Kyi denied the inflated  exchange rate had much of an effect on external trade, and he  pointed to the "side effects" such as sky-rocketing domestic  prices that devaluation would bring.    The real problem today, he said, is that production, which  should be "the engine of our economic development," is  insufficient. His priority, he said, is to boost production.    Tun Kyi said the government was working to eliminate  technical barriers to trade and open the country's doors to  business. "We want to trade and have trade relations with any  country, big or small," he stressed.    Burma would also like to get credit facilities from major  international financial institutions, but they are controlled by  Western states which are withholding approval to underscore  their disapproval of Rangoon's human rights record.    Referring obliquely to the West's policy of isolation, Tun  Kyi stressed Burma's independent mentality. "We have some  pride," he said. "We would rather die than beg."    A local businessman was more direct, asking why Burma's 42  million people should suffer "for just one person," a reference  to leading dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, now in her fifth year of  house arrest.    A leading economist at the foreign ministry also stressed  Burma's independent tradition, saying that the suspension of aid  from donor countries did not worry the Burmese, who "want the  economy back in their own hands."    Most analysts agreed that Rangoon would not release Aung San  Suu Kyi in the near future, but was banking on the hoped-for  emergence of a more pragmatic approach by the West to boost the  economy.    A Western diplomat argued that the government should not  wait  too long to make the financial and economic adjustments  required. After decades of isolation, "expectations are zero"  among the populace, he said.    But the military government, betraying its inexperience in  international finance, is "paranoid about creating debt," he  said.</p>

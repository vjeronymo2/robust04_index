			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> SHOCK TV HOST DOWNEY BANKRUPT  </P> <P> Former "shock TV" talk show host Morton Downey Jr. has only $100 in his pocket,  and is seeking protection from a limousine company and other creditors under  federal bankruptcy laws, court papers indicate.  </P> <P> Downey listed liabilities of nearly $2.4 million, including a mortgage of  $628,000 and federal taxes of $500,000, in a petition filed last week in U.S.  Bankruptcy Court seeking protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy  law.  </P> <P> Downey, who lives in suburban Englewood, listed assets that include commissions  and syndication rights worth $6.3 million and $500,000 in real property,  according to financial statements that also say he has only $320 in the bank  and $100 cash on hand.  </P> <P> Downey's attorney, Brian D. Spector, would not comment on whether Downey's  financial troubles were related to the demise of "The Morton Downey Jr. Show,"  a nationally syndicated talk program that featured the host ranting about  issues and taunting guests until it was canceled after two years.  </P> <P> Downey's creditors include more than 75 banks, businesses and agencies --  including posh New York boutiques and restaurants -- a New Jersey limousine  service and New York City's Parking Violations Bureau, court papers said.  </P> <P> A pioneer of shock television, "The Morton Downey Jr. Show" initially enjoyed  good ratings after its debut in October, 1987, but began a slide as Downey  repeatedly got in trouble with the law. The show was canceled in September,  1989.  </P></p>

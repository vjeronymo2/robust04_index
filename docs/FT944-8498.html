			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Greyhound Canada plans airline Greyhound Lines of Canada plans to move out from the languishing long-distance bus business by forming a low-cost, no-frills airline. The Calgary-based bus company, which operates the same familiar silver and blue buses as its US counterpart but no longer has any direct corporate link with it, is confident that an airline would complement its bus services. For example, it would offer tickets combining bus and air travel. Greyhound Canada is 69 per cent owned by Dial Corp of Arizona, which sold its interest in Greyhound Lines, the ailing US bus company, in 1987. Greyhound Lines this month avoided a second brush with bankruptcy by offering a large equity stake to its creditors. Dial, whose business centres on consumer products, said it was considering disposing of all or part of its stake in Greyhound Canada to facilitate the formation of the airline. Under Canadian law, foreign investors are limited to a 25 per cent stake in a domestic air carrier. Greyhound Canada said it had not decided how the airline would be structured. It is seeking outside investors in both the bus and air operations, and plans to lease up to 10 aircraft for domestic routes. Canada's air industry is dominated by Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International. Greyhound Canada earned CDollars 8.7m (USDollars 6.44m) in the first nine months of this year on revenues of CDollars 160.5m.</p>

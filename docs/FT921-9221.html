			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Revenue rises at Alitalia ALITALIA, Italy's state-owned national airline, reported a 7 per cent rise in revenue to almost L6,000bn (Dollars 5bn) last year, despite the effect on business of the Gulf war, writes Haig Simonian. Mr Giovanni Bisignani, Alitalia's managing director, said earnings had recovered in the second half of last year, with operating profits of around L80bn in July to December. The airline carried around 8.5m in the second half against a 18.2m for all of 1991. The second-half improvement may attenuate what is expected to be a heavy loss in 1991. At group level, Alitalia lost L123bn in the first half of 1991. Mr Bisignani said the company was committed to its fleet renewal programme.</p>

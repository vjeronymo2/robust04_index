			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Arts: Schnittke for south-coast sophisticates - Music at the Brighton Festival On Thursday, as part of a lightning European tour, the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra under Hugh Wolff came briefly to rest in the Dome at Brighton. No signs at all of travel-tiredness: the prestigious ensemble from Minnesota gave an excellent concert. They opened with a Tombeau de Couperin Suite as crisp and crystalline as one could wish - just enough lemon-juice for Ravel's exquisitely on-the-edge harmonies. James Galway, the soloist in Mozart's G major Flute Concerto, made the (by Mozartian standards) garrulous piece seem more rewarding than usual. For the playing's sake, one forgave Edwin Roxburgh's over-elaborate cadenza. At this point in the programme while Londoners on the following evening were offered Barber's Adagio for String, we south-coast sophisticates were treated to Schnittke's Mozart a la Haydn, in which a group of string players assemble in darkness to faint harmonics and fainter pluckings. When the lights come up, standing in a semi-circle, they exchange and play with Mozartian references until the process is reversed into darkness again. More than a good Festival diversion; a late descendant, surely, of Tchaikovsky's Mozartiana, and nobody can say he didn't love Mozart. And Haydn? Well, he made more musical jokes than most composers. On Wednesday in Hove Town Hall two very distinguished senior artists to whom music-lovers owe an enormous amount, Victoria de los Angeles and Nicolai Gedda, gave a joint recital. A solo group each and two helpings of duets. For some reason vocal duets designed mainly for domestic performance sound a little sad in public. In their Schumann group one admired the style in spite of some wavering intonation. Musically there is little in the duets that Schumann did not do better elsewhere. A French group included two delightful examples by Saint-Saens, whose endless output continually discloses unexpected good things, also a rarely-heard humorous item by Berlioz - 'Le Trebuchet'. Gedda's solos, all Tchaikovsky, included 'At the ball' which he does so well and a dashing 'Don Juan's serenade'. Plenty of metal left in the tone when required. For her part Mme de los Angeles gave us Falla's Seven popular Spanish songs. Lovely phrases, artfully shaped and shaded, in the quieter songs ('Cancion' especially) but no longer the ferocity for, say, the final 'Polo'. With respect, the choice of Falla was not entirely wise. There are so many other Spanish songs requiring a less vivid contrast and pointing of moods. Geoffrey Parsons' accompaniments were admirable. A footnote to what has already been written about the City of Birmingham Touring Opera's hearteningly enterprising staging of Rameau's Les Boreades, which I caught at the first of two end-of-tour appearances at the Goldsmiths' Leisure Centre at Crowborough. This is the kind of non-theatrical space (but modern, not picturesquely dilapidated) that may make an opera producer's heart leap for joy but denies a larger proportion of his audience a good view of the stage than the least democratically planned conventional opera house with side boxes and all that. The place was boomingly reverberant yet three singers, Peter Jeffes, Peter Snipp and Jonathan Best, took trouble and got their words across. It may be coincidental that they also produced more agreeable tone than any of their colleagues. The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra concert was sponsored by American Express. The recital in Hove Town Hall was given in association with the National Arts Collection Fund</p>

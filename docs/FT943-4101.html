			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Broad-based growth lifts Christies to Pounds 8.1m Broad-based growth in all its main salerooms helped Christies International, the auctioneers, lift first half pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to Pounds 8.13m. Total auction sales rose by 19 per cent to Pounds 390m in the six months to June 30 compared with the same period last year, although this was below the Pounds 399m achieved in the second half of 1993. Furniture, oriental art, old masters, books and wine all produced sales increases of more than 25 per cent; the New York, Hong Kong and South Kensington salerooms all saw rises of 19 per cent or more. Sir Anthony Tennant, chairman, said sales planned for the forthcoming season, which included consignments such as a Leonardo da Vinci manuscript, were encouraging. But it was too soon to predict second half sales. Christies continued to devote 'substantial resources' to developing its presence in east Asia and Latin America, he said. It became the first western auction house with a presence in China, opening an office in Shanghai earlier this year. Spring sales in Hong Kong grew by 50 per cent. Mr Peter Blythe, deputy finance director, said Christies would use the office in Shanghai to raise its profile in China before making decisions about further investments. Total auction revenues rose by 21 per cent from Pounds 71m to Pounds 59m. This was slightly more than auction sales, mainly because of an increase last March in the buyers' premium, a commission charged to buyers. Competition for major consignments meant that auction commission as a proportion of sales remained under pressure and costs had been pushed higher. Administrative expenses were up from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 26m while auction, print and other costs rose to Pounds 49.3m (Pounds 39.1m). Remuneration costs also increased, partly because of recruitment in the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. Spink and Son, the fine art dealer acquired last April, contributed Pounds 10.6m to sales against Pounds 5.7m last time, while its operating profits dropped from Pounds 178,000 to Pounds 51,000. Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 2.84p (2.51p). The interim is unchanged at 0.5p. See Lex</p>

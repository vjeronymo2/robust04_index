			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COUPLE SUE NISSAN OVER CORPORATE 'MOLE'  </P> <P> Last summer, Stephen and Maritza French rented a room in their Costa Mesa house  to a quiet, bespectacled Japanese man. At the time, the Frenches say, they  thought Takashi Morimoto was just another foreign visitor, a polite and curious  young man learning the language and customs of the United States.  </P> <P> In reality, the couple now contend, Morimoto was a corporate snoop.  </P> <P> Unbeknown to the Frenches, the 29-year-old Nissan Motor Corp. employee was  studying their every move as part of a research project for the Japanese car  maker, the couple contend. They only discovered that Morimoto was some sort of  automotive mole upon reading an article in The Times that detailed his curious  mission.  </P> <P> Irked that their lives had been under a corporate microscope, the French family  filed a lawsuit Thursday against Morimoto and the car maker claiming fraud,  invasion of privacy, trespassing and unfair business practices.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, also seeks a  court order forbidding Nissan from dispatching emissaries like Morimoto into  the homes of other unsuspecting families, stating that the firm is "engaging in  a pattern and practice of conducting market research by invading the privacy of  American consumers."  </P> <P> "They just feel outraged," said Nancy Kaufman, the Santa Ana attorney  representing the Frenches. "They just wonder what he was writing down, what  about their private lives is in a Nissan file somewhere. They feel violated,  they really do."  </P> <P> In a nine-page legal complaint, the family alleges that Morimoto "intentionally  misrepresented and concealed" the reason for his six-week stay with the couple  and their two daughters, 22-year-old Sherylinn and Danielle, 13.  </P> <P> "Morimoto's true purpose in renting a room from (the French family) was to spy  upon them and to record and use every perceivable aspect of their private lives  for the commercial purposes of Nissan," the lawsuit contends.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Nissan Motor Corp. in Carson said he could not comment since  the firm has not yet been served with the lawsuit, which also asks for  unspecified monetary damages.  </P> <P> For several years, Japanese auto makers have made a practice of dispatching  researchers to study American families to better understand the strengths,  foibles, likes and dislikes of the U.S. car-buying public. Typically, the  families are asked to voluntarily participate in the research.  </P> <P> The lawsuit also named Makoto Tachikawa, a product strategy director for  Nissan, and two firms allegedly involved in placing Morimoto in the French  household, Academic Recruit Communication International of Los Angeles and the  Japanese American Cultural Center.  </P> <P> Chiey C. Nomura and Terry Terasaki, officials with the two organizations who  were also named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment Thursday.  Nomura was out of the country and Terasaki did not return a phone call from The  Times.  </P> <P> Kaufman said the episode unfolded after the French family responded in June to  a newspaper advertisement that Nomura placed to find homes for Japanese  students.  </P> <P> Stephen French, an accountant, contacted the placement service but was was told  by Nomura and Terasaki that no student was available, according to the suit.  Instead, the two men suggested that the family find a spot for Morimoto, who  moved in June 16.  </P> <P> Kaufman said the family was aware that Morimoto worked for Nissan but thought  he was engaged in some sort of temporary project at the firm's U.S.  headquarters in Carson and wanted to stay with an American family simply "to  improve his English and general knowledge of the country."  </P> <P> Morimoto proved a hospitable guest during his stay and when his visit ended on  July 31, Morimoto and the French family parted "as friends," Kaufman said.  </P> <P> The family was shocked and outraged when they saw an Oct. 2 article in The  Times on the car culture of Southern California that contained three paragraphs  outlining Morimoto's stay with them over the summer, the attorney said.  </P> <P> It said Nissan had dispatched Morimoto, an intern from the Tokyo headquarters,  to the middle-class Costa Mesa neighborhood to "unearth" the life style of an  American town as part of the effort to design a future car model targeted to  U.S. consumers. Morimoto, the story said, was among several "operatives" who  were lured to Southern California by the region's trend-setting image.  </P></p>

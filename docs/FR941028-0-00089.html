			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the above discussion, OSM has determined to adopt, with the modification noted, the proposed amendment to 30 CFR 778.14(c) as a final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Part 840_State Regulatory Authority: Inspection and Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 840.13_Enforcement Authority. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rule provided that paragraph (b) of 30 CFR 840.13 be amended to include a reference to proposed &sect;843.23 as an enforcement provision whose stringency must be matched by State programs. As has been stated previously in this preamble, OSM has deferred action on the adoption of proposed &sect;843.23 for a later rulemaking. See Proposed Rule, 58 FR 34652  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (June 28, 1993). While OSM has adopted the reference to 843.23 for inclusion in paragraph (b) of 30 CFR 840.13, the adoption of such reference does not prejudge whether OSM will ultimately adopt proposed &sect;843.23 as a final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Part 843_Federal Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Part 843_Table of Contents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the September, 1991, proposal, OSM proposed to amend the Table of Contents of 30 CFR part 843 to add, in numerical order, the proposed regulations for the Federal enforcement of the proposed AVS-related regulations. The proposed additions would have included &sect;843.23, sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information, and &sect;843.24, oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control of the status of violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to the publication of the proposed additions to the Table of Contents, OSM proposed a modified version of 843.23 as part of a separate rulemaking. See Proposed Rule, 58 FR 34652  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (June 28, 1993). OSM has deferred action on the adoption of proposed &sect;843.23 for that later rulemaking. Since action on proposed &sect;843.23 has been deferred, OSM will not adopt a reference to &sect;843.23 for inclusion in the Table of Contents at this time. If a final version of 843.23 is adopted, a reference to the section will be added to the Table of Contents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM has adopted the proposed reference to 843.24, oversight of State permitting decisions with respect to ownership or control or the status of violations, for inclusion in the Table of Contents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 843.10_Information collection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The September, 1991, proposal would have removed existing section 843.10 since part 843 did not contain any information collection requirements which required the approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507. The references to &sect;843.14(c) and 843.16 in existing 843.10 did not represent information collection requirements. The requirements in &sect;843.14(c) for OSM to furnish copies of notices and orders to the State regulatory authority and to any person having an interest did not require OMB approval because the obligation to provide the information was imposed upon OSM and not upon the State or upon a member of the public. Section 843.16 merely informed the public of the right to file an application for review and request a hearing under 43 CFR part 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the proposal, OSM has deleted section 843.10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deferral of decision with respect to proposed &sect;843.23_Sanctions for knowing omissions or inaccuracies in ownership or control and violation information. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Proposed &sect;843.23 was designed to respond to those circumstances in which there had been a knowing failure to provide the regulatory authority with complete and accurate ownership and control or violation information in an application or other document submitted pursuant to parts 773 and 778 of Title 30. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;843.23 was designed ``to carry out the purposes'' of sections 507(b)(4), 510(b), 510(c), and 518(g) of SMCRA. The proposed section was designed to deter and punish the intentional failure to provide the complete and accurate ownership and control information required by sections 507(b)(4) and 510 (b)&hyph;(c) of the Act. It would have further implemented the criminal provisions of section 518(g) where appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, OSM again proposed this rule with certain modifications. See 58 FR 34652  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (June 28, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, OSM has determined to defer further action on the proposed rule. OSM will address the proposed rule within the context of the subsequent rulemaking initiated on June 28, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Survey of Leeds (5): City of rich and poor - The gap between haves and have-nots SHARP differences between the haves and have-nots of modern urban society have become increasingly obvious in Leeds where professional and financial services have created thousands of new, well-paid jobs in banks, building societies, law and accountancy firms since the mid-1980s. The new jobs give the impression of widespread economic regeneration, but they have been largely confined to the city centre. In some areas, local unemployment has risen in the wake of the decline in old manufacturing concerns. The trappings and symbols of city centre investment - such as new office buildings, expensive clothes shops and good quality wine bars and restaurants - have highlighted social differences. This is much to the concern of the city council's Labour party leadership. In Leeds, the contrast is particularly striking because one of the most deprived inner city areas - comprising the Chapeltown and Harehills districts - abuts the city centre. From the top of Chapeltown Road, with a Caribbean restaurant on one side and a Yugoslav Social Club on the other, one can watch completion of the gleaming new Department of Social Security building, locally dubbed the 'Kremlin'. The benefits agency of the DSS and the Department of Health executive are being, or have been, relocated to Leeds. It is expected that 2,000 jobs will be created by the moves but how many will go to people in Chapeltown is debatable. Unlike the Gorbals district of Glasgow, where large numbers of socially deprived people were moved to peripheral housing estates, Chapeltown-Harehills has not been broken up and about 31,000 people live there in 11,000 households. Mr Roy Dean, manager of the Chapeltown Business Centre says: 'The population has been roughly the same for some years. There has not been much net emigration, but the ethnic mix might have changed a bit.' About a third to a half of the population consists of racial minorities. Broadly, people of Afro-Caribbean origin live in Chapeltown and those of Asian descent - notably from Bangladesh - live in Harehills. The Bangladeshis are the most recent arrivals in a long history of immigration into the area, which is still a patchwork of minorities, though Afro-Caribbeans and Asians dominate. The district has many large, once grand, Victorian houses divided into flats, as well as terraces of back-to-back cottages. Chapeltown is characterised by the usual indices of deprivation. There is high unemployment - 30 per cent overall and more than 50 per cent among ethnic minorities. There are more children per family than in other areas of Leeds - and more single parents. There is a higher proportion of rented accommodation and fewer households with a car; a notorious red light district; a high level of crime; and a rising trend of drug-related problems and criminal activity. This mix of deprivation and racial tension erupted in riots in 1981, said at the time to be copycat riots after Toxteth in Liverpool and Brixton in London, but Mr Dean, a social worker in the area at the time, believes they were the result of frustration at the lack of attention the area received. 'There was just too little money spent on the housing stock, on jobs and on education,' he insists. A government inner city task force - a team of civil servants and business people set up to promote and help channel funds to inner-city training and employment - was established in the mid-1980s. It supported more than 100 projects, spending about Pounds 1.6m directly. The task force has recently been wound up, with some programmes taken over by the Leeds Development Association. Through its business centre, the LDA runs 15 workshops and advises on training and 'self-build' initiatives. Much has been done in terms of brightening up shops, building new homes and refurbishing old ones. However, Mr Dean says: 'It is a long haul and the problem does not just go away. At the heart of it is unemployment. There is a lot of retail business, but hardly any manufacturing or other commercial activity. 'Many of the young people here have never had any work and see little prospect of getting any. Outside the bookmaker's you will see young men hanging around. Some of them will have mobile phones. They will be doing drug deals. That is the only kind of work there is for them.' Chapeltown may be the most deprived area of Leeds' run-down areas but it is not the only one. Mr John Siddall, head of the LDA, says: 'I estimate that, of the Leeds population of 700,000, more than 100,000 live in what can be described as deprived inner city areas. They represent one of our greatest problems. Because Leeds is perceived as a flourishing city with average overall unemployment levels we get little help from the government.' Leeds is not an assisted area and therefore has no access to 'Brussels money' such as the European regional and social funds. This year it also failed to win money from the City Challenge programme, now abolished by the government, which is saving money by cutting urban funding. Mr Jon Trickett, leader of the council, says that the inner city areas are one of Leeds' greatest problems. He chairs the Leeds Initiative, which links the public and private sectors to find ways forward through the difficulties. 'Increasingly, people in these areas are being left out of the economy. A priority is to provide training and incentives so they can get jobs and be part of the city's development. It is difficult. We have only a little urban aid. We get around Pounds 5m but even that is being cut,' he says. With Leeds' very success hindering access to public sector funds, the hope is to find local solutions which will help wealth spill outwards to Chapeltown and other deprived areas. Mr Trickett does not hide his anxiety at the possible consequences of failure.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee frost damage put at 40% Coffee futures continued Tuesday's rally in London and New York yesterday after Brazil issued a frost damage estimate that was higher than most analysts were expecting. The London Commodity Exchange September delivery position jumped Dollars 177 to open trading at Dollars 3,650 a tonne in response to the overnight release of the Brazilian industry and commerce ministry's estimate of 15.7m bags (60kg each) for the country's 1995-96 coffee crop. That was about 11m bags down on the 26.5m bags tentatively forecast before frosts struck on June 27 and July 11, driving the September position to an 8 1/2 -year high of Dollars 4,085 a tonne. Yesterday's opening surge was quickly trimmed back, but the price still ended the day with a net Dollars 67 addition to Monday's Dollars 90 rise. At New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, meanwhile, the December future's price reached a peak of 220.5 cents a pound before easing to close at 214 cents, up 2.85. Tuesday night's announcement in Brasilia by trade policy secretary Mr Frederico Robalinho had been anxiously awaited by traders who were beginning to have second thoughts about the wisdom of the 81 per cent post-frost price surge. Early ideas that the 1995-96 crop, which was in the flowering stage when the frosts struck and therefore vulnerable to damage, might now turn out below 15m bags had generally been abandoned. And as most analysts damage forecasts settled into a 6m- to 9m-bag range the September price at the LCE sagged to Dollars 3,662 a tonne at one stage on Monday. The market was particularly vulnerable to selling as the record-breaking, Dollars 800-plus opening jump on July 11 had left a yawning gap in the price charts within which little technically-motivated support could be expected. Mr Robalinho's statement, while not inspiring any great volume of buying, relieved brokers fears that they might have to repeat the hectic scramble of two weeks ago, but this time as sellers instead of buyers. 'We are looking at optimistically 16m bags,' the Reuters news agency quoted the minister as saying, 'but I would say that based on technician reports it would be 15m bags. . . The situation is really dramatic. We had a loss of approximately 11m bags.' Mr Robalinho made his estimate following a meeting of representatives from the agriculture ministry, the economy ministry, agricultural experts from nine states, climatologists and government coffee experts to weigh the effects of the two frosts. 'These numbers are preliminary,' he said, 'but. . . they will only change a little.'</p>

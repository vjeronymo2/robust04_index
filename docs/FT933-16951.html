			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Liberte, fraternite and soon, equity - The selling of the Balladur bond Cue stirring music, softly focused images of muscular construction workers and a sonorous voiceover adjuring the French to 'show confidence in our great country' and to rise to the 'challenge of proving that France can wake up again'. The casual viewer could be forgiven for thinking that this was a party political broadcast left over from this spring's parliamentary elections, an early bid by one of the candidates for the 1995 presidential poll, or even a Foreign Legion recruitment film. It is a television commercial for the Balladur bond, the new French government's special bond issue, with which Edouard Balladur, the conservative prime minister, hopes to raise FFr40bn (Pounds 4.8bn) to fund his economic regeneration schemes. The main aim of the commercial, the lynchpin of a FFr25m 'Invest In Our Future' advertising campaign, is to sell the bonds. But it also has the objective of persuading the French to transfer some of the cash now in savings accounts and money market funds first into bonds and then into shares once Balladur's FFr280bn-FFr360bn privatisation programme starts in September. 'This is pragmatic advertising,' says Nicolas Monnier, chairman of Alice, the agency behind the campaign. 'We want as many people as possible to buy Balladur bonds, but we also want to encourage them to start thinking about participating in the privatisation issues.' The unalloyed patriotism of the Balladur bond advertising contrasts with the frivolous tone of the current UK promotion of the third round of BT's privatisation. Featuring the comedian Mel Smith, the TV and poster campaign is part of a long British tradition of humorous advertising. The private investor is an important target for the BT sale, but at least the UK government knows that the issue will interest the country's large pension funds. The Balladur government has no such luxury. There are no pension funds in France because of the state's stranglehold on the pension system. There are also fewer individual investors than in the UK. The shareholding population doubled to more than 5.5m in the last privatisation drive from 1986 to 1987, but has since shrunk to 4.5m, partly because of the October 1987 stock market crash. When he launched the issue last week, Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, was at pains to emphasise that, as a government issue, the bonds were 'absolutely secure'. His team has also devised a string of incentives, including tax breaks and equity plans, to persuade investors to convert their Balladur bonds into privatisation shares. At present the government does not plan to launch a generic campaign to promote the privatisations. The individual share sales will be publicised by the companies concerned, such as Rhone-Poulenc and Elf Aquitaine. This means that the bond advertising will play a critical part in shaping public opinion in the approach to the privatisation drive and the Balladur government decided to spend far more heavily on promoting the issue than its predecessors did for the Giscard bond in 1973 and the Barre bond in 1977. The Balladur bond advertising campaign is in two parts. The television commercial is intended to set the scene by raising public awareness of the government's plans for the bond and for privatisation. The radio and press advertising offer more detailed information about the financial attributes of the bonds and how they can be converted into shares. So far the issue seems destined to be a roaring success. Economists expect it to beat Balladur's FFr40bn target. It remains to be seen whether privatisation candidates will follow the government's lead by trying to persuade people to buy shares to help the economy, rather than just to make money.</p>

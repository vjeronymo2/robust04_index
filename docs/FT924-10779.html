			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: SKF slumps to SKr361m loss after nine months SWEDEN'S SKF, the world's leading roller bearing manufacturer, sank to a SKr361m (Dollars 62.56m) loss in the first nine months. The result, which compares with a SKr85m profit a year ago and is worse than expected, reflects a sharp deterioration in third-quarter sales in the group's main European markets and a big loss at Ovako, the special steels operation which it bought last year. It means the group will make a sizeable loss this year, with continued losses forecast for the final three months, upsetting the prediction of a 1992 profit which it made at the six-month stage. As a result, SKF will intensify its efforts to reduce costs, with a further 3,000 job losses projected in 1993 on top of the 10,000 which have been cut since 1990. Group sales in the first nine months fell to SKr19.99bn from SKr20.07bn a year ago. The company said sales to the European car industry, which had shown a positive trend for more than a year, deteriorated. 'All forecasts for the European car and truck industry point to a further reduction in sales during 1993,' it added. With Europe accounting for 60 per cent of sales, it was little consolation that the group had better sales performances in the North American and Asia-Pacific regions. Ovako recorded a SKr407m loss over the nine months on sales of SKr2.30bn. Its result reflected falling volumes and lower steel prices. A year ago, Ovako was reported as an associate company. 'The prospects for the fourth quarter and for 1993 are grim,' said Mr John Longhurst, European capital goods analyst at James Capel, which now expects SKF to make a 1992 pre-tax loss of up to SKr600m, excluding redundancy provisions. This compares with a SKr221m loss last year.</p>

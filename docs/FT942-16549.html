			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News - The AGM Season: Organisers go for audio-visual aids Annual meetings are seldom so dramatic as that held recently by NFC, which was brought to life by a bust-up between the former chairman of the transport and logistics group and his successor. Sir Peter Thompson, who in 1982 led an employee buy-out of the former National Freight Consortium, accused the board of putting the group's traditional values at risk - a charge Mr James Watson, the present chairman, vigorously denied. The 1,100 shareholders who attended the Wembley meeting had no difficulty in following the argument. Although Sir Peter spoke from the floor, close-up images of his face were relayed to huge video screens above the platform - and shareholders could also watch reaction shots of Mr Watson and the rest of the board as Sir Peter spoke. NFC said: 'People in the audience are used to watching the television news, and if you don't come up to that standard, they feel it is pretty hick.' This use of the latest audio-visual techniques continued a long-standing NFC tradition of seeking to make its huge AGMs relevant to employee shareholders, many of whom have no other contact with the world of investment. When in 1988 NFC took the decision to seek a stock market flotation, the crucial AGM was held in Blackpool and attended by more than 4,000 people. The company laid on a circus for the employees' children, a discotheque and, for its pensioners, a tea dance. NFC shareholders also see on screen a summary of all proposals as they vote. The only criticism made of this at the last AGM was that the screens should show the full text of motions. Cable and Wireless, the international telecommunications group, has for the last two years paid about Pounds 50,000 for a 45-minute edited version of its AGM to be broadcast on BBC in the early hours. Details are given in the group's annual report of timing and codes, allowing shareholders and employees to set their videos and watch at their leisure. It started doing this instead of a series of regional road-shows, which could tie up senior directors for long periods.</p>

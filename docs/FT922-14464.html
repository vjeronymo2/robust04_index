			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (8): Profitable dinosaurs - Mainframes MAINFRAMES are no longer the mainstay of the computer industry nor at the centre of technological interest, but represent a significant source of profits for those companies determined to remain as full-line computer suppliers. The list is short and exclusive. It includes International Business Machines, Fujitsu (including its 80 per cent-owned subsidiary, ICL), Hitachi (which distributes its machines through Hitachi Data Systems and Comparex), Digital Equipment, whose 9000 series represents its first venture into mainframes, NEC, Unisys, Amdahl, Siemens-Nixdorf and Groupe Bull, as well as AT&amp;T which took over NCR last year. Olivetti markets Hitachi mainframes within Italy. Unisys, formed in the 1980s from Burroughs and Univac, still markets two lines of mainframe although they are converging in hardware components if not in software. For those companies, the ratio 20:40:60 is an important set of numbers, representing approximately the gross profit margins on personal computers, mid-range machines and mainframes respectively. It is a prime cause of the hiatus among mainframe manufacturers. The personal computer sector, with the lowest gross margins, is growing the fastest at 10-20 per cent a year; mainframe growth is essentially flat at about 3 per cent or less. So, while computer companies derive the greatest part of profits from mainframe sales, the mainframe sector is the slowest growing part. The reasons are twofold: First, the mainframe business is now essentially mature; there are few new customers to be found and existing customers are usually wedded to existing suppliers by the cost and complexity of changing software. There are few competitive knock-outs. Second, the trend to 'downsizing' using a smaller, less expensive computer based on modern technology to replace a mainframe is growing. Downsizing is possible because many applications traditionally run on mainframes can be processed more economically on today's high performance mid-range machines. Nevertheless, according to estimates by the marketing consultancy Infocorp, the cumulative market for systems which cost more than Dollars 700,000 will total Dollars 95bn this year growing to Dollars 106bn next. Who, therefore, still needs these dinosaurs of the data processing business? Mr John Gardner, managing director of ICL's UK operations, points out that many companies still have a need for centralised data processing, especially where large data bases have to be searched - 'big transaction processing operations demand a mainframe; batch processing, however, is on the way out.' By 2000, however, Mr Gardner believes Unix, the 'open' operating system favoured by companies downsizing their computing activities, will be able to handle large databases and transaction processing as efficiently as proprietary systems such as IBM's MVS or ICL's VME. IBM has the lion's share of the mainframe business and is likely to retain much of it. However, according to Price Waterhouse, the management consultancy, its share of the market has slipped from almost 75 per cent in 1985 to about 57 per cent in 1991. It faces new and aggressive competition from leading Japanese players Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC. Fujitsu, indeed, is now reckoned to have displaced western manufacturers as the leading mainframe designer. By comparison with the stolid mainframe computer business, the world of supercomputers has been turned upside down recently. Supercomputers are designed to operate as fast as the laws of physics will allow. Sometimes their designers seem more interested in the speed of their machines than to the application. They chiefly come into the public eye through their use in carrying out the immense calculations needed for weather forecasting; more recently, the UK Atomic Energy Authority's Cray 2 computer at Harwell achieved fame for taking 19 hours of computational time to discover the largest prime number. A few years ago, the supercomputer market was a set piece; battle lines were drawn between Cray of the US and the three large Japanese manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC. Control Data, the US computing pioneer which had earlier dropped out of the battle because of rising costs, returned through a marketing agreement with NEC. There was skirmishing on the technological and political level. Cray claimed its software superiority gave its machines the edge over the blinding speed apparently obtainable from Japanese computers such as NEC's SX-3. US politicians complained that the Japanese market was closed to US supercomputer makers; Japanese makers were excluded from the public sector under pressure from Congress and the Bush administration. Unabashed, Fujitsu has unveiled plans to market its most powerful machines to the US private sector at prices ranging from Dollars 2m to Dollars 17m. The advent of 'massively parallel' computers has completely changed supercomputing and allowed new players into the market. Massively parallel systems involve networks of microprocessors working together to give substantial computing power. The pioneers include Alliant Computer Systems, Convex Computer, Maspar and Stardent. The technology has enabled microprocessor manufacturers such as Intel to become supercomputer manufacturers in their own right. Microprocessor chips are becoming the key to supercomputing; in particular, the microprocessors designed around reduced instruction set computing (risc). Last month, Hewlett Packard, a leader in medium-sized computers, signed an agreement with Convex to use HP's risc chips and Convex software technology to develop massively parallel supercomputers. Cray is still the world leader in traditional (vector-processing) supercomputers with a range stretching from the multimillion-dollar C90 to the air cooled, entry level Y-MP EL. The company has agreed to use a new 32-bit risc chip, the alpha chip, developed by Digital Equipment (DEC) to develop a massively parallel computer. The experts are now convinced that software, rather than hardware, will be the key to the evolution of the fastest calculating machines man has designed.</p>

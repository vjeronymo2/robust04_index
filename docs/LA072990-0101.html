			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 2 BANKS ROBBED, 1 ATTEMPT FAILS  </P> <P> Banks in Oxnard, Camarillo and Ventura were hit by robbers in three days, and  one man may be responsible for at least two of the similar crimes, authorities  said Saturday.  </P> <P> The First Nationwide Bank at 1055 S. Oxnard Blvd. was robbed at 11:20 a.m.  Saturday, Oxnard Police Sgt. Frank Porter said.  </P> <P> A man holding out an open Manila envelope approached a teller, indicated that  he had a weapon and demanded money, Porter said.  </P> <P> The teller put an undisclosed amount of money in the envelope, and the man  fled, he said.  </P> <P> The robber was described as about 20 years old, with medium blond hair and a  mustache. He was about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and wore a black sweater and  khaki pants, Porter said.  </P> <P> A man using a similar method tried to hold up the Ventura County National Bank  at 502 Las Posas Road in Camarillo on Friday.  </P> <P> The man -- described as 5 feet, 10 inches tall with reddish crew-cut hair --  handed the teller a Manila envelope folded in half, Ventura County Sheriff's  Lt. Kathy Kemp said.  </P> <P> When the teller unfolded the envelope, she found a written demand for money,  Kemp said.  </P> <P> A second teller, unaware of the situation, came up and started chatting with  the man. The man got nervous and ran out the door, Kemp said.  </P> <P> Kemp said agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation believe that the same  man may have held up a bank in Ventura on Thursday.  </P> <P> In that case, the robber, described only as a white adult, used a note to  demand money from a teller at Security Pacific National Bank at 9493 Telephone  Road, Ventura Police Officer Diann McCaskill said. The man claimed to have a  gun, she said.  </P> <P> The FBI declined to comment on the three cases. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

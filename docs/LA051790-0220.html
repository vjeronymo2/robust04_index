			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPRECIATIONS;  </P> <P> THE MAN WHO GAVE SOUL TO THE MUPPETS  </P> <P> Catapulted to fame by "Sesame Street," Muppet creator Jim Henson, who died  Wednesday at age 53 in New York of a massive bacterial infection, left behind a  dynasty of remarkable foam-and-wire creations -- Kermit the Frog, Fozzie Bear,  Miss Piggy and Big Bird among them -- that live on with a beguiling independent  reality of their own.  </P> <P> The flamboyant vanity of Miss Piggy ("Moi?"), the endearing greed of Cookie  Monster, the shy sweetness of Big Bird and Kermit's bemused voice of reason are  familiar to audiences worldwide through television, films, records, books,  toys, computer software, clothing and other Muppet merchandise.  </P> <P> More significant than the marketing bonanza it became, was the fact that the  special world of the Muppets offered a haven to children growing up in an  increasingly troubled era, a haven where reading and numbers were fun, a haven  without peer pressure or violence or drug dealers. Parents encouraged their  children to walk down "Sesame Street" or soar with "Pigs in Space," secure in  the knowledge that no harm would befall them.  </P> <P> Although the characters will survive, the sorrow is that their future will lack  the guiding hand of their gentle creator.  </P> <P> Henson's genius flowered in his original exploitation of television as a visual  medium. Earlier television shows with human and puppet characters, such as  "Kukla, Fran and Ollie," were set up like little theater performances, with a  human host and puppeteers behind a curtain.  </P> <P> Henson created interaction between humans and Muppets -- his term for a cross  between puppets and marionettes -- with complex, three-dimensional settings and  crew members concealed in trenches or behind walls.  </P> <P> Instead of seeing a human simply talking to a puppet, viewers were offered a  new dimension, one where Muppets were firmly in control and human visitors had  to cope with the eccentric surroundings as best they could.  </P> <P> Muppets could appear above, below, behind or in front of their human guests.  The effects wouldn't have worked for a live audience -- the scaffolding would  have been visible and the cameras would have gotten in the way -- but the  results were spectacular to home viewers.  </P> <P> Without their endearing, humorous, all-too-human characteristics, however, the  Muppets would have been just another technological surprise, to be exclaimed  over and then dismissed.  </P> <P> Henson gave them more than technical life; he gave them soul. Sweet, petty,  crusty, jealous, greedy, grumpy, wise and funny, each possessed an  individuality with which their human counterparts could identify.  </P> <P> And identify they did. Henson's Muppets became a merchandising and media  phenomena, second only to Disney characters in their instant visual identity.  Last year, Kermit and Mickey Mouse became a mega-team, when Henson's production  company and the rights to his Muppet characters were purchased by the Walt  Disney Co.  </P> <P> Henson's stunning artistic and commercial success were light years away from  his high school puppet club days and a career that began in the '50s with "Sam  and Friends," a local puppet show on a television station in Washington.  </P> <P> That show, the first major outing for Kermit the Frog, won an Emmy in 1958.  Quirky guest appearances on "The Ed Sullivan Show," "The Tonight Show" and "The  Jimmy Dean Show" followed.  </P> <P> Then, in 1969, came "Sesame Street," and Henson's Muppet dynasty proliferated  with instantly appealing blue and green monsters, shaggy dogs and round-headed,  goggly-eyed creations, helping millions of children learn letters, numbers and  social skills.  </P> <P> The first generation of "Sesame Street" viewers are now watching Oscar the  Grouch and Bert and Ernie with their own toddlers. (This is the second major  creative loss for "Sesame Street." Joe Raposo, its remarkable composer and  musical director, died last year.)  </P> <P> But Henson wanted to reach a wider audience, and "The Muppet Show," a  star-studded variety program, premiered in London in 1976, before moving to the  United States. Feature-length movies came later, and still more television  series -- "Fraggle Rock"; "The Jim Henson Hour," an innovative mix of live  action, computer graphics and puppetry; the Saturday morning cartoon "Muppet  Babies"; and the HBO music appreciation series, "The Ghost of Faffner Hall."  </P> <P> Not all brought commercial success -- the movies "Labyrinth" and "The Dark  Crystal" didn't do well -- but Henson's fantastic creations continued to earn  wide-eyed raves.  </P> <P> Kermit the Frog, the reasonable mediator, frequently perplexed by an  unreasonable world, was often referred to as the soft-spoken Henson's alter-ego  (he was one of Henson's earliest creations and Henson supplied his voice).  Henson, who preferred staying out of the limelight, denied that his  award-winning creations spoke for him. In a 1984 Times interview, he said,  "They don't do or say things I wouldn't otherwise do or say. I don't see myself  as a repressed person hiding behind the characters."  </P> <P> Yet during that interview, Henson only became voluble when he spoke as Kermit.  To a little green frog, the spotlight was a warm and wonderful place to be.  </P> <P> Free-lance writer Charles Solomon contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Budget reduction of interest rates urged THE GOVERNMENT should cut interest rates further in next month's Budget to boost confidence, but interest rates might have to rise as early as the end of this year if wage claims start to move higher. The message from economists at London Business School is that the sluggishness of the recovery owes much to caution among consumers still burdened with high debt and frightened by unemployment. Mr David Currie and Mr Geoffrey Dicks say in an assessment of UK economic prospects that the government needs to raise taxes if it is to avoid a debt spiral on the budget deficit. They forecast growth of 1.4 per cent this year. Inflation will stay in the Treasury target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent this year but rise to 5 per cent next year.

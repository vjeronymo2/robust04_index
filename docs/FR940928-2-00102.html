This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.1.3.1.d, which extends the restoration time for one inoperable vent and/or drain valve from 24 hours to 7 days, does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. A 7 day restoration time, as identified in NUREG 1433, is reasonable given the level of redundancy in the lines and the low probability of a scram occurring while the valve is inoperable and the line is not isolated. If the inoperable valve fails open, the redundant valve in the line allows for leakage from the CRD [control rod driveline] to be drained out and also allows for the line to be isolated if necessary. If the valve fails closed, the line becomes isolated. However, float switches and pressure sensors will notify operators of water buildup in the instrument volume. A review of the surveillance data indicates the vent and drain valves rarely fail the initial operability test and require rework. The low failure rate combined with the redundancy of the valves makes for a highly reliable system. Therefore, the proposed change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changing Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.a from requiring demonstration of the SDV vent and drain valve operability during a scram at less than or equal to 50% rod density to a requirement to perform the testing at shutdown conditions does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The purpose of the 50% rod density requirement is to provide a test environment having typical reactor coolant pressure and temperature conditions. However, the closure time of the vent and/or drain valves is not affected by pressure and any variations due to temperature are relatively insignificant. Therefore, testing from shutdown conditions ensures the safety functions of the vent and drain valves are met. Also, the proposed change does not affect system design or operation. Therefore, the proposed change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The deletion of Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.b, requiring proper float switch response by verifying float switch actuation after a scram, does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Design changes eliminated the high differential pressure experienced by the float switches after a scram and provide redundant level measuring instrumentation. Differential pressure gauges were added in addition to the float switches to provide the RPS [reactor system protection] logic with a diverse and redundant means of measuring SDIV [SDV] level. The changes have resulted in no crushed ball floats at SSES after a scram. The proposed change will have a negligible effect [on] the reliability of the system and therefore, does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.1.3.1.d, which extends the restoration time for one inoperable vent and/or one inoperable drain valve from 24 hours to 7 days, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Extending the restoration time to 7 days does not change the design purpose or operation of the SDV valves. Therefore, the change is bounded by the existing accident analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changing Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.a from requiring demonstration of the SDV vent and drain valve operability during a scram at less than or equal to 50% rod density to a requirement to perform the testing at shutdown conditions does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Performing the surveillance from shutdown conditions, as recommended in NUREG 1366, ensures that the operability of the SDV is maintained. No new failure modes are introduced by the change and the change is bounded by the existing accident analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The deletion of Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.b, requiring proper float switch response by verifying float switch actuation after a scram, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The role of the ball floats to sense increases in SDV water level is not affected by the change. In the unlikely event that crushing of the ball float were to occur, redundant level measuring devices would maintain system function and the existing 92 day surveillance activity would identify a ball float failure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.1.3.1.d, which extends the restoration time for one inoperable vent and/or one inoperable drain valve from 24 hours to 7 days, does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. A 7 day completion time, as identified in NUREG 1433, is reasonable given the level of redundancy in the lines and the low probability of a scram occurring while the valve is inoperable and the line is not isolated. Also, a separate Technical Specification (3.1.3.1.e) addresses the potential for two inoperable vent or drain valves in the same line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changing Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.4.a from requiring demonstration of the SDV vent and drain valve operability during a scram at less than or equal to 50% rod density to a requirement to perform the testing at shutdown conditions does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The change maintains the intent of S.R. 4.1.3.1.4.a by performing equivalent testing at the same frequency. The change increases the margin of safety by eliminating potential future scrams taken to meet S.R. 4.1.3.1.4.a., thus reducing the potential for safety challenges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

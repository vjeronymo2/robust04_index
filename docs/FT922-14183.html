			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Foreign Affairs: Down the aisle after a long, tortuous courtship - UK Tories and European Christian Democrats are teaming up In the past few days the Tory election campaign has taken on a rather anti-European tone, with Prime Minister John Major warning that 'the Lib-Lab left would not speak for Britain in Brussels, they would speak for Brussels in Britain', and Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, denouncing the Germans for their use of proportional representation. Meanwhile on the Continent, the banner of Christian Democracy is looking faded. Yet by an ironic quirk this is the moment that British Toryism and continental Christian Democracy, after a long and tortuous courtship, have chosen to announce their nuptials. Last night, in Strasbourg, members of the European parliament belonging to the Christian Democrat 'European People's Party' (EPP) were to decide whether to admit their Conservative colleagues to their parliamentary group. Almost certainly they will have voted in favour, bowing to the wishes of Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is said to regard the issue as having 'a historic dimension'. 'It is a long story, but I hope with a short end,' says Mr Bernhard Salzer, the senior German in the group, who has acted as Mr Kohl's representative. One of the protagonists in it is none other than Mrs Margaret Thatcher, despite her well-known suspicion of things European and her strained relations with Mr Kohl. Always sensitive to the realities of power politics, she was keen for her party to team up with the Christian Democrats, as the leading Conservative force on the Continent, back in the 1970s when she was leader of the opposition and when political parties throughout the EC were preparing to fight the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979. It is the Christian Democrats who have been playing hard to get: not so much the Germans, who have always looked on Britain's Conservatives as natural allies, but the Belgians and Dutch, some of the Italians, and the Irish (Fine Gael). These parties take their 'Christian' label seriously, and do not feel it hangs convincingly on British Toryism. Most Christian Democrat parties have their roots in a 'social Christian' doctrine which started as an attempt by the Catholic church to compete with Marxism on its own ground, showing that one did not have to be an atheist to champion workers' interests. Although Christian Democrats have accepted the role of defenders of capitalism against socialism, they place more emphasis than Conservatives do on the need to tame capitalism with appropriate state intervention, and to ensure a harmonious relationship between 'the social partners' - a phrase which baffled Mrs Thatcher until it was translated into more idiomatic English as 'the two sides of industry', and even then was not much to her taste. Most Christian Democrats are keen Euro-federalists. Among such people, Mrs Thatcher is hardly the most popular European politician. The Tory MEPs had little chance of being admitted to the EPP group so long as she was their party leader. So they had to form a separate group, with the small Danish Conservative party as their sole ally. This began to look slightly more convincing when the Spanish Alianza Popular joined it in 1986; and Sir Christopher Prout, who became the group's leader in 1987, hoped at one time to draw in the French Gaullists as well. But in 1989 disaster struck. In the European elections of that year the Conservatives lost one-third of all their seats in Britain and two of the four they held in Denmark; and, as a crowning humiliation, the Spaniards deserted to the EPP. Membership of the group fell from 66 to 34. Meanwhile, with the coming into force of the Single European Act, the European Parliament was gaining in powers and prestige; national parties were coming to attach more importance to the balance of political forces on the EC level. An influx of new Labour MEPs, more dedicated than their predecessors to working within the Socialist group and using the parliament to promote their own political and social philosophy, tipped the balance of the EC towards the left. Both Conservatives and Christian Democrats became more aware of the importance of working together. Sir Christopher decided the time had come for a new approach to the EPP, and won Mrs Thatcher's support for an application to join their group. But these were the years after the Bruges speech, when Mrs Thatcher was saying 'no, no and no' to European monetary union. The application was put on ice until after Mr Major became prime minister and proclaimed his desire to put Britain 'where we belong - at the very heart of Europe'. The current campaign notwithstanding, Mr Major is regarded on the Continent as a much better European than Mrs Thatcher; and indeed better than the Gaullists, who are now threatening to block French ratification of the Maastricht treaty. The Gaullists have not yet applied to join the EPP, although their ally, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing (who himself defected to the EPP from the Liberals last year), would like them to. Even the 'social chapter' which Mr Major insisted on excluding from the Treaty of Maastricht, obliging his 11 partners to adopt it as a separate protocol, is not seen as an insuperable division. Christian Democrats believe the chapter in its present form is no more than a set of minimum standards which British industry could easily meet and that the UK, by accepting it, would be better placed to influence its future development. Privately most Tory MEPs agree. But there is a danger that the rift will widen if the social chapter is accepted by a Kinnock government, and the Tories in opposition react by beating an anti-European drum. In today's Europe, so-called Socialist parties have mostly accepted free-market and monetarist policies, while in several countries voters, scared by unemployment and immigration, are defecting to xenophobic populist parties. That leaves, in Mr Giscard d'Estaing's view, less scope for the uncompromising free-market economics of a Thatcher. 'Now we are obliged,' he says, 'to incorporate more social preoccupations. That's what we're trying to do in France. That's why we joined the EPP last year . . . We must become centre-right, move closer to public opinion, and put more 'social' in our market economy. We need a combination of tolerance and firmness - notably on immigration  - and a positive view on European union.' Probably that is a fair description of what Mr Major is trying to do as well, although he might not use quite those words. On the Continent, at any rate, that is what his party's alliance with the EPP will be taken to mean.</p>

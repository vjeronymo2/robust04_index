			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTING OF ASIANS  </P> <P> Regarding Calendar's article about the road show of "The King and I" (Nov. 26):  </P> <P> As an advocacy organization interested in the balanced and realistic portrayals  of Asian/Pacific Americans in the media, we want to voice our dissent and  concern over the casting choices for the show. To use no Asians as principals  is unjust and anachronistic, especially when "The King and I" is a musical so  obviously based on Asian themes.  </P> <P> Granted Rudolf Nureyev is one of the greatest dancers of the 20th Century, with  the power and presence to portray the King magnificently. However, there are  many talented Asian-American performers who could have been cast for the  principal leads.  </P> <P> In this era of heightened social awareness, it is as unacceptable to use actors  playing in "yellowface" as it is to have Caucasians play in "blackface." The  producer of the show, Manny Kladitis, should have been more sensitive to the  Asian-American audience, and also should have considered the fact that he has  insulted the intelligence of the general public.  </P> <P> BEULAH KU  </P> <P> Director of Advocacy  </P> <P> Assn. of Asian/Pacific  </P> <P> American Artists  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Brussels backs UK decision to leave ERM: Chancellor is warned he must take tough measures on deficit BRITAIN was right to withdraw from the European exchange rate mechanism, says a confidential paper from the European Commission to be presented to senior officials from central banks and finance ministries today. Brussels warns, however, that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, may need to take tough measures to curb the country's budget deficit. It suggests that tax rises and/or spending cuts may have to be more severe than planned at present. The Commission's assessment, which is likely to arouse protest from Britain's EC partners, is to be discussed by the EC's secretive monetary commission. The meeting is due to discuss the UK's programme to make its economy ready for economic and monetary union by the end of this decade, should parliament approve such a step. The Commission's paper suggests that Britain can more easily rebalance its fiscal and monetary policies outside the ERM. It also suggests that getting the right balance might be more difficult if the Bank of England were independent of the Treasury. However, some European officials fear the Commission has gone too far in an attempt to appease Mr John Major's embattled government while the Maastricht treaty is still unratified by Britain. They find it extremely odd that the Commission should appear to cast doubt on the benefits of Britain's membership of the ERM. The paper points out that the UK has made little progress towards making the Bank of England independent. But its central finding that the present relationship between Bank and Treasury should help UK policy makers push through necessary changes is likely to be disputed in Germany, France, Spain, Belgium or the Netherlands. These are all countries that either have independent central banks or are planning to introduce independence. While the Commission warns that the UK might have to tighten fiscal policy more than planned, it says the method of doing so should be left to the UK government. Under the principle of 'subsidiarity', as much decision-making as possible should be left with national and regional authorities, so Mr Clarke would have the difficult choice of whether to raise taxes or cut public spending. The paper discusses the UK's latest plan for bringing the economy back into balance, which is understood to repeat the measures announced in Mr Norman Lamont's last Budget in March. It also outlines the government's medium-term financial strategy for reducing the public-sector borrowing requirement from about 8 per cent of gross domestic product in the present financial year to 3.75 per cent by 1997-98. The document's bias towards fiscal tightness might encourage some to infer that the commission would like to see lower British interest rates to stimulate investment and growth. While the paper in general is likely to meet with approval among the UK monetary authorities, neither the Treasury nor the Bank of England is in any mood to reduce interest rates. Elsewhere in the EC, there is sufficient disenchantment with UK policy for the paper to cause a row. Only last week, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank president, angrily declared that currency co-operation in Europe had 'collapsed' and implicitly criticised Britain, Italy and Spain for having engaged in the competitive devaluation of their currencies since the ERM crisis last September. It is also not so long since Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, was castigating Britain for 'social dumping'. The devalued pound and the UK's refusal to agree to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty were viewed in the Commission as a deliberate move by the UK government to lure investment and employment from Britain's EC partners. Although there are signs of warmer relations between France and Britain since Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right coalition took office, France's economic establishment remains critical of UK policies since sterling left the ERM. Some French officials point out that Britain has not been able to reap the same benefits as France, where continued ERM membership has delivered lower long-term interest rates than is the case in the UK. Others make no secret of their concern about Britain's increased competitiveness on the depressed export markets of continental Europe.

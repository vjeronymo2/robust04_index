			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of the National Assembly, Senator  Firmin Jean-Louis, will address the nation today, 15 April, on a  private radio station in the capital within the scope of a  message on the immediate political juncture, the HAITIAN PRESS  AGENCY learned from a source close to Sen. Jean-Louis.  According to the same source, the legitimate president of the  Senate reserves the right not to react to the speech of Chamber  of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde, but to react to the  immediate situation of the country.    The current political juncture favors numerous irresponsible  and illegal steps, the same source pointed out, holding as an  example the attempt by some senators of the Alliance [for  Parliamentary Cohesion] and senators elected during the  contested legislative elections of 18 January 1993 to implement  Article 149 of the Constitution. The president of the National  Assembly proposes giving his opinion as well on the possible  legislative elections scheduled for this year in his message.  The message will be delivered less than 48 hours after the one  delivered on 13 April by Chamber of Deputies President Frantz  Robert Monde, who announced a series of consultations for next  week within the framework of finding a solution to the crisis.    Promising to provide explanations on the presence abroad of  the president elected on 16 December [1990], Deputy Monde, who  has never hidden his hostility to the return of President  Aristide to his post, contented himself with evoking the  extended absence of the president of the republic, whom he  nevertheless asked to assume his responsibility toward the  Constitution by appointing a prime minister. Monde also asked  General Cedras not to listen to the perverse songs of the sirens  and to do what his duty and his word as a soldier order him to  do.</p>

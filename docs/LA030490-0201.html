			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC STUDENTS, POLICE WAGE PITCHED BATTLE; 8 HURT, 17 ARRESTED  </P> <P> A violent melee between 50 police and more than 400 youths outside a  controversial UC Berkeley housing facility early Saturday led to 17 arrests and  left at least eight people hospitalized, authorities said.  </P> <P> The demonstrators sealed off a major street for three hours, lighting bonfires  and throwing bricks and bottles at firefighters trying to put out the blazes.  </P> <P> The five-hour confrontation began late Friday night when club-wielding police  tried to break up a party at Barrington Hall, a student-operated residence hall  just south of the campus.  </P> <P> The police action occurred after the building's owner, the student-run  University Students Cooperative Assn., received an injunction Friday to bar any  public gatherings in the building. The association's membership voted last fall  to close Barrington Hall, which has a history of illegal drug use and neighbor  complaints.  </P> <P> George Proper, general manager of the association, feared that the party would  lead to vandalism. Friday's injunction prohibits the Barrington residents from  having any guests.  </P> <P> Residents of the 180-room building said they were having a private party and  were not disturbing anyone.  </P> <P> "We were just reading poetry and enjoying some quiet music. We weren't causing  any trouble," said junior Kibi Schultz.  </P> <P> But when police arrived with Proper and asked the group to disperse, the mood  quickly grew belligerent as students began banging pots and pans, and shouting  obscenities at police.  </P> <P> The 75 students who were driven out of the building gathered on Haste Street,  about two blocks west of Telegraph Avenue. As they built barricades, lit fires  and taunted police, the students were joined by many other young people from  the largely student neighborhood four blocks south of the campus.  </P> <P> The crowd swelled to about 350, and several demonstrators broke the windows out  of a police car and attempted to set it on fire.  </P> <P> Other students in the three-story building's upper floors threw desks, drawers  and furniture out of their windows to help stoke the fires.  </P> <P> Police formed lines on each end of the block and another in a parking lot  across the street from Barrington. They held their ground for more than an hour  and let the fires burn as high as 20 feet in the air. The students turned the  event into a street party and danced around the barricades yelling obscenities  and making obscene gestures at police.  </P> <P> After the crowd thinned, police gradually moved forward and firefighters began  hosing the flames, but they quickly retreated when they were met with volleys  of rocks and bottles. Firefighters then sprayed demonstrators and the building.  The confrontation remained in a stalemate for about an hour as police advanced,  then retreated.  </P> <P> After one firefighter was hit by a rock and fell off a firetruck, students  surged forward. The police charged to meet them, chasing students into the  building and hitting many of them with clubs.  </P> <P> After getting reinforcements, the police combed the dormitory room by room,  knocking down some doors with fire axes and driving students out of the  building. More than a dozen students said afterward that they were forced to  "run the gantlet" through club-wielding police.  </P> <P> The police stood guard and would not let any of the students return to the  building, although some students stood in the street outside Barrington  taunting them until about 4 a.m.  </P> <P> Six students, one firefighter and one police officer were hospitalized and  later released. Ten police and several firefighters were treated for minor  injuries. Dozens of students also sustained minor injuries.  </P> <P> "This didn't need to happen; they (police) were incredibly violent," said  junior Eugene Perez as he held a cloth to a bloody gash on the back of his  head. "I'm beaten up and homeless -- and they accomplished nothing."  </P> <P> Lt. William Pittman, who commanded the police, defended their action in the  incident -- the fourth violent protest in Berkeley in the last year.  </P> <P> "We were met with a great deal of violence and I feel we acted with restraint  under these circumstances," he said.  </P></p>

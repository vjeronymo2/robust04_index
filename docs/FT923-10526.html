			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Fairey to buy Infrared Eng FAIREY GROUP, the diversified engineering company, has agreed to buy Essex-based Infrared Engineering and its marketing and technical support subsidiaries in Boston and Stuttgart in a deal worth Pounds 11.5m. Infrared makes specialist gauges used to measure moisture, fat and protein for the food, paper and tobacco industries and the thickness of plastic films and coatings. Fairey said Infrared had achieved compound annual sales growth of 12 per cent over the last five years, with 80 per cent of its turnover exported. In the year to March 31 underlying pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.4m on sales of Pounds 7.3m. Fairey is paying Pounds 10.3m for Infrared by issuing 2.68m new shares to the six vendors who are currently directors. The five executive directors remaining with Infrared after the acquisition will retain 827,676 Fairey shares. The balance of the shares has been underwritten by Cazenove and will be placed with investment clients at 380p per share. Fairey's shares added 7p to 400p. By separate contract, Fairey has agreed to buy from the Infrared directors' pension fund the freehold building from which Infrared operates for Pounds 1.2m cash. Fairey expects to increase its dividend for the six months to June 30 by 10 per cent to 3.3p.</p>

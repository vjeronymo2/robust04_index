			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Deadline extended United Airlines and USAir have agreed to extend the deadline for United's purchase of USAir's Philadelphia-London route by 30 days, to June 14, writes Our New York Staff. United said that the extension would provide extra time to secure government approval of the transaction. United signed an agreement with USAir in March to buy the route with the intention of transferring it to Chicago. Under the UK-US bilateral aviation agreement, United cannot operate services from Chicago to London. But the airline hopes the switch will be approved following US government clearance for British Airways to buy a 19.9 per cent stake in USAir.</p>

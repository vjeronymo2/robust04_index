			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 8/6/1994 -- The attempt on the  national anthem is an attempt on Moldova's independence and  sovereignty committed by the governing party, declared today  Alexandru Arseni, chairman of the Moldovan Democratic Party of  Labor (PDMM) at a press conference. Arseni also stated that the  draft law on press is a draft pointed against the press; it  violates the Universal Declaration on Human Rights stipulating  the delivery of correct and uncensored information to people.  "Under present conditions Moldova does not need a law on  press," said Arseni. Vlad Darie, member of the PDMM  Coordinating Council, mentioned that the governing party, PDMM,  will be soon removed, and its place will be taken by the  socialists and communists. Many mayors who did not support the  PDMM during the electoral campaign were fired. Concerning this,  the PDMM Republican Council made public a declaration calling  "the extension of the results of the parliamentary elections on  the local administrative organs a violation of the  Constitution." "The PDMM informs the representatives of the  CSCE, the European Council, foreign embassies and political  parties and movements about the real threat of restoring  totalitarianism and obscurantism in our country," says the  declaration.</p>

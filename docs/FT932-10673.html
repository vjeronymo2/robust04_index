			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RJB well placed to win contracts RJB Mining, the private coal mining company which is preparing for flotation, believes it is well positioned to win new open cast mining contracts from British Coal. The pathfinder prospectus discloses that RJB recently won a tender for the Llanilid West contract in Wales which will involve the extraction of 770,000 tonnes of coal and generate turnover of Pounds 20m. The company is awaiting the results of two further tenders, and is aware of likely opportunities to tender for at least five more contracts this year. The prospectus contains no specific profit forecasts, but says that RJB will benefit from the deregulation of the UK coal industry in several ways. Financial advisers are Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The flotation, which is expected to value the company at over Pounds 100m, will be priced on May 19 and dealings will start on June 7.</p>

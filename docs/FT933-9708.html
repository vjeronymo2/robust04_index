			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Arts: Time to dance - Video WATCHING ballet on video is increasingly attractive as theatre tickets take to the price stratosphere, and repertories and casting become duller by the week. A look at the ballets and dancers on offer 20 years ago can provide a sad comparison with the lack of directorial imagination and the midget talents that beset dance today. Ballet is now beleaguered. There is a dearth of new, vital classic choreography. How few are the starry names that can set the groundlings in a roar. The current and lately past seasons by the Royal Ballet and English National Ballet are depressing in their lack of verve, their absence of authentic ballerina performance. Until companies can lure audiences back with ballets and artists worth the blood-chilling price of tickets, then dance-videos are the best thing. There is little new on the video market in ballet, though the many admirers of Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Winter Dreams should watch for a forthcoming recording from Warner Teldec with the original Royal ballet cast headed by Irek Mukhamedov and Darcey Bussell. I give details herewith of available recordings which have more than passing interest. From Castle Communication Videos come three historic re-issues. For sheer joy, and as a reminder of a company we see all too rarely, let me recommend the Royal Danish Ballet's joyous Napoli (CVI 2056). Not to know this enchanting piece is to be poor. To see it given with the gaiety of spirit and buoyancy of step that the Danes bring to this ancestral treasure (they have danced it uninterruptedly for 150 years) is to have life permanently enriched. There is grand cast, led by Linda Hindberg and Arne Villumsen; the mime roles are done with the proper Danish sensitivity and good humour. The sun shines. Preben Montell directs with real affection for this dearest of ballets. For a glimpse of New York City Ballet - who will visit Europe, but not Britain, next year - there is the marvel of Balanchine's Davidsbundlertanze (CVI 2059), with its original cast. This late, elegiac masterpiece takes Schumann's piano score as mirror of the composer's life. It says everything about Balanchine as a romantic, and it is sublimely danced, with interpretations by Suzanne Farrell and Karin von Aroldingen that stop the heart. There is ideal direction by Merrill Brockway. And as a reminder of the Bolshoi Ballet as it was during the summer of 1986, ebulliently under canvas in Battersea Park, there is The Bolshoi Live: Divertissements (CVI 2052). We see a luminous Sylphides led by Bessmertnova, Semenyaka, Semizorova, Alexey Fadeyechev - now there's a cast - and the second act of Spartacus with Mukhamedov glorious at the head of roaring lines of slaves. A final feu de joie brings all the company's then stars - and stars they tremendously were - to dazzle us in bravura numbers, including the ecstatic catch-as-catch-can of Spring Waters. (During that season I heard one member of the audience call it Strong Waters. The truth will out). John Vernon's sure direction preserves the excitement of those very happy evenings. From Warner Teldec come two more recent videos of major productions. MacMillan's Prince of the Pagodas is happily secure in a fine recording by Derek Bailey. It offers the original cast (save for Simon Rice, who is excellent as The Fool), and allows us to enjoy (which Covent Garden does not) MacMillan's homage to Petipa, led by Darcey Bussell, Fiona Chadwick, Jonathan Cope. Performances are uniformly excellent. Watching it, we are made even more poignantly aware of how much our national ballet has lost with MacMillan's death. As a postlude to the performance, we are shown Derek Bailey's sympathetic documentary about the choreographer - Out of Line - in which Sir Kenneth spoke so powerfully about his work. The Nutcracker has been given more, and more curious, productions than any other ballet I know. Rudolf Nureyev first staged it in 1967; thereafter he re-worked it, and his last version was made for the Paris Opera Ballet. This was recorded in 1988, with Nureyev directing the film. The result is a mixed blessing. Performances are, as always with the Paris Opera, admirable: Elizabeth Maurin can look convincingly child-like as Clara, but dances with absolute authority and great charm; Laurent Hilaire, as Drosselmeyer/Prince  -that's Nureyev for you - is elegant in manner and in bravura. An incidental pleasure is the brilliance of Bruno Cauhape in the Mirlitons divertissement. But the choreography is, characteristically, something of a fidget, and the lighting has too many dreary, 40 watt moments, which give the staging a sombre and un-festive air. A valuable view, nonetheless, of the company and of Nureyev's classic ideals. Dance videos are listed every month in The Dancing Times, 45-47 Clerkenwell Green, London EC1 R OEB.

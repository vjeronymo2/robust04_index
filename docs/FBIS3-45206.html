While inspecting the two cities in Sichuan Province during  January 6-11, State Councillor Li Tieying said that Sichuan  should blaze a new trail of speeding up the reform and opening  wider to the outside world for other inland areas in the country.    The leader discussed how to promote the reform together with  executives of major state-owned companies in Chengdu, the  capital of Sichuan Province, and Chongqing, the leading  manufacturing and commercial center in southwest China. He also  visited a number of manufacturing companies in Chongqing.    Li, who is also the minister in charge of the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economy, asked local officials  to step up construction of transportation, telecommunications  and energy facilities in Sichuan Province.    "Sichuan should also try to promptly institute a new  economic  system and an efficient operational mechanism," he said.    The leader also asked local officials to attract more funds,  technology and personnel from other parts of China and the world.    Li said that current comprehensive reforms focus on the  transformation of the operational mechanism of state-owned  enterprises, the introduction of a modern enterprise system and  implementation of macro-economic controls.    "In the course of the reform the government serves both as a  director and the most important actor," he told local officials.    Therefore, government bodies must play a leading role in the  establishment of a modern enterprise system, while transforming  their own functions, he noted.    Li Tieying stressed the importance of freeing businesses  from  the burden of "running society" -- taking charge of all  employees' welfare -- by introducing a social security system.    "Only by solving that problem will enterprises be able to  become vigorous in market competition," he said.    Speaking of cultivating a market structure, the leader  stressed the need to promote the construction of production  factor markets, financial markets and technology markets, as  well as intermediate agencies such as accounting, auditing and  law offices.</p>

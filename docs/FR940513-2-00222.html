Berthold Community College; Little Hoop Community College (serving the Ft. Totten Reservation); and United Tribes Technical College, Bismarck.

Signed By: Mark D. Handley, President. Funds Requested: $34,517. Total Project Cost: $86,717. To purchase microwave equipment to improve the interconnection between two public radio repeater stations and the flagship station of New Hampshire Public Radio, Station WEVO&hyph;FM, 89.1 Mhz, Concord. One repearter, already on-air, is WEVH&hyph;FM (91.3 Mhz) in Hanover; the second, scheduled to go on-air in June 1994, is WEVN&hyph;FM (90.7 Mhz), in Keene. The proposed microwave STL systems would provide higher quality signals to the repeaters than are possible from off-air signals. The project would therefore allow approximately 67,000 residents of the Hanover and Keene areas to receive truly reliable public radio signals for the first time. This proposal would also allow for some regionalization of public radio services to the affected areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> File No. 94155 CTB University of New Hampshire, Rt. 155A, Mast Road, PO Box 1100, Durham, NH 03824.

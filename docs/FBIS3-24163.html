			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Panchenko: "A Chain Reaction to Acute </F> Problems"]    [Text] Late last year, against the background of the  continuously worsening energy crisis, the Supreme Soviet  rescinded the moratorium on introducing new capacities at the  republic's atomic power plants which it had adopted in August  1990. But the belated correction of the mistake was unable to  improve the situation in power engineering. Moreover, in  February practically all of Ukraine's AES's [nuclear electric  power plant] experienced a shortage of nuclear fuel. The  Zaporozhye AES had to "unload," that is to say lower, the output  of two units so that they could work through this year. The same  thing is happening at the Chernobyl and South Ukraine  plants.    Russia must be paid almost 50 billion rubles for  nuclear fuel elements. And no one knows how much the scarce  equipment for the units that have been brought back up at the  Rivno and Khmelnitskiy AES's costs now. Generally the problems  here are purely economic ones, but some deputies have not ceased  their attempts to blame Yeltsin and his government for our  troubles. Such a stand can only aggravate the crisis. For our  main enemy is ourselves. The populism, unprofessionalism, and  indifference of the parliamentarians and government bureaucrats  costs taxpayers too much.    It is not impossible that on the threshold of the  elections, some candidates for deputy will again try to play the  nuclear card. Voters should know what all this hysteria and  incompetence can cost all of us if this history repeats  itself.  <H5>  The Reverse Side of the Moratorium </H5>   The antinuclear euphoria on the shores of the Dnepr reached  a  peak in the summer of 1990. The republic was declared a hostage  of the atomic department of the former Union. The Communist  Party of Ukraine and communist deputies in parliament supported  the idea of a moratorium.    Hotheads who were superficially familiar with the problem  and  did not inconvenience themselves with proof assured the people  very emotionally that Ukraine would get along without AES's,  that if all the plants were closed no one would notice.    And the fact that 14 energy units with a total capacity of  12.8 million kilowatts are in operation at the 5 Ukrainian AES's  and that in 1990 they provided about one-third of all the  electricity produced in the republic was not taken into account.  Today atomic power plants bear 40 percent of the load.    Certain scientists and the minister of energy at that time,  Vitaliy Sklyarov, threw oil on the fire by trying to convince  everyone that Ukraine should build gas turbine-powered heat  plants rather than nuclear energy units. But what do you burn at  such plants? Ukraine satisfies 24 percent of its gas needs and 8  percent of its oil needs through its own production. And there  are depressing forecasts that this situation will get worse. But  we can be supplied with uranium for centuries.    These and other facts were published in the press at the  time  and rang out from the rostrum of the Supreme Soviet, but the  opinion of the specialists was not heeded. World experience was  also ignored. After all, France, with which people love to  compare Ukraine, produces 75 percent of its electricity at AES's  and, strange as it may seem, the French do not consider  themselves hostages of the nuclear monster.    Ukraine passed its peak of electricity production in 1988  (297.2 billion kilowatt hours). Since that time we have only  been lowering its production. There are two reasons for that:  first, half of the equipment of the heat plants have depleted  their service lives and need to be replaced. Secondly, the  extraction of energy media dropped both in Russia and in  Ukraine, but the prices for them increased. So last year the  republic was short 50 billion kilowatt hours as compared with  1988. But while the TES's [thermal electric power plants] reduce  production, AES's increase it every year. If not for the nuclear  units, back in the winter of 1991 Ukraine would have had to  introduce a scheduled energy delivery.    The symptoms of the disaster which has now begun were more  than obvious back at the time the decision on the moratorium was  adopted. It was also obvious that Ukraine could not do without  atomic energy--only uranium could really alleviate the shortage  of organic fuel. But even so the construction of AES's was  terminated.  <H5>  You Have To Pay for Everything </H5>   I am certain that the decision on the moratorium was adopted  without a serious economic expert study. If the deputies had  known the facts and figures cited below, everything would not  have happened so readily and smoothly.    So, in 1990 three million-watt units with VVER-1000  [water-moderated water-cooled] reactors which were not inferior  to similar Western ones in terms of safety were under  construction at the Zaporozhye, Rivno, and Khmelnitskiy AES's.  The cost of each one was a billion dollars. With international  prices for electricity at 6-7 cents per kilowatt hour, one year  of moratorium costs the country 500 million dollars. It is easy  to figure the direct losses, but the republic's actual losses  are much greater.    By putting up a barrier in the path of AES's, the Supreme  Soviet automatically terminated the development of high  technologies in Ukraine. For an atomic energy unit is the result  of the activity of dozens of scientific and production  collectives. The latest achievements of science and technology  are applied in designing and building it. In one moment they  became useless.    The construction workers were the first to begin to  disperse.  Then it was the turn of the operating personnel of the AES's  themselves. Highly qualified specialists, most of them young,  immediately understood that the moratorium would put an end to  their careers in Ukraine. No new units, no growth. And the  wages? In Russia a control operator earns 300 dollars a month  converted into hard currency, but at the Zaporozhye AES it is  one-tenth that.    A moratorium was imposed in our country, but Russia began to  launch its own nuclear energy program. Recruiters began to work  at Energodar and other AES's of Ukraine. They not only offered  the needed people a decent wage but even apartments. The  professionals whose training takes from 3 to 5 years began to  pack their suitcases. And not just one or two but by brigades  and shifts. Last year alone 325 people left the Zaporozhye GRES  [state regional electric power plant], and about 400 left the  atomic power plant!    Recently the director of the Zaporozhye AES, Vladimir  Bronnikov, announced that if the exodus of specialists is not  stopped, there will be simply no one to run Unit No 6. And will  other units become safer if novices sit at the control panel?    The overall collapse of industry has also had an effect on  the safety of atomic power plants. The moratorium forced plants  producing equipment for AES's to seek other orders, do simpler  things. The quality control system was destroyed and specialists  left. As a result many enterprises can no longer supply  equipment which meets the demands of atomic power engineering.  Ukraine is declining as a high technology country.    So the goals declared by the advocates of the moratorium  were  not achieved. Just the opposite. AES safety declined and  electricity production dropped. In the frozen units not only was  an enormous amount of capital and past labor paralyzed, but  every day they required considerable expenditures to maintain  and guard them. Ukraine's sick economy had a shortfall of  billions of dollars. All these streamlets of wastefulness and  irresponsibility made up the river of present-day inflation and  economic collapse.  <H5>  Courage Is the Lot of the Wise </H5>   The fact that the moratorium accomplished nothing but harm  was already clear in the fall of 1991. Even Zaporozhye Oblast,  which has three very large power plants, Dneproges [Dnepr  Hydroelectric Power Plant], a GRES, and an AES, with a total  capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts, had an energy  shortage at that time. Two of 18 ovens were in operation at  Dneprospetsstal [Dnepr Special Steel] and the aluminum combine  ceased production of silicon and thereby shut down dozens of  enterprises of Ukraine's electrical and radio engineering  industry. Let me remind you that this was 1991.    In 1992 the situation got even more complicated. The  appeals,  verbal and written, of the directors of the industrial  enterprises and power stations to the state's leaders did not  yield results. The parliament, with stubbornness that should  have been put to better use, stood its own. True, some of the  deputies understood the mistake, but most did not have enough  courage to acknowledge it from the rostrum.    But in the lobbies people suggested to the directors of  AES's  that they appeal to the government. Let it by its decree (since  it had the authority) rescind our decision. This shameful  haggling continued for a year! And only when the economy, and  she is a stern mistress in all respects, finally turned her back  on us did the people's chosen ones deign to do anything.  <H5>  What Is Ahead! </H5>   The moratorium was rescinded, but the problems it created  were not. The collective of the Zaporozhye AES is preparing to  launch Unit No 6. In fact this will be done in the coming  months. As for the reactors at the Rivno and Khmelnitskiy power  plants, there are more questions than answers.    In actuality, by 1990 the basic construction work in  Energodar was complete. The Zaporozhye workers provided No 6  with all the equipment, and despite the moratorium completed  installation at their own risk and prevented the unit from  collapsing for 3 years. People simply did not want to sink a  billion dollars into the sand, and, it is true, no one even said  thanks for this.    Construction was not completed on the units at the Rivno and  Khmelnitskiy AES's and all the equipment was not supplied. Now  it will have to be collected in all the countries of the near  abroad or production will have to be set up in Ukraine. It is  frightening to even speak of how much this is going to cost.  Specialists estimate that with strong state support, the units  could provide current in 1995-1996. But there can be no talk of  any support while the Ministry of Power Engineering owes the  Zaporozhye AES alone more than 30 billion karbovantsy for energy  already produced. Where can money be gotten when Ukraine owes  everyone? So the future of these units is very hazy and  uncertain.    The future of Ukraine's power engineering system is just as  hazy. The point is that even now the independent state does not  have a scientifically substantiated program of actions  reinforced with real resources for the sector as a whole or for  atomic energy in particular.    And meanwhile Ukraine's power engineering system continues  to  fall into the abyss. Because of the shortage of fuel, the output  of the Zaporozhye GRES, the largest in Europe, has dropped to  two-thirds its former level. The situation in the other heat  plants is no better either. In turn, because of the shortage of  electricity, many industrial enterprises have sharply reduced  production, or even stopped it, and in some cities of the  republic electricity is supplied to the population by schedule.    Is this really the kind of life we want?</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Brazil's leader begins shake-upof privatisation BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco has taken control of privatisation away from the National Development Bank (BNDES) in the first step of a shake-up of the programme. The news hit shares on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, which fell 5.2 per cent in response. The privatisation programme, begun in 1991 by former President Fernando Collor, has always been run by the Rio-based BNDES. However, Mr Franco, a past critic, apparently wants more influence over the programme, which he suspended on December 15 but has promised to restart in March after a thorough review. Mr Franco had been expected last night to sign an extensive decree altering the programme's rules and changing the composition of the privatisation commission. However, after an hour-long meeting with Mr Paulo Haddad, planning minister, and Mr Jose de Castro, his chief adviser on privatisation, he walked out casting doubt over the signing of the decree. Mr Antonio Barros de Castro, the recently appointed BNDES president, is known to have annoyed Mr Franco by recommending last week that the previous rules be maintained for the sale of 35 companies slated for privatisation. Mr Jose de Castro yesterday dismissed investor fears that the programme would not be restarted and insisted the next sale would go ahead on March 10 but under new rules. The decree prepared by Mr Haddad and Mr Jose de Castro is expected to leave to presidential discretion on a case-by-case basis the issue of a minimum cash participation in the sales. Until now most of the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) raised through privatisation has taken the form of domestic debt. According to Mr Jose de Castro the objective of the new rules is 'to guarantee more transparency and legal security. All sell-offs done so far have been sub judice because of badly elaborated decrees and unclear regulations'.</p>

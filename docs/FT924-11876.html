			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Chambers call for capital spending BRITISH Chambers of Commerce, the umbrella organisation for regional chambers, called on the government yesterday to restore business confidence through a 10-point programme embracing increased capital spending and deregulation. But after presenting a bleak survey of business conditions, Mr Christopher Stewart Smith, British Chambers president, warned against 'a reckless dash for growth'. The British Chambers' members in manufacturing, construction and service industries would not be best served by a new sharp cut in bank base rates from their present 8 per cent level, he said. There were 'no simple fixes' for the economy. Mr Stewart Smith called on the government to: Maintain vital capital spending, giving priority to infrastructure investment, especially in transport. Provide more support for export promotion. Manage the public-sector pay round so that increases are less than inflation. Push for an agreement in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Hold down the uniform business rate (UBR). Proceed with deregulation, particularly by cutting red tape for small and medium-sized businesses. Improve public-sector payment terms so small companies are not left waiting for bill payment. Exempt empty properties from the UBR. Improve the support services given to businesses, especially small companies. Liberalise European air transport. Mr Stewart Smith said the cost of making business trips to Europe was increasingly prohibitive, especially for small companies. He said the government was in a strong position to boost business confidence. New roads to the east coast ports, the Channel tunnel link, and the Jubilee and Crossrail lines in London were 'vital for the future competitive-ness of British business and the efficiency of the capital'.</p>

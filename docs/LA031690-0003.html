			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PET ISSUE IS BACK IN THE SADDLE;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS: IN A REPLAY OF THE FAMILIAR RAGTIME TUNE, CITY ASKS A RESIDENT  TO GET RID OF TWO MINIATURE HORSES.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks, which lost one legal tiff over a miniature horse named Ragtime,  has decided to wage another legal battle -- this time with a man who keeps two  of the small horses in his back yard at a housing tract.  </P> <P> City officials are asking Greg Bowlay to remove the miniature horses from his  house on Calle Castano because they say his 13,000-square-foot lot is too  small.  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. Nancy Kierstyn Schreiner said the city wants to send a  message to the community that miniature horses are unwelcome in densely  populated residential areas, despite a judge's decision allowing Patty and  Richard Fairchild to keep their miniature horse, Ragtime, at their home on  Shady Brook Drive.  </P> <P> Bowlay, who has been issued two municipal citations for having the horses, said  he plans to battle the city in court. He has pleaded not guilty, and the case  is scheduled to be heard by a Ventura County municipal judge on April 10. The  maximum penalty for each citation is $1,000.  </P> <P> Schreiner said she is confident that Thousand Oaks can win the fight against  Bowlay because it has eliminated loopholes in its ordinance regulating  miniature horses that resulted in a three-year losing struggle in the Ragtime  case.  </P> <P> In September, 1987, a Ventura municipal judge dismissed the city's case against  the Fairchilds because, he said, the part of the Thousand Oaks zoning code  dealing with horses was poorly worded.  </P> <P> As a result, the city adopted a new ordinance prohibiting a single horse of any  size on a lot smaller than 20,000 square feet. That stipulation was missing  from the previous ordinance, Schreiner said.  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks then cited the Fairchilds under the revised ordinance. But a  municipal judge ruled that, because of Ragtime's size, the miniature horse was  considered a domestic pet under city regulations and could remain at the Shady  Brook Drive home.  </P> <P> Since then, the city, which received worldwide attention in the Ragtime case,  again changed its ordinance. The definition of a domestic pet was altered to  include dogs, cats, tropical fish, small rodents and small reptiles. It defined  miniature horses, as well as pot-bellied pigs and other small animals, as  livestock and prohibited them in densely populated areas.  </P> <P> Bowlay said the city is trying to "save face" after losing the Ragtime battle  by unfairly targeting him.  </P> <P> "They took that loss very personally," Bowlay said. "Now they're coming after  me."  </P> <P> Schreiner said the case has nothing to do with the city's pride. She said her  office has received several complaints from neighbors who say Bowlay's horses  stink. Moreover, the city is enforcing its ordinance, which was adopted to  protect the community, she said.  </P> <P> "People have to consider their neighbors," Schreiner said. "You don't bring  pigs, horses and goats into a housing tract . . . where people are living close  together."  </P> <P> Bowlay, a former state Department of Corrections officer who has been out of  work because of a medical disability, said two miniature horses, named Apache  and Chips, have been kept in a large pen in his back yard since July.  </P> <P> He said he bought Chips for his daughter, Rachelle, 6, and liked him so much  that he bought Apache for himself.  </P> <P> "I consider them pets," Bowlay said. "They're part of my family."  </P> <P> Philip R. Dunn, Bowlay's attorney, said he has a good case against the city.  But he conceded that it will be more difficult to beat City Hall this time  around.  </P> <P> "They have learned from their mistakes," Dunn said. "You get caught with your  pants down the first time; the second time, you know what you've done wrong."  </P></p>

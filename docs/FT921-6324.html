			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Lib Dems defend remit of EC Social Charter LEGISLATION from the European Community's Social Charter merely reflects what good employers already do, and would affect only the less reputable, Mr Jim Wallace, the Liberal Democrat employment spokesman, said yesterday. Addressing a Sign the Social Charter meeting organised by the Trades Union Congress, Mr Wallace stressed that his party rejected the government's 'opt-out' from the Social Charter in spite of some hostile comments made about the charter by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader. Ms Rhiannon Chapman, director of the Industrial Society, the independent organisation that promotes good industrial relations, suggested an exchange-rate-mechanism style banding for more controversial proposals in the social field. A banding formula, allowing a multi-speed social Europe, would widen support for proposals and increase the likelihood of compliance by providing an 'interim stage on the way to full implementation', she said. Ms Jill Andrew, chair of the social legislation committee of the London Chamber of Commerce, said the implementation of the Social Charter in its current form would result in increased job-shedding if companies were forced to cut costs to accommodate directives.</p>

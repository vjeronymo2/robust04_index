			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Miyazawa defeat throws Japan intopolitical turmoil: Snap election is forced as rebel who toppled PM plans new party JAPAN was plunged into political instability last night as the ruling Liberal Democratic party was forced to call a snap election after the humiliation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, in a no-confidence vote. The LDP, which has ruled the country since 1955, was in chaos as members of the 35-strong faction led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, a former finance and agriculture minister, voted against the party in favour of the no-confidence motion. The Hata faction is expected to form its own political party shortly. A further 10 members from a separate LDP faction announced the formation of a political group. More defections are expected today. The no-confidence vote, proposed by three opposition parties, was prompted by an inconclusive debate over the reform of the scandal-prone political system. The government's failure to tackle the issue enraged members of Mr Hata's pro-reform faction, and the no-confidence motion was carried by 35 votes. After his defeat, a distressed Mr Miyazawa was compelled to dissolve the lower house, the more powerful of the two Japanese houses, and call an election. He claimed to have supported political reform, specifically an overhaul of the electoral system, but that 'change was very difficult to bring about'. 'What happened was very unfortunate,' a dejected-looking Mr Miyazawa said. 'I was called a liar but that's not true . . . I really thought I would be able to achieve political reform.' Under Japan's constitution, the election must be held within 40 days, meaning that the campaign period will include the Group of Seven summit, due to begin in Tokyo on July 7, at which Mr Miyazawa had hoped to impress as an international statesman. Business leaders expressed fears last night that the country faced an extended period of political turmoil, which will limit the government's ability to cope with an economic downturn and to deal with the increased pressure from the country's trading partners, particularly the US. Television opinion polls put the prime minister's popularity at a mere 10 per cent last night, suggesting that the LDP was unlikely to win a parliamentary majority in the forthcoming poll and raising doubts about the relationship between the party and the bureaucracy that has guided post-war Japan. Senior LDP officials demanded that the defectors be expelled from the party. Mr Hata said he did not want to vote against his party, but had 'no choice' but to bring down the government. 'We have entered a new era in Japanese politics. I am sure we will see a realignment of the political system,' Mr Hata said. He is hoping events will encourage more LDP members to join him in a new party and that he will able to lure representatives from opposition parties. Mr Yoshiro Mori, the minister of international trade and industry, expressed widespread concern that economic policy-making will stall when the economy appears to have touched bottom. Business leaders wanted the government to introduce another stimulatory package in August, but the election and the prospect of continuing chaos in the LDP have left the package in doubt.

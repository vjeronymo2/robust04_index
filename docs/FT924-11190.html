			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Bankers support Gerald Ronson BANKERS TO Heron, the heavily indebted property group, who are meeting to discuss restructuring proposals on Thursday, are happy that Mr Gerald Ronson should remain as chief executive. However he is thought likely to give up the chair since the restructuring is expected to involve a large element of debt being swapped into equity, substantially cutting the proportion of the equity controlled by the Ronson family and its charitable trusts. In many recent cases where companies have sought help from their creditors, the banks have demanded the departure of existing management. In Heron's case, though, Mr Ronson is seen as capable of handling the controlled disposal of assets which will be recommended to the group's creditors as the best way of recouping their loans. The group owes about Pounds 1.4bn to its banks and bondholders. An external non-executive chairman is expected to be appointed.</p>

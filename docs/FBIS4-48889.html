			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 1 (XINHUA) -- About 50,000 Muscovites  today rallied peacefully in the Russian capital to mark May Day,  and some chanted anti-government slogans.    At 09:00 Moscow time (06:00 GMT), about 25,000 people  started  the celebration Marching along Moscow's central Tverskaya Street  from Triumfalnaya (Triumph) Square to rally on Manezh Square  near the Kremlin.    The parade accompanied by two orchestras was organized by  the  Federation of Labor Unions.    Addressing the rally, Mikhail Nagaitsev, chairman of the  Moscow Federation of Labor Unions, urged the government to  introduce a legislative bill making the withholding of salaries  and wages a crime, to index salaries to inflation rate and adopt  a state employment program, as well as intensify the work of  law-enforcement bodies in their fight against crime and  corruption.    "We are in favor of (the civic) accord and civic peace, but  not at the expense of the working people, of depriving the  common people of their rights," he said.    One hour later, another parade, sponsored by the Russian  Communist Party and other political parties, marched practically  along the same route. It also held a meeting on Tverskaya  Square, with nearly the same number of demonstrators.    At 10:00 Moscow time (07:00 GMT), about 20,000 demonstrators  rallied on October Square holding anti-government banners and  slogans.    The demonstration was called by the Liberal-Patriotic Party  Renewal along with the Russian Communist Workers' Party (RCWP),  and the All-Russia Communist Party of Bolsheviks.    The RCWP leader Viktor Anpilov appealed over loudspeaker for  a nationwide political strike scheduled for early October. He  stressed the need to rebuild socialism in Russia.    After their first meeting, the demonstrators, which were  joined by Russian Communist Party leader Anatoliy Zyuganov and  former Soviet speaker Anatoliy Lukyanov, marched toward  University Square at 11:45 Moscow time (8:45 GMT) for an  additional meeting there.    The current labor day coincides with the easter Sunday in  Russia, and also with the one-year anniversary of a bloody  conflict between demonstrators and police in Moscow. Over 150  people were injured in the clash.</p>

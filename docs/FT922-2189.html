			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: South Africa may abolish agricultural marketing boards SOUTH AFRICAN agriculture could be faced with a radical overhaul of its marketing structures following the government's decision to appoint an independent committee to investigate whether agricultural control boards should be abolished. The decision follows in the wake of a report published by the Board on Tariffs and Trade into food prices, which recommends that the statutory powers of control boards be abolished, with farmers free to market their produce as they choose. Agricultural control boards - there are 22 in the country - suffered a further setback earlier this month when the Cape Supreme Court ruled null and void charges levied by the Milk Board on farmers. All marketing boards finance their activities by levying producers. The BTT report arose out of concern at the very high level of food price inflation. Public criticism rose to a crescendo earlier this year when the Central Statistical Service published figures suggesting that food price inflation was running at 29 per cent per annum. The board focused on the divergence between producer and consumer prices in respect of six basic food sectors - red meat, maize, dairy, vegetables, broiler chickens and wheat - which averaged 5.1 per cent during the period 1980-91. The report concluded that control board schemes contributed 1.5 per cent of the 5.1 per cent discrepancy. One of its recommendations for breaking the inflationary spiral was to scrap control boards, which it felt were contributing to a high degree of concentration in the intermediate levels of the food supply chain. The government has clearly had its hand forced in announcing the investigation. Although the trend in agricultural policy in recent years has been towards allowing greater play to market forces, Mr Kraai van Niekerk, the minister of agriculture, showed little enthusiasm in a recent interview for grasping the nettle of the control boards. He noted, correctly, that agriculture was in a transition phase from controls to free markets, but he was clear that the initiative for reform should come from farmers not the government. 'If government is too prescriptive you run the risk of failure. It comes back to you. The farmers must decide. I'm not willing to decide' said Mr van Niekerk. The BTT report, and the attendant clamour about food prices, forced him to change his tune. Although there are exceptions, like deciduous fruit and sugar, control boards in many industries have become alienated from the producers they purport to represent. They are seen in the public eye not so much as representatives of agriculture as a self-serving and unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. The boards are not going to give up without a fight. Mr Fanie van Rensburg, chairman of the Agricultural Marketing Boards Co-ordinating Committee has criticised the BTT report as prejudiced and said it would be strongly contested.</p>

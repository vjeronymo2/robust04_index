			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News in Brief Consolidated pre-tax profits at Tabacalera, the state-owned Spanish tobacco monopoly, are understood to have fallen by more than 13 per cent to Pta18.9bn (dollars 161m) last year, despite a small 3.5 per cent pre-tax profit increase, to Pta20bn, at the parent company itself, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. The group figures are understood to have been hit by poor results from the Philip Morris operation in Spain, in which Tabacalera has a 50 per cent stake, and by the incorporation of Elosua, the loss-making edible oils group, of which Tabacalera took control last year. Unofficial figures have Tabacalera's 1992 group sales 7.6 per cent up at Pta700.4bn. The group is a potential candidate for some form of privatisation later this year, and is also on the verge of selling its Royal Brands foods subsidiary.</p>

The students set up roadblocks of branches and burning tyres  at all intersections and blocked off the bridge across the Niger  River linking the city centre to their campus.    About l00 police drove some 200 students back to the campus.    The students were calling for the punishment of all those  involved in the death of a student a week ago, when police  raided the campus to break up a demonstration of protest against  arrears in payment of study grants.    The student was hit full in the face by a teargas canister  and died of the wounds next day.    Friday's demonstrators demanded in particular the immediate  sacking of Niamey's Mayor Souleymane Abari, who is also district  administrator with police powers.    Government spokesman Mouctar Diallo set out a timetable for  paying the missing subsidies late Thursday, but the student  union said the gesture was a deliberate misreading of their call  for punishment of the culprits in the campus death.    Apart from the paramilitary police contingent, there were no  policemen in the streets because their national union with 1,700  members has called a strike in support of the colleagues accused  by the students.</p>

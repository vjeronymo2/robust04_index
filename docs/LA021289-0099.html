			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLO'S PEACE MOVES ERODE SUPPORT IN LEBANON CAMPS  </P> <P> The Palestine Liberation Organization is struggling to hold onto its  grass-roots followers in refugee camps across Lebanon as refugees rebel against  Chairman Yasser Arafat's moves to open peace talks with Israel.  </P> <P> In Rashidiyeh, an impoverished camp near Tyre in southern Lebanon, hundreds of  demonstrators marched in protest last month, brandishing rifles, chanting  slogans and waving the red, white, green and black Palestinian flag. A week  later, residents of the Ein el Hilwa camp in the port of Sidon, 25 miles north  of Tyre, also protested.  </P> <P> The refugees are chafing under orders issued by the PLO's majority Fatah  faction, headed by Arafat, to refrain from infiltrating and making raids on  Israel -- the traditional, if largely unsuccessful, strategy of the past. They  also complain bitterly about an economic squeeze caused by salary cuts that  Arafat ordered for guerrillas languishing in the camps.  </P> <P> "It is hard to tell fighters that after 20 years or 40 years, they may have to  do something else, stop fighting for now, take up a trade," one Western relief  official said. "This is a problem with all such movements, and it is a problem  for the PLO."  </P> <P> The restlessness indicates the PLO's difficulties in gaining support for its  new, moderate policy, which has shifted away from fighting Israel and toward  creation of a Palestinian state. And it suggests its leaders do not have  unlimited time to show results.  </P> <P> An official of an international relief agency in Lebanon observed: "There is a  feeling the clock is ticking on Arafat. He has to work hard to convince his  people that he is not wasting time."  </P> <P> To ease discontent, the PLO recently dispatched top officials from Beirut to  the camps to insist that Arafat's diplomacy is gaining ground and that the  budget cuts -- designed to divert funds to the 14-month-old Palestinian  uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip -- are temporary.  </P> <P> As an added morale booster, a group of 13 Palestinians recently expelled from  the occupied territories lectured the refugees on the gains of the intifada, as  the uprising is known.  </P> <P> The refugees' hard-edged attitude reflects the debate among the PLO's top  officials, Lebanese and Palestinian sources say.  </P> <P> In recent days, reports from Tunisia, where the PLO maintains its headquarters,  have exposed a growing impatience with Washington. Since talks between the  United States and the PLO began in December, the Americans have tried to focus  mainly on ending terrorism, PLO officials say, while the Palestinians want to  focus on ways to bring Israel to the negotiating table.  </P> <P> "It's very disappointing," said one aide to a PLO leader who has met with the  Americans. "They're not saying anything about the behavior of the Israelis, who  are killing civilians every day in the occupied territories."  </P> <P> Another PLO spokesman added: "At the beginning, they talked of a substantial  dialogue, but all we hear from them these days is quibbles. If they think this  is the way to influence the PLO, I think they'll get negative results."  </P> <P> In regrets expressed to a Lebanese newspaper, Nayef Hawatmeh, head of the  radical Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of five PLO  factions, lamented the willingness of "rightist" PLO officials to surrender  "national unity" in favor of talks with the Americans.  </P> <P> Hawatmeh seemed to directly challenge the hold of Arafat's Fatah on the PLO by  calling for an end to "dominant control" by any one segment of the  organization.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attacks on Israel  </P> <P> Radical PLO factions like Hawatmeh's are promising out-of-work guerrillas that  they can take part in attacks on the northern frontier of Israel if they bolt  from Fatah, Arab and Western sources say. The factions consider refugee camps,  where poverty and isolation are softened only by dreams of "struggle,"  "advance" and "victory," to be fertile ground for their appeals.  </P> <P> A unit of the Marxist-led Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,  another PLO faction out of Arafat's direct control, recently attempted to raid  Israel in what was considered a display of purpose designed to contrast with  Fatah's impotence. Israeli troops operating in Israel's security zone in  southern Lebanon aborted the raid, shooting five Palestinians in an ambush.  </P> <P> News of the failed operation fueled the latest Israeli efforts to persuade the  United States to drop contact with the PLO on grounds that it is still wedded  to terrorism. In response, the U.S. ambassador in Tunisia expressed  Washington's "concern" over the commando action to PLO officials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discontent in Territories  </P> <P> As Arafat's talks with the United States limp along, indications of discontent  in the West Bank and Gaza also have surfaced. Both the Popular Front and  Islamic fundamentalists operating there have criticized Arafat's willingness to  recognize Israel's right to exist.  </P> <P> The simmering skepticism is having an effect on tactics inside the intifada,  reported one Palestinian source in Jerusalem, who is in contact with intifada  leaders. After a few months of drift, intifada leaders are considering stepping  up protests, beginning in March.  </P> <P> Although the opening of talks with Washington was an accomplishment, it is not  an end in itself, the leaders have decided, and the uprising will have to pick  up steam if something more is to come out of it.  </P> <P> In Lebanon, both Arab and Western sources report, the unhappiness has prompted  Palestinians to take to the streets.  </P> <P> About 150,000 Palestinians live in refugee camps run by the United Nations in  Lebanon; another 135,000 reside outside the camps, although they are still  registered as refugees. Altogether, about 1.5 million refugees reside in  Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, making up a sizable constituency for the PLO. In the  West Bank and Gaza, 800,000 Palestinians are registered as refugees out of a  total population of 1.7 million.  </P> <P> The first demonstration against Arafat's policies erupted in Rashidiyeh, a camp  of 17,000 where political divisions sharpened after Arafat recognized Israel  last fall. So split on the question is Rashidiyeh that various sectors in the  camp are controlled by different PLO factions. Passage from one cinder-block  neighborhood to another depends upon the whims of armed mini-militias -- a  version of the fractured geography of Lebanese cities, like Beirut, gripped by  civil war.  </P> <P> "In this camp, Fatah has not imposed its control," said Hassan, a Lebanese  member of a local militia that has access to the camp. "To do so now would mean  war, and it wants to avoid that. So it lets things go on in this tense way."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Effort to Dispel Tension  </P> <P> As part of the effort to dispel that tension, the group of Palestinians  expelled from the West Bank and Gaza Strip had planned to affirm Arafat's  leadership as the most representative of all Palestinian interests.  </P> <P> "We have to get everyone unified. We are united in the intifada, and that is  what has kept us going," said Rizek Bayari, a local leader from Gaza.  </P> <P> When asked about the divisions among the refugees, Bayari responded with the  colorful, if sometimes empty, Arab rhetoric: "Sometimes when brothers live in  the same house, they fight. But they are still brothers."  </P> <P> Reporters who encountered the traveling exiles in Tyre were barred from going  with them into Rashidiyeh. Passions were too raw for exposure to foreigners,  the Palestinians explained.  </P> <P> Bayari conceded that some aspects of the PLO's new moderation were bound to  bother the refugees, notably its ambiguity about the "right of return," a  long-held dogma among Palestinians.  </P> <P> The "right of return" claims the prerogative of all Palestinians to go back to  their place of origin, even if it is now inside Israel proper. Thousands of  Arabs were driven from their homes during various Israeli-Arab wars.  </P> <P> Recently, Palestinians in the West Bank have begun to speak of exchanging the  "right of return" for monetary compensation. But such a move would leave  refugees like those in Rashidiyeh in a foreign land among clannish people who  have never welcomed their presence.  </P> <P> "The question of the right of return should be the last one brought up in any  negotiation," the Palestinian source in Jerusalem said. "It is the one that  could bring Arafat the most trouble."  </P></p>

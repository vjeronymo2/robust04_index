			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR AOUN CAUSE: CRADLE TO GRAVE  </P> <P> An East Beirut woman who gave birth to triplet boys last week made it clear  that in the beleaguered Christian enclave, military recruiting begins in the  cradle.  </P> <P> "I'm happy to have three boys," she said proudly in a television interview. "We  Christians must increase our numbers."  </P> <P> The new mother and other residents of Lebanon's 310-square-mile Christian  sector continue to rally behind the commander of the Lebanese army, Maj. Gen.  Michel Aoun, in his "war of liberation" against Syrian troops and their  Lebanese Muslim allies.  </P> <P> There are about 1 million Christians in Lebanon, but the power and influence  traditionally accorded them are in jeopardy. Christians now account for just  40% of the population, and they are counting on Aoun, who heads one of  Lebanon's two rival governments, to maintain their predominance against the  Muslim majority and its Syrian supporters.  </P> <P> Outside heavily populated areas of East Beirut and its suburbs, the Christian  enclave includes scores of coastal towns and mountain villages, none of them  entirely free of the conflict.  </P> <P> In one mountainside village, Mazraat Kfardibiane, an 8-year-old Christian boy,  recently challenged a friend to a game of chess. When his opponent chose the  black pieces, he announced, "You are Syria." Setting up the white pieces, he  said, "I am Lebanon."  </P> <P> For most Beirut children, formal education stopped last March, when shelling by  Christian and Syrian forces made schooling secondary to survival. But for many  of Lebanon's youngsters, political education at their parents' feet has begun  where the three R's stopped.  </P> <P> Political commitment to Aoun's cause has also caught the imagination of young  Christian men who once preferred the life of the militias.  </P> <P> "They are volunteering (for the regular army)," said a resident of Elysar, a  community between East Beirut and the port of Juniyah. "They don't even want  basic pay."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Dissent  </P> <P> In Christian towns, political discussions over endless cups of coffee produce  little dissent. Any attempt to play the devil's advocate is met with suspicion.  The Arabic label khayyin, or traitor, is applied to those who don't share the  battle cry, "Syria out of Lebanon!"  </P> <P> It is becoming equally popular as an epithet against those who question that  Aoun will be Lebanon's next president. There has been no elected head of  government since last September, when Parliament failed to agree on a successor  to President Amin Gemayel. When his term expired, Gemayel left Lebanon in the  hands of Aoun, his army commander, who has adopted the title of premier -- as  has Salim Hoss, the head of a rival Muslim government in West Beirut.  </P> <P> "I support Aoun in his war against Syria, but I do not necessarily want him for  president," said a resident of Douma, a mountain village. Aware that this is  political heresy, he spoke out of earshot of his family and friends.  </P> <P> Most Christians are feeling singularly oppressed by the five months of war,  which started when Aoun attempted to take control of ports run by Muslim  militias in defiance of his government. Blockaded and shelled since March,  residents of the eastern sector often liken their struggle against the Syrians  to that of the Algerians against France, Afghans against the Soviet Union and  Vietnamese against the United States.  </P> <P> The heart of Aoun's support is in East Beirut, an area he wrested from the  rightist Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces, in February. His turf is  clearly marked with posters of the 54-year-old general framed by a Lebanese  flag.  </P> <P> While his popularity extends throughout the enclave, Aoun's direct influence is  limited in wide areas still under the control of Samir Geagea, 37, commander of  the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces. There are no Aoun posters where the militia  maintains its camps.  </P> <P> "We don't like Geagea, but people are afraid to put up Aoun," a Douma resident  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROJECT CRITICIZED FOR LACK OF CLASS  </P> <P> About 50 Agoura area residents have told developers that a proposed 474-acre  commercial and residential project is too dense and not classy enough for their  semi-rural community.  </P> <P> Wickliff &amp; Co. and the Pulte Home Corp. want to build 338 housing units and  261,700 square feet of commercial space, including a discount retail store,  near Agoura and Kanan roads. They are calling the proposal the Agoura Canyon  Ranch.  </P> <P> In a town hall-style meeting in Agoura Hills punctuated by shouting Tuesday  night, residents said the proposal would clog traffic on already busy roads.  The proposal includes 126 condominiums, which some residents said would be out  of character with the community of large estate homes to the south. Others  objected to the discount store.  </P> <P> The project is "low-end rather than upper-end," resident Michael Genthe said.  "You're proposing such a non-consistent development compared to what's there  today."  </P> <P> "We don't need it, and we don't want it," resident Gary Epper said.  </P> <P> Developers' representatives defended the proposal, saying that the discount  store would serve the community and that the condominiums would satisfy  requirements for low-cost housing.  </P> <P> "We're not proposing a cheap-production thing," said Robert W. Smith, vice  president of Pulte Home. "These can be fairly expensive things that will add to  the value of the community." The project would include 80 estate-sized houses  on lots averaging two acres.  </P> <P> In addition, the developers said, the city of Agoura Hills would receive $3.3  million in fees for traffic improvements.  </P> <P> The city could use that money to pay for new on- and off-ramps to the eastbound  Ventura Freeway at Kanan Road, estimated to cost $2.9 million, City Manager  David N. Carmany said.  </P> <P> The site of the proposed project straddles the southern border of Agoura Hills,  with the area proposed for houses and condominiums in unincorporated Los  Angeles County territory.  </P> <P> If the city were to annex the unincorporated area, Wickliff and Pulte would  have to seek zoning changes to permit the housing density they are proposing,  Carmany said.  </P> <P> Project officials said they did not know how much housing is allowed under the  county plan for the area.  </P> <P> Robert L. Anderson, Wickliff vice president, promised to hold another meeting  in about a month to respond to those and other questions, such as the issue of  possible flooding from Medea Creek.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 6 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] on Thursday accused Law and Order Minister Hernus  Kriel of "PAC bashing" and of "demonising" Transkei military  leader Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa. PAC national organiser Maxwell  Nemadzivhanani was reacting to reports that Mr Kriel had linked  Transkei to the St James Church and Heidelberg Tavern massacres.    Mr Nemadzvhanani said in a statement the recent arrests of  PAC western Cape leaders Theo Mabusela and Michael Siyolo, as  well as attempts to link Transkei to Azanian Peoples Liberation  Army [APLA] attacks on South Africa, were "part of the regime's  strategy to target the PAC in those areas where it is strong".  He accused "the same forces" for arresting PAC leaders and  members in a "nation-wide swoop" in May 1993 and "killing  children" in a raid on a house in Transkei in October last year.    "Following the Kenilworth church gun attack in July 1993 in  Cape Town, the regime summarily arrested Vuyo Tekane, a PAC  activist and schoolteacher allegedly for masterminding alleged  APLA activities. "Tekane, according to police allegations then,  was also linked to the 1922 APLA attack at a King William's Town  golf club. Once again Tekane was released from detention without  being charged for the alleged offences," Mr Nemadzivhanani said.    He said from all the cases or "so-called police  breakthroughs" a clear picture had emerged of "camouflaged  hostilities" against the PAC in the guise of maintaining law and  order. "The PAC strongly condemns the detention of Comrades Theo  Mabusela and Michael Siyolo as pure political gangsterism by the  (President F W) de Klerk regime, designed to manipulate the  transition and eventually the outcome of the election by  'unlevelling' the playing field against the PAC and thus rigging  the elections long before they start," Mr Nemadzvhanani said.    Mr Nemadzvhanani's statement was issued to SAPA shortly  before Mr Kriel on Wednesday announced the arrest of two alleged  APLA members in connection with the Heidelberg Tavern attack.</p>

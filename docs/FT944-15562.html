			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Union against sell-off of division of UK Atomic Energy Authority The sale of a division of the UK Atomic Energy Authority has run into strong opposition from unions, which last night threatened industrial action unless staff concerns were met, Alison Maitland writes. The authority announces today that it is inviting bids for its Facilities Services Division, which provides engineering, maintenance, security and other services for its six sites. The sale is part of the restructuring of the authority. Its nuclear installations are to remain in public hands, but technology and consultancy services are due to be privatised as AEA Technology. The authority wants to sell the services division separately. The IPMS specialists civil-service union, which represents 200 managers, engineers and technicians employed by the authority, said 92 per cent had opposed the sale in a ballot in which 73 per cent had voted. Mr John Billard, national officer, said the authority had refused to show it the memorandum of sale and was allowing it to consult with the preferred bidder on terms and conditions only after the exchange of contracts. He said: 'UKAEA have drawn up a new pension scheme which will abandon index-linking and will freeze increases at 5 per cent a year.' Coopers and Lybrand, financial advisers on the sale, said the authority would sell only to a business prepared to preserve terms and conditions.</p>

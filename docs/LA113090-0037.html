			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SMALL-BOAT OWNERS FEAR MARINA EXPANSION  </P> <P> With a salary of $6.50 an hour and bills that include monthly child support  payments, John Thompson figures he's living pretty lean. Sure, he's got a  sailboat. But the 22-footer is hardly a yacht. If it were, Thompson says, he  wouldn't mind paying more than the current $160 a month for a slip in San  Pedro.  </P> <P> But now, as the Los Angeles Harbor Department considers expanding the port-run  Cabrillo Marina, many small boaters like Thompson face a difficult choice: Move  or pay for larger slips than they need.  </P> <P> Prompted by the success of the $45-million Cabrillo Marina, the Harbor  Department is planning to add 1,510 slips to its marina south of 22nd Street by  1994. To do this, port officials intend to evict four private marina operators  who have been in business for decades and replace their old wooden docks with  concrete wharfs that cater to larger boats. The average slip will measure 42  feet, and none will be shorter than 30 feet.  </P> <P> The plans for larger slips, officials say, are backed by studies showing that  the best use for slips at Cabrillo Marina and elsewhere is to berth larger  boats. "We've found that when vacancies occur, they tend to be at smaller slips  -- those have the highest turnover and the lowest demand," said Mark Richter,  the port's assistant property manager.  </P> <P> Moreover, port officials say many of the nearly 200 smaller boats (less than 30  feet long) that occupy slips in the private marinas can easily be put on  trailers and launched from ramps. That is especially true for powerboats,  Richter said, conceding that some sailboats pose hauling and storage problems  because of their keels and masts.  </P> <P> Private marina operators and small-boat owners take issue with the port's  attitude, saying they deserve better treatment.  </P> <P> "The small-boat owners were the ones who built these marinas . . . and this is  unfair to them," said Valerie Gerkey, dockmaster for the 450-slip Fleitz  Brothers marina, the largest of the four to be evicted by the port. "I mean,  everybody with a boat is not rich . . . and there will be a lot of people who  won't be able to handle" the fees for larger slips.  </P> <P> Thompson, a 29-year-old boat repairman, agreed: "Why should I pay for a 30-foot  slip when I have a 22-foot boat?" A larger slip would cost at least $50 more a  month, he said. "It's just unfair."  </P> <P> So far, Gerkey and other marina operators say, the port's plans to expand the  Cabrillo Marina have drawn little attention because they are incomplete and  have not been publicized. "Nobody knows what the plan is, exactly," said Steve  Gossett, assistant manager of Holiday Harbor Marina. "I have a feeling that  when they do, there is going to be quite a commotion."  </P> <P> Though the Harbor Department has begun to make way for the new marina by  issuing a demolition permit for the Navy's fuel dock, port officials say they  are months away from finalizing the marina's design. No date has been set for  the evictions, but it is certain that the private operators will be gone. And  many of their small-boat customers may follow.  </P> <P> "It's going to hurt a lot of people. A lot of people won't be able to have  boats anymore," said Donald Holland, foreman of the 110-slip Cabrillo Boat  Shop, owned by his father, Rolland.  </P> <P> "I don't know where they're going to go," said Kathy Geiger, who manages  Shelter Point Marina, which opened in San Pedro 35 years ago.  </P> <P> With all but nine of its 79 slips measuring less than 30 feet, Shelter Point  Marina has catered to smaller boats whose owners haven't had to pay for one  foot more of slip space than they needed, Geiger said. They include Thompson,  whose 22-foot sailboat, "Das Boat," has been in a 22-foot slip at Shelter Point  for four years.  </P> <P> Another Shelter Point tenant, Candace Rivilla, is a part-time schoolteacher who  lives aboard a 27-foot sailboat with her husband and daughter. "People think  that if you own a boat, you're wealthy," Rivilla said. "And it just isn't  true."  </P> <P> The rent increase is "going to be a problem for some of our neighbors who like  to just come down on weekends and use their boats," Rivilla said, predicting  that it will force some to give up their boats. "The sport sailors are the ones  who are really going to suffer."  </P> <P> Port officials dispute that claim. They say expanding the marina will provide  more slips and better facilities for boaters. "The current facilities are in  deplorable condition," Richter said.  </P> <P> The expansion plans, he said, include concrete floats to replace the old,  weathered wooden docks and three new hoists for boats that are not moored at  the marina.  </P> <P> Richter said the eventual slip prices will be reasonable, given the new  amenities for boaters. "The rent will be commensurate with the quality of  facilities," he said.  </P> <P> But as they wait for the port's plans to take shape, the private marina  operators and some boaters say the Harbor Department has put the squeeze on the  little guy.  </P> <P> "I can understand that the port is in the business to make money. But I think  they should provide water space for smaller boats," Geiger said.  </P> <P> "Come down on a weekend and see which boats have gone sailing. It's not the big  boys. All of them are in port. It's the small boats that are out there."  </P></p>

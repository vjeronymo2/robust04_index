			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Jobs cuts force charge on Merck MERCK, the world's biggest drugs group, yesterday said it was taking a pre-tax Dollars 775m (Pounds 516m) second-quarter charge to cover voluntary redundancies and other cost-cutting measures. The group added that it would cut about 2,100 jobs by the end of this year, about 1,100 more than previously announced. Stripping out the charges, Merck posted a 9 per cent rise in underlying second-quarter profits to Dollars 693.6m, or 61 cents a share, against Dollars 643m, or 56 cents, last year. Including restructuring charges, Merck recorded net income of Dollars 172.6m, or 15 cents, in the 1993 quarter. Sales rose 8 per cent to Dollars 2.57bn from Dollars 2.37bn. The figures were in line with expectations and Wall Street was enthusiastic about the restructuring plans. Merck's shares rose Dollars 1 to close at Dollars 33 1/8 . Merck's job cuts will cost Dollars 450m. In the longer term, Merck plans to consolidate and streamline manufacturing facilities and distribution centres at a cost of Dollars 325m. As a result, Merck will make futher job cuts, largely outside the US, starting next year. Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said the reduced employment costs should save more than Dollars 140m annually. For the first half, Merck posted net income of Dollars 786.3m, or 69 cents, against Dollars 740.3m, or 64 cents, a year ago. Excluding the restructuring charges in 1993 and charges for accounting changes in 1992, earnings rose 9 per cent to Dollars 1.31bn from Dollars 1.2bn.</p>

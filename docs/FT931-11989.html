			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Letter: Jumping the election gun Sir, It is a pity to upset Joe Rogaly's assumption ('Yes, but no sax appeal', January 22) but, at the turn of the century, President Clinton will at best be three weeks away from relinquishing office while Mr Major will probably have to win two elections. There are 2,900 days, or just more than 95 months, to the turn of the century which will occur at midnight on December 31 2000] Geoffrey Selwyn, 32 St Mary's Avenue, Northwood, Middx HA6 3AZ</p>

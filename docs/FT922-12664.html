			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Newarthill net loss up to Pounds 72m LOSSES AT Newarthill, the family-controlled holding company for the civil engineer Sir Robert McAlpine, jumped from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 42.8m in the 12 months to October 31. The company turned round to a trading loss of Pounds 10.5m, against a profit of Pounds 3.68m, and provided an exceptional Pounds 25m for writing down the value of the property joint venture in Leicester. Directors said the construction operations were profitable but the performance of the Australian property interests was the main contributor to the loss. The financial reconstruction in Australia had been finalised; it entailed a contingent debt/equity swap under which no interest was payable for the next five years. Below the line the company provided Pounds 33.5m for diminution in value of fixed assets investments and properties and for contingent liabilities, to leave an attributable loss of Pounds 71.8m (profit Pounds 12.6m). Losses per share were 287.2p (80.7p).</p>

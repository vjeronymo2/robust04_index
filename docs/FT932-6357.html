			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Smart shares hit by profit warning Shares in J Smart (Contractors) were marked down 15p to 205p yesterday as the company warned of a substantial reduction in profit for the year ending July 31 1993. Although the volume of work in hand in contracting was markedly up on last year, margins had been further eroded and were now at an all-time low, the directors said. They reported a drop from Pounds 1.58m to Pounds 1.04m in pre-tax profit for the opening half, and did not expect the figure for the current six months to be substantially different. Turnover fell 17 per cent to Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 7.1m) in the six months ended January 31, and for the year was not expected to match last time's Pounds 14m. Earnings came to 6.91p (10.5p). The interim dividend is held at 2.3p, again costing Pounds 116,000 as shareholders owning some 50 per cent of the capital waived their rights.</p>

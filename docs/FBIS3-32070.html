			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas, met today with President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari in Los Pinos. Afterward, he met with senators  and deputies from the Plural Group [grupo plural) in his office  to follow-up on events in Chiapas. The congressional Standing  Committee created this group, and it comprises 10 legislators  representing the six registered political parties. They talked  about the need to find a negotiated and peaceful solution to the  Chiapas conflict above any partisan stand.    Camacho said the conditions for dialogue exist, and he  highlighted three points that will be discussed with the armed  groups. These points are:    1. Economic demands relating to the material conditions of  the Chiapas Indians.    2. Social demands relating to racism, neglect, poverty,  disrespect, expulsions, and attacks on culture and traditions.    3. Political demands relating to the Chiapas Indians' lack  of  legal room for true participation. Camacho will make a public  announcement tomorrow.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (16): Local government targeted - Privatisation thrust is renewed Mr Peter Hintze, the general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the largest of the three parties in Germany's centre-right coalition government, did not take long to come to the point. Minutes after emerging from the first session of talks between the CDU and its two coalition partners to shape a new coalition programme he was talking about the need for more privatisation. The government, Mr Hintze said, would trim the federal bureaucracy by 1 per cent a year - about 14,000 jobs - and cut back the excessive amounts of red tape as part of a drive to modernise Germany. However, while Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new government has vowed to maintain the momentum of privatisation, most of what still needs to be done is in the hands of Germany's 16 Lander (or state) governments and reaches down to local councils across the country who are under growing pressure to contract out an array of services from waste disposal to parks management. Since coming to power in 1982 the CDU-led government has drawn in its tentacles and pushed many industries and services into the private sector, raising DM11.6bn in the process. Lufthansa, the national carrier, has been privatised. The railways have been turned into a joint stock company as a first step to privatisation and Deutsche Telekom will be listed on the stock exchange in 1996. 'The privatisation of conventional industry is basically finished,' said a senior finance ministry official. 'You need a magnifying glass to find any holdings we still have in larger companies.' The government has said it will now redouble its efforts to get the state governments to sell their industrial holdings and examine new models, like private motorways, which would enable them to function more efficiently. Leading the way among the states is Bavaria, one of Germany's richest states, which last year announced an ambitious new initiative to sell off its holdings in a variety of companies. The state government has already raised over DM3bn and hopes to bring together another DM2bn, money which will almost all be invested in new technologies. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister who himself comes from Bavaria, rarely misses a chance to sing the praises of his party brethren in Munich who have been setting the example he wants other states to follow. However, poorer states like the Saarland and the city state of Bremen, where unemployment is relatively high, feel duty bound to prop up limping industries with state funds. The state of Lower Saxony is setting another bad example by holding on to its 20 per cent in the car maker Volkswagen and much of what could not immediately be privatised in eastern Germany was taken over by the respective state governments via Beteiligungsgesellschaften or state-owned companies created to manage shareholdings in strategic companies such as Jenoptik, the well-known Thuringian optical instruments manufacturer. 'The Lander are not overly inclined (to privatise),' said Ms Barbara Eckrich, of the finance ministry. There is hope yet. As a senior finance ministry official points out, the reason most states and councils will make further efforts to privatise is because they are running out of money. The federal government, for instance, announced earlier this year that it would only pay unemployment benefit to people who have lost their jobs for a maximum of two years. Thereafter they will receive so-called social assistance which will be entirely funded by local governments. The smaller budgets, coupled with a realisation that many privatisation models developed outside Germany do actually work, means that the country's traditional penchant to have civil servants do everything is beginning to wane. The process has been helped considerably by the Treuhandanstalt, the state-owned agency charged with privatising east Germany which will be wound up at the end of this year. Faced with a shortage of funds and confronted with unheard of difficulties involved in privatising a whole country, the Treuhandanstalt developed a variety of new models for local government, setting an example which has made privatisation much more palatable than it would otherwise have been. Some sewage plants, for instance, are now operated privately, including one in the east Thuringian town of Altenburg where about 50 companies competed for the contract, a process which enabled the local council to make considerable savings. On a national level, the government in Bonn meanwhile has pushed through reforms which allow private employment agencies to compete alongside the state-owned agencies in the hope that competition will offer better services to people seeking jobs. However, the government has not made all the progress it has wanted to. In the past state and local governments were allowed to fulfil their tasks by means of publicly-owned companies or authorities. Now a new law will require them to prove that their duties must be carried out by a state-owned entity; otherwise, the contract must go to a private operator. But just weeks before the October elections, the Bundesrat, the upper chamber of parliament which represents the 16 Lander, threw out the new law shifting the so-called burden of proof. The government has vowed to push the amendment through early in the next session of parliament but the setback is an indication of how difficult it may be to force the Lander, many of which are run by the left-wing Social Democratic party (SPD), to privatise. Meanwhile the government will press on to privatise as much as it can of what is left in its care. The finance ministry is mulling over plans to sell institutions such as the famous Max Planck Institute and other public research facilities. And the organisation which runs Germany's 350 motorway service stations is being restructured and renamed and will be sold off next year. Work is also continuing on technology to introduce tolls on motorways, a first step towards wholesale privatisation. Since 1990 the government has also sold about 9,000 flats and houses which used to belong to foreign armed forces stationed in Germany and it is trying hard to make the thousands of hectares it still owns more attractive for developers, including discounts of up to 50 per cent from the purchase price if the land is used for approved council housing.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Santiago del Estero--The workers who had taken over  a textile firm in this city and who were evicted last Thursday  described the police crackdown on them as "savage" and charged  that "the order was given by Secretary of Internal Security  Andres Antonietti." Interior Minister Jorge Busti also  criticized the action.    Santiago del Estero Radical Party members predicted, for  their part, that the federal overseer, Juan Schiaretti, "will  come to the same end as his predecessors" and cautioned that the  disturbances last December were not "the culmination of a  process but rather a wake-up call."    Nine workers at the company Textil Santiaguena, which is  located in the Huaico Hondo neighborhood, were wounded by the  rubber bullets or overcome by the tear gas used during the  evacuation of the plant, which had been ordered by Judge Silvia  de Ferreyra Lesye and carried out by the Infantry Corps of the  provincial police.    The workers said that they had occupied the plant "in  defense  of jobs" inasmuch as the firm had declared bankruptcy and the  property had been auctioned off.    At a press conference after the eviction the workers blamed  the police crackdown on Brigadier Antonietti and said that the  agents who had taken part in the maneuver "received extra pay to  dislodge us by whatever means."    One of the evicted workers related that "the chief of the  Infantry Corps, Julio Olivera, made me kneel down, aimed his  service weapon at my head, and then fired to one side. The blast  made me pass out and damaged my hearing."    The demonstrators also criticized the judge: "She deceived  all of us workers by saying that she had decided to give us five  days and then ordering the eviction a few hours later."    In remarks to a Buenos Aires radio station, Minister Busti  described as "regrettable the way in which the police took  action at the textile plant" and announced that he had ordered  preliminary proceedings opened against Olivera for the means  that he had used to regain control of the plant.    Moreover, the Province Committee of the Radical Civic Union  (UCR) asserted in a press release that overseer Schiaretti "will  come to the same end as his predecessors," adding that he "is  mistaken if he still thinks that what happened in December was  the culmination of a process, inasmuch as it was only a wake-up  call."    The Santiago del Estero UCR, led by National Deputy Jose  Zavalia, indicated that "Schiaretti is just as arrogant and deaf  as his predecessors," asserting that the demands of the people  "are still unmet."  <H5>  Legal Insecurity </H5>   Former Federal Judge Federico Pinto Kramer charged yesterday  in this city that "legal insecurity in Santiago del Estero is  becoming increasingly self-evident," adding that "the desire of  some judges to be in the limelight casts suspicion on court  actions and confuses public opinion with false news."    At a press conference the well-known attorney questioned the  new arrest warrant issued for his client, former government  spokesman Miguel Brevetta Rodriguez, who has been accused of  signing a 300,000-peso advertising contract with a nonexistent  Tucuman firm.    Former Governor Carlos Mujica and his interior minister,  Angel Bagli, are also at large in connection with this case.    Pinto Kramer gave newsmen photocopies of the alleged  contract  and asserted that it was not signed with a dummy company. "The  contract was signed with a well-known advertising firm on behalf  of a printing house," he said.    The former judge indicated that "there is a black smoke  screen to confuse instead of clarify" and charged that "four  months into the investigation the proceedings are still being  kept confidential and there is more talk than action."    In addition, the former federal judge also lashed out at the  federal overseer, Juan Schiaretti, recalling that he had said  that he "would fill the jails." "With whom?" Pinto Kramer said  sarcastically, then asserting that "so far the Mujica  administration seems to be the most conscientious in recent  years."    Mujica resigned late last October amid charges of  embezzlement and was replaced by Deputy Governor Fernando Lobo.    Brevetta Rodriguez's and Mujica's homes are among the houses  and public buildings that have been looted and burned.</p>

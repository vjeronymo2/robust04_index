			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> CONSULTANT TO STUDY L.B. POLICE STAFFING  </P> <P> Staffing at the Long Beach Police Department will be reviewed by an independent  consultant hired by the city to evaluate whether members of the police force  could be more efficiently used.  </P> <P> The study, approved this week by the City Council, is intended to answer  questions raised during debate over a proposed city tax to pay for more police.  The special tax would have to be approved by Long Beach voters, who have  questioned whether the department is using its work force to the best  advantage.  </P> <P> The council approved the study amid some discussion of its impartiality, since  the police chief will have a hand in outlining the evaluation.  </P></p>

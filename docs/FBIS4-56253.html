			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Bolivian Foreign Minister  Antonio Aranibar Quiroga today ended his stay in Bonn, the main  phase of his three-day visit to Germany. During his visit to  Bonn, Aranibar encouraged German business people to invest in  Bolivia.    Aranibar, who had a chance to address a large audience of  private German business people during a meeting at the  Confederation of German Industry and Commerce Chambers, tried to  interest business people in a series of privatization projects  and some significant industrial projects.    During a news conference this afternoon, Aranibar explained  that he had told his audience about the capitalization project  involving some public enterprises in the natural gas and oil,  electric power, telecommunications, railway, smelting, and air  transportation fields.    The German business people also showed great interest in the  plan to build a gas pipeline between Santa Cruz central Bolivia  and Sao Paulo, Brazil. This represents a "megaproject" for  Bolivia and is necessary for Brazil's energy supply system.    The Germans also were interested in the plans for Ilo, the  Peruvian town on the Pacific coast where Bolivia, after an  agreement signed with the Peruvian Government, intends to build  an industrial and tourism free zone and hopes to turn it into an  important port for the shipment of its exports.    Aranibar, who believes the Germans are the right people for  this project due to their experience and technology, also will  show the plans for Ilo port to business people in Berlin, with  whom he will meet on 27 April in the morning, and especially to  those in Hamburg, the great hanseatic town and German port,  where he will end his visit that same afternoon.    During his two-day visit to Bonn, Aranibar had a tight  agenda  that ended on 25 April with a meeting with his German  counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, with whom he signed a financial  cooperation agreement for 50 million German marks ($30 million),  earmarked for potable water and sewage infrastructure projects,  as well as for the preservation of natural resources.    Aranibar announced that the German-Bolivian Joint Commission  will meet next July in Germany to establish the framework for  future cooperation between the two countries, among them  cooperation for the institutional consolidation of the recently  created La Paz Justice Ministry.    According to the minister, during all the meetings held in  Bonn with politicians, legislators, representatives of  organizations or business people he found great interest and  understanding for the efforts toward political and economic  reform in Bolivia.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Trade test triggers the alarm: Tony Jackson looks at how seriously UK manufacturing industry is being damaged by the recession After a decade's absence, the supposed death of British manufacturing is back in the headlines. Hardly a day goes by without agonised bulletins about closures and job losses at great British companies such as Lucas, Rolls-Royce Motors and British Aerospace. The last recession did lasting damage to large sectors of British industry. Can it really be happening all over again? The short answer is no, or at any rate not yet. Though job losses in manufacturing are as severe as last time round, the fall in output is not. From its peak two years ago, manufacturing output in the UK has fallen by 7 per cent. In the two years to mid-1981 it fell by twice that. Only a quarter of the 3,300 businesses put into receivership this year have been manufacturers. No less than 60 per cent have been in service industries. If this recession is the worst since the second world war, it is only because the pain is more equally distributed. This is not to deny that manufacturing has received some hard knocks. But not all have been primarily recession-related. Last month's closure of British Aerospace's historic factory at Hatfield, for instance, was if anything overdue. BAe had never made money from its regional aircraft business. The recession simply uncovered the fact. Again, some of the bad news turns out on inspection to be not quite so bad after all. Much coverage was given to Monday's announcement from Lucas that it was closing some UK plants and shedding some 2,000 workers. Less was made of the fact that Lucas may end up producing slightly more in the UK as a result. The company is closing plants in Continental Europe as well as in Britain and redistributing its output among the remainder. In the process, the UK looks like gaining slightly more than it loses. 'The UK is a good manufacturing base,' Lucas said on Monday. 'Some of our customers who traditionally bought in their own countries are specifically looking to source in the UK.' Similarly, the Engineering Employers' Federation was widely quoted this week as condemning the government's 'ministerial paralysis'. But it also said it expected engineering output to rise by 3 per cent in the next 12 months. The UK's cost competitiveness in export markets, it said, was 'probably now as good as at any time since before 1980'. The main reason for the EEF's optimism was the motor industry. There has been much publicity over lay-offs at Ford, Rolls-Royce and Jaguar. But UK car production this year is running only 3 per cent below its peak in 1989. This is partly to do with Japanese manufacturers setting up new capacity, but not entirely. Vauxhall's production this year is 32 per cent higher than in 1989, and Land Rover's 28 per cent. Again, the German car maker Mercedes-Benz has just announced that it almost trebled the amount it spent with British component manufacturers in 1991. 'The British economy', it said, 'is under-rated'. It seems clear from this that the idea of a recession-induced crisis in British industry does not bear inspection. But perhaps the real issue is wider than that. If the recession is not doing drastic damage in itself, it may still be a stark reminder of underlying decline. The best measure of this is not, as is sometimes supposed, the dwindling contribution of industry to output and employment. This is a natural trend in any developed economy, as workers are replaced by machines and manufactured goods become cheaper in real terms. The real test is the balance of trade in manufacturing; and it is here that the alarm bells start ringing. For at least 40 years, Britain's imports of manufactured goods have been rising faster than its exports. In the mid-1950s, exports were three times as large as imports. By a decade ago they were the same size. Ever since then, the UK has been running a persistent deficit in manufactured goods. The roots of the problem are simple enough. The UK's volume of manufacturing output is now virtually the same as it was in 1973. In that time, the economy as a whole has grown by a third. Since consumption of manufactured goods rises with national income, imports have been sucked in to make good the difference. In 1973, imports had a 21 per cent share of the UK market for manufactured goods. By 1989 they had 37 per cent. Meanwhile, the UK has lost ground in world exports. Its share in 1970 was 8 per cent, in 1980 7.5 per cent and in 1990 6 per cent. But the UK is not alone in showing a deficit. Last year, the gap was proportionately wider in the US, to say nothing of less developed EC partners such as Spain, Portugal and Greece. So does the deficit actually matter? The answer ultimately depends on a number of imponderables. The deficit need not matter if it can be paid for by exporting services, or indeed by importing capital from foreign multinationals such as Japanese car makers. Whether that can be achieved in the 1990s is not easy to judge. If it cannot, there are those optimists who say that the deficit can be cured when the upturn comes. What remains of UK manufacturing is better managed and more internationally minded than it was 10 years ago. In addition, foreign companies in the UK are now training its workforce in modern techniques of manufacture. There are two reasons for pessimism. First, recent large-scale foreign investment in the UK is mostly confined to the car industry, which accounts for only some 8 per cent of total UK manufacturing. It is not clear how many other industries will attract such inward investment. And above all, the long-run trend is simply too consistent. For decades, through boom and slump, UK manufacturing has been losing ground. It is very much in the national interest that the trend should be halted. It is asking a good deal for it to be reversed.</p>

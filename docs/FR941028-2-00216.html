			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Directly observed therapy (DOT): An adherence-enhancing strategy in which an HCW or other designated person watches the patient swallow each does of medication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DNA probe: A technique that allows rapid and precise identification of mycobacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. bovis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) that are grown in culture. The identification can often be completed in 2 hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Droplet nuclei: Microscopic particles (i.e., 1&hyph;5 &mu;m in diameter) produced when a person coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings. The droplets produced by an infectious TB patient can carry tubercle bacilli and can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time and be carried on normal air currents in the room. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Drug resistance, acquired: A resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs that develops while a patient is receiving therapy and which usually results from the patient's nonadherence to therapy or the prescription of an inadequate regimen by a health-care provider. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Drug resistance, primary: A resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs the exists before a patient is treated with the drug(s). Primary resistance occurs in persons exposed to and infected with a drug-resistant strain of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Drug-susceptibility pattern: The anti-TB drugs to which the tubercle bacilli cultured from a TB patient are susceptible or resistant based on drug-susceptibility tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Drug-susceptibility tests: Laboratory tests that determine whether tubercle bacilli cultured from a patient are susceptible or resistant to various anti-TB drugs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethambutol: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug sometimes used concomitantly with INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethionamide: A second-line, oral anti-TB drug used primarily for treating drug-resistant TB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exposure: The condition of being subjected to something (e.g., infectious agents) that could have a harmful effect. A person exposed to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  does not necessarily become infected (see Transmission). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First-line drugs: The most often used anti-TB drugs (i.e., INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fixed room-air HEPA recirculation systems: Nonmobile devices or systems that remove airborne contaminants by recirculating air through a HEPA filter. These may be built into the room and permanently ducted or may be mounted to the wall or ceiling within the room. In either situation, they are fixed in place and are not easily movable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fluorochrome stain: A technique for staining a clinical specimen with fluorescent dyes to perform a microscopic examination (smear) for mycobacteria. This technique is preferable to other staining techniques because the mycobacteria can be seen easily and the slides can be read quickly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fomites: Linens, books, dishes, or other objects used or touched by a patient. These objects are not involved in the transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gastric aspirate: A procedure sometimes used to obtain a specimen for culture when a patient cannot cough up adequate sputum. A tube is inserted through the mouth or nose and into the stomach to recover sputum that was coughed into the throat and then swallowed. This procedure is particularly useful for diagnosis in children, who are often unable to cough up sputum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: A specialized filter that is capable of removing 99.97% of particles "0.3 &mu;m in diameter and that may assist in controlling the transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Filters may be used in ventilation systems to remove particles from the air or in personal respirators to filter air before it is inhaled by the person wearing the respirator. The use of HEPA filters in ventilation systems requires expertise in installation and maintenance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection: Infection with the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV infection is the most important risk factor for the progression of latent TB infection to active TB. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Immunosuppressed: A condition in which the immune system is not functioning normally (e.g., severe cellular immunosuppression resulting from HIV infection or immunosuppressive therapy). Immunosuppressed persons are at greatly increased risk for developing active TB after they have been infected with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . No data are available regarding whether these persons are also at increased risk for infection with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  after they have been exposed to the organism. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Induration: An area of swelling produced by an immune response to an antigen. In tuberculin skin testing or anergy testing, the diameter of the indurated area is measured 48&hyph;72 hours after the injection, and the result is recorded in millimeters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Infection: The condition in which organisms capable of causing disease (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) enter the body and elicit a response from the host's immune defenses. TB infection may or may not lead to clinical disease. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Infectious: Capable of transmitting infection. When persons who have clinically active pulmonary or laryngeal TB disease cough or sneeze, they can expel droplets containing  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  into the air. Persons whose sputum smears are positive for AFB are probably infectious. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Injectable: A medication that is usually administered by injection into the muscle (intramuscular [IM]) or the bloodstream (intravenous [IV]). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intermittent therapy: Therapy administered either two or three times per week, rather than daily. Intermittent therapy should be administered only under the direct supervision of an HCW or other designated person (see Directly observed therapy [DOT]). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intradermal: Within the layers of the skin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Isoniazid (INH): A first-line, oral drug used either done as preventive therapy or in combination with several other drugs to treat TB disease. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

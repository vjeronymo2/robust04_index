			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian  at 1307 GMT on 16 January broadcasts a 5-minute report by  station political observer Valeriy Kiosa who reports on reaction  in the Russian Government to the resignation by First Deputy  Premier Yegor Gaydar.    Kiosa says he has just spoken to Valentin Sergeyev, head of  the press service of the Russian Government. Kiosa continues:    "In reply to my question about the premier's reaction to  Gaydar's statement, Sergeyev said that Chernomyrdin's reaction  was calm. The premier talked with Gaydar about the possibility  of combining the functions of leader of the Russia's Choice  faction and that of first deputy premier. As a result of that  calm and businesslike conversation, a decision was made to think  things over and to find a solution. Gaydar announced his  decision today.    "In reply to my question as to whether Yegor Gaydar had made  his decision under pressure from the premier, Sergeyev  categorically denied such a possiblity. He stressed, moreover,  that Gaydar's coming -- or rather his second coming -- into the  government occurred on the initiative of the premier himself,  and all their relations were businesslike and working relations.    "Valentin Sergeyev said that the final composition of the  Government will be announced at the beginning of next week. I  think that Tuesday is the most likely day for this."    Kiosa recaps that there has been much talk over the past few  days that if Fedorov and Gaydar leave the Government this will  mark an end to reforms in Russia. Kiosa continues:    "According to Sergeyev, the Government will continue to be  directed toward the reforms, in keeping with the program which  has been approved."    He adds: "As far as the question of Fedorov is concerned,  Sergeyev stressed he did not have any information on that yet.  However, I would draw the conclusion that candidacies for this  post held by Yegor Gaydar will be examined now, and are probably  being examined already.    "In reply to your question, of course, a lot depends on  whether Fedorov remains, that is the first thing, and on who  will take Gaydar's place. Incidentally, it is probably worth  drawing attention to Gaydar's words on his wish that Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy should take part in the government."    The announcer asks Kiosa if he thinks Yavlinskiy will be  offered the post of first deputy premier, to which Kiosa replies:    "It is really hard to believe that now, although the most  unexpected things may happen."    Kiosa wonders why the financial issues raised by Gaydar as  motives for his resignation were not discussed in the Government  with him. "I think that Gaydar's resignation may have a serious  effect on the alignment of forces, both in the Government and on  the whole in the higher echelons of power," Kiosa says.    Gaydar's resignation may have been undesirable for the head  of the Russian Government, the announcer surmises. Sergeyev may  just have been putting on a diplomatic act when he spoke to  Kiosa, she concludes.</p>

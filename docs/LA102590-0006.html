			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS EXPOSED U.S. DEPLOYMENT FLAWS, OFFICIAL SAYS  </P> <P> The Persian Gulf crisis has exposed this nation's shortcomings in quickly  deploying a sizable military sea lift without the considerable assistance of  other nations, the head of the U.S. Maritime Administration said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Further, Capt. Warren G. Leback warned that without the unprecedented  commitment of foreign-flagged ships, it would have taken until now for the  United States to muster enough cargo vessels to adequately supply the 250,000  troops massing in the Middle East. And even now, he said, the U.S. sea lift  would face a struggle supplying the troops if a conflict erupts.  </P> <P> "As long as we don't start shooting, everything's fine," Leback told a Long  Beach luncheon crowd. "But to go to the next step, we're short. There's no  question."  </P> <P> In an interview, Leback added that the lessons of the Middle East deployment,  Operation Desert Shield, will certainly include a reassessment of the nation's  military sea lift capability and the need for committing as much as $1 billion  over the next four to five years for maintaining and testing a reserve fleet of  cargo ships.  </P> <P> "If it was not a global effort, we're not sure we would have had the  availability of the vessels" needed for Operation Desert Shield, Leback said  after his appearance before the local chapter of the Propeller Club of the  United States, a nonprofit maritime association.  </P> <P> Leback's remarks follow weeks of attention by Congress and the Bush  Administration to the nation's sea lift capabilities and particularly the  Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force. The 96-ship force was  established in 1976 to support military operations and consists of retired  commercial vessels maintained by the Transportation Department, which oversees  the Maritime Administration.  </P> <P> Since the crisis began there has been criticism of the reliance on  foreign-flagged ships to support U.S. troops and of delays -- some as long as  20 days -- in deploying the 45 Ready Reserve Force vessels that are taking  supplies to the Mideast.  </P> <P> Though Administration and Pentagon officials have emphasized the size of  Operation Desert Shield, they have also acknowledged, as Leback did Thursday,  that years of federal neglect of the nation's maritime readiness must end if  the United States is to sufficiently support its military in a crisis.  </P> <P> Specifically, Leback said, the Persian Gulf crisis demonstrated that the  nation's Ready Reserve Force fleet did not meet its established goal of  dispatching the vessels in as little as five days in a military deployment.  Previously, officials reported that only 14 of the ships activated in Operation  Desert Shield reached their ports for loading on schedule, with the remaining  ships arriving one to 20 days late.  </P> <P> Moreover, Leback pointed out the U.S. sea lift to the Persian Gulf relied  heavily on foreign-flagged vessels whose support cannot be assured in the  future. Had those 70 or so foreign vessels not been available, Leback said, the  United States might have been forced not only to call up its remaining 51 Ready  Reserve Force ships, with delays of up to 30 days, but other, older ships in  the so-called National Defense Reserve Fleet, whose deployment could have taken  two to four months. (Some of the National Defense Reserve Fleet vessels have  been mothballed for 10 years.)  </P> <P> And that scenario, Leback said, would have left the United States unable to  swiftly provide the hundreds of thousands of tons of military equipment and  cargo needed to support the nation's troops in Saudi Arabia. "We wouldn't have  been able to put the armor and equipment needed to match the troop lift in  order to deter the Iraqis," Leback said.  </P> <P> Since the problems with the Ready Reserve Force became apparent, Leback and  other Administration officials have emphasized the great demands on sea lift in  the past three months. The operation has required, for example, the delivery of  50% more equipment and supplies in the first month of operation than during the  first month of the Korean War.  </P> <P> At the same time, officials have acknowledged there can be no excuses for slow  deployment in a military crisis. And that, Leback said Thursday, will be the  argument for immediately increasing funds to the reserve fleet, whose budget  was cut last year from $171 million to $89 million.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make sense in one year when we are in an emergency situation, or  whatever you want to call it, to get all kinds of money," Leback said. "We need  to put the ready back into the ready reserve."  </P></p>

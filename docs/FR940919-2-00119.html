Fifty-three percent of the written responses came from SSA employees, 21% came from DDS employees, and 26% came from individuals and organizations external to the SSA/DDS community. Members of the Team read, analyzed, and collated every one of those 6,210 comments so that no idea, reaction, or nuance would be overlooked.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the commenters who presented written reactions to the overall proposal, 52% were favorable to the overall concept, 39% were unfavorable, and 9% were neutral. Approximately 10% of these commenters believed no reengineering was needed. Beyond the request for written comments, additional means of gauging reaction to the proposal were also employed: group employee feedback discussions were held in over 80 sites across the country with almost 2,000 SSA and DDS employees participating; a public meeting was held in Washington, D.C.; and Team members conducted briefings and spoke with more than 3,000 individuals and organizations about the proposal during the comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was a very mixed reaction to the proposal. Very few verbal or written responses were totally favorable or unfavorable toward the proposal_those liking it had concerns about some elements while those generally disliking it found portions which they believed would be improvements over the current process. Many commenters, regardless of expressing praise or concern, addressed very limited aspects of the proposal without providing a reaction to the overall proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Profile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comments expressed can be categorized as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _SSA received widespread praise for taking on the task of redesigning the disability claim process. The prevalent belief was that dramatic improvements are needed to provide better service and handle workloads more effectively. Whether fully supporting the proposal or not, most commenters expressed concern that the system is broken and that only radical redesign will solve the problems that currently exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The most popular concepts were ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> listed from most to least frequently mentioned <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> ): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Elimination of the reconsideration step; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The disability claim manager as single Agency point of contact in the initial claim; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A single presentation of substantive policies for all decision makers; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Encouragement of the claimant to be a partner in the development of the claim; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Elimination of the mandatory Appeals Council review step; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Increased reliance on the use of information technology; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Increased public awareness and education about program requirements; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Evidence development tailored to claimant circumstances; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Disability claim managers empowered with full decisionmaking authority; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The general aspects of the proposed disability methodology. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The greatest concerns centered around ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> listed from most to least frequently mentioned <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> ): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Personal safety of disability claim managers; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Ability of one person to fulfill the disability claim manager role; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pre-denial personal interview with disability claim manager; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The general aspects of the proposed disability methodology; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Encouragement of the claimant to be a partner in the development of the claim; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The disability claim manager as single Agency point of contact in the initial claim; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Development and use of an Index of Disabling Impairments; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Use of standardized forms to request evidence from treating sources; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reliance on treating source certification of existing evidence; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Potential bias of disability claim managers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Many of the responses centered around how the proposal would be implemented and what organizational changes would be needed to make the new process work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _There were concerns about whether the proposal would meet the objective of not increasing or decreasing program costs with fairly divided opinions about whether the new disability methodology would allow or deny more claims than the current methodology. Reliance on treating sources as preferred sources of medical evidence and personal bias resulting from disability claim manager face-to-face meetings with claimants were often cited as the reason for the belief that there will be an overall increase in allowed claims. The new four-step evaluation process was cited as the most common reason for the belief that there will be an overall increase in denied claims. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22491 Filed 9&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4190&hyph;29&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

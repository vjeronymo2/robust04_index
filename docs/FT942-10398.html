			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Sony in Mexico labour complaint The AFL-CIO, the US labour union grouping, is preparing to file a complaint against Sony Electronics for allegedly violating the labour rights of its Mexican workers, in a potentially important test case of the North American Free Trade Agreement's side accord on labour. Mr Michael Byrne, spokesman for the AFL-CIO, said its complaint would be filed within weeks. The union alleges a Sony-owned plant in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, fired workers for union activism in January, played a substantial role in staging fraudulent union elections last month, and called riot police into the plant to put down a peaceful demonstration. Sony denied the allegations, saying it had been caught in a dispute between two factions in the company union. It says two workers were fired in March, but for disrupting work rather than union activism, and that Sony played no part at all in union elections. The AFL-CIO complaint will be the third presented to the National Administrative Office of the US Labour Department, which was set up to implement the labour side agreement of Nafta. The first two complaints were filed against General Electric and Honeywell for allegedly firing workers for seeking to organise a union in their Mexican-owned plants. The NAO agreed last month to review the complaints against General Electric and Honeywell, and has up to 180 days to issue a non-binding public report, which could be followed by a public hearing. However, the alleged violations are not punishable by sanctions, and it is not clear what the next step would be if the complaints were upheld. Under the Nafta side accord, labour offices are established in each member country to receive and report on complaints labour laws have been violated in other member countries. However, in most cases the result of the report will be a recommendation, since sanctions are only applicable if a country fails to enforce its minimum wage, child labour or health and safety laws.</p>

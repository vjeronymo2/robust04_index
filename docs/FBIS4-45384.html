			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] A report by Tzvi Giv'on on page 4 of  Tel Aviv HATZOFE in Hebrew on 5 June notes that Beni Arad,  director general of the Antidrug Authority, said last Friday in  Haifa that "the volume of drug trafficking in Israel amounts to  $2.5 billion." Arad added that "there are about 200,000 casual  drug users, of which 27,000 are high school students, and about  30,000 drug addicts." He noted that "about four metric tons of  heroin, five metric tons of hashish, and 500 kg of cocaine are  consumed in Israel every year."    Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 7 June  reports that Tel Aviv police detectives "uncovered a crate  containing three metric tons of hashish soles, estimated at 30  million shekels. This is the largest drug shipment ever  smuggled into Israel. Our police affairs correspondent Shim'on  Vilna'i reports that the hashish arrived at the port of Ashdod  from the Far East aboard the Zim Tokyo. Detectives waited for  over a month to see who would come to release the crate from  customs, but when nobody turned up the crate was pried open and  the hashish packages were found inside. No suspects have yet  been arrested."    Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 8 June, in a page  14 report by David Rudge, states that Galilee District Police  yesterday arrested two suspected drug dealers and seized "two  sacks containing 50 kg of hashish and a nylon bag containing a  kilo of heroin" "worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on the  streets." The capture was made after a "large-scale operation,  involving members of the special Lebanese border unit and  plainclothes officers."</p>

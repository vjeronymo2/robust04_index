			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Shevardnadze overplays the Russian card: Steve LeVine sees no sign of Moscow's hand in Abkhazia's rebellion against Georgia THE separatist rebellion in Georgia's autonomous region of Abkhazia appears to be a largely indigenous uprising without the official Russian backing alleged by Georgia's leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze. Interviews with Russian and Abkhaz officers and a three-day visit to the warfront revealed no Russian officers or soldiers, other than those attached to local garrisons of the Commonwealth of Independent States, successor to the Soviet Union. While some Russian officers are openly sympathetic to the Abkhaz and a few former Russian troops discharged from local bases are reported to be fighting against Georgia, there was no sign of collusion between the poorly organised, poorly trained separatist army and Russian forces. Claims of Russian partisanship have been the anchor of Mr Shevardnadze's efforts to solidify local and global support behind his deployment of Georgian forces. The ex-Soviet foreign minister, who was elected leader of Georgia earlier this month, asserts that outside involvement - some 1,200 men from Abkhazia's tiny North Caucasian neighbours have joined the fight against Georgia, and are visible throughout the battle zone - threatens to spark a larger, regional war. The conflict on Russia's border could continue indefinitely unless peace talks succeed. The Abkhaz have seized three dozen armoured vehicles and hundreds of rifles from Georgian troops, and they believe the new citrus crop will provide adequate economic support through the winter. The Georgians themselves have huge stockpiles of weaponry from garrisons of the former Soviet army, and also seem unlikely to back down. Last week Mr Shevardnadze was quoted as threatening to take all of Abkhazia by force if new talks failed. Colonel Vladimir Arshba, a former Soviet commando who heads the Abkhaz fighters, replies in kind. 'We think we must liberate all the territory of Abkhazia from the invaders. We won't be slaves . . . We have enough forces to counter their hardware.' The conflict began in August, when Abkhazia - an autonomous, sub-tropical republic of 550,000 people within Georgia - declared independence and Mr Shevardnadze sent in tanks. The Georgians now control much of the south of Abkhazia, stretching from the regional capital of Sukhumi. The separatists, holding the north, are headquartered at the port of Gudauta. The frontline is the Gumista River in Sukhumi's suburbs. Mr Shevardnadze and other Georgian officials, while saying they trust the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, allege that hardliners in Russia's government and military have given sophisticated hardware to Abkhazia, such as T-80 tanks. A Moscow newspaper last week claimed that Russian mercenaries were fighting on behalf of the Abkhaz. Col Arshba said he possessed 10 tanks. Russian sources say they are mostly old Soviet T-54s. The Abkhaz also have up to 30 other armoured vehicles and 10 heat-seeking anti-aircraft missiles, one of which on October 11 shot down a Georgian-piloted SU-25 fighter. But the colonel and other officers insisted almost all the munitions were seized in battle against Georgia. Conversely, Col Arshba offered a list of weapons he claimed the Georgians have received from the former Soviet 10th Motorised Infantry Division, a list partially substantiated by foreign journalists in Georgia. It included 108 tanks, 170 other armoured vehicles and eight multiple-firing GRAD missile launchers. The CIS has an airbase at Gudauta, an army base at Sukhumi and a paratrooper regiment at Eshera, north of Sukhumi at the Abkhaz frontline. 'I have been approached many times to take part in the conflict,' said the Russian commander in Eshera, Captain Roman. 'But I am a military man, so I cannot participate.' The CIS commander in Abkhazia, General Alexei Sigutkin, refused interviews. But Capt Roman vowed to protect his eight armoured vehicles from seizure by fighters of either side. 'I would use all my ammunition to shoot everyone,' he said, 'then use the combat vehicles to get out of here.'</p>

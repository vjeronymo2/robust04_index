			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Economic and Development Authority  (NEDA) board yesterday approved four projects estimated to cost  P [Philippine pesos] 34.7 billion as part of the government's  program to spur infrastructure development in the country. Three  projects amounting to P21.7 billion are agro-industrial projects  while the remaining program costing P13 billion involves  long-term urban sewerage and sanitation.    The agro-industrial projects approved are the Metro-Cebu  Development Project Phase III (MCDP III), the Lower Agusan  Development Project-Irrigation Component (LADP-IC) and the  Strategic Industries Development Program (SIDP). These projects  are expected to hasten agro-industrialization through  investments in the countryside, Socio-economic Planning  Secretary and NEDA Director General Cielito Habito said.    Funding support will come from loans under the 19th-Yen  Credit package of Japan. These will be coursed through the  Municipal Development Fund and government financial institutions  such as the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development  Bank of the Philippines.    The P15.9 billion MCDP III will include the construction of  a  Cebu South Expressway, a south reclamation project, an urban  circumferential road and five new distributor roads in Cebu.  Habito said the Japanese government was willing to shoulder 80  percent or P6.6 billion of the Cebu South Expressway component.    The LADP-IC, costing some P1.09 billion, is planned to give  farmers of Butuan City 95 kilometers of irrigation canals, 27  kilometers of new roads and 69 kilometers of drainage canals and  on-farm facilities.    The SIDP, with P4.5 billion in funds, will modernize the  country's shipping sector.    The sewerage and sanitation program, meantime, will involve  a  national policy, strategy and action plan for urban sewerage and  sanitation, particularly in urban areas.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Opren claimants lose court battle MOST OF the remaining alleged victims of the banned arthritis drug Opren who are claiming compensation had their actions dismissed in the Court of Appeal yesterday. In a test-case ruling, three judges decided that 13 of 16 representative claimants were barred from seeking damages against Eli Lilly, the pharmaceuticals company, because their actions started too late. Lord Justice Purchas, sitting with Lord Justice Ralph Gibson and Lord Justice Mann, dismissed appeals by 13 claimants against rulings by Mr Justice Hidden that their claims were 'statute barred' under the 1980 Limitation Act which lays down time limits for starting civil actions. The claimants, mostly elderly arthritis sufferers, allege they suffered long-term or permanent side-effects as a result of the drug, which was withdrawn worldwide in 1982.</p>

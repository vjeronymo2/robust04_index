French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe said this here on Friday during a meeting with his  Armenian counterpart Vahan Papazyan. Juppe said France had  always been in favour of solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh  conflict in the framework of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    The ministers noted with satisfaction that there are no  contradictions in Franco-Armenian bilateral relations. Juppe  confirmed that the draft law envisaging the ratification of the  agreement on friendship between France and Armenia will be put  on the agenda of the spring session of the National Assembly now  underway in France.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- During their regular  meetings, the leaders of the houses of the Russian Parliament  and the president "look for approaches to basic decisions which  are subsequently elaborated," Federation Council Speaker  Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists at a roundtable meeting here  on Wednesday.    In response to an ITAR-TASS question about his meeting with  Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday, Shumeyko remarked that such meetings  are held periodically when the president needs to discuss some  matters with law-makers.    The Federation Council speaker is confident that the houses  of parliament "should not be used as an instrument of the  struggle for power." There is no sense in parliament's  decision-making "for decision's sake".    Decisions made at the state level should be complied with,  Shumeyko stressed, adding that it is easier to coordinate  matters at the very first level of the decision making process.  "Boris Yeltsin did not make any recommendations to the  Federation Council," Shumeyko specified.    Touching upon the notorious coup scenarios, Shumeyko  described them as an "attempt to undermine the situation in the  country in order to catch fish in troubled waters." He believes  that the situation in Russia is now stable enough, and that  attempts to upset it by such methods look ridiculous and won't  pan out.</p>

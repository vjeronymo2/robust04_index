			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] There has been a government reshuffle: Prime  Minister Cavaco Silva has replaced Agriculture Minister Arlindo  Cunha with Antonio Duarte Silva. The ministry's existing  secretaries of state will remain in office. Antonio Duarte  Silva is practically unknown, apart from the fact that he was  included in the Social Democratic Party list of candidates for  the European Parliament. More details from Pedro Cid:    [Cid] We know very little about the new minister, he is  unknown to public opinion, but he has some kind of professional  political background. He was a secretary of state once at the  same ministry and his most recent job was that of president of  the Viana do Castelo shipyard. [passage omitted]    He is a mechanical engineer and was once taught at Lisbon's  Instituto Superior Tecnico.</p>

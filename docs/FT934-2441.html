			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Arts: Classical in question - Exhibitions in Leeds and Halifax A visit to the handsome public galleries of Leeds this December or January can be recommended as offering stimulating food for thought. The Henry Moore Institute ends this year and begins the the next showing the work of four European sculptors, and is also, at its sculpture studios at Dean Clough in Halifax, offering the opportunity to experience one of the more experimental works of the American artist James Turrell. Those who wish to see Gas Works: A Ganzfeld Sphere - a chamber in which one viewer at a time is exposed to the effects of red and blue neon and white strobe lights - must act quickly; it closes on December 20. The sphere offers not so much an aesthetic experience as a lesson in perception - the changing colours and psychedelic patterns experienced inside are created not on its smooth white dome but on the retina of the beholder, as each individual reacts to the flashing lights. It also offers an insight into the kind of obsessive interests (Turrell plans to revisit the piece at the end of the show to continue his light experiments) which can eventually bring about completely realised works of art. The four works in the show at the Henry Moore Institute are all very different: two have been made especially for the exhibition, two have not. 'Sea of Sun,' a maze of metal chains created by the English artist Andrew Sabin, was first exhibited at the end of 1992 at the Battersea Arts Centre in London. The effect of pushing through the series of rectangles he has created from hanging painted steel chains is indeed like plunging into sun dappled water, the coloured images, visible through each other, ever shifting and never quite resolved. Some of the chain screens are covered with abstract patterns, some with single faces, some with buildings or landscapes. Viewing them is rather like recalling a dream, trying to catch hold of that one half-remembered scene which will unlock the meaning of all the rest. The Spanish sculptor Jaume Pensa likes his metal traditional, although with a post modern twist. He has used iron casts of iron-casting buckets as the unit of construction of 'La Neige Rouge', 1991, a hollow rectangle made from one hundred buckets piled up and facing inward. The lips of the buckets are threaded with orange neon elements. Standing inside the rectangle in the buzzing orange glow is like standing inside heat, being made molten by colour alone. Vittorio Messina, originally trained as an architect in Rome, made 'Confini d'Occidente', 1993, especially for the exhibition. Using only ready made industrial materials - breeze blocks, neon strips, pieces of wood, carpeting, metal shelves, sanitary ware and an anatomical skeleton - he has created a shabby temple, its structure and form recalling the classical monuments of ancient Greece. Their reprise in these humdrum materials sets off a dialectic between the forms of the past which we so revere and the utilitarian functions of ordinary buildings, so often reviled. Being forced to look at these brutal staples of our everyday lives, assembled in a manner which consciously evokes the past, serves to remind us that history is made now, too, in similarly unprepossessing settings, even when, as busy participants, we fail to notice. 'Fallen Cornice', 1993, by Edward Allington, the present Gregory Fellow in creative art at the University of Leeds, also questions the classical past which still so informs our present attitude to art and architecture. Made for a room at the Institute which retains the proportions of the original merchants' offices, the eponymous cornice, recreated larger than life in copper lies on the floor. In its descent from the ceiling, it has dragged with it some of the inner workings of the building, suggested by lengths of armoured cabling trailing from the roof. Allington's work explores the continuing role of classical convention in our mass produced present, economically conveyed by such ironic displacements . Herbert Read, the centenary of whose birth is celebrated by a marvellous exhibition at the Institute's next door neighbour, the City Art Gallery, throughout the 1920s also questioned the dominance of the classical, Mediterranean tradition in our view of art, suggesting that it should be set against the romanticism of Northern Europe to be fully understood. This early position became typical of Read's dialectical approach in his writings about art, and allowed him to defend both abstraction and Surrealism during the 1930s, when their practitioners were at daggers drawn, and in the 1950s to accept the new precepts of abstract expressionism while still remaining loyal to the naturalistically based work of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. Only in his later years did his ability to accept and understand the new begin to fade. His famous dislike of Pop Art may perhaps be traced to the socialist and anarchist views of his youth, formed during his years at Leeds University from 1912 to 1914 when he was also a member of the radical Leeds Arts Club. The Pop artists' blithe acceptance of the crude mechanics of capitalist advertising he found hard to take. 'For him,' his son Ben, one of the curators of the exhibition, told me, 'art was always very serious.' Read's move to London in 1933 thrust him into middle of the progressive artistic community then beginning to gather in Hampstead which formed the bedrock of his aesthetic development. The exhibition's greatest success is to celebrate Read's individual vision, so much the product of the circumstances of his life. It is moving to see works by Hepworth or Nicholson or Moore presented to Read in the course of their long friendship, and touching to see his huge desk, made to his own design when he was championing modernism to an unresponsive audience when briefly professor of fine art at the University of Edinburgh (1931-33). This quiet Yorkshireman could be not only a radical but a true internationalist, helping to bring a sceptical England its first sightings of surrealism and abstract expressionism and, eventually, worldwide recognition. His final lecture, given in Cuba 1968, was on 'The Problems of Internationalism in Art.' Not just a writer, lecturer and thinker, he also got things done; he was one of the founders of the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, for example, becoming its first chairman in 1947. He never shrank from the difficult questions and spent his life discussing the role of art in what he believed to be its proper place, the very heart of a society's political and social development. That he could do so with such confidence, that he was also not afraid to allow his views to develop, was perhaps because as a lifelong writer of poetry the creative process was an intimate part of his own experience, giving him the strength to remain true to his aesthetic instincts.

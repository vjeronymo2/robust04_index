			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: TransAtlantic slips to Pounds 60.7m - Contribution from Sun Life nearly doubled to Pounds 36.7m TRANSATLANTIC Holdings, the property and life assurance group which obtained a London stock market listing last year, yesterday announced a marginal fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 61.2m to Pounds 60.7m for the year to December 31. Earnings per share fell to 9.93p compared with 14.52p in 1991, reflecting increases in the amount of unrelieved advance corporation tax and reduced interest capitalisation. A recommended final dividend of 6p raises the total for the year to 12p, against 11.45p in 1991. TransAtlantic is owned jointly by Liberty Life, the South African life assurance company, and Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest insurer. It owns 50 per cent of Sun Life Holdings, the UK life insurer, and Capital &amp; Counties, the property company. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said he was 'especially encouraged by the performance of Capital &amp; Counties' regional shopping centre property portfolio, which has demonstrated strong signs of buoyancy both in turnover and an improved market share of retail trade'. Income from property investment amounted to Pounds 67.9m (Pounds 60m), while proceeds from property trading were Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.2m). Administrative expenses fell to Pounds 11.7m (Pounds 12.6m). Income from Sun Life nearly doubled to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 18.7m). Interest payable amounted to Pounds 35.7m, against Pounds 7.4m in 1991, reflecting a significant reduction in interest capitalised on property development projects from Pounds 32.4m to Pounds 11.6m, principally because interest capitalisation ceased at June 30 1991 on the Thurrock Lakeside Shopping Centre development. Share capital and reserves increased from Pounds 775m to Pounds 948m. The value of investment properties rose to Pounds 1.05bn (Pounds 1.01bn), with the advance reflecting a large rise in the valuation from Pounds 325m to Pounds 380m of Thurrock Lakeside, which amounts to 40 per cent of TransAtlantic's property portfolio. Special assumptions were made about the exceptional turnover rent potential of the Thurrock development. Pounds 25.9m of the increase was due to exchange rate fluctuations. Separately, Sun Life yesterday reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 41.7m), although new premium income fell marginally to Pounds 1.49bn compared with Pounds 1.5bn in 1991. New single premiums amounted to Pounds 1.4bn (Pounds 1.41bn), with regular premiums falling by 3 per cent to Pounds 85.6m.</p>

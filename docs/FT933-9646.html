			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Cable operator signs first BT deal NYNEX, the US-owned cable operator, is believed to be the first of the 'big four' companies that dominate the UK's cable TV and telephone industry to sign an interconnection deal with British Telecommunications. According to the Financial Times's Telecom Markets newsletter, the agreement will give Nynex, which has 20 UK franchises, 50 per cent of the gross call revenues generated by its subscribers, against 25 per cent under its existing agreement with Mercury. Until now the four main cable operators - Nynex, Southwestern Bell, Telewest and BCE of Canada - have relied exclusively on Mercury to carry long-distance and international calls originating from their local networks. Mercury's prices have almost invariably been lower than BT's, but BT is believed to be competing strongly on price. The latest deal is thought likely to lead to Mercury signing an interconnection agreement on similar terms. Cable operators, which have recently been reporting take-up rates of about 30 per cent for telephony in areas where networks are under construction, are increasingly switching their own traffic on to the public network rather than handing it over directly to Mercury. Switching enables them to choose more freely between long-distance operators, and to keep a higher proportion of their subscriber income. The advantages will be greater still when new operators enter the market - notably Energis, the telecom arm of National Grid, which is building a long-distance network on National Grid's pylons and expects to be offering a service from next Easter. Nynex and other operators are likely to operate least-cost routing systems, which allow calls to be sent along the network of the lowest-cost operator, enabling them to take advantage of short-term movements in prices between rival operators.</p>

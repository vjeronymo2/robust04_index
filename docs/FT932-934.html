			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo set to challenge for top spot in copper league - The South African group's expansion plans, focused mainly on South America ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation of South Africa, best known for its gold and diamond operations, is laying the groundwork for a huge copper business in South America that will place its subsidiary in the region among the world's leading producers. The group also has the right of first refusal when Zambia privatises its copper business, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, scheduled to go ahead by 1998. If all goes to plan, Anglo would jump from about fifth place among the world's leading copper producers possibly to challenge Codelco in Chile, which currently leads the field with annual output of more than 1m tonnes. Anglo has been focusing attention primarily on its South American projects in presentations to analysts and institutions in South Africa and Europe. The group's interests in the region are held by Anglo American Corporation of South America (Amsa), a 50 per cent-owned mining, finance and industrial company that Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Anglo's chairman, describes as 'a mini-Anglo in South America'. He says that the stock market floatation of Amsa is a possibility when its development projects are more advanced. In Chile, Amsa's most important interest is a 75 per cent stake in Mantos Blancos, which is already producing about 78,000 tonnes of copper a year. Mr Ogilvie Thompson says that Mantos Blancos is embarking on four projects in Chile and Peru which will cost USDollars 442m: Some Dollars 85m will go to expand open pit copper output at Santa Barbara in Chile from 30,000 tonnes a year to between 35,000 and 40,000 tonnes. A feasibility study will be completed shortly. Another Dollars 56m may be spent on installing a modern solvent extraction-electro winning processing plant at Santa Barbara; A second feasibility study is close to completion for the Mantoverde copper project in Chile, which is expected to produce 37,000 tonnes of open pit copper a year and cost Dollars 150m; Mantos Blancos recently paid Dollars 12m for the Quellaveco copper deposit in southern Peru, in which about 24m tonnes of copper has been identified. There is to be a Dollars 2.5m, three-year feasibility study; Mantos Blancos and Anglo's subsidiary Minorco also recently bought between them one third of the Collahuasi copper project in Chile from Chevron for Dollars 190m. Mr Dave Deuchar, Anglo's chief metallurgist, says Collahuasi will become 'one of the world's great copper mines'. Production is likely to start in 1988 and reach about 300,000 tonnes a year. The Royal Dutch/Shell group owns another third of Collahuasi but is at present considering an offer for most of its metals and mining assets from Gencor of South Africa. Mantos Blancos, Minorco and the other partner, Falconbridge of Canada, have pre-emptive rights to Collahuasi and Mr Deuchar says Mantos Blancos will certainly pre-empt 'if the price is right'. In Brazil, Amsa's interests are held largely in association with the Bozano Simonsen group through Mineracao Morro Velho which has mines that last year produced about 12 tonnes of gold. Morro Velho recently won a tussle with RTZ Corporation of the UK for a stake in a world-class copper deposit at Salobo in the Carajas region of the Amazon, owned by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, Brazil's biggest state-controlled mining group. The project is expected to cost Dollars 750m. Morro Velho and CVRD hope to develop a mine producing 150.000 tonnes a year of copper and 8,000 tonnes of gold. A feasibility study should be completed in one year and it would take another three years for mining to begin. The Salobo deposit was discovered in 1976. Since then CVRD has spent Dollars 120m on it. The company has already established that the ore body consists of at least 700m tonnes, containing 0.7 per cent copper and 0.5 grams of gold a tonne, with more ore to be discovered. Development has been held back because of its unusual ore. It has to be ground into a very fine powder because the copper is disseminated through it. Meanwhile, Mr Ogilvie Thompson says that Anglo has 'first refusal rights' on the Zambian government's 60 per cent stake in ZCCM. 'We are getting on well with the new management and would buy the government interest on the right terms and conditions,' he adds. Anglo already owns 27.3 per cent of the Zambian copper producer. The rest of the shares are in public hands. ZCCM has also been talking to analysts in London and says it needs Dollars 2bn over the next 15 years to keep production from falling any further. Mr Larry Hanschar, ZCCM's consultant metallurgist, says, however, that a big chunk is needed almost immediately. He says ZCCM is ready to go ahead with financing for the Dollars 600m Konkola deep mine project where it has an estimated 344m tonnes of ore containing a juicy 3.8 per cent copper. ZCCM hopes to produce about 150,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate for about 50 years from Konkola. In its last financial year, to March, the company produced 432,000 tonnes of copper and 4,706 tonnes of cobalt. To put that in perspective, in the heady days of 1969, ZCCM produced 689,254 tonnes of copper. Mr Hanschar says that although ZCCM's mines could yield another 4.2m tonnes of copper over the next ten years, if there is no further investment, ZCCM's reserves will virtually run out by then. That is why the Zambian government wants to privatise the company. Acknowledging that there has been some heated debate about this, he adds: 'But the debate is not about whether ZCCM should be privatised, it is simply about the timing of privatisation'. Copper mining provides about 95 per cent of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and contributes at least 15 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, so some people in both the government and the company would prefer to see ZCCM privatised sooner rather than later. Analysts reckon that one big drawback to smooth privatisation is the number of people ZCCM employs: 52,000. That equates to production last year of 8.3 tonnes per employee compared with RTZ's 118 tonnes a head at its Bingham Canyon copper mine in the US. But Mr Hanschar insists that, once cobalt revenue is taken into account, ZCCM's cash costs are about 60 US cents a lb and that all-in costs are below 70 cents. Mr Hanschar also suggests that ZCCM does not need to wait for privatisation before pressing on with its life-saving Konkola project. The company is looking for funding from the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and other aid agencies and expects to get a favourable response even though it is already in debt to the tune of Dollars 700m.</p>

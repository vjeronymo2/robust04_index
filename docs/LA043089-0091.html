			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MUSTANGS DEFEATED IN VARSITY CLASSIC  </P> <P> In the long run, Saturday's Redondo/Mira Costa Varsity Classic means little to  the Mira Costa Volleyball team, win or lose.  </P> <P> The Mustangs were eliminated from the tournament in the quarterfinal round by  dropping a 16-14 decision to Newport Harbor after winning four straight matches  to get there.  </P> <P> Despite the loss, the tournament was very important for the Mustangs, who are  ranked No.1 in the CIF Southern Section 4-A Division after compiling a perfect  15-0 overall record and a 10-0 mark in the Ocean League.  </P> <P> The 25-team tournament, which was held at Redondo High, provided the Mustangs  with their biggest challenge of the season but the results were less than  encouraging for coach Mike Cook.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar, a team that trails the Mustangs in the 4-A Division at No. 4,  defeated Loyola (4-A, No.7) by scores of 15-8, 15-12 for the title.  </P> <P> "This is a great tournament and there's a lot of competition," said Cook, whose  team now looks forward to the start of the playoffs on May 12. "Anything can  happen in a one-game playoff and we made a few too many errors."  </P> <P> The Mustangs built a 6-3 lead before hitting three straight balls out of bounds  to allow Newport Harbor back into the match.  </P> <P> "We had a good lead and all of a sudden we hit three nice sets out of bounds,"  said Cook. "We have too much talent to keep doing that, but this tournament  doesn't really mean anything to us; we'll be all right."  </P> <P> The only other local team to advance past the pool play besides Mira Costa was  Palisades, which was also eliminated in the quarterfinals.  </P></p>

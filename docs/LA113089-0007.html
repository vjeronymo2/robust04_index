			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSEQUENCES OF PORNOGRAPHY  </P> <P> We were delighted to see the article on the social impact of illegal  pornography. Just as the community has united on the war against drugs, we must  also join together to eradicate illegal pornography which debases our women and  children, and contributes to a wide variety of violent crimes.  </P> <P> Because we believe that one of the most urgent causes today is the more  stringent enforcement of existing laws against illegal (child and violent)  pornography, we implore our local law enforcement agencies and the U.S.  attorney's office to prosecute those who have broken these laws.  </P> <P> JOANNE GALLAGHER  </P> <P> JOE GALLAGHER  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Arts: A Romantic through and through - Poetry in Performance SENATOR WB Yeats once referred to himself as a '70-year-old smiling public man' with the easy self-importance of one accustomed to being feted as Ireland's greatest poet. A man with an equal claim to public eminence is Sir Stephen Spender CBE, grand old survivor of the 1930s, that 'low dishonest decade' in Auden's famous phrase, poet, critic and cultural ambassador extraordinary, who gave a rare reading in London this week as part of the Poetry Library's 40th birthday celebrations. The difference between the demeanours of the two men was striking. Yeats was said to be forever striking poses; Spender, for all his great height (6ft 5in before he began to stoop a little), resembles, in another poet's words, some 'infinitely gentle, infinitely suffering thing' - shy, vulnerable, entirely at our mercy. The tragedy of Spender's life is that, although he has always regarded himself as a poet in essence, it is not what he has been best at. The Journals and his autobiography, World within World, are his finest achievements. It was not therefore at all surprising that, setting aside his life's work as a published poet, Spender should spend his time reading new poems, as if to say: My reputation is still to come . . . it was a decision of gentle defiance. Poetry is in the service of language, and language is in such a fragmented state nowadays that poets often seem unsure in what language they ought to be writing. Stephen Spender's poetry has no such doubts. He has been consistently faithful to a vocabulary and a rhetorical manner that link him directly with the Romantic tradition. It is a poetry that cherishes the uniqueness of the I, and passionately celebrates the realm of the personal as the first and last bulwark against Chaos. A number of the poems were versified notes from his diary, including a striking portrait of his friend, WH Auden. In 1970 Auden had just spent a semester or two teaching students at Milwaukee, and he shared his impressions of those students, and of himself teaching the students, with his old friend. 'He shares his distance from them like a joke', writes Spender. For him, that would be quite unimaginable. Paul Durcan, who was reading at the South Bank this week from his new collection, A Snail in My Prime, usually wears red shirts - suggestive of seditious opinions - when he performs in public, and rolls up his sleeves to remind us that the reading of poetry is a real job. And, like any other task, it is not to be taken too seriously. Durcan is one of Ireland's most popular poets, a man given to playing the role of the Holy Fool in public, a light-fingered scourge of the medieval mysteries of Irish catholicism and much else; a poet whose performances give his work its unique flavour. The success of a Durcan reading depends upon stillness, silence and a brooding darkness over the auditorium - suggestive of mock-sanctity. What the audience registers are the head and the speaking voice. Nothing else matters. It is the mobile face, a tragi-comedy mask of a face, that contains all the humour - and all the anguish. The voice, a rich, velvety Co Mayo, creeps up unawares like a stranger approaching from behind and, from time to time, inflicts a shockingly savage wound. Every word of every poem matters. There are three important facial characteristics: the raising of a single eyebrow, which indicates a sudden fit of childish indignation; a furious working of the lips; and a flick of the eyes heavenward, which means: God alone has the key to this mess of potage that we miscall civilised human life upon earth] But almost best of all is a hopeless lolling of the head to left or right, which says: 'This is as much as can be said. I am washed clean of all hope, now and forever more.' A Snail in My Prime. Paul Durcan Pounds 7.99 and Pounds 16, 272 pp. Harvill</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU urged to promote 'high natural value' agriculture European farmers could be required to adopt environmentally-friendly practices to qualify for common agricultural policy support, according to a report published today on farming and nature conservation. The report, published by the independent Institute for European Environmental Policy, calls for a mix of policies to promote 'high natural value' farming. This includes grazing with fewer animals, growing cereals with fewer agro-chemicals and traditional cultivation of olives and other tree crops. 'Extensive farming systems. . . support large areas of semi-natural habitat which harbour many rare and endangered species of wildlife,' it says. Such farming is often in jeopardy, either because it is no longer economically viable or because some CAP support encourages intensification, says the report, prepared for the Dutch agriculture ministry. It cites aid for new irrigation or for grubbing-up olive groves. It proposes expanding direct incentives to farmers who use environmentally-sensitive methods, as provided for in the 'agri-environmental' programmes that member states are drawing up in line with CAP reforms. However, budget constraints are likely to limit the growth of environmental incentive payments, especially in poorer regions, the report says. 'A significant measure of support will continue to be essential for most 'high natural value' farmers. This reinforces the importance of integrating environmental objectives into the principal CAP support instruments.' For example, non-intensive livestock farmers could be encouraged by linking support more closely to land management or making it conditional on low-density grazing. Adapting payments to serve environmental objectives should cost little more and 'might strengthen the case for retaining direct payments within the CAP in the long term'. Other suggestions in the report include: exempting non-intensive arable farmers from set-aside; paying livestock farmers on difficult terrain according to area rather than number of animals; investing in infrastructure such as shelter for shepherds and livestock; and marketing products from environmentally-friendly farms with an EU-wide labelling system. 'The objective is not to make farmers into 'park keepers' but to establish sustainable forms of agriculture,' it says. Farming of this kind should not be seen as unproductive. 'In fact, it may be considered more in tune with the demands of the currently over-supplied EC food market.'

Numerous  problems must be solved for this, so that the enterprises which  until now were oriented more toward the former East Block can  learn, for example, to compete for industrial contracts from the  European Space Agency, ESA.    The first successes by the DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AG] and  Zeiss company group in Jena with high-performance optoelectronic  telescopes and satellite components are stimulating this  difficult adjustment process. In order to accelerate this  development, the German Space Agency (DARA) in Bonn recently  arranged an industrial conference especially for those newly  founded enterprises which also deal with satellite projects.    What is involved is about 60 companies with 10,000  employees,  some of which often have only a few dozen people working in this  field, however. DARA itself has supported the reorganization of  the socialist research structures from the beginning, of course,  and fought for the preservation of the highly qualified  technical and scientific space capabilities in the new laender.    Accordingly, this year DARA has distributed about 16 percent  of the national space flight budget of about 350 million German  marks [DM] to enterprises in eastern Germany and thus almost  achieved a percentage which corresponds to the population  figure. Three years after unification this is regarded as a very  good integration result in the national space flight sector.    On the international level, this inclusion of the eastern  German satellite industry has not been very successful, however.  To begin with, it involves concrete aid, such as how the new  laender should actually apply to ESA for project participation.  A complicated formalism is required for this, which can only be  mastered after some practice.    It begins with the special English-American expressions and  does not even begin to end with the knowledge of the  ramifications of the European space flight industry. Concrete  help is urgently needed, because in 1993 eastern German  companies were only able to obtain ESA contracts worth DM 1  million for preparatory studies. That is only a tenth of a  percent of the German contribution of more than DM 1 billion to  the European space flight organization this year.    In order to increase this share significantly, DARA,  together  with German Aerospace, recently invited ESA's director general  Jean-Marie Luton to Jena-Optronik in Thuringia, and Luton  expressed himself quite impressed by the technical capability  and the involvement of the approximately 100 employees, who  previously developed and built special cameras and other  optoelectronic equipment for Russian space projects.    The French research politician gave assurances that in the  future the eastern German enterprises should have the same  chance to obtain space flight contracts within the European  framework as other ESA nations. The companies in Jena and other  locations will get concrete opportunities for larger contracts  as soon as the German and European space flight cooperation with  Russia really gets under way, because that is where the eastern  German experts, with their Russian knowledge and the experience  they acquired at the time of the GDR with projects in the East  Block, have clear advantages.    Jena-Optik therefore calculates that it has good chances for  getting several ESA contracts amounting to about DM 25 million  next year. Above all, they involve the Omos-Ozone telescope for  the Envisat satellite for atmospheric and earth reconnaissance,  as well as a solar sensor for the Artemis communications  satellite and components for the XMM X-ray telescope, which will  be launched at the very end of the 1990s.    Another important project for including eastern German  capabilities in European space flight is being proposed by the  Carl Zeiss company in Jena. This involves an astronomical  telescope which is to be used for experiments in optical data  transmission with the European Artemis communications satellite.    This instrument is based on several other telescopes, which  were previously built by VEB Carl Zeiss Jena for several  observatories in the East. The telescope has received improved  electronic controls and additional equipment for laser  experiments.    Despite the general economic problems, in the last few years  a number of western German companies in the space flight  industry have become involved in the new laender by taking over  companies there with a similar production range or by founding  new branch offices. This applies not only to large companies  such as Deutsche Aerospace or Carl Zeiss, but also to  medium-sized systems enterprises such as OHB-Bremen and  Kayser-Thede, Munich, as well as to many small companies.</p>

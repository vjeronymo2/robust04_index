			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: London is now a banker bet for the Swiss - The leading financial institutions' switch out of Zurich WHEN a foreign subsidiary of a bank opens an outlet in the city in which its parent is based, something is up. Credit Suisse Financial Products (CSFP), the high-flying London-based swaps and options affiliate of the leading Swiss bank, has just done it, opening a representative office in Zurich. This cheeky move is only the latest of many steps taken by the three top Swiss banks - Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) and Credit Suisse - which reveal a pattern of centring more and more operations in London while letting their Swiss bases slide gently and parochially towards the sidelines. UBS and CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse, each employ more than 2,000 people in London, compared with only a few hundred 10 years ago. SBC employs 1,000 in London. At a time when Germany is promoting Frankfurt as a European financial centre, this build-up provides welcome reassurance for those worried about the future of the City of London. The Swiss, at least, have no doubts. In their view, no other European city can hope to challenge the City as an international financial centre for the foreseeable future. The Swiss may even help London maintain its pre-eminence. They have established themselves in the past two years among the world's leaders in the new high-tech game of using financial derivatives, mainly swaps and options, to help clients - and themselves - control risks in their investments. And London is their main base for these activities. 'London is the central information point. There is a different quality of professional dialogue here than in any domestic market,' says Mr Bruce Brittain, managing director of capital markets and treasury at SBC in London. Like many other large banks with international operations, the big three Swiss banks have had outlets in London for decades. But, while many other foreign banks have reduced their presence in the City in the past few years, the Swiss have continued to expand. This is perhaps best symbolised by the rather grand City premises of UBS and SBC. More concretely, it is apparent in the range and scope of the activities the big three undertake there. Their concentration of Euromarket business, excluding Swiss franc issues, in the City is similar to that of other international banks. Yet it is unlikely that French or German banks will follow in putting most of their European investment and corporate banking in London. They believe they can compete from the home bases. On the Swiss trend, an Italian banker remarks: 'We see Swiss bankers in our country a lot more than we used to, and they are coming from London, not from Zurich.' The big three Swiss banks have nurtured institutional fund management services in London and have even beefed up their private banking operations in the City, apparently in response to the preference of more of their rich individual clients. UBS has gone a step further than its rivals, taking major shares in some UK domestic financial markets through its acquisition, starting in 1984, of the front-line UK equities firm, Phillips &amp; Drew. To an extent, these moves reflect the decline of Zurich. Until the 1980s, Zurich was the pre-eminent European foreign exchange market. It has lost that title to the City, and the Swiss banks have, like others, boosted their dealing presence in London. Swiss tax laws have driven away securities transaction related business, such as broking and fund management, even in Swiss securities. Credit Suisse felt obliged to have its London branch take out a London Stock Exchange membership last summer to keep pace with rivals. Swiss restrictions on immigration and worker-friendly employment policies are also factors. 'Labour laws are very important. It costs you a fortune to change people in some European countries. Here, my maximum commitment is six months,' says Mr Rudolf Muller, executive vice-president for Europe of UBS in London. Mr Jean-Christian Cheysson, managing director of CSFP, recalls that, when his company faced the challenge of forming a team of 300 people in a very short time to service its complicated transactions, 'it was easy in London; it would have been impossible in Zurich.' None of the big three publishes figures on the size and profitability of their London operations, but they give clues. SBC says the capital employed in its London-based businesses is roughly equivalent to that of SG Warburg, the largest UK investment bank. Credit Suisse says about one-fifth of its total capital is tied up in London operations. For UBS, London is the most important foreign centre. Mr Muller says more than half its foreign profits last year came from London. For SBC and CS Holding, US operations are still larger than those in London, mainly because of long-established commercial banking activities. CS also has a 64 per cent stake in US investment bank, CS First Boston. The banks' performance in London is less impressive. SBC and UBS made profits there last year for the first time since 1986 and 1987 respectively. Credit Suisse and SBC have figured prominently among the creditors to companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell and other large UK bankruptcies. The three are confident that their troubles in London are now behind them, and the word in Zurich is that they made killings during the recent currency market turmoil. But they have yet to show that they can make triple A quality returns in London or anywhere abroad. All three expect that, within a few years, most profits will come from abroad, which raises the question whether they will effectively, if not formally, move their headquarters to London. Mr Georges Streichenberg, executive director for international finance at SBC, diverts the question. 'With modern communications, it does not make much difference where you are, but we could not call ourselves Swiss if we were in London.' Paradoxically, the banks seem to be increasing central control in Zurich and Basle, partly in response to bad lending experiences abroad and partly because of the increasingly large and complex risks involved in derivatives business. Last summer, UBS appointed Mr Pierre de Weck as executive vice-president for Europe, based in Zurich, and made clear that he would rank ahead of Mr Muller in London, who carries the same title. Mr Georges Blum, who will become chief executive of SBC next April, says that the freedom of individual units 'has been very largely reduced'. Mr de Weck also wants to build up expertise in Zurich as well as London. 'Being a Swiss bank, we need to have capabilities in both centres,' he says. But neither he nor any other Swiss banker talks of cutting back in London.</p>

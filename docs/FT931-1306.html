			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Arts: Doing the right thing - Jazz The young trumpet player Terence Blanchard is the burnished sound behind most of Spike Lee's celluloid. After serving with that finest of finishing schools, Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, Blanchard plunged into composing with scores for School Daze (1988), Do The Right Thing (1989) and most recently Malcom X. During this period of concentrated writing activity, Blanchard, who is just 31, began to have problems with his own playing and for a while it looked as though he might spend the rest of his career with only his charts for company. On the evidence of his quintet's appearance at Ronnie's this week, however, reports of his demise are greatly exaggerated. In a sombre but sometimes startling collection of seamlessly segued movements called The Malcom X Jazz Suite, Blanchard led his young quintet heroically. The original film score was written for 40 pieces but this adapted and improvised on version for quintet has a grainy texture on to which Blanchard sears his notes to dramatic effect. The air of foreboding created by the opening bass lines was transformed into an achingly cool and urban setting. The addition of Troy Davis's simmering cymbals and Bruce Barth's plaintive chords completing the setting for tight trumpet and tenor harmonies from Blanchard and Sam Newsome. The pair have an impressive sound between them: the sturdy tenor providing woody contrast to Blanchard's lustrous tone, both able to produce feisty and elastic solos. A suite with such serious intent as this might seem inappropriate for a club setting but the movements follow conventional mores, and head arrangements with obligatory bludgeoning drum parts separate the movements sufficiently well. In contrast to the monochrome grandeur of Malcom X, the lush and complex guitar work of Martin Taylor was a luxurious bonus. The 37-year-old English concert guitarist is most often heard in the company of Stephane Grappelli, or in a classical setting, but sounds equally comfortable spinning standards from the stage of a smoky club. Indeed so relaxed and convincing is Taylor's command of simultaneous rhythm, melody and bass that he could easily pass for a trio. Chopping or sustaining, the vocalised tone and timing is a joyous thing and his fitting in the spaces between two sets of Malcom X make a beautifully balanced evening's entertainment. At Ronnie Scott's until March 27</p>

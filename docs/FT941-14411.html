			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Eurotunnel chief takes the helm  -Georges-Christian Chazot will be a regular Channel traveller Mr Georges-Christian Chazot, Eurotunnel's new French chief executive, may be a keen amateur sailor, but he admits he has never taken his 35-foot racing yacht, Eloisa, across the English Channel. Nor will he have a chance to make the voyage in the next few months. Instead, it seems Mr Chazot is set to spend more time travelling under the Channel than sailing across it. On Tuesday, he made his first trip through the tunnel which he must now turn into a profitable transport under-taking. Despite a long and apparently successful career with international companies, Mr Chazot, 54, is not a name familiar to the business community outside France. He is also taking on a role whose previous occupant, Sir Alastair Morton, established a fearsome reputation for getting things done. Mr Chazot was picked after a search by two teams of headhunters in Paris and London. Sir Alastair said Eurotunnel was looking for 'the best man without regard to nationality'. Not that Mr Chazot regards himself as being particularly French. 'I feel a little detached from that type of consideration,' he said yesterday. 'My basic business education was in the US for the first three years of my business life.' He was educated at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, and at the University of Florida, graduating with a degree in electrical engineering and a diploma in marketing. Most of his subsequent career has been industry, and he worked for 14 years each at Schlumberger, the international engineering group, and CGE (now Alcatel Alsthom), the telecommunications company. He ranks as one of his successes the transformation of Saft, Alcatel's battery subsidiary, from a company with 'a culture of high-tech arrogance to a service-minded corporation'. Among his career disappointments, he recalls the problems he had taking to Alcatel the hard-driving commercial approach he brought from Schlumberger. Alcatel, he says, had 'a public telephone company culture'. From Alcatel he went to Adia, a Swiss temporary employment agency, running its French subsidiary for 18 months. 'Time with a service company complemented my industrial experience,' he said. 'Eurotunnel is a service company and nothing else.' Eurotunnel nevertheless represents another significant career switch. 'There are few, if any, parallels with this project,' said one French banker. 'The important thing is that he has an international background, has shown himself to be an able manager, and that he is installed before the tunnel opens its services.' One valuable lesson Mr Chazot brings from Adia is experience with price competition. In industry, he said, he sold on quality and on innovation but at Adia, which was fighting for business in a depressed market place, price and margins took on increased importance. If forecasts of a tariff war between the cross-Channel ferries are borne out, this experience will be useful. Eurotunnel insists it has no plans to compete with the ferries on price, but it may have little choice. Although Mr Chazot is taking over as chief executive, Sir Alastair will remain as co-chairman. Both men were keen to stress they would have complementary and not conflicting roles. Mr Chazot is to spend the next four months ensuring that services which run through the tunnel - the car passenger shuttles, passenger trains and freight services - are launched as planned, and that the business starts to make profits. This is a task which will involve him closely in the operational and marketing sides of the company. Sir Alastair and Mr Graham Corbett, the finance director, will devote their time to solving outstanding disputes with the railways and raising an additional Pounds 1bn of finance. 'We want to prevent Mr Chazot from being overburdened by the problems of the past,' said Mr Andre Benard, co-chairman. However, for an untried business with Pounds 10bn invested in an intensely competitive market, the problems of the past will be hard to ignore.</p>

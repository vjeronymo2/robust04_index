Only 34 votes were cast  against the program.    According to the program, a total of 20,000 small  businesses,  1,400 unfinished construction projects and 8,000 medium and  major industries will be privatized in 1994.    As a result, Ukraine's private sector will amount to  28% of  the country's economy. The state will receive over 21 Tn  [Trillion] karbovantsy and over $230 Mn.    The properties of state bodies, National Space Agency, TV  and  radio broadcasting centers, publishers' and port facilities are  not subject to privatization.    The chairman of the state privatization fund, Vladimir  Pryadko, did not rule out that the adoption of the privatization  program on the eve of the future parliamentary elections  scheduled for March 27 was a measure of political character. In  his opinion, "the Supreme Soviet's conservative nature hampered  the process of privatization in the republic."</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Northern Ireland industry gets belated energy help THE GOVERNMENT is to provide at least an extra Pounds 10m to industry users of electricity in Northern Ireland to help curb rises in their energy bills  -a move long demanded by Ulster Unionist MPs who may now decide to abstain in Monday's Commons coal debate. The announcement by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, was made in a written parliamentary answer at the same time as Thursday's coal white paper - but not mentioned by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, in his Commons' statement. Colleagues of Sir Patrick yesterday denied that the timing of the move was deliberate. Although Mr Roy Beggs, the Ulster Unionist Party's energy spokesman, said: 'I'm very pleased that the secretary of state has responded as positively as he has.' The party's nine MPs have agreed to meet on Monday to decide how to vote that night. In October they helped save the government from defeat over the pit closures by abstaining in a Commons vote. Although their votes are now less crucial, ministers have listened carefully to Northern Ireland MPs' demands over the last five months and Mr Beggs has met Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister. Ulster Unionists have also welcomed the European Commission's decision earlier this month to give about Pounds 60m towards the cost of the planned electricity interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Mr Beggs said his party had been concerned about electricity costs which, he said, were up to 25 per cent higher for large industrial users than on the mainland.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TEMPLE ACHIEVES MEASURE OF PEACE IN HACIENDA HEIGHTS  </P> <P> Man Tao, 35, a Buddhist nun from Malaysia, slowly enunciated the foreign words:  "Como esta usted?"  </P> <P> "Como se llama?"  </P> <P> She giggled shyly while taking a break from welcoming a steady stream of  visitors to the Hacienda Heights temple and bowed her shaved head after  demonstrating what she had learned in three months of Spanish classes at Hsi  Lai Temple.  </P> <P> "Perhaps one day I'll have the chance to connect with the Spanish-speaking  people and give them the Buddha's teaching," Man Tao said.  </P> <P> A collection of awe-struck sightseers, devout worshipers and curious passers-by  is a common sight to Man Tao and the 30 other nuns and monks-in-residence at  the monastery, the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and one of  more than 50 branches of Fo Kuang Shan, Taiwan's predominant Buddhist  organization.  </P> <P> "Beautiful," sighed Husteon (Chick) Price, 72, a West Los Angeles resident  visiting for the first time with his wife, Dorothy, and a Thai neighbor, Nilla  Kronprasert. "I've read about this in the paper. It's just beautiful."  </P> <P> Outside, a group of art students from Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut milled  around the central courtyard of the 15-acre complex, admiring the glistening  ocher tile roofs, gilded sculpture and intricate stone carvings. Nuns scurried  from one building to another, offering hot tea to visitors.  </P> <P> A solemn-faced Asian woman entered the Hall of Buddha, knelt on the tile floor  and prostrated herself before three seven-foot-high fiberglass statues of the  smiling deity, enveloped in a cloud of jasmine incense.  </P> <P> As Hsi Lai Temple prepares to mark its second anniversary next month, spiritual  leaders there are more than just religious mouthpieces and strict adherents of  the eight precepts, or Buddhist commandments. Over the last two years, they  also have served as ministers of culture to residents in the ethnically diverse  community.  </P> <P> Spanish classes are conducted in Chinese for the benefit of immigrants from  Taiwan, China and Hong Kong who work side by side with newcomers from Mexico  and Central America.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the temple helped establish a sister school relationship  between Nogales High School in La Puente and P'u Men High School at the Fo  Kuang Shan Temple in Taiwan.  </P> <P> At the end of each month, the temple holds an "Eight Precepts Retreat" to teach  lay people the basics of Buddhism.  </P> <P> As many as 100 participants file into the Hall of Buddha and learn how to  chant, prostrate before the deity and repent their bad deeds. They are served  two vegetarian meals and, at the end of the day, sleep on floors in the  monastery's living quarters, in accordance with a Buddhist teaching that  followers of the religion forgo luxury. (Nuns and monks at Hsi Lai sleep on  simple cots, Man Tao said.)  </P> <P> Such is the rhythm of life at Hsi Lai -- not a rhythm that came easily to the  Hacienda Heights temple. When the Buddhists first proposed the project 10 years  ago, Hacienda Heights residents opposed it, showing up en masse before the Los  Angeles County Board of Supervisors to object to the temple's large size and  the number of people and cars it would attract. Some feared the nuns and monks  would startle neighbors with pre-dawn gongs and loud chanting.  </P> <P> Last year, after 2,000 visitors descended on the temple during Chinese New  Year, residents complained about illegally parked cars and traffic pouring onto  Hacienda Boulevard. Supervisor Pete Schabarum warned temple officials that the  large crowd violated a conditional-use permit. The county erected no parking  signs on the street.  </P> <P> In addition, fire officials said lighted niches with tiny statues of Buddha  lining the walls of the main temple did not meet safety codes and would either  have to be removed or protected with a sprinkler system. The temple opted for  the latter.  </P> <P> Nowadays, there are fewer complaints, mostly concentrated in the residential  area surrounding the temple complex on Glenmark Drive.  </P> <P> "It's in the wrong location," said Sharon Pluth, who lives on Thaxton Avenue a  few blocks north of the monastery. "They made it into a tourist attraction. I  would have fought just the same if they wanted to put Disneyland in my  community."  </P> <P> Besides being a religious and cultural center, Hsi Lai Temple has become a  stopping-off point for Chinese students and scholars who have defected to the  United States. Since the June 4 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters  in Beijing's Tian An Men Square, participants in the movement, including  student leader Wuer Kaixi, have sought temporary refuge at the temple.  </P> <P> More recently, Xu Jiatun, China's former top representative to Hong Kong whose  departure from the British colony was the subject of widespread media  speculation that he was planning to seek asylum in the United States, turned up  in Southern California under the care of Hsi Lai's founder, Master Hsing Yun.  </P> <P> Xu reportedly had fallen out of favor with Chinese Premier Li Peng for being  sympathetic to the democracy movement. Last month, Hsing held a press  conference at the temple to dispel rumors of Xu's defection. Hsing said the  74-year-old Xu was merely vacationing and intended to return home.  </P> <P> In a recent interview, Hsing said his willingness to house Xu, Wuer and others  was merely a humanitarian gesture, which he would extend to people of all  faiths and cultures. He added that he shied away from mixing religion and  politics when he refused a request by Chinese community leaders to hold a  ceremony at Hsi Lai Temple in commemoration of those killed in Tian An Men  Square.  </P> <P> "They have their political ideals, we have our own ideals of compassion and  loving kindness," Hsing said through an interpreter. "For example, if a mother  is beating her child, and the child is taken in by a third person, the mother  would not have misunderstandings and blame the person for taking care of her  child."  </P></p>

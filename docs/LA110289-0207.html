			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JERRY BUSS' DAUGHTER ROBBED OF $25,000 IN JEWELRY AT THE FORUM  </P> <P> A gunman confronted the daughter of Jerry Buss inside her father's Great  Western Forum sports arena and robbed her of $25,000 in jewels, police said  today.  </P> <P> Jeanie Buss, 28, director of tennis and volleyball for her father's California  Sports Inc., was in the north stairwell on her way to her Inglewood Forum  office when the gunman approached Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> "She was shaken up. This is the first such burglary that has occurred on our  premises," said Bob Steiner, spokesman for the Forum.  </P> <P> The items stolen included a Los Angeles Laker's championship ring, a Rolex  watch, a diamond tennis bracelet and her engagement ring.  </P> <P> According to Forum officials, the suspect was 18 to 20 years old, about 5 feet  10 inches and was wearing green pants and a white T-shirt.  </P> <P> The robbery appeared to have been planned, Steiner said, because at the time a  guard was between posts while walking his rounds. There were no sports events  going on in the Forum, which hosts Lakers basketball and Los Angeles Kings  hockey games.  </P></p>

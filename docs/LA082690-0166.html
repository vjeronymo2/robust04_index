			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORLY THING TO DO? SHOW A LITTLE HEART AND SOUL  </P> <P> My first reaction to the story "RV -- Is It Refuge or Eyesore (Aug. 17)" was,  and still is, disgust for the people who consider the value of their property  more important than the value and quality of life of a human being who is  living under difficult circumstances.  </P> <P> I applaud Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer.  </P> <P> Linda Fisher should be allowed to live in the RV at her cousin's home. She can  be cared for without the loss of her dignity.  </P> <P> Fisher shows spunk and tenacity. Instead of burdening the county hospitals or  welfare rolls, she is trying to live her life within her means. Her family is  supporting her and should not be ostracized for doing so.  </P> <P> The two unnamed complaining families should search their souls and their  motives. Unfortunately, they seem to reflect the "me, myself and I" society  America is becoming.  </P> <P> I pray that far more positive commentary is received in support of the special  circumstances of Fisher. And that the city of San Juan Capistrano allows this  special circumstance to continue.  </P> <P> ANNE E. HREHA  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hoogovens leads Dutch blue chip gains Wall Street gains, warmer bond markets, and corporate news gave bourses a lift yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM featured some impressive rises among the blue chip stocks, none more so than a 4.6 per cent advance in Hoogovens after the metals group pleased investors with first-half results at the top end of analysts' expectations. The market was also encouraged by the company's forecast that second-half results would see a considerable improvement from the first six months. The AEX index added 0.79 at 417.62. Other strong gains came from DSM, up 2.5 per cent at Fl 144.10 and Elsevier, ahead 2.3 per cent at Fl 174.00. Heineken, off Fl 3.30 at Fl 232.50, announced after the close of trading that it was to lift its stake in Spanish brewer El Aguila to 64 per cent from 51.2 per cent. FRANKFURT reflected a volatile bond market, said Mr John Blackley at James Capel, running twice through the cycle of weakness followed by recovery during the official equity session, and the post-bourse. The Dax index closed the session 3.83 down at 2,160.37 after a day's low of 2,153.70, and eventually recovered to 2,166.51 after hours, 5.59 higher than it was at the end of Tuesday afternoon. Turnover stayed low at DM5.5bn after DM5.4bn, and in these illiquid conditions a number of shares reversed sharp movements which they had seen a day earlier. Degussa, for example, saw profit-taking after earlier gains on a good half-year result, and the chemicals to gold refining group's shares dropped DM11 to DM502.50 after a DM6.50 rise on Tuesday. Siemens followers, meanwhile, decided that Tuesday's resumption of a Hanau plutonimum plant project, following a favourable court decision, was good for the shares, which rose DM8 to DM688.50 by the post-bourse close after Tuesday's session fall of DM9.10. PARIS suffered an interruption in trading as lightning hit the bourse's computer system, but the system came back on stream before the end of the session, leaving the CAC-40 index down 10.31 at 2,064.17. Turnover remained weak at FFr2.7bn. A raft of first-half sales figures did nothing to excite interest, especially as most of the data had been well flagged in advance. LVMH was among those companies providing figures, the shares slipping FFr3 to FFr865 as it announced a near 20 per cent rise in year-on-year sales. ZURICH stayed interested in bank shares, but the market benefited as UBS regained its equilibrium after its falls on its own poor results and Tuesday's bond market weakness. UBS, the most active stock, ended SFr3 higher at SFr1,112 after an early low of SFr1,095, and the SMI index closed 5.9 firmer at 2,591.4. Ciba registered rose SFr4 to SFr815 following its acquisition of the ophthalmic pharmaceutical product line of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Swissair added SFr21 at SFr851, taking its cumulative gain to SFr101 in August so far. Dealers said Swissair rose on a short-term buy recommendation by a British broker, following UBS's recent upgrade to 'buy' from 'hold'. They saw US investors, which recently had shown interest in the shares in European carriers, as buyers. MILAN lost 2 per cent in the Comit index as sell programs took their toll of blue chips. The index dipped 14.81 to 674.52, with turnover reported as low. Traders noted that if the index fell below the 670 support mark, the next level of resistance would be 620-640. Olivetti was among the stocks being sold, with the shares down L50 at L2,175, while Fiat slipped L65 to L6,575 and Pirelli L20 to L2,710. COPENHAGEN receded 1.1 per cent after the market was disappointed by weaker than expected six-month results from Novo Nordisk, the drugs and biotechnology group. Novo reported profits of DKr550m, against market expectations of above DKr600m, as the share price fell DKr50, or 7.5 per cent, to DKr616. The KFX index finished 1.13 down at 103.41. ISTANBUL rallied 5 per cent as domestic investors supported the market and foreigners continued to make selective purchases. The composite index advanced 1,249.68 to 23,954.57. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders in London commented that the market's momentum had been building up following better than expected first-half results, a stable dollar and lower interest rates. Second-line stocks had been pushing the market forward, rather than blue chips, he added. TEL AVIV gained 1.6 per cent as the strong market sentiment from the political peace process continued. The Mishtanim index closed 3.13 up at 197.32. Analysts expected the market to stabilise before it challenged the 230 level at the end of the year.

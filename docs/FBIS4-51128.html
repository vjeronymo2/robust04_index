			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 13 May (XINHUA) -- In recent years, the  total amount of China's state-owned assets rapidly increased and  their economic efficiency turned for the better as our socialist  market economy developed in depth. According to the latest  statistics compiled by the State Administration of State  Property [SASP], as of the end of 1992, the total amount of the  book value of China's state-owned assets increased 14.3 percent,  or 385.1 billion yuan, from 2,684.6 billion yuan in the previous  year to reach 3,069.7 billion yuan (excluding either the assets  in terms of resources or the army units' and armed police force  units' state-owned assets).    Of the total amount of state-owned assets 1,458.4 billion  yuan, or 47.5 percent, were under the management of central  government units and 1,611.3 billion yuan, or 52.5 percent, were  under the management of local governments. Of the total amount  of state-owned assets, 72 percent, or 2,210.1 billion yuan, were  used to conduct business operations, while the remaining 28  percent, or 859.6 billion yuan were not used to conduct business  operations. The amount of state-owned assets used to conduct  business operations posted an increase of 13.1 percent, or 256.5  billion yuan, over the previous year.    The total amount of state-owned assets represented the  overwhelming majority of the total amount of assets in society.  State enterprises took a leading role in the whole national  economy.    In terms of sectors, as of the end of 1992, the total amount  of state-owned industrial enterprises' assets reached 1,649.8  billion yuan. State-owned enterprises accounted for over 90  percent of such important industries as energy, communications,  mineral products, high technology, banking, and foreign trade  which have a bearing on the national economy and the people's  livelihood. The growth rate of the total amount of state-owned  assets of the industrial, architectural engineering,  agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy sectors was higher  than the national average growth rate by more than 10 percentage  points. Among them, the total amount of state-owned assets of  the real estate industry and enterprises that implement a  shareholding system posted the fastest growth rate. As of the  end of 1992, the total amount of state-owned assets of the real  estate industry reached 90.5 billion yuan, an increase of 69.8  percent over the previous year, and the total amount of  state-owned assets of the enterprises that implement a  shareholding system reached 28.4 billion yuan, an increase of  175.7 percent over the previous year.    In terms of regions, the state-owned assets under the  management of local governments enjoyed very rapid growth in  recent years. Shandong Province, whose state-owned assets posted  a growth rate of as high as 30.5 percent in 1992, enjoyed the  fastest growth of all. The state-owned assets of coastal areas  in east China, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and  Fujian, posted an average growth rate of 21.7 percent; those of  south China regions, including Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan,  17.3 percent; and those of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and other  regions 16.6 percent. In terms of regional distribution,  coastal areas captured a bigger amount of state-owned assets  than others. As of the end of 1992, the top 10 provinces and  municipalities that took the leading rank in terms of the total  amount of state-owned assets under the management of local  governments were as follows: Guangdong had 165.7 billion yuan;  Jiangsu, 103.2 billion yuan; Shandong, 102.8 billion yuan;  Liaoning, 96.5 billion yuan; Sichuan, 87.7 billion yuan;  Shanghai 82.7 billion yuan; Beijing, 79.2 billion yuan; Hubei,  69.6 billion yuan; Hebei, 66.3 billion yuan; and Zhejiang, 62.5  billion yuan.    An authoritative person of the SASP said: The above figures  show that, expedited by reform and opening up, state-owned  assets are growing continuously and very rapidly. The entire  state-owned economy is continuously expanding and represents a  leading force of China's national economy.    He also pointed out: As a result of deepening reform and  opening up wider, state-owned enterprises have been continuously  invigorated and their economic efficiency has turned for the  better. At the end of 1992, China's state-owned enterprises  turned 329.1 billion yuan in tax payments over to the state, an  increase of 16 percent, or 45.3 billion yuan, over the previous  year; they made profits worth 117.6 billion yuan, an increase of  11.3 percent, or 11.9 billion yuan, over the previous year. The  ratio of enterprises that suffered losses dropped 7.3 percentage  points from the previous year's 31.6 percent to 24.3 percent.  The ratio that the amount of losses captured in the economic  returns of business operations dropped from the previous year's  32.1 percent to 26.7 percent. The taxes paid by state-owned  enterprises to the state accounted for approximately two thirds  of the budgeted revenue.</p>

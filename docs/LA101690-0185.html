			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ACTOR BEGLEY BOOSTS RECYCLING  </P> <P> Ed Begley Jr. says he has been into recycling since 1970 and recently refused a  ride in an NBC limousine during a promotional tour for his new TV series,  "Parenthood."  </P> <P> Instead, Begley said in the November issue of Redbook, he rode his bike from  his San Fernando Valley home to the Century City studio.  </P> <P> "It's late. But it's not too late," said the former "St. Elsewhere" star, who  is on the boards of seven environmental organizations and recycles everything  from newspapers to metal products.  </P> <P> "People have to realize that they can turn this around quicker than they think.  How? By exercising their voting power and their purchasing power."  </P></p>

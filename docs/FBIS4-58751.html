			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Khalil] </F>   [Excerpts] The talks between the Nasirists and the  extremist groups has resumed following a seminar held by writer  Fahmi Huwaydi and organized by the Nasirite Party. During the  seminar, Huwaydi said he carried a message from the religious  groups and the Islamic movement. Following the seminar, the  Nasirite-Islamic meetings increased.    For some time [leading Nasarist] Farid 'Abd-al-Hakim has  been  promoting the idea of talks and coalition between the two sides.  He has been in touch recently with jailed members of the  extremist groups as one of their lawyers, along with Muntasir  al-Zayyat. Lawyer Sayyid 'Abd-al-Fattah, who has been arrested  in connection with the Salsabil case [computer company said to  be connected with Muslim Brotherhood], attended these meetings.    During the meetings, the extremists claimed that their  opinion of the Nasirists had changed and that now they consider  them the closest political force to the general Islamic  principles. They noted that they and the Nasirists now see eye  to eye on most issues, particularly their stance on Israel and  the West. [passage omitted]    Dr. 'Isam al-'Iryan, member of the Muslim Brotherhood, has  stressed that the doors are open for dialogue with any faction.  He added that he has met with Farid 'Abd-al-Hakim, whom he  described as clear and well-motivated. He added that the  important things in this dialogue are the bases, the subjects,  and the goals. Dr. al-'Iryan pointed out that the Muslim  Brotherhood has nothing to do with what happens in the meeting  of the political bureaus of the Labor and Nasirite parties  because the Labor Party has freedom of action. He noted that  the alliance between the Labor Party and the Muslim Brotherhood  still stands in specific areas, such as running for elections  and coordination over general positions.</p>

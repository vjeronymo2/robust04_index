			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Along with the fast  development of the real estate sector, it is very necessary to  formulate a special law for it and put it under legal management.    This is the common view of Chinese legislators as they are  deliberating the draft law on management of urban real estate  sector during the current session of the Standing Committee of  the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature.    They pointed out that arable land of China has decreased  drastically in recent years, thus, approval and renting out of  the land also should be put under the legal system.    Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peiyao said  that it is hard to draw a clear line between rural and urban  areas due to economic development, especially in rural industry  and service trade.    The vice-chairman suggested that a unified administrative  institution be set up for the real estate sector and a single  law be formulated for both the urban and rural real estate  sectors.    Member Qin Zhongda said that large-scale development of land  will likely take place as many people want to reap huge profits  from it. The law should provide concrete regulations on how to  save land, prevent its waste and punish those bent on  trafficking in it. Otherwise, people's living environment will  be greatly damaged.    Member Tao Dayong, who is also an economist, pointed out  that  the draft law under deliberation is very important and ought to  be passed as soon as possible.    The economist expressed his worry that without the law, the  unhealthy development of the sector will possibly affect  reforms, development and social stability.    Member Zou Jue maintained that lax administration of the  sector has also led to corruption among some grassroots  officials.    The woman legislator Lin Liyun stressed the protection of  private real estate of overseas Chinese and their relatives in  China.    She said that governments at all levels have done a lot in  recent years in returning houses to Overseas Chinese and their  relatives. But new violations of their rights have happened  during recent urban construction and the development of the real  estate sector. The law should make clear provisions on this,  she said.</p>

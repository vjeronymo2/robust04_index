			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Vondra, first deputy minister of </F> foreign affairs of the Czech Republic, by unidentified OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA correspondent; place and date not given: "Into NATO--for  the Defense of Democracy"]    [Text] Working consultations with diplomats of  certain European states, the Czech Republic included, have been  held in Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Czech Republic  delegation was headed by Aleksandr Vondra, first deputy minister  of foreign affairs. Formerly a dissident, after 1989 he became  an assistant to Vaclav Havel for foreign policy and subsequently  a professional diplomat. Aleksandr Vondra answers OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA's questions.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] The Czech Republic is energetically  seeking membership of NATO. Is this not dictated by a fear that  some time ahead, in several years, say, Russia might extend its  imperial ambitions to the Czech Republic?    [Vondra] The debate in the Czech Republic about NATO  membership is not dictated primarily by fear. We have other  motives, and they are connected with our understanding of what  the North Atlantic alliance represents. It was never perceived  as a hostile force in my country. Many people saw it as a  community defending Western liberties against communism, others  saw the opposed military blocs as two mighty fortresses, between  which we were situated.    Read the Washington Treaty of 1949, and you will see that it  says nothing about enemies. It says that the states subscribing  to the treaty undertake to guard democracy, Western values,  liberty, and the constitutional state. We are a small state, for  which remaining neutral and providing for our defenses on our  own are difficult. The best means of the defense of democracy  for us is membership in a system of collective defense. The sole  effective instrument of such defense today is NATO, which for 50  years not only guarded Western liberty and democracy against  communism but has maintained also a certain internal order in  Europe itself. We, as a country situated right at the center of  Europe and cleaving to Western values, are interested in joining  the North Atlantic alliance. This is our main mission, and here  our position differs somewhat from that of other countries,  perhaps.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Should we understand you to mean that  membership of NATO would symbolize the Czech Republic's return  to a Europe of which it had always been a part?    [Vondra] For us this is a final return to a world to which  we  have historically belonged. But this step is not simply a  symbol. In joining a system of collective security we would like  simultaneously to insure ourselves against any extreme  contingency.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Could the Partnership for Peace--if only  partially--afford you the guarantees you seek? As we all know,  when signing the agreement with Ukraine, Bill Clinton promised  it some guarantees, not more closely defined....    [Vondra] Clearly, the guarantees promised Ukraine are not  the  same guarantees of security that NATO members possess. In my  view, it was confirmed in Ukraine's case that it is an  independent state, not some temporary formation, as some  politicians would like. Even though Ukraine does not have a  strong historical tradition of national statehood, it should be  respected. That is, I would say that the guarantees to Ukraine  are primarily guarantees of political will.    As far as the Partnership for Peace is concerned, we have  been promised nothing, merely offered cooperation with NATO on  an individual basis. And we believe that final membership of the  North Atlantic alliance would complete the process, which will  take some time. We are prepared to invest resources to ensure  that this process culminate in the establishment of the fullest  mutual trust and the Czech Republic's official membership of the  alliance. Guarantees of the assurance of our national security  would thereby be placed on the table at the same time also.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] And does not the aspiration to such  guarantees betray, nonetheless, a fear in the face of the  development of events in Russia?    [Vondra] No. I believe, moreover, that a unique opportunity  connected with the fact that the present-day Czech Republic is  not the former Czechoslovakia is, in a sense, opening up before  us. However paradoxical, we are now after all situated "further  away" from Russia: We are separated by two whole  states--Slovakia and Ukraine. Now we need not, as previously, be  so afraid, and this could contribute to the greater balance of  Czech-Russian relations. Now we can look at Russia more  rationally, without the previous emotions, and cooperate. This  is a new challenge demanding a response from both parties.</p>

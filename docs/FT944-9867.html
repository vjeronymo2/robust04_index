			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Hospital chief slapped down: Bottomley disowns claim that patients should be third in doctors' priorities Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, and health service professional organisations yesterday disowned comments by a hospital trust chairman that patients should come third on the list of doctors' priorities, after the relationship with their managers and their own professional development. Mr Roy Lilley, chairman of the Homewood NHS Trust in Chertsey, Surrey, set out the priorities in an article which has yet to be published in the journal HealthCare Today. Department of Health officials said Mr Lilley was 'speaking of his own volition and not for the secretary of state'. Patients had always been put first and this principle applied throughout the health service, the department said. The National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts said the paramount duty of doctors should be to patients and described Mr Lilley's remarks as 'not particularly helpful'. Mr Lilley said yesterday that he never said that patients should come last: 'Patients are at the very centre of everything we do but, first of all, doctors have got to get the relationships with the organisations they work with sorted out.' Mr Lilley said Mrs Bottomley expected everybody in the health service to put patients first, but 'down here, at the coal face, there are some real difficulties with working relationships with doctors'. After their organisations, doctors have a duty to themselves and their professional training, Mr Lilley said. He claimed that supermarket cashiers received more rigorous training in the latest technologies than doctors were likely to get in developments in medical techniques. He added: 'As it stands at the moment, a doctor who fancies having a go at something can, out of curiosity, go and get himself involved in a branch of medicine or surgery without having to get more qualifications.' This contrasted with, for example, airline pilots, who had annual medical checks and regular training. 'Even the little girl on the checkout in Sainsbury's, if they introduce a new till, has to go on a course to find out how to use it,' he said. To meet Treasury requirements, performance management had to be introduced into trusts by next March, Mr Lilley said. But the British Medical Association had opposed the move and 'just waved two fingers at everybody and that's made the relationships that managers have with doctors very difficult indeed'. Mr Lilley said patients could be better cared for 'if you've got an organisation that isn't in chaos and if procedures are being carried out by people who are well-trained and up to date. That seems to me to be straightforward logic.' Mr Philip Hunt, director of the trusts association, said the key to improving the NHS was for doctors and managers to work in partnership. 'If you come out with statements about how awful doctors are you are going to undermine that partnership,' he said. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said Mr Lilley's views were 'completely outrageous'. Patients' interests had to come first.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: A joint account for Midland FT-SE Index: 2,491.2 (+20.5) The Hongkong Bank's Mr William Purves has a canny sense of timing. With Midland Bank's profits finally poised to recover and his own bank's share price riding high after last week's 83 per cent jump in earnings, it was now or never for a merger. Even after yesterday's 30 per cent leap in Midland's share price, there is still an opportunity for HSBC, as the holding company is called, to pick up a bargain. The risk to the UK clearer's shareholders is that, after a five-year wait, their management will be in such a rush it will sell the bank on the cheap. Midland's depressed profits and shrunken dividend make its shares difficult to value on any normal yield or earnings basis. By last night, however, they were still at a premium of only 22 per cent to net assets, even after adjusting the latter for the property devaluation not incorporated in the 1991 balance sheet. The present price barely discounts the prospect that, on its own, Midland could expect earnings per share of some 60p by 1994. Shareholders could reasonably demand a larger premium from HSBC. It is likely to make a paper offer with scarcely a glint of cash. Acceptance would add to Midland shareholders' risk by exposing them to the volatile climate in Hong Kong, where the combined entity would have nearly a quarter of its assets. The Hongkong Bank's results may have sparkled last year, but that reflected wide margins in the territory's local banking market which are unlikely to be repeated. Nor is disclosure of its hidden reserves guaranteed to help. The challenge for Mr Purves is to pitch the price high enough to lure Midland shareholders without upsetting existing HSBC owners. It is not as if he can claim large immediate cost savings, though Midland could benefit from HSBC's retail banking technology. The complementarity of the two groups is almost certainly an exaggerated advantage. It could generate some additional business, though how much is open to question. Nor is it easy to forget HSBC's dismal record at overseas diversification, epitomised in Marine Midland and Australia. HSBC's need to hedge its risks before 1997 means it needs Midland Bank much more than the UK clearer now needs it. One has to assume yesterday's announcement signals confidence that the regulatory hurdles can soon be overcome and a price agreed. Once that price is known Midland shareholders will need to ponder whether to accept or sell in the market and switch to a bank whose recovery is not yet fully discounted.</p>

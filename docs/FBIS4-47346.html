Mordasov, Tambov Chemical Engineering </F> Institute; UDC 532.137:53.082.32]    [Abstract] The urgency of pneumatic monitoring of the  physical and chemical properties of liquid media in production  systems, e.g., by using a rigid-wall chamber-type transducer  (KPP), prompted the development of an immersible capillary  automatic viscosimeter which realizes the pneumatic method of  measuring the liquid outflow through the capillary. The design  and operating principle of the new instrument are described in  detail, and a schematic diagram is cited. A system of  differential equations which describes the processes in the  automatic viscosity-to-pneumatic signal transducer is derived,  and the equation's coefficients are summarized in a table. The  device has a measurement range of  (0.5-2.5)[.sup].[/]10[.sup]-3[/]  m[.sup]2[/]s[.sup]-1[/] at a temperature of 20C, a  response of 87[.sup].[/]10[.sup]-3[/]  s/m[.sup]2[/]s[.sup]-1[/], and a basic adjusted error of  3.5%. The pneumatic rectangular output signal has a  duration  equal to the monitored liquid outflow doze duration; the primary  signal is converted by a secondary transducer into viscosity  readings in a digital form. The automatic capillary  viscosimeter's operations can be analyzed theoretically. Figures  1; tables 2; references 6.</p>

Prokes said that the SNS fully agreed with the view of its  coalition partner, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS), that the elections should be called as early as possible.    He said that the vote of no confidence in Deputy Premier  Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik by the HZDS  Board on Saturday [12 February] was a natural result of the  developments within the HZDS.    Roman Kovac and Moravcik [are] the initiators of a new  faction within the HZDS aimed at creating a broad coalition  government.    Prokes said that the SNS and the HZDS had not yet discussed  possible successors to Kovac and Moravcik if they are dismissed.  It is premature to evaluate the question of whether the post of  foreign minister will be offered to himself, Prokes stated.    Reacting to the proposals made by the newly established HZDS  faction, the Alternative of Political Realism, Prokes said that  the country had already experienced a National Front in the  communist period. If such steps are taken now, it would be the  end of pluralism, he added.    Prokes assured that the eight-member SNS group of deputies  would support the amendment to the large privatization law,  which is to be the first point on the agenda of the next meeting  within the current parliamentary session, scheduled for  Wednesday [16 February].</p>

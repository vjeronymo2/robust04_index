			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Three Harland arms up for sale HARLAND SIMON, the control systems specialist rocked by a profits warning in February, yesterday confirmed that it was seeking buyers for three subsidiaries in a move to cut borrowings and concentrate on mainstream businesses. Mr David Mahony, who returned as chairman following the resignation of Mr Roy Ashman, said negotiations were at an 'advanced stage' for the sale of Vickerys, which makes blades and screens for the water and paper industries. NEF, a Swedish subsidiary, and Pro-Aqua, involved in water control, are also being targeted for sale. Following the disposals, Harland will focus on its electrical and electronic businesses. Harland's shares rallied 15p to 94p on the news. The shares have collapsed from 585p in February. Several institutional shareholders liquidated their holdings following the profits warning, which also revealed provisions of Pounds 750,000 to cover disputed payments due from two companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Ashman resigned following the profits warning. Mr Mahony said that despite the fall in the share price, Harland had not run into trading difficulties. In June Harland is due to announce results for the year to March 31. Hoare Govett, the company's broker, has cut its forecast from Pounds 13m to Pounds 4m. Vickerys made operating profits in excess of Pounds 1m in the year to March 31 from turnover of Pounds 11m. However, NEF and Pro-Aqua are expected to incur combined losses of Pounds 700,000 for the period. Proceeds from any sales will be used to reduce borrowings, which have increased from Pounds 3.3m a year ago to about Pounds 13m. Most of the increase is due to last year's Pounds 7m-worth of acquisitions. Mr Mahony said Harland's relationship with Perfect Information, an on-line news cuttings service with links to Mr Ashman, was 'under review'. Harland owns a Pounds 600,000 debenture in PI which, if converted, is equal to 18 per cent of the company's equity. Harland's pension scheme also has an investment of Pounds 500,000 in the service. He said PI was now 'making progress', despite a warning in February that delays and start-up costs would reduce profits due to Harland by Pounds 3m.</p>

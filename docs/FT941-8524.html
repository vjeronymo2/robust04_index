			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / BNL post takes Sarcinelli home The appointment of Mr Mario Sarcinelli as chairman of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro will bring a further shake-up to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. However, the prospective move to the BNL by this well-respected former director general of the Italian Treasury adds considerable impetus to the planned privatisation of Italy's largest state-controlled commercial bank. Mr Sarcinelli, 59, who is No. 3 at the London-based EBRD, said last night he was looking forward to heading the BNL. 'I always go to places where there is a lot of challenge.' Mr Sarcinelli said he was offered the BNL job in a telephone call from a 'high place' in the Italian government on Thursday morning. Although one business associate of Mr Sarcinelli yesterday described him as 'a fish out of water' at the EBRD, he said he was 'not at all unhappy' at the bank. Formerly in charge of the development banking department that was merged with EBRD's merchant banking team towards the end of last year, Mr Sarcinelli said the EBRD reorganisation 'was one largely at my instigation.' He added: 'I am sad that I will not be reaping the results.' One EBRD executive said Mr Sarcinelli's move came as a surprise. 'He was not forced out. He has landed a wonderful job. It is a good reflection on us.' Mr Sarcinelli said he would leave the EBRD after its annual meeting in St Petersburg on April 18/19. Choosing a successor was a matter for Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the EBRD president. 'I hope he has someone in mind,' Mr Sarcinelli said. Mr Sarcinelli was the most brilliant mind of his generation recruited by the Bank of Italy, and rapidly moved up the ranks during the 1970s to become deputy general general. But he paid a very high price for daring to behave as an impartial public servant, pushing in 1978 for an inspection of the troubled Banco Ambrosiano, run by Mr Roberto Calvi. In a politically-motivated move, Mr Sarcinelli was arrested in 1979 along with Mr Paolo Baffi, the then governor of the Bank of Italy, on trumped up charges by Rome magistrates. The charges were subsequently dropped and he was reinstated, becoming director-general of the Treasury. However, he felt constrained in Italy's highly politicised environment in the late 1980s, and resigned in 1989 in a row over the way the Andreotti government was permitting uncontrolled credit cover for the Soviet Union. The BNL has a tortured history. The bank has been associated with the secret masonic lodge P2 headed by Mr Licio Gelli. Mr Gelli and the P2 were found to be closely linked to the fraudulent bankruptcy of the Banco Ambrosiano. Mr Sarcinelli's appointment is also a signal from the government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi that it will try to push through BNL's privatisation. The BNL, traditionally controlled by the Socialists, has resisted any such move.</p>

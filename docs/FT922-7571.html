			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Easing traffic congestion in Oldham A traffic bottleneck in Oldham will be relieved under a Pounds 5m road improvement contract awarded to TARMAC CONSTRUCTION. About 2.6 kilometres of the A62 Manchester Road in Oldham is to be converted into a dual carriageway. It will run from Oldham's ring road, the Oldham Way to South Street. The contract, for Oldham Municipal Borough Council, includes extensive demolition of empty commercial properties, including several pubs and shops, to create the new southbound two-lane carriageway. The existing road will be upgraded to become the northbound two-lane carriageway. Work includes excavating and capping old mine shafts and pumping up to 4,000 tonnes of grouting into the mine workings. More than 30 side streets will also have to be re-aligned at their junctions with Manchester Road.</p>

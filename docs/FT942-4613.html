			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Housewife who built empire from nothing: China's economic surge is producing a new breed of tycoon As China's economic surge throws up a new breed of tycoons, few can be more unusual than Mrs Rabia Kader. Mrs Kader is an ethnic Uighur Moslem who has built up a business empire out of nothing in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Province in the far west of China. She has managed to do so despite the deep-seated worries of the Chinese authorities about the position of the ethnic minorities who make up 60 per cent of Xinjiang's 15m population. A 4 square metre shop which Mrs Kader opened in 1982 has turned into a 10,000 square metre shopping centre in the heart of Urumqi. The centre is only part of fast-growing property, trading, agricultural and manufacturing interests grouped under the umbrella of her Xinjiang Arkider Industrial and Commercial Corporation. 'What I have gained today is not something easy,' Mrs Kader said in an interview during a visit to London. 'It is the result of long struggle and of not sleeping for many months. People say I am made of iron. And it is true.' Mrs Kader is in Britain to seek UK investment in Xinjiang, to buy machinery for her factories and to find a location for a Uighur restaurant she would like to set up in London. She also wants to set up shops selling silk, fruits and other Xinjiang produce. She is reluctant to talk in detail about the problems she faced in establishing herself. Before the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, she was a housewife eking out extra income through buying and selling goods such as wood and liang fu, a Uighur concoction of tomato powder and garlic said to be good for the digestion. 'We were always depressed,' she says of that time. 'Any initiative was assumed to be capitalist.' But, starting with only the equivalent of Dollars 10, she began to do business in earnest as early as 1977, the year before Deng Xiaoping began to open up the economy. In 1980, with her eighth child only 40 days old, she embarked on a gruelling tour of China's big cities, beginning in Shanghai. 'At that time I hardly spoke Chinese at all. I brought together buyers and sellers and even cooked Moslem food for Islamic businessmen.' Mrs Kader traded textiles, clothes and food. She bought goods from Moslems who had gone on pilgrimages to Mecca. The small shop she opened in Urumqi in 1982 became a rapidly-growing focus for her business. As the 1980s unfolded, successive relaxations of official controls made it easier to do business, culminating in last year's award to border provinces of privileges similar to those enjoyed by the booming coastal regions. Mrs Kader is careful to give credit to the central government in Beijing and the provincial authorities in Urumqi. 'In the past 15 years since Deng Xiaoping came to power, China has been moving in the right direction.' Although she is a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body on which elder statesmen and other successful figures sit, Mrs Kader professes to have no interest in politics. 'I am just an entrepreneur,' she says. 'I concentrate on making money and on how I can contribute to the economy of Xinjiang Province. I don't pay attention to politics at all.' Her protestations are understandable, given her sensitive position, as well as that of her husband, who is a scholar of Uighur history. Uighurs, whose language is close to Uzbek and Turkish, number 7m in Xinjiang, China's largest province by area, though ethnic Han Chinese tend to occupy top official positions. The Chinese authorities are perennially concerned about Uighur nationalism, especially following the break-up of the Soviet Union and the emergence of the new 'silk route' states which border on or are close to Xinjiang, and with which Mrs Kader trades actively. China's premier, Mr Li Peng, toured Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in April, seeking to strengthen commercial ties partly to ward off ethnically-inspired friction; in Kazakhstan, for example, there are militant Uighurs who seek independence for Xinjiang. Mrs Kader's success is controversial even within the Uighur community. 'Moslem women are normally supposed to stay at home and look after their husband. It is very rare for a Moslem woman to travel so widely. A lot of people complained and were jealous.' But, she says, 'I am determined I must succeed. If a man can do it, a woman can do it too.' Her present fortune can only be guessed at, but is substantial. She says she does not want to pass on the business to her 11 children, whose ages range from 30 to 3, because she wants them instead to acquire knowledge, for example of high technology. 'I will pay for their degrees in subjects which are useful to society, because I did not have such an opportunity.'</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Former LUI directors may face disqualification moves THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is considering disqualification actions against former directors of London United Investments, the insolvent insurance group, following a highly critical inspectors' report. The report, published yesterday, says that between 1970 and 1989 about Pounds 40m in commissions was 'wrongfully diverted' through HS Weavers, an underwriting subsidiary of LUI, and CR Driver, an underwriter which did business with the group, to companies in Germany and Liechtenstein. These companies were controlled by Mr Graham Smith, an accountant since debarred from the profession, who refused to co-operate with the inspectors. The report criticises Mr Charles Driver, Mr Henry Weavers, who has died, and Mr Peter Wilson. All three were directors of LUI. It also criticises Mr Stanley Mayhew, a director of CR Driver. All denied the accusations. The DTI said it was beginning disqualification proceedings, but would not specify against which directors. Its insurance division said it was also considering action to debar any directors from taking positions with insurance companies. The inspectors' report makes some criticisms of the procedures used by KPMG Peat Marwick, auditors to LUI and Weavers, and Billsons Cullen, now part of Kingston Smith, which was auditor to Weavers until 1987. The conclusions appear to lend support to civil and criminal action triggered by the collapse of LUI in 1990 and of associated companies. The Serious Fraud Office and City of London police launched an inquiry into suspected offences of fraud at LUI and its subsidiaries after a referral from the DTI in April 1992. The SFO said yesterday that its investigations were continuing. Requests for assistance from the authorities in Switzerland and Liechtenstein are currently on appeal in the two countries' supreme courts. The 316-page document was written by Mr Angus Gilroy and Mr William Gage, who were commissioned by the DTI in October 1990 to examine the collapse of LUI. Their inquiry was extended to include CR Driver in January 1992. The investigation cost Pounds 2.3m. The inspectors were unable to trace the final destination of the money, but said they believed Mr Driver, Mr Weavers and Mr Wilson had 'derived some financial benefit' from the transactions. The DTI has also sent copies of the report to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, and to the Lloyd's insurance market. Complex case sparks conflicts of interest, Page 10</p>

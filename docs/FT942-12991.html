			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Observer: One Delors closes . . . Jean-Luc Dehaene is not the most obvious candidate to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Resembling a slimmed-down version of Helmut Kohl, the bespectacled Belgian premier has little international diplomatic experience - and a great face for radio. Still, the German chancellor has taken a shine to Dehaene, and so people - not least the British Foreign Office - are suddenly taking him seriously for the top executive job in Brussels. UK interest in his chances is all the keener because of Dehaene's enthusiasm for federalism, a bogey word in Britain. Dehaene wants faster political and economic European integration balanced by greater devolution of power to the regions. It's the same model Belgium has adopted in response to pressure for greater autonomy in Flanders and Wallonia. The man himself won't say if his hat is in the ring; nor will anyone in the Belgian government. But contingency plans for his departure are forming. Of course, he may still be blocked by the British and Dutch, who lean more towards Ruud Lubbers. And, in spite of his protestations that he just wants to go home to Dublin, Peter Sutherland, out-going head of the Gatt and a former EU commissioner, will have to get used to hearing his name floated repeatedly as the compromise candidate.</p>

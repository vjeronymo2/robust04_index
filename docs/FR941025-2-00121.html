Potomac represents that while no sale of AHL is currently feasible on favorable terms, AHL has returned to profitability following the difficulties it experienced over the last half of 1991 and during 1992. Potomac states that these profitable operations will result in a very significant return to the Plans on their investment over the near term, particularly when compared to the only viable alternative, a sale of AHL's ships at a price approximating their scrap value. Since a scrap value sale of the ships remains available after the relatively short period of profitable operations permitted under OPA 1990,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Potomac believes that the Plans' retention of their investment is the preferable investment course of action over the near term, even if OPA 1990's requirements ultimately end the useful life of AHL's ships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Potomac represents that AHL's Board, subject to Potomac's review as investment manager, has instituted a number of measures designed to return AHL to profitability. These measures included a change in AHL's key management, the ability of new management to secure term, as opposed to spot charters, and the installation of more refined and sophisticated cash management and management information systems. In addition, AHL had significant necessary maintenance performed, including the successful completion of total drydock on three of AHL's four ships. During the first quarter of 1994, AHL earned a net profit of $787,284 from operations, and shareholders' equity rose to the highest level in AHL's history. Potomac represents that it believes that in 1994, AHL will earn between $1.2 million and $1.6 million from operations. Potomac further represents that the scrap value of the ships will not decline significantly from today's values, if at all, over the near term. Thus, even if AHL found that OPA 1990's requirements left it with no option other than scrapping its vessels after 1996, the continued operation of the company, so long as it is profitable, will leave the Plans with the added value generated by such profitability, plus roughly the same scrap value that they could now realize. In addition, this investment option allows AHL to continue to study other options and await market developments that may significantly enhance the value of its assets to a potential buyer and thus significantly enhance the value of the Plans' investment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. One such potential market development involves the reconstruction of existing single-hulled vessels to meet the requirements of OPA 1990, which may present a cost-effective alternative to the building of new ships. This alternative entails attaching new, double-hulled cargo bodies to the engine and crew sections of existing ships. Potomac represents that discussions it has had with Avondale Industries, Inc. (Avondale), one of the nation's leading shipbuilding companies, suggest that the cost of rebuilding an existing vessel in this fashion would be approximately 50% of the cost of a new vessel. This potential cost savings represents an important value potential for AHL's existing ships that Potomac represents would exceed the ship's scrap value and may be attractive to a possible buyer should a demand for rebuilt ships, in fact, develop. Potomac has been exploring this option in discussions with Avondale and representatives of the United States Coast Guard. In addition, preliminary discussions have been held with the Federal Maritime Administration concerning the potential financing of such a project, by whomever is the owner, with federal loan guarantees. Potomac emphasizes in exploring this option that it does not intend the Plans either to make any additional investment in AHL for this purpose, or to guarantee any financing for AHL. In fact, BSFS, in its capacity of named fiduciary for the Plans with oversight responsibility over Potomac (see rep. 13., below), has made it clear to Potomac that any such investment by the Plans, either directly or in the form of guarantees, is out of the question. Rather, it is Potomac's goal to advance this conversion project so as to make AHL and its ships attractive to a potential buyer/investor in the event a market for reconfigured vessels develops as a cost-effective alternative to new construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. BSFS represents that its obligations under the Court Order to monitor and report on the activities of the investment managers for the Special Assets Portfolio sharply restrict Potomac's opportunity to perpetuate unduly the Plans' continued ownership of AHL. Pursuant to the investment management agreement with Potomac that BSFS negotiated on behalf of the Plans, Potomac is obligated to supply detailed quarterly reports on each of the Special Assets it manages and to comply with written investment guidelines. Those guidelines state that Potomac ``shall seek, among other prudent objectives, to: (A) Maximize the Plans' net, long-term investment return [and] (B) Liquidate each such investment when and insofar as prudent *&blank;*&blank;*'' Furthermore, the guidelines require Potomac to prepare and update on a quarterly basis an ``action plan'' for each asset, including AHL. The action plan requires the investment manager to state the timetable for achieving a sale (if sale is intended) or for achieving any other stated objective. In short, BSFS represents that significant mechanisms are in place to prevent Potomac from improperly seeking to continue indefinitely to manage the Plans' Stock in AHL. BSFS represents that in its capacity as Named Fiduciary, it has reviewed in depth Potomac's analysis of the various options available and has accepted Potomac's conclusion that the continued ownership of the Stock is in the best interests of the Plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

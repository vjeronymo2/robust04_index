			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pawel Reszka: "Government-`Solidarity'; A Week </F> for Experts"]    [Text] Today experts of the government and "Solidarity"  ["S"] are beginning talks. In line with one version (submitted  by Marian Krzaklewski at a press conference), they are supposed  to prepare proposals of legal changes that would be needed to  implement the demands of "S." The team's decisions would then  be approved by the Council of Ministers at its next session. In  line with another version (a joint communique by the director of  the Government Press Office and the "S" spokesman), they are  supposed to "review the most important problems submitted by  both parties and propose solutions to them within a week. (...)  The results of the talks between the prime minister and the  chairmen of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union `S' and  other trade unions, just like the results of the work of  experts, will be presented and discussed at the session of the  Council of Ministers."    "S" says that the failure or success of the talks will  determine the staging of a mass protest. Until the decisions  are implemented (that is, as the National  Committee--KK--spokesman explained to us, until their results  are approved by the parliament), the union will strike in line  with the earlier schedule.  <H5>  What "S" Wants To Achieve </H5>   "S" is striking to protest the lowering of the living  standard of the Polish families. The union presented the  following proposals (in line with the words of the "S"  spokesman):    --slowing down the rate of increase of the energy prices  ("S"  claims that it has been accepted by the World Bank)    --increasing the real wages of the people    --implementing the "Pact on Enterprise"    --amending the Budget Law (more money for social aid) and  amending the budget-related laws    --collecting income taxes in families (distributing the  income among all of the family members, including children); in  families with the lowest incomes (on the border of the  biological minimum), collecting no tax or lowering the limit    --deducting from the tax the costs of commuting to work and  the costs of educating the children    --a five-day workweek and all Saturdays free (so that more  people can be employed)    --giving the national property to all citizens.  <H5>  Which Laws Need To Be Amended </H5>   By the end of the week, the "S" experts, along with  government representatives, want to come up with proposals of  legal solutions that would make it possible to implement the  demands. "S" KK Press Spokesman Piotr Zak was not able to tell  us which laws "S" believes should be amended.    "This is what the experts are going to discuss," he  explained.    An analysis of the demands suggests that their  implementation  will call for amending the following laws:    --the Budget Law    --the Law on Income Tax for Persons    --the Labor Code    and the adoption of a new law on giving the national  property  to all citizens.  <H5>  What Rivals Say to That </H5>   "As far as I know, the purpose of the talks between the  government and `S' is the selection of the place to which the  problems of this trade union will be forwarded. It may be the  Trilateral Committee or the teams negotiating the Charter of  Social Guarantees," we learned from Waclaw Martyniuk, deputy  chairman of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ].  Martyniuk informed us that, at the meeting with OPZZ, the prime  minister stressed that he wants to hold joint negotiations with  all of the trade unions.</p>

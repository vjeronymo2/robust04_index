			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> GIFTED CHEF ADROIT AT EACH ITALIAN STYLE  </P> <P> Has success spoiled Massimo Navaretta? Not on your life.  </P> <P> When we last saw him, Navaretta was sporting a T-shirt, singing along with his  Celentano tapes and cooking pasta in a little neighborhood trattoria on Newport  Boulevard called Scampi. Then the restaurant took off, and so did Navaretta,  selling out to brother Fernando.  </P> <P> After a brief hiatus, Navaretta is back, working his magic anew. You'll find  him at his serious new restaurant, Amici, turning out creations such as potato  souffle ai porcini and lasagne al pesto. However, he's traded in his T-shirt  for a starchy white uniform and his Celentano for opera.  </P> <P> It's not that tapes of Italian pop singers don't suit this handsome trattoria,  located on a hard-to-find corner a block from the Orange County Performing Arts  Center. It's just that, well, opera suits it better. It's a casual restaurant,  to be sure, where you can sit and while away the evening undisturbed; but, it's  a serious one, too, where you can get a first-rate dinner and a fine bottle of  wine. In that respect, it is unique to the area around the Center.  </P> <P> The restaurant itself is small and intimate, all Art Deco lines and  salmon-colored walls that make it look like a private dining room on a '30s  cruise ship. Navaretta doesn't sing Puccini, but he does make a faint attempt  at imitating Picasso. The walls are plastered with mock Cubist collages he put  together all by himself: musical motifs made from guitars, mandolins and  flutes.  </P> <P> Of course his real artistry comes from the kitchen, where he turns out some of  the area's most surprising contemporary Italian dishes. He is a native of a  small coastal town in Napoli called Caserta, and the soul of his cooking is  southern Italian. But the restaurant's large menu shows an adroitness at nearly  every style Italy has to offer, as well as considerable originality and whimsy.  Expect a real tour de force.  </P> <P> Begin with one of the off-menu special antipasti. I've done it and really heard  singing. One evening the chef prepared a light fritto of zucchini flowers in a  fragrant tomato coulis. I thought his combination of Italian technique and  California style was brilliant; oddly enough, the taste reminded me of a dish I  once ate at a Japanese tea ceremony.  </P> <P> Another evening I had that magic potato souffle filled with fresh sauteed  porcini. The souffle, fluffy and golden brown, had been hollowed out to make  room for the mushrooms, which Navaretta has flown in frozen from Italy. They  are much better than the dried ones normally seen at Italian markets,  incidentally.  </P> <P> Scampi, a carry-over from the other restaurant and one of the house  specialties, are another item that he has flown in. Rush right over if you  haven't tasted them; these are not prawns but another beast altogether, like  small lobsters with a richer, more buttery flavor. The scampi available now are  from Iceland, but later on in the season they will be straight from the  Sardinian coast. I have tasted both and can't tell the difference. Besides,  with all the olive oil and garlic used in the broiling, you won't care. You eat  them out of the shells, and they are just fabulous.  </P> <P> A large number of interesting pastas should strike your fancy at some point.  Here you need to exercise judgment. Pasta e fagioli, the pasta and bean soup  traditionally claimed by Rome, gets the cavalier treatment only a true southern  Italian could minister it. There must be about 10 cloves of garlic in every  bowlful.  </P> <P>  Risotto ai quattro formaggi, a rice casserole with four cheeses, has a  wonderful taste, but I question the texture. For some reason, Navaretta uses  long-grain rice instead of Italian short-grain (Arborio) rice, a gesture that  some would consider sacrilegious. I wouldn't go that far, because I loved the  subtle tastes of Gorgonzola and fontina in his dish, but I did miss the grainy,  individual quality of the Italian rice. When it comes to risotto, I agree with  that Italian who said: "When you can count the number of grains in your mouth,  the risotto is great."  </P> <P>  Lasagne al pesto is excellent, anyway, a rich green pesto mingled into a  ricotta filling between thick, perfectly cooked noodle sheets. There is a fine  dish of penne with a vodka cream sauce, short tubes prepared Milan-modern with  a definite kick to it. I've saved the best for last: ravioli with ricotta  cheese. Chewy and soft, Navaretta's hand-rolled variety puts the others to  shame. Here they are topped with a Neapolitan tomato sauce, natch.  </P> <P> With such pasta treats on the menu, I always consider main dishes an  afterthought at good Italian restaurants. If you have enough gusto, however,  there are several not to be missed. Rotolo al Barolo is my favorite, a  sausage-stuffed chicken breast in a wonderful red wine sauce. The veal chop is  good, too, accompanied by a plate of sauteed spinach heavy with roasted garlic.  Unfortunately, it was also accompanied by the one sub-par thing I tasted in  this restaurant, a gummy saffron risotto.  </P> <P> Fish lovers should be happy with plates such as clams or mussels in garlic-rich  broth, broiled swordfish or bass brushed with olive oil and various stews of  whitefish, scampi and calamari.  </P> <P> Naples is famous for seafood, and Navaretta has the touch. Just don't let the  waiters talk you into having them with pastas. They stand on their own.  </P> <P> Navaretta also makes his own desserts. The ever-present tiramisu is the big  ticket, soaked in rum on the bottom and properly unctuous in the middle. An  oversized crema al caramello is fine and firm, and then, my choice, pear  poached in red Barolo wine on a moat of custard cream. That is the lightest of  the three, and if you order it you'll be humming Puccini all the way home.  </P> <P> Amici is moderately expensive. Antipasti are $5.95 to $8.95. Soup and pasta are  $3.95 to $8.95. Main dishes are $9.95 to $16.95. The back of the menu has a  large selection of Italian wines. Special occasion Italian wines such as  Ornellaia, Sassicaia and Brunello Biondi-Santi are available from an exclusive  list by request only.  </P> <P> AMICI  </P> <P> * 3220 Park Center Drive, Costa Mesa  </P> <P> * (714) 850-9399  </P> <P> * Open for lunch Mondays through Fridays, from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.; for  dinner Mondays through Thursdays from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays  from 5:30 to 11:30 p.m. Closed Sundays.  </P> <P> * Visa and MasterCard accepted  </P></p>

[Begin Kravchuk recording] I express satisfaction with the  meeting that took place today Russian President Boris Yeltsin  and U.S. President Bill Clinton. This really is a historic  moment. It opens up a new page in the resolution of such a  global problem as nuclear weapons. I am pleased to stress that  having signed these trilateral documents Ukraine, together with  other states, in the interests of the peoples of Ukraine and  Russia and of the whole of mankind, is going along the path of  nuclear disarmament and, I would say, is one of the first to  take this historic step.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- An estimated 2,000  inhabitants of Yangsan, South Kyongsang Province of South Korea,  staged a sit-down Thursday in protest against the installation  of a nuclear waste dump.    They called upon students to boycott school in protest,  bringing home to them the danger of a nuclear waste dump.    They undauntedly resisted ten companies of riot police  hurled  by the puppet clique to repress them.</p>

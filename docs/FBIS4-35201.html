			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 29 May (MENA) -- Authoritative Palestinian  sources have stated that recent rumors circulated by Israeli and  foreign media about the deterioration of the health of PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat are untrue and mere lies. The sources  said 'Arafat's health is good; in the past few days he has been  chairing meetings of the Palestinian National Authority Council.    The sources explained that 'Arafat recently underwent  medical  tests at the military hospital in Tunis under the supervision of  a team of prominent doctors. The tests lasted only two hours,  after which 'Arafat resumed his activity. The sources noted  that the doctors advised 'Arafat to get some rest. However,  this advice is not new. Such advice has been given to him  several times in the past because of his hectic activity and  frequent travel.    Regarding the rumors circulated by Western and Israeli media  that 'Arafat has divorced his wife Suha Tawil, the Palestinian  sources said these rumors are untrue and that 'Arafat and his  wife are leading a normal life.    The Palestinian sources said that the recent rumors of  'Arafat's illness and his divorce are an attempt to divert  attention from the course of peace and the gains which 'Arafat,  his negotiators, and the PLO Executive Committee members have  achieved.    The sources said that these rumors are part of a plan of  provocation and attrition that began with the campaign on  'Arafat following his address at a Johannesburg mosque in which  he spoke about a jihad to liberate Palestine. These rumors then  turned into a media campaign against 'Arafat and Suha Tawil.    The sources did not rule out that this campaign will  continue  before and after 'Arafat's return to Jericho.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Robt Jones ordered to pay record damages New Zealand's court of appeal yesterday ordered Robt Jones Pacific, a subsidiary of Tasman Properties, to pay NZDollars 73m (USDollars 40.5m) damages to McConnell Dowell for withdrawing from a contract in 1990 to buy New Zealand's tallest building. The decision reverses a high court ruling that Robt Jones Pacific did not need to pay damages. The damages are believed to be the highest in New Zealand history. McConnell Dowell said it also intended to seek up to NZDollars 23m in costs. If awarded, the costs would exceed Tasman's shareholders' funds of NZDollars 83m. Robt Jones Pacific signed a complex agreement in 1988 with McConnell Dowell under which it agreed to purchase the 41-storey building in Auckland. However, when the building was near completion Robt Jones Pacific said it would not buy it, as conditions specified in the contracts had not been met. McConnell Dowell said it was delighted with the latest ruling, saying it totally vindicated its view that Tasman Properties had unlawfully breached the contract.</p>

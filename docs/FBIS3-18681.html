			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "Sto.": "Ruehe: Threat of Violence Came Too </F> Late"]    [Text] Bonn, 3 Mar -- Addressing the Bundestag, Defense  Minister Ruehe, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], said it was  "indeed a mistake" not to have "used the threat and use of  military means as an ultimate political argument earlier" in the  "Yugoslavia" negotiations in Geneva. During a Bundestag  question session on the government's position on NATO military  missions -- the session had been called for by the Party of  Democratic Socialism [PDS] -- Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] deputies Duve and Glotz gave assurances that a SPD-led  government would not have acted differently. The PDS, on the  other hand, said that the participation of German troops in  AWACS flights was a "clear-cut" violation of the constitution.  Ruehe said that the shooting down of "Serbian" combat aircraft  had sent "an unmistakable signal." The war in former Yugoslavia  painfully shows that even after the end of the Cold War, peace  cannot be guaranteed on a lasting basis without the possibility  of employing armed forces when necessary.    The Bundeswehr, assured Ruehe, would continue to make its  contribution to helping people in need. Until now, 874 flights  had delivered 6,950 tonnes of relief supplies to Sarajevo and,  in addition, 325 nighttime missions had dropped 1,800 tonnes of  supplies over eastern Bosnia. Ruehe said he was pleased that  the SPD had approved of the missions and that in the future,  there should no longer be any differences between German  soldiers and their comrades from alliance states.    Foreign Minister Kinkel said it was hard when violence could  only be stopped with violence, but that is reality. If the  alliance had not been so united, then the Serbs would not have  moved their heavy weapons away from Sarajevo. The "German  attitude of restraint has served us well, and we do not want to  give it up," said Kinkel and, at the same time, demanded a rapid  clarification of questions pertaining to German constitutional  law. Like Ruehe, Kinkel said it was inaccurate for the SPD  chairman to say that there were no differences between the  government and the SPD on foreign policy. With their latest  party convention resolutions, Alliance 90/the Greens had  "completely broken with political reality," said Kinkel. And  like Defense Minister Ruehe, Kinkel also stressed Russia's  positive role.    Speaking for the SPD, Deputy Duve said that if it had not  been for the shooting down of the aircraft over Banja Luka, the  Washington agreement would not, perhaps, have been possible.  The Vance-Owen plan has finally been put aside, although that  does not mean that peace has been guaranteed, it has been given  a new chance. SPD Deputy Glotz said that shooting down alone was  not enough, the international community finally needs a  political concept. Deputy Ullmann (Alliance 90/the Greens)  expressed regret that it had taken a year before NATO had  enforced the flight ban.</p>

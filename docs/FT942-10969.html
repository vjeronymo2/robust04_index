			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Markets: BP springs a pleasant surprise - London The big surprise this week came not in the ballot boxes - the Tory showing in Thursday's local elections was expected to be pretty bad, and indeed it was - but in the announcement of British Petroleum's first quarter dividend payment, also on Thursday. A rise of nearly a fifth, the first increase since BP cut its dividend two years ago, came as a most pleasant surprise for a stock market which has become bogged down in fears about the macro-economic picture. The increase underlines the fact that dividends have gone up by more than expected in the latest round of results. Mark Brown, equity strategist at Hoare Govett, reckons that from the results seen so far from 80 large industrial companies dividends have risen in aggregate by 10 per cent, which compares to a forecast in January of 6 per cent. This has persuaded investors to raise their expectations of dividend rises in 1994. According to the monthly Gallup survey of institutional investors views, predictions for 1994 dividend increases from all quoted UK companies, have risen from 4.3 per cent in October last year to 7.4 per cent last month. Growth in dividends ought to support the stock market - after all the fundamental purpose in holding shares is to receive a cash return. Brown puts the corporate generosity down to companies not knowing what to do with their mounting cash. The corporate sector's financial position has improved markedly over the last few years, partly because of rights issues, and now companies are generating more cash than they know what to do with. Companies are not, it seems, investing more, according to the latest CBI survey on investment intentions. So cash is going into higher dividends and takeover bids. More bids appeared this week, with the emphasis again on buying outside the UK. SmithKline Beecham is paying Dollars 2.3bn to buy a US drug wholesaler, while Wassall, the conglomerate, is buying a US cable maker for Dollars 270m, partly financed by a rights issue. However, the Footsie fell for the first half of this week to 3070.5 on Wednesday, a low for the year and nearly 13 per cent off the peak at the start of February. The main worry was the narrow money figure published on Tuesday, which showed MO had risen by 6.2 per cent in the year to April. This is well above the Government's target range of 0 to 4 per cent for the indicator, and above market expectations. The gilt-edged market took the news badly and between Tuesday morning and Wednesday evening the yield on 10-year gilts had risen from just under 8 per cent to 8.4 per cent. Turmoil in the currency markets, with the dollar requiring concerted central bank support did not help. The fear was that US rates could rise again to hold up the dollar and this would mean UK interest rates rising again. Hopes for one last quarter point cut in base rates were fading fast this week, and money markets are now discounting a significant rise in rates by the year end. It is here that there is the biggest discrepancy between market watchers' views. On the bearish side are the likes of Nick Knight, strategist at Nomura International. Having been a superbull until the market turned, Knight is now concerned that base rates could be rising sharply. The stock market was largely ignoring the local government elections, rising on both Thursday - thanks to BP - and Friday - until a weak opening on Wall Street dragged it down to its opening level - although not sufficiently to offset Tuesday and Wednesday's falls. But Knight took the results to mean that the Tory government will now have to hold off a general election until the last possible time, spring 1997. If that is the case, he argues, the government needs to tighten policy now - by marching interest rates up - so that there is scope to loosen again later by marching rates down before the election. Without higher interest rates, and possibly even with them, he says, sterling will come under pressure. And that would push gilts and equities lower. At best, he believes, the Footsie will be little changed over the summer months, and it could go much lower. That being the case, his advice is to sell and put the cash on deposit for a higher return. An opposing view is taken by Michael Hughes, managing director of economics and strategy at BZW. He sees the local elections as largely irrelevant, unless they scare international investors. And he says there was a better tone to the market this week with buyers coming in on weakness in the Footsie. He believes US interest rates will not rise beyond 5 per cent and UK inflation will stay below the 6 per cent threshold at which it has, in the past, got out of hand. With the earnings yield at 7 per cent and gilt yields above 8 per cent - a growth rate actuaries often apply to pension fund liabilities - he is comfortable with the level of the equity market now. His concern is more that the economic recovery is already nearing its peak, with growth in 1995 perhaps no stronger than in 1994. If there is a negative for the market, he asserts, it is that growth might fail, not that interest rates will rise. There was no sign of a faltering of corporate profit recovery in this week's results though. Aside from BP's healthy profit rise, Tate and Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group, increased profits over 20 per cent in its first half year, while BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance giant, lifted first quarter profits by a fifth as well. Even Body Shop International, the toiletries and cosmetics maker and retailer, confounded its critics with an underlying rise of a third in profits for the year. But it will take more than one of Body Shop's potions to restore John Major's fortunes.</p>

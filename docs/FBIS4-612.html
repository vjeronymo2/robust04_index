			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English  on 10 April on page 18 carries a full-page campaign ad for the  Democratic Party, DP. The upper two-thirds of the ad contains a  picture of six DP representatives to the Kempton Park  negotiations, in business attire, standing in a circle, and  looking upward. The picture was taken from directly above them.  The caption of the picture reads: "AT NEGOTIATIONS, THESE 6  DEMOCRATS WON MORE ISSUES THAN 40 NATS. IMAGINE WHAT 12 WILL  DO, OR 24, OR 48..."    The text below the picture reads:    "You're probably surprised. After all, it was the NP  [National Party] who protected you at negotiations, right?  Wrong.    "F.W. de Klerk and his "new" Nats were so busy looking after  their own interests, it was left to the DP to look after yours.    "In fact, while we were greatly outnumbered, we won 5 times  more issues than the Nats, and even more than the ANC. (As  identified in a leading Johannesburg newspaper, 23 November  1993.)    "We stopped the new government from being able to just take  your home away, or being able to declare a State of Emergency  whenever they want to.    "We made it possible to take the new government to court.  And whatever the other parties may say about Women's Rights  policies, it was left to the DP to safely enshrine women's  rights in the new constitution.    "The reasons we had this effect are simple. Our candidates  understand how to negotiate. And, unlike De Klerk's "new" Nats,  we believe in what we stand for. That's why we fight harder.    "So give your vote to the Democratic Party.    "(Remember each 1 percent of the vote will put another 4 DP  members in Parliament).    "By giving us your support, you can have a lot more    "DP members representing you.    "And just imagine what we will do then."    The ad ends with a reproduction of the DP logo, the motto  "DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PROTECTING YOU FROM THE ABUSE OF POWER." and  the enjoinder to "Join the growing number of people moving  across to the DP. Write to Box 1475 Cape Town 8000 for more  information."</p>

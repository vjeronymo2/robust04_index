			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The sixth working-level delegates' contact was held  for the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and  the South. The sixth working delegates' contact for the exchange  of top-level special envoys of the North and the South was held  in the South side area of Panmunjom on 12 March amid great  expectations and interest of the people at home and abroad. The  head of our sides' delegation made the following keynote  statement regarding the contact:    We had the sixth round of contact today with a keen  awareness  of the importance to the nation of the mission of the delegates  of the two sides.    The people at home and abroad are uneasy now about the  prospects for the exchange of special envoys and are expressing  deep worries over the continually slow progress of our working  delegates' contact. Therefore, we think we should give good  news to the people at home and abroad who are observing this  contact by announcing a breakthrough in the present stalemate  [kyochak sangtae] by joint efforts at today's contact, and would  like to clarify our position.    As your side is aware, the issue of exchanging top-level  special envoys of the two sides was initiated by our side, and  we have since made all sincere efforts to realize it.    Our side initiated the proposal for the exchange of special  envoys last year, from the ardent desire to truly improve and  develop North-South relations, paying attention to your side's  [South Korea] remarks -- as have already been reported -- that  your side would place the nation at a foremost position and that  no ally can be better than the nation after the launching of the  civilian regime, expressing hopes for a meeting of top-level  leaders at, for instance, Mt. Paektu or Mt. Halla or any place.    If your side truly possessed the will to resolve all the  important issues raised between the North and the South between  fellow countrymen, hand in hand with the national position, and  maintained the position to hold a meeting of top-level leaders,  your side should have sincerely accepted our new proposal for  the exchange of special envoys.    Your side, however, suddenly changed the attitude you took  in  the initial stage of the launching of the regime and rejected  our proposal for an envoy exchange by insisting on working talks  on a lower level. Moreover, deviating from the national  position, your side attempted to harm the fellow countrymen in  cooperation with outside forces. Your side even went so far as  to say that your side cannot shake hands with the dialogue  partner with nuclear weapons, thus totally rejecting the envoy  exchange.    In fact, our nation consists of fellow countrymen connected  with one blood lineage whether they live in the North or in the  South. The fellow countrymen in these relations are conducting  large-scale nuclear war exercises against the fellow countrymen  and seeking an international alliance [kukje kongjo cheje].  What need and what good will this bring about for our nation?    The North and South are fellow countrymen, not strangers,  even though they have different ideas and systems. Dialogue  between us should be dialogue for national interests, not  dialogue for outside force, even though we have different views.    Therefore, from a sincere attitude of giving priority to  national dignity and interests and resolving all issues based on  the principle of national independence, we sometimes gave advice  to your side and criticized your side's unjust position and  attitude, and at other times showed generosity and concessions  and expected that your side would assume a national position and  become an independent dialogue partner.    Because we expected your side, just like our side tried to,  would sincerely assume a national position and exchange special  envoys for the sake of national interests, we demanded that your  side discontinue all large-scale nuclear war exercises and  abandon an international alliance. Moreover, we recently asked  your side to cancel its plan to introduce Patriot missiles and  its remarks that it cannot shake hands with those who have  nuclear weapons. We did so not to pick a fight but to sincerely  exchange special envoys and improve North-South relations in  compliance with basic national interests. I think our sincere  position has won deep sympathy from public opinion at home and  abroad and sympathy and due support even from many people on  your side.    Because the exchange of top-level special envoys of the  North  and South is an important matter and because the missions of  special envoys are urgent for the sake of national interests,  correctly solving problems, which are stumbling blocks to the  exchange of special envoys, is a pressing task that should be  resolved on a priority basis.    Our just proposal and position has not received a due  response from your side for almost one year. We repeatedly  expressed regret over this to your side, gave exhaustive,  lengthy explanations and advice to your side, and patiently  urged your side to agree on the contact for the exchange of  special envoys.    As a result, your side has today changed its course toward  exchanging special envoys -- changing last year's opposition to  the exchange of special envoys.    Of course, your side's present attitude is still different  from the position our side assumed when it proposed the exchange  of special envoys. Your side has tried, first, to exchange  special envoys to pursue its own interests.    Under circumstances in which your side has accepted our  proposal for the exchange of special envoys and has tried to  exchange special envoys, no matter the reason your side may have  done so, our side would like your side to clarify its position  on a few matters.    Your side must make clear, first, is that it is necessary  for  your side to admit that when we proposed the exchange of special  envoys, you automatically [toponoko] opposed it. We acknowledge  that your side must make this matter clear without fail for the  successful exchange of special envoys.    The second thing your side must make clear is that your  side consistently opposed our side's proposal regarding the  envoy exchange in the past.    Our side had proposed to your side's former authorities when  the first North-South dialogue started 20 years ago that the  North-South summit should be held. Later, we have proposed on  many occasions through official and unofficial channels that the  North-South summit should take place. In particular, our side's  special envoy visited Seoul in early April 1992 and invited your  side's top-level leader to Pyongyang. At that time, heads of  state and government and prominent figures of many countries  came to Pyongyang and congratulated our respected and beloved  leader on the occasion of his 80th birthday and had significant  meetings with him.    Your side, however, even though we are the same fellow  countrymen, did not come to Pyongyang, turning down our special  envoy's proposal and, as a result, the North-South summit failed  to take place. However, we have never mentioned this.    The reason we make this clear today is because we want to  prevent the unpleasant past regarding the envoy exchange of the  North and South from occurring again.    Realizing the exchange of special envoys by the two sides  and  resolving all pending issues, including the issue on  denuclearization, through discussions is the earnest desire of  the nation. Such being the case, under any circumstances, the  two sides should exert joint efforts to realize the envoy  exchange from the view of being the same fellow countrymen. By  so doing, we will prepare a starting point for North-South  relations.    Accordingly, if the two sides continue to debate over  whether  we cannot accept your proposal since it is yours or that you  should accept this because it is ours by holding firm  [choltaehwa] to its own position, as we did in today's contact,  the opportunity for the envoy exchange, which was achieved with  much effort, will never materialize again.    Out of a such stance, we deeply studied and examined your  side's proposals and remarks made during the last working-level  contacts and a private meeting between the heads of both sides.  Putting all accounts together, we reached the conclusion that  your side suggested that the issues of giving up the  international alliance and canceling all large-scale nuclear war  exercises, which were put forth by our side, might be dealt with  and resolved when special envoys are exchanged.    Your side also said that the decision on suspending the 1994  Team Spirit joint military exercise had been made and more  efforts should be concentrated, from the national view point, on  the international alliance. Your side said the plan for the  introduction of Patriot missiles had been shelved. Your side  said it reversed its decision not to shake hands with those who  have nuclear weapons because the situation had changed since the  remark was made last June and because your side's top authority  said later that the North had no nuclear weapons judging from  information available.    This position of your side, on the whole, is short of our  expectations, but we would keep it in mind [kue yuuihagojo  handa], as an expression of understanding the feasibility of the  four demands we raised.    Therefore, I would like to put forth the following  constructive proposal as a momentous step to conclude the  working delegates' contact today and exchange the top-level  special envoys of the North and the South.    First, I propose to take one momentous joint step to give  the  people at home and abroad a hope for the envoy exchange. For  this step, we suggest that the North and the South promulgate at  home and abroad in the form of a joint communique [kongdong  podo] that the two sides reconfirm their intention to exchange  top-level special envoys and have completely agreed to exchange  the special envoys at an early date.    If we issue this joint communique, we will be able to give  great joy to the people at home and abroad, who are worried  about the prospects of the envoy exchange, and it will be a  manifestation that the delegates of our two sides are fulfilling  their responsibility to the nation.    Second, I propose that the two sides seriously discuss and  bring to a conclusion the draft agreement on procedural matters  that they have put forward in today's contact. In this  connection, since our side has put forward a new  counterproposal, fully taking into consideration the draft  agreement that your side put forward during the previous  contact, we think that the two sides can easily arrive at a  settlement if we hold clause-by-clause discussions on it.    We think there is no reason why your side should not accept  our new proposal. As our side has shown broad-mindedness in the  generous position to realize the envoy exchange urgently, it can  be said that the early realization of the envoy exchange is  entirely dependent upon your side's attitude. We express a hope  that the top-level special envoys of the North and the South  will travel between Pyongyang and Seoul at an early date as a  result of your side positively responding to our sincere  position. [end DPRK delegate statement]    After the conclusion of the statement, the two sides began  to  discuss specific problems. Our side repeatedly urged the other  side to take steps to announce to the nation in a joint  communique that the two sides reconfirmed each other's intention  of exchanging special envoys and agreed to realize it at an  early date. The South side, however, refused to accept our  side's proposal to take joint steps with unreasonable excuses  and pretexts. The South side said that they can only issue a  joint communique if the two sides agree on the working  procedural matters as well, and made an absurd assertion that  taking joint steps is meaningless.    Refuting this assertion of the South side, our side  questioned the reason for not issuing a joint communique on the  two sides' agreement on the exchange of special envoys now that  all suspicions have been dissolved -- the suspicion of the South  side that the position of our side, which initially proposed the  envoy exchange, for the envoy exchange is doubtful [pultumyong  hadago]; and the suspicion of our side of the doubtful view of  the South side, which obstructed the envoy exchange by laying  four crossing gates [negaji chadanbongul mandulgo].    When the head of the delegation of our side asked the South  side if it objects to the envoy exchange [tuksa kyohwanul  haryonundenun tarungosi omnungarago murunde taehae], the South  side said no. So our side stated that the intention of  exchanging special envoys is reconfirmed. When our side asked  the South side if it has a different opinion on the exchange of  special envoys at an early date, the South side also said that  it shares the same view of our side. So our side confirmed that  the two sides share the same view on this matter as well, and  asked under these circumstances why the two sides cannot issue a  joint communique to inform the nation. However, the South side  blindly opposed the issuance of a joint communique.    Our side repeatedly questioned if we can brand the South  side's attitude as their lack of intention to exchange special  envoys and as its intention to delay the envoy exchange.  However, the South side could not reply.    Our side stressed again and again that there is no reason  why  the two sides cannot issue the communique now that the two sides  have clearly confirmed the intention to exchange special envoys  and shared the same view that the envoy exchange should be made  at an early date. In addition, our side strongly asserted that  under the circumstances in which a joint communique cannot be  issued, the two sides should report it as each side considers  appropriate.    However, the South side said that it cannot do this, either.    Our side said emphatically that we will report it in our  own way [urinun uridaero podohalkosirago] irrespective of the  South side's intention.    During the contact, the working procedural matters were  discussed for the envoy exchange.    In the discussion of the working procedural matters, out of  the 28 points of 13 articles contained in the draft agreements  put forward by the two sides, they agreed in principle on all  but four articles.    In the discussion of the working procedural matters, the  South side insisted on its unreasonable position and took a  negative attitude toward the principled and important matters  related to the tasks of the special envoys, such as adherence of  the North and the South to the principle of national  independence, confirmation of the way of national reunification,  and the promotion of the great unity of the whole nation.    Our side gave a logical and reasonable refutation to the  South side's unjust assertion, repeatedly stressed the justness  of our side's draft plan of working procedural matters, and  hoped that the South side will take a position to bring about a  turning point by coming to the next contact after making further  study of our side's plan so that the two sides may affix their  final signature to the draft agreements without fail.    Then followed a tete-a-tete contact of the senior delegates  of the two sides.    It was agreed that the seventh working contact would be held  at the Tongilgak in our side's area of Panmunjom on 16 March.</p>

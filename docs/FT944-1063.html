			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Arts: Choral traditions - Martin Hoyle welcomes the Danes and bemoans the financial state of some superb British choirs Consider this paradox. In some repertoire British choirs are second to none. Yet some of our most acclaimed choral groups are scarcely heard in Britain. They simply cannot afford to sing here. The Monteverdi Choir, for example, limits itself to three or four London appearances a year. The Sixteen gives 75 to 80 per cent of its concerts outside the UK. Both are capable of superlative work by international standards, denied to the British public. John Bickley of Magenta Music describes the situation as scandalous. The run-up to Christmas provides an ironic contrast in national attitudes to funding. As part of the Great Choirs of Europe series, the Danish Radio Choir brings London a fascinating programme of modern Scandinavian music. In its present form dating from 1937, the choir is subsidised by Danmarks Radio to the tune of DKr9m (Pounds 100,000), increased by Pounds 250,000 when enlarged for symphonic-scale works. Despite economic turbulence and threatened cuts that sound all too familiar to British music-lovers, the choir should be safe for the next ten to eleven years. Besides Copenhagen's imminent metamorphosis into Europe's City of Culture, the choir already has projects for the year 2005 - unthinkable in British musical planning. The Danish choir's position seems the reverse of, say, the highly praised Sixteen. Like most British choirs, the BBC excepted, The Sixteen has no regular funding. It has to raise money project by project, from foreign promoters or foundations. John Bickley looks enviously at the Danish and Dutch choirs that have been working with The Sixteen in the Great Choirs of Europe series, both state-funded, both providing permanent employment. The Sixteen performs its now established Messiah the day after the Danes display their Nordic treasures. The irony is that the appetite for choral music is thriving. The choral repertoire extends from the currently popular meditative medievalism to the exciting sounds of the Estonian Veljo Tormis in the Danes' programme ('We're very liberal in our view of Scandinavia,' says Ivar Munk, the Danes' manager), or Sven-David Sandstrom's thrilling setting of Blake's Tyger. But then, as John Bickley observes, 'an orchestra covers 150 years of music, a choir like The Sixteen covers a thousand. With a wider repertory and lower overheads, a small amount of money can go much further.' The Danish Radio Choir sings at St John's Smith Square on tonight; The Sixteen gives The Messiah there tomorrow.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Appeal to Beijing"] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong's giant property companies are fond of  calling on the Government to take the heat out of the property  market by releasing more new land for building. Now, having  apparently failed to make much of an impression on the Hong Kong  Government, Cheung Kong chairman Li Ka-shing has revealed he has  also been asking the Chinese Government to give the green light  to increase the land supply.    Beijing is certainly the right address for such a request.  And it is tycoons like Mr Li, whose mainland links have long  given them the ear of the Chinese leadership, who are in the  best position to deliver it.    In the current state of Sino-British political relations,  the  Hong Kong Government would be virtually helpless to push through  any increase, even if it were convinced of the need. The  failure of Governor Chris Patten to offer any concrete solutions  to the property speculation problem led to an overnight sit-in  last night by 11 United Democrat legislators. Although land  releases beyond the strict minimum of 50 hectares a year laid  down by the Joint Declaration are technically possible, they  have to be agreed jointly with the Chinese through the Land  Commission.    It would take someone of Mr Li's stature and influence to  get  the Chinese side to be more cooperative. However, the question  remains whether even Mr Li is able to push China into meeting  their needs. If keeping a stranglehold on land supply is seen in  Beijing as a crucial bargaining chip with Britain, there will be  no increase in the amount of new land for a while yet.    An indication of China's negative thinking is the row over  the release of 62 hectares of land for the construction of the  airport railway. If China persists in demanding the new land be  phased in gradually under the 50-hectare quota, it will  seriously delay the completion of the project and sharply reduce  the amount of new land available for other projects. It surely  will win over many Hong Kong people's hearts if Beijing agrees  to release more lands promptly.    Mr Li and his fellow Hong Kong Affairs advisers have been  claiming that it is a shortage of land, not the hoarding of  completed flats, which has been pushing up prices.  Nevertheless, the Consumer Council estimates that about half of  the flats completed last year have remained vacant. Whom do  these empty flats belong to?</p>

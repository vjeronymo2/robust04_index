			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / More pits offered to private sector BRITISH COAL is today offering to the private sector a further five pits it no longer wants. It said it was receiving 30 inquiries a week for all the mines that have so far been advertised. The additions to the list of pits being offered are Vane Tempest, Seaham and Westoe in the north-east of England, Grimethorpe and the linked Houghton Main in Yorkshire and Trentham in Staffordshire. Potential licensees must register their interest by July 16. British Coal has now advertised 14 of the 20 pits it intends to offer to private operators because it no longer sees a market for them under its control. Mr Eddy Hindmarsh, the corporation's head of operations, said there was no operational reason why some of the mines at present being preserved on a care-and-maintenance basis should not be back in production in the autumn.</p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Share gifts to grandchild I WOULD like to give shares to my grandchild from time to time, so creating a fund for her use on her 18th birthday. I believe she cannot hold shares in her own name until then. If this is the case, can I make simple arrangements to act as her trustee until that time? (I stress the word simple because I shall not be giving her very large sums which would justify expensive legal procedures; I have other grandchildren to provide for later). Would it be possible for my wife to be a joint trustee in case of my death? You are correct in saying that your granddaughter would not be able to own shares in her own right until she is 18. But you and your wife could hold the shares for her in the form of a bare trust. This requires drawing up a simple declaration of trust. The shares are in your name, but your granddaughter is entitled to the dividends. Depending on the level of her income, she may be able to use her personal allowance to obtain a repayment of the tax credit attaching to dividends. An alternative course would be to set up an accumulation and maintenance trust, but you might not wish to go to the bother of this arrangement if the amounts involved are very small.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Spanish Blue Helmets deployed in Bosnia on a  peace mission have reopened the Neretva River route after three  months of hard work. Slovak Blue Helmets deployed in the area  also took part in this mission.    The reopening of the route means that the link between the  Dalmatian coast and the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, has been  reestablished. A floating bridge has been installed on the  Bijela River to replace the one destroyed during the fighting  between Croats and Muslims.    The UK's Michael Rose, commander of the Blue Helmets in the  area, was at the bridge-opening ceremony where a plaque was  unveiled in honor of the Blue Helmets, among whom are the  Spaniards belonging to the Cordoba Group.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD;  </P> <P> CASE STUDY / URBANIZATION;  </P> <P> THE RUSH TO THE CITIES IS STRAINING THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF NATIONS  </P> <P> Ninety years ago, when Mohandas K. Gandhi established Phoenix Settlement on  this fertile knoll, it was a rural commune sheltering a dozen families.  Dedicated "to serve mankind," it grew its own crops, operated a clinic and  published a newspaper preaching nonviolent resistance to discrimination.  </P> <P> The legacy of Gandhi's 21 years of exile in South Africa lives on at the  clinic. But what happened to the rest of Phoenix Settlement reflects the "urban  revolution" now sweeping at least 120 of the world's 170 countries.  </P> <P> Today, more than 10,000 squatters are crammed around the shells of  now-abandoned buildings from Gandhi's era. They have come from rural and tribal  homelands, in search of better jobs, better homes -- better just about  anything.  </P> <P> Instead, they end up in homemade shacks of cardboard and plastic sheeting.  Crates marked "Toyota spare parts" are favored building materials; their  thickness better protects barefoot children from rain and biting winter winds.  </P> <P> Phoenix Settlement squatters are but a tiny fraction of the mass of humanity  rolling into cities around the globe. In 1800, only 3% of the world's  population lived in cities. In 1900, it was 10%. By the beginning of the 21st  Century -- for the first time in history -- at least half the people of the  world will be urbanized.  </P> <P> The impact of that transformation, which is occurring at its most uncontrolled  in Third World countries least able to handle it, is staggering -- on the  people pouring into cities, on the cities themselves and on the nations of a  world grown so interconnected that few will escape the shock waves from one of  the greatest migrations in human experience.  </P> <P> For the Third World, "this situation is going to produce a social disaster,  increasing the level of illiteracy, downgrading public health, converting  cities to slums and creating a social structure with a deep cleavage and a  large percentage of marginalized people," warned Atilio Boron, an Argentine  political economist.  </P> <P> Chief among the consequences of runaway urbanization:  </P> <P> * The economic and political fabric of countries is strained perhaps to the  breaking point as national treasuries are drained without meeting even the  minimal needs of urban migrants. Food production drops in rural areas and  existing institutions collapse under the strain of unsupportable burdens.  </P> <P> * As the public and private sectors fail to cope with millions of new  residents, so-called "informal" institutions mushroom to deal with everything  from jobs and housing to commerce and social services -- de facto  states-within-states, all outside the control of government.  </P> <P> * The rise of impoverished megacities, urban centers besieged by rings of  teeming slums, sets the stage for explosive urban strife as the burgeoning  fringe vies for limited resources.  </P> <P> "Urbanization usually means housing problems, job problems, overcrowding,  disease, social conflict," said Dr. Simon Baynham of Pretoria's Africa  Institute. "As more and more impoverished people come in from the rural areas,  they come into areas that are already limited in terms of the amount of land  available.  </P> <P> "So you've got fighting over land, fighting over housing, over influence in  these areas."  </P> <P> The developed world is not exempt. The populations of Los Angeles, New York,  London and Moscow are all expected to top 10 million by the year 2000, while  Tokyo-Yokohama will exceed 20 million. Advanced nations have far more resources  available for dealing with such growth than poorer nations, however.  </P> <P> Some countries are already facing nightmares -- intensified, ironically, by  political and economic reforms. New freedoms stimulate urban migration even as  they reduce governments' control over patterns of growth.  </P> <P> In Turkey in 1983, for example, the end of military rule and the accompanying  economic reforms triggered a rush to the cities -- and the rise of hundreds of  gecekondus, or built-by-night suburbs. The fastest-growing area in Turkey is  Sultanbeyli, a gecekondu outside Istanbul. In 1985, it was home to 3,741; today  the population is 180,000.  </P> <P> In China, which has the world's largest rural population and limits migration,  new urbanization fervor has broken out since the end of forced programs that  had sent millions of city dwellers into the countryside during the Cultural  Revolution. By the end of this decade, up to 200 million Chinese -- equivalent  to two-thirds of the U.S. population -- are expected to move to cities, 46 of  which already have more than a million inhabitants.  </P> <P> In South Africa, the repeal of apartheid laws limiting black migration from  rural areas is spawning an influx so massive that Johannesburg's Urban  Foundation predicts all of that country's major cities will double in  population in just the next 10 years. With as many as 7 million urban  squatters, South African cities would have to construct 800 homes a day for the  next 10 years just to resolve the housing crisis.  </P> <P> "This is the century of the great urban explosion," concluded a recent United  Nations report. And, it said, "governments are discovering the impossibility of  reversing urbanization -- or even of slowing it down."  </P> <P> They are also discovering that when existing institutions -- public or private  -- fail to meet the needs of urban migrants, the newcomers begin to develop  their own, often-imperfect answers. The result: mushrooming growth of informal,  ad hoc institutions that spring up to deal with human needs when governments  don't.  </P> <P> Greater Lima, now teeming with 7 million of Peru's 22 million people, is among  the worst cases. Some 800 illegal slumlets ring the capital, including San Juan  de Miraflores, a labyrinth of mud-brick and reed-thatch hovels, bleached  colorless by the sun, in which the entire extent of government services is a  single telephone.  </P> <P> Destitute and all but officially abandoned by a debt-ridden government, Peru's  squatters have started mobilizing themselves.  </P> <P> Lima, always alive with street vendors, is now a giant open-air market. On  decrepit main roads, hawkers walk among speeding cars or near stoplights  pushing hardware, magazines, fly swatters, cake covers, car fluid or any other  new product or import. At Plaza dos Armes, the site of Lima's ornate 17th  Century city hall, hundreds of street merchants offer fruit, underwear, toys  and watches, each "business" neatly laid out on the sidewalk. Near one vendor,  a child taps out tunes on empty Coke bottles.  </P> <P> Once called the subsistence sector, such informal institutions are becoming  among the most dynamic -- and volatile -- elements in Peruvian society.  Analysts estimate that "informals" now account for 80% of all markets and bus  transport in Lima and at least 40% of the capital's overall economic activity  -- patterns mirrored throughout the developing world.  </P> <P> "Many planners see the informal sector as probably the greatest source of new  urban jobs in the next few decades and as an important safety valve to fill the  gap created by inadequate city services," the World Resources Institute  reported this year.  </P> <P> Informals are creating vast networks of wholesalers, suppliers, service  industries and even quasi-governments, everything from bus lines and small  cooperatives to police forces dispensing informal justice.  </P> <P> "Because of the magnitude of economic problems, the informal sector is going to  increase in importance and significance," said Yunus Carrim, a South African  sociologist.  </P> <P> In Mozambique, informal businesses in homes and garages make shoes, clothes,  even car parts. "Our markets are now 50% informals. They began to develop in  1983-84. They were doing a significant part of the nation's business by 1986,"  said Firminio Mucavele, a Maputo economist.  </P> <P> In South Africa, the roads between Johannesburg and its black suburbs bustle  with some 4,000 Toyota or Nissan mini-buses, all operated by informals.  Informals even extend into the arms industry: there is the qwasha handgun,  named for the sound it makes, as well as a rifle that takes standard-issue  military ammunition.  </P> <P> Informals account for at least 20% of South Africa's GNP, according to  Johannesburg's Small Business Development Corp.  </P> <P> But the hope of self-generated communities is matched by potentially  self-destructive problems -- for the informals themselves and for the states.  As Carrim warned: "It's going to become a much more strident feature of  urbanization. It's going to be very difficult to have a controlled, orderly  pattern" of development.  </P> <P> One problem is declining food production. "All the expected growth in Latin  America is going to be in urban settings. That means a decreasing percentage  for feeding growing urban populations," said Eric Rodenburg of the World  Resources Institute.  </P> <P> Another problem is that "none of the cities in the developing world can afford  the infrastructure of mega-cities," the U.N. report said. Lima is expected to  double in 14 years -- theoretically requiring a doubling of services. That is  an impossible task for a city government unable to meet even the current  demands for schools and jobs.  </P> <P> A third danger is political breakdown. "The fact that (informals are) growing  usually is a commentary on the failure of the political system," said Jonathan  Moyo, a Zimbabwe political scientist. "You can't tax them. You can't ensure  standards in health." Nor does construction conform to building codes,  schooling to basic curricula, or businesses to safety, sanitation or  environmental standards. And homemade guns are not registered.  </P> <P> "Although the process will play differently in different cities on different  continents," said Francisco Sagasti, a World Bank forecaster, "it's clear that  the future of cities around the world will be determined more by the  overwhelming numbers coming in at the bottom than by the people who now run  them at the top."  </P> <P> Finally, left on the fringe, the informals' alienation and isolation could turn  to instability and conflict. Squatter camps and informal suburbs worldwide are  riddled with drugs, crime and prostitution. San Juan de Miraflores and other  Lima slums, for instance, offer ripe recruits for Peru's Shining Path  insurgents.  </P> <P> Violence caused in part by the urban crunch is already part of daily life in  informal slums from Argentina to Zimbabwe -- including Gandhi's beloved Phoenix  Settlement.  </P> <P> In many countries, the result may be that cities, traditionally centers of  human and societal progress, will stagnate and decline under the rising burden  of poverty.  </P> <P> "Dating back to Greek times, cities have been seen as places where people  become 'urbane' and have access to the benefits of progress," Sagasti said.  </P> <P> "But at the close of the 20th Century, the historic role of cities is now being  compromised. They still offer the main means for upward mobility and  modernization. . . . The problem is that cities are becoming massive ghettos of  people confined in small spaces with little interaction with the rest of the  city except through violence or illegal activities. The danger is that these  ghettos will be institutionalized."  </P></p>

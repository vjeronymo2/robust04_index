			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STATE SUES MOBIL OVER HEFTY BAGS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: JOHN VAN DE KAMP, ALONG WITH OTHER STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL, FILES  SUIT TO STOP MAKERS OF THE TRASH BAGS FROM CLAIMING PRODUCT IS DEGRADABLE.  </P> <P> State Attorney General John Van de Kamp filed a consumer protection lawsuit  Tuesday against the maker of Hefty brand plastic trash bags, alleging that  Mobil Chemical Co. used false advertising to sell its so-called degradable  bags.  </P> <P> The action, filed in San Diego Superior Court, alleges that Mobil has misled  the public with untrue claims that its plastic bags are good for the  environment and that the plastic breaks down when exposed to the elements. In  fact, the suit claims, the bags will not degrade when used in the usual manner.  </P> <P> "Such advertising seizes upon the public's desire to do what is best for the  environment and then preys on that desire to sell products," Van de Kamp said  in a statement. "We cannot let such advertising fool customers . . ."  </P> <P> The suit asks for an injunction to halt the use of the allegedly misleading  claims and for civil penalties of at least $500,000. Van de Kamp was joined in  his action by the attorneys general of six other states -- Massachusetts,  Minnesota, New York, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin -- who filed similar suits  against Mobil on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Allen H. Gray, a spokesman for the Virginia-based company, denied that the  labeling is misleading. But he said that because many consumers are confused,  the company already has agreed to remove claims of degradability from its  packaging until common guidelines can be established.  </P> <P> "Right now it's a morass out there," Gray said, adding that Mobil has  volunteered to lead a joint industry-government effort to standardize  specifications for degradable products. "But you don't achieve anything with  litigation. We've got a strong case. We'll fight if we have to. But the other  alternative is much more productive."  </P> <P> Doug Blanke, Minnesota's assistant attorney general for consumer protection,  agreed that the definitions of terms such as degradable, recyclable or  environmentally safe are too vague. But, like California, Minnesota accuses the  makers of Hefty bags of not merely confusing but intentionally deceiving  customers.  </P> <P> "There is abundant evidence that Mobil Chemical Co. was fully aware of what the  facts are, but they deliberately and cynically chose to manipulate public  perceptions and to ignore the scientific facts for the purpose of making a  profit," Blanke said. "The only conclusion you can draw is that the marketing  department got the better of the laboratories."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's suit concurs. It claims that Mobil fails to tell the public that  its theories about degradability are unproven and that, even if the claims were  true, consumers would have to expose their trash bags to the sun, wind and rain  for weeks or months for the breakdown to begin. If used in the customary way --  simply shipped to local landfills -- the bags are not exposed long enough to  the elements to trigger the degrading process, the suit claims.  </P> <P> In addition, the suit notes, Mobil states on the front of some products that  they are "for recycling." The suit claims that Mobil explains on the back of  the package that the term means consumers can see through the bags to better  keep track of the trash inside, some of which might be recyclable.  </P> <P> "It's a traditional kind of false-advertising case involving representations  made to sell a product that we claim are either deceptive or, if true,  irrelevant to the products that are being sold," said Al Shelden, California's  deputy attorney general for consumer law. The suit was filed in San Diego  County for convenience, not because the company has any ties to the area, he  said.  </P> <P> The lawsuits stem from an informal task force formed in November by the  National Assn. of Attorneys General in Washington. In December, the task force  approached several companies to inquire about the meaning of and the basis for  several pro-Earth advertising claims.  </P> <P> "We wanted to put a spotlight on this issue, to test whether it was as serious  a problem as we thought it was," said Blanke, who helped organize a public  hearing on the issue in mid-March. At that hearing, attended by attorneys  general from eight states, he said, "there was a broad consensus that there was  a problem.  </P></p>

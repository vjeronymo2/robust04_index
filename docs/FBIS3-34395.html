Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that  MK's  Salmovitz, Goldfarb, and Segev are now seeking to reconvene  Tzomet's Central Committee within two weeks in order to discuss  their demand that their allegations of financial mismanagement  in the movement be investigated. The MK's said that if their  suspicions prove true, they will demand that Tzomet Director  General Doron Shmu'eli take a leave of absence until the  investigation into the matter is concluded.    MK Ester Salmovitz, who is deputy speaker of the Knesset,  explained that she and her two colleagues would retain their  posts until the Central Committee convened. Our correspondent  reports that Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan announced that he  would reply to the three MK's request in several hours.</p>

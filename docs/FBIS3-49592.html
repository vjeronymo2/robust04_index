Also attending were  representatives of international organizations. President  Berisha greeted the participants in the reception and Romanian  Ambassador George Miku, dean of the diplomatic corps, greeted on  behalf of foreign diplomats.    Firstly, I would like to wish you and your families, your  governments, peoples and countries wholeheartedly a Happy New  Year, President Berisha said at the beginning of his greeting  and added:    The year that elapsed some days ago was for us, Albanians, a  year of efforts, sacrifices and challenges as well as a year  which greatly consolidated Albania's turn on the road of  democracy, which marked an important development and progress of  the reform in the political, legislative, economic and  institutional fields. In 1993, the human rights and freedoms  were further expanded in legislation and in life, the rule of  law is functioning increasingly better.    The economic reform in its major components, that is in the  financial aspect, the privatization of the economy, the growth  of production and attraction of foreign investment, has marked  considerable progress, which, I hope, will make Albania in the  future a country of fully successful reforms.    1993 was also the year of our great efforts to overcome the  serious consequences of isolation, to construct a foreign policy  based on the principle of reciprocity and in accordance with our  national interests, which aim is to realize Albania's  integration into Europe and the international community, to  establish cooperation and friendly relations with all those who  want and respect those values which are so sacred now for all  the peoples. I believe that to this end have also served the  visits to Albania by heads of states, prime-ministers and high  ranking government members from countries of the region, Europe  and the world.    Likewise, the treaties of friendship, agreements of  economic,  military, cultural cooperation with many countries have led to a  closer and greater cooperation of our country with your  countries, with international institutions and organizations,  with the European Union, NATO, and other organizations.    Naturally, our most serious difficulties during the past  year  were poverty and unemployment. But alongside these, the  contradictions that have arisen from the conflict in Bosnia made  that old quarrels and grudges reappear on our horizon as well.  But, it is important to note that we proved to be determined to  solve disagreements through tolerance, dialogue and  negotiations, avoiding their aggravation to open conflicts. We  also proved our resolution to follow a policy of good  neighborliness and friendship with all those neighbouring and  non-neighbouring countries that are for such a friendship and  abide by the same principles as we do.    Honourable ambassadors and representatives of international  institutions and organizations,    I would also like to stress that of extremely importance for  our achievements have been the aid of the countries and  institutions you represent and your personal commitment to  realize this aid and cooperation. Therefore I would like to  express our profound and eternal gratitude to the governments,  institutions and citizens of the countries you represent for the  generous aid they have given and are giving to Albania.    Ladies and gentlemen,    This year Albania is facing serious challenges and  difficulties. We are optimistic because the all-sided progress  of the reform during 1993 has restored in the people a great  faith in it. It has created conditions for us to solve the  problems for 1994 with success. The reform in our country has  established closer relations of Albania with the other friendly  countries and nations. Cooperation with these countries has been  and will be of primary importance for Albania's integration into  Europe.    Our main objectives for 1994 are related with the  privatization of large and medium-scale enterprises, creation of  the market of vouchers, encouragement of foreign investment,  reduction of unemployment, improvement of infrastructure,  greater integration of Albania into Europe and international  institutions, prevention of the conflict in the region and a  correct solution of the question of the Albanians in Kosova and  in all former Yugoslavia. All the above are our objectives  which call for great efforts and support.    Ladies and gentlemen,    Our road and also others' toward progress and stability has  become difficult due to Bosnia syndrome. This is the most  ominous syndrome that has affected our continent since 1945. On  a local plane it was characterized by an devastating war and  aggression and an unprecedented genocide. But it is not a local  syndrome, that is of a single country or region.    This syndrome is also international and precisely on the  international plane it may probably have the most catastrophic  consequences. In this respect, I would say that Bosnia syndrome  is a result of the lack of responsibility and loyalty and  courage of international community to the fundamental principles  and laws which guarantee order, peace and stability in the  world. Consequently, it may be also considered as a syndrome of  complete or partial paralysis of those principles which  immediately lead to the blocking of international institutions  (suffice it to mention that out of several resolutions and  decisions of the Security Council, NATO, and the European Union,  the embargo is the only one, which has been implemented, though  not completely). The consequences of this paralysis in a  long-term future may be extremely disastrous. They may  encourage and permit the revival of rivalries and ambitions,  claims of the past, which may gradually replace the spirit of  cooperation with that of confrontation, and which may lead to  several consequent conflicts with unprecedented results for us  and the generations to come. Therefore, let's wish that the  year 1994 and the NATO summit scheduled for today be a success  in returning loyalty to the international principles on which is  based our peace and security, in condemning aggression and  raising efficiency of international institutions and creating a  new climate of fostering a close cooperation among Eastern and  Western countries.    In this regard I would like to confirm that we have  supported  and continue to support the initiative of "Partnership for  Peace," but considering it not as a stage of fixed  classification, but as an active preparatory process for Albania  and other Eastern countries to become NATO members. In this  respect I would like to stress that because of Albania's strong  historic relations with the West and accidental relations with  Russian factor, its withdrawal from the Warsaw Treaty in the  60s, its strategic geographic position, the intensive  cooperation it has already developed with NATO, and because of  the fact that Albania was the first country to present its  official request to become a NATO member, undoubtedly this  request for membership to the alliance deserves to be considered  first.    Wishing once again a good year I want to assure you that  Albania is and will continue to be ready to develop the spirit  of understanding, the honest and friendly cooperation with your  countries and all those countries and institutions that will be  interested in this.    In his greeting on the occasion, the Romanian ambassador in  Albania, Mr. George Miku, said that diplomatic representatives  accredited to Tirana note with pleasure that during 1993  cooperation and relations between the countries and the  international organizations which they represent and Albania  have marked new positive developments and a significant progress  of mutual interest.    Mr. Miku said that during this year Albania will make new  steps regarding the solution of economic problems on the road of  its integration into the international community. Proceeding  from the fact that the Albanian nation is equally an old and new  nation, Mr. Miku expressed his belief that these objectives will  be realised as soon as possible.</p>

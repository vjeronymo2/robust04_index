			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> European Takeover Plans: The European Community Commission said it plans to  propose new measures early next year to make corporate takeovers in the  12-nation trade bloc easier. The commission said in a statement that takeover  bids faced formidable legal obstacles in many member countries, but such  roadblocks could be overcome by new measures and the application of current EC  legislation. The commission said it wants, among other things, to strengthen  the voting rights of shareholders and force bidders to outline their plans to  target companies and their employees.  </P></p>

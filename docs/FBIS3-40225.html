On 28 December  1993, the BFEL facility successfully realized saturated  oscillation, becoming the world's first infrared FEL  facility--among the 10-odd such installations built in the  United States, West Europe, and elsewhere--to reach this goal  and thus propelling China into the world's front ranks in this  high-tech field. The BFEL facility first achieved infrared FEL  oscillation on 26 May last year, making China the fourth  nation--after the United States, the Netherlands, and France--to  use a radio-frequency linear accelerator for generating infrared  FEL light. Following that achievement, BFEL facility scientists  succeeded in raising the electron beam density and improving the  uniformity of the quality factor; this in turn permitted them to  raise system gain from the original 6 percent to 17 percent,  where saturated oscillation took place. Also, compared to last  May's achievement, stimulated oscillation signal strength is now  5 orders of magnitude higher [i.e., 100,000 times as high] and  spontaneous radiation strength is 8 orders of magnitude higher.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to any conflict among the requirements or the accessibility standards of section 504, the Fair Housing Act and the ADA, and their respective regulations, HUD notes that an individual or entity that is subject to the provisions (including regulatory provisions) of more than one of these statutes must comply with the provisions that provide for the greater substantive rights or the more stringent accessibility standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of ``Accessible'' (&sect;9.103)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Definition Requires Clarification. Two commenters stated that the definition of ``accessible'' in the part 9 proposed rule lacks the specific guidance provided by the definition for this term in &sect;100.201 of HUD's Fair Housing Act regulations (24 CFR 100.201). One of the commenters stated that the part 9 definition of ``accessible'' with respect to individual dwelling units requires that a unit be designed to meet the specific needs of a qualified individual's particular disability or impairment. The commenter requested that HUD clarify that for a unit to be counted toward a program's five percent requirement for accessible units, all the accessibility requirements for dwelling units, as provided in 24 CFR part 40, must be met and not just those which might be adequate to meet the needs of the individual's specific disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, section 504 and the Fair Housing Act have different purposes. The Fair Housing Act's design and construction accessibility standards apply only to certain new multifamily housing. Section 504 is concerned with overall ``program'' accessibility, which includes accessibility standards for multifamily housing and other types of facilities, including Federal Government buildings. Additionally, the Fair Housing Act, unlike section 504, does not impose accessibility standards on alterations to existing housing and facilities. Accordingly, the definition of ``accessible'' in HUD's Fair Housing Act regulations is not sufficiently broad for section 504 purposes. However, as noted in Section II of this preamble, which discusses changes made to the proposed rule, the Department did make some modification to the definitions of ``accessible'' for purposes of clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the question of whether an individual dwelling unit, that is altered to be accessible to a qualified individual with a specific disability, counts toward the program's five percent requirement, the Department notes that this issue is addressed by &sect;9.152 of the rule. Section 9.152 provides that if HUD undertakes alterations to a PDP multifamily housing project, that is subject to the accessibility requirements of &sect;9.152, a minimum of five percent of the total dwelling units, or at least one unit, whichever is greater, must be made accessible for persons with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> mobility <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  impairments. (Emphasis added.) Section 9.152 also provides that if the unit is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with &sect;9.152(d) (which requires compliance with the definitions, requirements and standards of the UFAS, except where the ADAAG provides for greater accessibility) the unit is accessible for purposes of &sect;9.152. Section 9.152 further provides that an additional two percent of the units (but not less than one unit) in the project must be made accessible for persons with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> hearing or vision impairments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Emphasis added.) Thus, whether an individual dwelling unit, which is altered for a specific qualified individual with disabilities, counts toward the program's five percent or two percent requirement depends upon the nature of the alterations undertaken to address the individual's disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of ``Accessible Route'' (&sect;9.103)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Definition Lacks Specific Guidance. Two commenters stated that the definition of ``accessible route'' as set forth in HUD's Fair Housing regulations provides more guidance than the definition in the part 9 proposed rule, and urged the Department to adopt the definition in the Fair Housing Act regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the previous response, the differences between the mandate and scope of the Fair Housing Act and the mandate and scope of section 504 render the definition of ``accessible route'' in HUD's Fair Housing Act regulations inappropriate for section 504 purposes. However, as noted in section II of this preamble, the Department has revised the definition of ``accessible route'' to require compliance with the ADAAG. The Department believes that the ADAAG definition of ``accessible route'' provides more guidance than the definition of ``accessible route'' in the part 9 proposed rule, and should address the commenters' concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Definition Should Reference Architectural Barriers Act. One commenter stated that the definitions of ``accessible,'' ``accessible route,'' and ``adaptability'' should reference the Barriers Act, which imposes access requirements on all HUD-owned, leased, and managed properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in section II of this preamble, the definitions of ``accessible route'' and ``adaptability'' were revised in this final rule to adopt the standards of the ADAAG or UFAS, as applicable. Also, &sect;&sect;9.151 and 9.152 of the proposed rule, and of this final rule, which establish the requirements for new construction and alterations to existing facilities, provide that the definitions, requirements, and standards of the UFAS apply to facilities covered by this rule, except where the ADAAG may provide for greater accessibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Definition Should Provide Accessibility For Persons Who Are Hearing and Sight Impaired. One commenter stated that the definition of ``accessible route'' in the part 9 rule provides that ``an accessible route that serves only accessible units occupied by persons with hearing or vision impairments would not be required to comply with those requirements intended to effect accessibility for persons with mobility impairments.'' The commenter requested that HUD revise this definition to include persons who are visually impaired, blind, or deaf and blind. The commenter stated that moving about safely in one's environment can be a major obstacle to independent living for individuals with these disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

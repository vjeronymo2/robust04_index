			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Serb leaders call for referendum on UN plan SERB leaders from the republic of Croatia yesterday called for a referendum on a United Nations plan to deploy 10,000 peacekeepers in a move which coincides with a report by a prominent international human rights organisation alleging Croat atrocities against Serbian civilians. Mr Zdenko Tosic, a spokesman of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Krajina, southern Croatia, said that within one month the people of Krajina, southern Croatia, would vote on the UN peace initiative. Mr Milan Babic, Krajina's president, opposes the UN plan on the grounds that the plan will not bring a 'lasting peace' to Krajina. He also objects to plans by the UN to disband Krajina's Serb irregulars, as well as the withdrawal of the federal army from Krajina when UN peacekeepers have been deployed. Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, is trying to persuade local politicians in Krajina to support the plan with promises of food and aid. Meanwhile, Ms Jeri Laber, the director of Helsinki Watch, the New York-based human rights organisation, earlier this week told a human rights commission of the US Congress that 'Croatian forces have abducted Serbian civilians, many of whom remain missing or have been found bestially murdered.' The report alleges that last October uniformed Croats abducted between 130 and 150 Serbs.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Portillo attacks EU interference: Minister tells Tories - 'Sometimes you have to tell Brussels when to stop' Mr Michael Portillo established himself yesterday as the unchallenged leader of the Tory right as cabinet divisions over Europe were exposed again at the party's Bournemouth conference. In a confident and carefully calculated performance which won thunderous applause, the employment secretary launched a fierce attack on interference from Brussels and a passionate defence of British institutions and sovereignty. Anticipating an intense debate within the government ahead of the 1996 intergovernmental conference, Mr Portillo said bluntly: 'Sometimes you have to tell Brussels when to stop.' His first conference speech as a cabinet minister came as Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, prepared to tell representatives today that the economic upturn would bring a strong revival in the government's political fortunes before the next general election. But Mr Clarke was expected to combine a firm promise of eventual tax cuts with a warning that the government would have first to make further cuts in public spending programmes and bring down sharply the level of public borrowing. Senior ministers are bracing themselves also for a grassroots backlash today over the government's perceived failure to bring down crime rates and over its refusal to contemplate full constitutional integration of Northern Ireland into the UK. The fresh discord over Europe coincided with a by-election threat after the death of Mr John Blackburn, Conservative MP for Dudley West. Senior ministers were pessimistic about the chances of holding a seat at which the party had a majority of only 5,798 at the last general election. A by-election defeat would reduce Mr John Major's Westminster majority to just 13 seats. Mr Portillo insisted his comments on Europe were in line with government policy and was at pains to repudiate the view of Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, that Britain might have to consider withdrawal from the European Union. He added that the cabinet was 'absolutely united' on the need to reduce interference from Brussels in the everyday lives of British citizens. But the Eurosceptic tone of the speech - Mr Portillo said the government would 'stop the rot' from Brussels - provoked a counterblast from Mr Michael Heseltine, the pro-European trade and industry secretary. Echoing a warning from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, earlier in the week that Britain could not turn its back on Europe, Mr Heseltine said a central role was vital for Britain's economic self-interest. He added: 'Our choice is to influence what is happening - or let others set the rules. That is why the prime minister is right to talk of a Britain at the heart of Europe.' But on a day when rightwing ministers appeared determined to set the agenda, Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, and Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, joined Mr Portillo in strongly repudiating any further European integration. In a clear indication of the growing irritation in Brussels at attacks on the EU by Tory right-wingers, Sir Leon Brittan, European trade commissioner, warned the UK could be damaged by sniping from the sidelines. Sir Leon said in Brussels that an 'open and sensible Europe' was impossible 'if we pander to lesser emotions and imply that our partners are not our friends.' Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, ruled out a looser relationship with the EU.

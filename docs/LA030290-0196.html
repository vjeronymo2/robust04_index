			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ALLEGATIONS ADD PRESSURE ON VALVANO;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: EDITORIALS CALL FOR N.C. STATE COACH TO QUIT. MEANWHILE, THE STATE  STARTS A FORMAL INQUIRY INTO REPORTS OF POINT-SHAVING.  </P> <P> Calls for Coach Jim Valvano's resignation intensified today as North Carolina  State basketball players and their possible ties to point-shaving allegations  became subjects of a formal state inquiry.  </P> <P> The State Bureau of Investigation acknowledged that its preliminary look into  rumors of gambling and point-shaving has turned into a full investigation,  initiated at the request of Wake County Dist. Atty. Colon Willoughby.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, ABC News reported that "inside sources" had said that as many as  four Wolfpack players, including Charles Shackleford, now of the New Jersey  Nets, conspired to hold down the scores of four games for betting purposes  during the 1987-88 season. Shackleford's lawyer and agent, Sal DiFazio of  Bridgewater, N.J., has said his client never shaved points.  </P> <P> ABC said that one of the games was against Wake Forest on March 6, 1988. State  defeated Wake Forest by four points after being favored by 16.  </P> <P> Shackleford has admitted accepting $65,000 from two men during the 1986-87 and  '87-88 seasons at N.C. State. One of the men, Robert Kramer of Denville, N.J.,  acknowledged giving Shackleford money, but said it was a loan that was repaid.  </P> <P> Though Valvano is not mentioned in the allegations and has denied knowledge of  point-shaving, two state newspapers and the student paper called for his  ouster.  </P> <P> "For the sake of a great sport and a great institution, Jim Valvano has to go.  Now," The Charlotte Observer said today.  </P> <P> "For Coach Jim Valvano, it's only a matter of time. The game is over," said the  Winston-Salem Journal.  </P> <P> Some faculty members also circulated a petition urging his dismissal.  </P> <P> N.C. State already is on two years' probation for violations that included the  sale of complimentary tickets and sneakers. Those infractions already cost  Valvano his job as athletic director.  </P> <P> Valvano was expected to return to the Raleigh campus from New York by late  afternoon today for a team practice. His agent, Art Kaminksy, was unavailable  for comment but an associate, Pat Gibbons, said the coach "obviously is  disturbed and shocked by what he's hearing. Other than that, he's not  commenting. It's all pretty disturbing on the heels of all that's happened in  the last 12 months. He's a tough guy. He'll handle it."  </P> <P> But some people in North Carolina think something should be done before the  investigation ends.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is, there are just too many unfortunate things that have  happened during his tenure," William Johnson, a member emeritus of the  university system's Board of Governors, told The Observer. "I think in order to  wipe away the stain, there's got to be a general cleaning out."  </P> <P> Acting Chancellor Larry K. Monteith said he would not suggest any action be  taken against Valvano until a review of the basketball program -- started about  a year ago -- is completed.  </P></p>

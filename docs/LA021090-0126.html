			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ABC WILL HONOR CFA AGREEMENT  </P> <P> ABC Sports announced Friday that it will honor its agreement with the College  Football Assn., beginning in 1991, minus Notre Dame.  </P> <P> ABC declined to discuss what it will pay, but a source said the price for the  five-year package was trimmed from $210 million to $175 million, or $7 million  a year.  </P> <P> The price was reduced because Notre Dame pulled out of the CFA television  package to make a deal of its own with NBC for its home games.  </P> <P> ABC said: "The CFA has confirmed the participation of its entire membership in  the ABC package, with the exception of Notre Dame, whose away games ABC has the  option to carry. ABC will have the right to select home games of 63 member  institutions."  </P> <P> ESPN also reached an agreement with the CFA by picking up an extra year for  only $15 million. ESPN had been close to a one-year extension for $30 million  before Notre Dame bolted.  </P> <P> ESPN originally had a four-year, $110-million agreement with the CFA. Now the  cable network has five years for $125 million. LARRY STEWART  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Panama City Television Networks in  Spanish at 0100 GMT on 26 April broadcast a live debate by four  Panamanian presidential candidates -- Ernesto Perez Balladares  of the Revolutionary Democratic party (PRD); Ruben Blades of the  Papa Egoro Movement; Ruben Dario Carles of the Change '94  coalition; and Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian Democratic  Party (PDC) -- from the TVN television studios in Panama City.  The debate, which is moderated by Rodrigo Eisenmann, president  of the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies (ILDEA),  includes panelists Rosa Maria Britton, Octavio del Moral, and  Roberto Reichard, who pose questions to the four candidates.  The debate is sponsored by ILDEA and the Media Presidential  Debate Committee.    The debate gets under way with Britton asking Perez  Balladares if the development of science and technology is  necessary for the nation's modernization, indicating that Panama  and Haiti are the only Latin American nations that do not have a  state council devoted to science and technology. Britton asks:  "What policy would your government adopt for the development of  science and technology in our country?"    Perez Balladares replies: "We have proposed increased  integration between the private sector and the national  education system."    Britton then asks whether Perez Balladares has taken into  consideration the creation of a technology ministry, such as in  Costa Rica. To this Perez Balladares replies that this would be  a bit overly ambitious, and, instead, he would opt for a science  and technological institute closely linked to the private  sector, because a ministry would tend to get bogged down in  bureaucracy.    Commenting on this same topic, Vallarino says he does not  agree with the formation of a science and technology institute;  rather scientific and technological development should be  centered within the universities.    Carles comments that there are already too many  institutions,  and therefore this issue must be analyzed and reviewed.    Blades says, "Until the nation defines where it is headed,  it  will not be possible to integrate any technological knowledge."  He adds: "The nation must first define its course, its  development, and those areas that will require technicians."    Next, Reichard poses a question to Vallarino. Taking into  account Panama's limitations, Reichard asks what areas should be  stressed to improve the nation's living conditions in the next  five years. Vallarino replies, "Considerable improvement can  only be achieved by raising Panamanians' income, and, in order  to do this, job opportunities must be increased." He continues  by pointing out that official statistics indicate that  Panamanians' real income has not risen within the past 20 years.    Commenting on the same subject, Carles says that if the  resources used for education, health, transportation, electrical  power, water, communications, public security, and social  security were managed more efficiently, they would improve the  standard of living.    Blades, meanwhile, says: "We must create an opportunity for  investments to come and remain in Panama, and these investments  should not be concentrated in the Province of Panama."    Vallarino also comments on this issue: "Social services are  very important for Panamanians with low income." To raise the  standard of living, we must provide much better public services.    Perez Balladares makes a final comment on this issue: "I  share the view that in order to enjoy a good standard of living,  one must have a good job." Therefore, he adds, we have taken  into account means of generating more jobs. He also says income  must be redistributed through state-run investments. However,  he notes, none of this is can happen if the nation fails to  raise its cultural level.    Octavio del Moral asks Carles to outline specific solutions  in his program to ease the dreadful conditions of the prison  system. Carles responds that the citizens who have been  sentenced to jail must pay for their crimes; however, the state  should provide the means for inmates to serve their sentences in  a decent manner. Historically, Carles says, the Panamanian state  has been negligent in creating institutions that serve as  rehabilitation and education centers.    In further commenting on the poor state of the country's  prisons, Carles says the state has failed to provide adequate  conditions and training for inmates, despite having built a new  prison. He says his administration intends to review the prison  system and to relocate prison installations to more adequate  places, as well as to try to improve the conditions under which  the inmates are currently living.    In responding on the same issue, Blades says that in 1973 he  visited the Coiba penal colony and was able to ascertain  conditions on the island. According to Blades, one of the  things that has never existed in Panama is the inclination to  confront the problem once and for all. He also notes there has  never been any interest in clarifying whether the system is  designed to punish or to rehabilitate. Blades adds, "Not only  has the situation not changed, but it has deteriorated."  According to Blades, the problem not only lies in the prisons,  but also in a judicial system that has proved to be ineffective.    Perez Balladares says there are three problems with the  prison system which must be attacked: 1) insufficient  facilities, 2) preventing crimes through programs aimed at  educating, and 3) training programs aimed at rehabilitating  criminals for the day they will reenter society. He adds that  prisons currently serve "more to train inmates for further  criminal activities than as deterrent." According to Perez  Balladares, one solution to this could be the creation of  halfway houses to train inmates on how to reenter society.    Vallarino says he believes conditions in Panama's prisons  are  beyond words, adding that there have been instances when  society's attitude against inmates are sometimes more heinous  that those of the inmates against society.    In response to a question on efforts to encourage education  in Panama, Blades says one of the first things that must be done  is to increase funds earmarked for education -- funds which  today are "outrageously inadequate."    Perez Balladares, meanwhile, says that if the nation invests  in cultural issues, it will be able to garner more productivity  from its human investment.    According to Vallarino, if the nation expects to promote  education, it must focus on the problem from within the family,  because this is where any individual's first experiences  originate.    One of the main problems that currently prevents promoting  education, according to Carles, lies in the numerous state  institutions that interfere with one another. There is no  coordination between these institutions, which, in turn, has  merely created an unwanted bureaucracy.    Panelist Roberto Reichard asks how each candidate would  confront the problem of limited resources and how to distribute  these resources equitably among an ever-increasing population.    Perez Balladares says his administration plans to create an  urban planning agency to provide basic services to each  community in an ordered manner to prevent the demographic chaos  that could take place at the end of the century. With respect  to disorderly population growth, Perez Balladares says he does  not advocate population control campaigns, but instead he  supports programs by institutions such as the Family Planning  Association.    In discussing the population issue, the other three  candidates agree that the fundamental problem lies in inadequate  information at all levels of society. On the other hand, Blades  believes the situation is further complicated by irresponsible  fatherhood plus the lack of respect toward women, both of which  are cultural problems.    Candidate Vallarino is asked whether he plans to amend the  Labor Code, and, if so, how. Vallarino replies that the Labor  Code is "certainly one of the factors inhibiting investment in  Panama." Noting that the Labor Code is obsolete, he adds:  "Panama's labor leaders know this perfectly well. I would not  amend the Labor Code. I would make the unions, in a joint  effort with the private sector, amend the Labor Code." Based on  his experience as president of the Labor Foundation, he says it  is possible to "reach an understanding without any side having  to renounce its interests." He adds: "Negotiation and a  consensus are possible, even easy, if goodwill and understanding  between the sides exist." Commenting on Vallarino's answer,  Carles notes that, while promoting assembly plant activity in  the country, he has learned "it is easy to find a consensus  between workers and businessmen, and the state should not  meddle, play politics, or discriminate in favor of one party or  the other." He adds that some laws are hampering the  development of new business activities.    On the same subject, Blades points to the Stability,  Competitiveness, and Employment Pact established in Mexico,  which seeks to generate more jobs "without worsening working  conditions." He adds: "I believe we can reach such a point  through a concerted effort. I believe we must not worsen  Panamanian working conditions." Blades says new formulas must  be presented in order that both business and labor understand  "they are a part of Panamanian society, and that a consensus  must be reached without allowing class-related, ideological, or  economic interests to prevail."    In the opinion of Perez Balladares, the key word on this  topic is "competitiveness," and to achieve this, "we must have a  Labor Code that allows us to compete with other countries vying  with us for investments." He adds, "We must also have efficient  private enterprise, because we cannot pin the blame on the  workers." He also says, "We must have a state that promotes a  consensus and which is, in turn, efficient in providing  necessary services."    Panelist Britton broaches the topic of the country's health  care system, and he asks Carles how he would improve the  country's health services. Carles answers that the state  earmarks a significant amount of money to this sector, "but we  must improve its level of efficiency by having more doctors  placed in charge of administration." He adds that public  services are not just inefficient because of a lack of funds,  but also because of mismanagement.    Blades notes that health care is of utmost concern. He feels  the system must not be politicized and resources should be  better allocated. Perez Balladares, in turn, notes that all  major health indicators have dropped in the country, and he says  the lack of adequate drinking water is one of the reasons for  this. Vallarino says that in this campaign he has had the  opportunity to visit many hospitals. He believes that  decentralizing health services would enable each community to  have a greater say in improving services.    Reichard asks Blades what specific actions he would take to  stop illegal mass immigration. The Papa Egoro candidate begins  by saying a law has to be enacted to define the functions of the  police, including the border police. He adds that the  government is one of the "chief culprits" in allowing the  smuggling of illegal aliens into the country.    Reichard then asks Blades to specify what measures can be  taken to prevent this. In Blades' opinion, "the corruption  generated by this sort of activity" has to be combated. He  argues that for many poorly paid public employees, this activity  constitutes "almost a survival mechanism." In addition, the  opportunity for smuggling illegal aliens exists because "crime  generally goes unpunished in the country." He adds, "We have to  punish those who break the law," and this will immediately send  a signal from the highest level of government to the lowest.    Speaking on this same topic, Perez Balladares say some  ethnic  groups are exploited by being asked to pay huge sums for visas  in order to emigrate from their native countries. He says he  would take steps to keep these people from being exploited by  their own compatriots who are in Panama or by immigration  officials. He agrees that police working in border areas need  to be professionalized.    Vallarino says the Immigration Law needs a complete  overhaul,  "because Panamanians have not yet decided who we want to come to  Panama." Carles agrees on the need to revise the Immigration  Law, because this is a problem of corruption "that begins in the  consulates, the Public Registry Office, and the Immigration  Office."    Perez Balladares stresses the need to introduce legislative  reforms that will permit expediting judicial cases. He says  such cases can be accelerated with the support of the lawyers.    Panelist Octavio del Moral notes that Perez Balladares has  suggested the next attorney general be selected from a list to  be supplied by the Bar Association and the Law School, but notes  adds that in the last bar election, 91 percent of its members  abstained from voting. This, therefore, would be undemocratic.  Perez Balladares says he does not agree with this argument,  because the lawyers are being consulted, and if they do not want  to participate, then that is their prerogative.    Vallarino claims that the fundamental problem in the  administration of justice has been the selection of those  individuals who impart justice, recalling the cases of the last  two attorney generals.    Carles notes that the quality of personnel both in the  Attorney General's Office and in the judicial system "must be  improved." He says he would not rely on the Bar Association and  unions, because that is where the worst manipulators have  existed for years. He suggests seeking a variety of options to  end impunity, deficiencies, and the slow administration of  justice.    Blades notes that the main problem in this area has been the  nonexistence of budgets needed for an expeditious handling of  justice.    At this point, Britton asks about the Panama Canal, which  requires constant maintenance. She says this cannot be achieved  if it is administered with the bureaucracy that has prevailed in  the government.    Vallarino responds: "The Canal needs autonomy, but real  autonomy. The National Assembly is already studying  constitutional reforms that are directed toward that goal. I  and 100 other Panamanians helped prepare those regulations. Our  primary concern was to keep the Canal administration from  suffering from the vices that occur regularly in the Panamanian  Government and -- I do not want to exclude it -- in the U.S.  Government. We are not unique in this. So autonomy is  definitely a part of the constitutional reform."    To the same question, Carles states: "The Canal will  efficiently perform its task; that is, transiting ships. Our  problems lie in the decisionmaking process. Important decisions  have to be made at the administrative level. The Americans have  trained thousands of Panamanians for many years. In that  respect, the Canal will operate correctly. Let's not have any  doubt about that. We need to prepare ourselves for the  decisionmaking process. We need to have the appropriate means  to make policy decisions on wages, purchases, investments,  tolls, and employment."    Blades responds: "I would like to say two things. First,  the Canal situation should be viewed in terms of the law and the  personnel. What worked for 79 years should continue to work the  same way with the same efficiency. In other words, things must  be done intelligently with the same efficiency and by remaining  consistent with our laws, the laws that allowed the Canal to  operate efficiently for 79 years, even if they are U.S. laws.  We must make them consistent with our laws.    "Second, the labor situation in the Canal Zone should not  deteriorate. The same circumstances that have made employees  happy and led to uninterrupted success -- that is, the  successful operation of the Panama Canal for 79 years -- should  be maintained."    Regarding the Canal, Perez Balladares responds: "There is a  Panamanian saying that sums it up quite well. If it isn't  broken, don't fix it. I think the Panama Canal has been working  perfectly well for many years. We have to make our laws,  Panamanian laws, consistent with the system and assimilate the  practices, personnel policies, wage administration policies, the  merit system, everything that has made the Canal function well.  Then there must be a total decentralization."    Perez Balladares adds: "We hope that on 31 December 1999,  the only ones who will know that there has been a change of  administration will be the Panamanians. The rest of the world  will see the Canal functioning normally."    Vallarino adds, "We have the talent to administer the Canal,  perhaps better than it is being administered now."    Reichard asks Carles that, if he is elected president, when  he ends his term in August 1999, what kind of nation will he  bequeath to future generations in the year 2000.    Carles responds: "The 8 May elections will be the most  important in the country's history, because we must create the  institutions that will permit the smooth transition from the  present to the future. For instance, if elected, one of the  first things I must do is consolidate the monetary system to  ensure financial and economic stability."    Noting that Panamanians have greater capabilities than many  people give them credit for, Carles begins answering a question  on whether or not he can, within five years, instill a feeling  of hope among the Panamanians. He explains: "This is not a poor  country. We just have to manage our resources better. As  comptroller I learned how to manage things. As comptroller, I  corrected the pattern of waste in public funds evidenced in the  videotape" released on national television by President  Guillermo Endara. Carles notes that what is required is "a  balanced budget, fiscal stability, and disciplined public  finances."    Ruben Blades, responding to the same question, says it is  indeed possible to instill hope in the people within five years.  Perez Balladares says his commitment is to the future and to a  united Panama. Vallarino says unity is necessary for the sake  of the country's future.    Carles takes the floor again and notes that it is fine to  think about the future, but he warns the past cannot be  forgotten. "I wish," he states, "we could engage in a real  debate and speak about what the PRD represents for the country's  future, especially considering that notions and practices  involving statism and interventionism continue to prevail."    Panelist Octavio del Moral then asks the candidates whether  the Panamanian Constitution has become a shackle inhibiting the  establishment of true democracy in the country.    Ruben Blades says he favors a Constituent Assembly, but he  does not favor simply putting "patches" on the Constitution.    Perez Balladares responds to the same question in this way:  "Of course the Constitution has to be changed, modified, and  made adequate for reaching national objectives. Perhaps this  will contribute to securing the reconciliation we so much  desire."    Vallarino says he favorably views a Constituent Assembly,  but  he warns this process could impose a six-month delay on Panama's  economic and social development. "Such a delay is critical for  those who do not have a job and have to resolve basic needs."  He adds, "In my opinion, this project is of secondary  importance, considering the many social needs of the Panamanian  people today."    Carles affirms that the current Constitution "is the result  of the aberrant and arrogant presence of a military caste and  its political expression -- namely, the PRD. This must come to  an end." Carles adds that, if elected, on 9 May he will create  "a commission that will present proposals on how to reform the  Constitution or how to prepare the way for a Constituent  Assembly."    Ruben Blades then makes his final statement in which he says  that he would not hold a Constituent Assembly right away because  there are other priorities, but he adds that it is important to  hold one.    Moderator Rodrigo Eisenmann closes the debate by thanking  the  candidates, the panelists, and the television viewers.</p>

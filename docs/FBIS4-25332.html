			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Wu Hengquan (0702 1854 2938) and </F> XINHUA reporters Yin Xuecheng (3009 1331 2052) and Zhou Lixian  (0719 4539 2009)]    [Text] Suzhou, 8 Jun -- A national conference on the  comprehensive management work on public security in rural areas  opened in Wujiang City, Jiangsu Province today. The conference  called for severely and promptly punishing all kinds of serious  criminal elements in accordance with the law to create a more  favorable social environment for reform and development.    Ren Jianxin, CPC Central Committee Secretariat member and  Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public  Security [CCCMPS] chairman, chaired the conference and relayed  important instructions from central leading comrades.    The conference was jointly held by the CCCMPS, the CPC  Central Committee Organization Department, and the Public  Security, Justice, and Civil Affairs Ministries to further  implement the guidelines of the central conference on rural  work; disseminate advanced experience in upholding material and  spiritual civilizations simultaneously to achieve economic  development and social stability; arrange to make concentrated  efforts to improve public order in rural areas where it is not  good; and vigorously strengthen comprehensive management of  public order to further improve the public security situation in  the countryside and promote all-round development of rural work.    In his speech, Luo Gan, state councillor and CCCMPS vice  chairman, pointed out: Today, our country is in an important  historic period of reform and development. Good public order  and stable social environment are important conditions for  reform and development. All these years, the party Central  Committee and the State Council have always regarded  agricultural, rural, and peasant issues as fundamental issues  affecting the overall interests of the party and country, and  they have adopted a series of effective measures to promptly and  appropriately resolve the prominent issues in rural work. This  has promoted rural stability and development.    Luo Gan said: In recent years, many localities have  rectified public order in many rural areas where it was not  good. The CCCMPS has also made arrangements to combat thieves,  pursue and annihilate "train and highway bandits," and launch  other special struggles closely related to public order in rural  areas. Some results have been obtained. The current situation  of public order in rural areas is generally good, although in  some local areas problems of public order are fairly prominent.    It was learned that the current work on rectifying public  order in rural areas will focus on cracking down on offenders of  serious crimes in four areas: 1) Evil forces of hooligans,  particularly gangs of hooligans and burglars, as well as  criminal rings with the characteristics of secret societies [he  she hui 7815 4357 2585]; 2) bandits on trains, cars, and ships,  as well as criminals who commit murder, robbery, explosion,  rape, and other violent crimes; 3) criminals who sabotage  railroads, telecommunications, power, and production facilities,  or who commit other serious crimes such as stealing or robbing  state properties; and 4) criminals who transport and sell  narcotics, organize prostitution, kidnap and sell women and  children, and manufacture or disseminate pornographic materials.    Luo Gan stressed: In conducting the work of rectifying  public order in rural areas, party committees, governments, and  departments concerned at all levels should fully understand the  necessity of strengthening comprehensive management of public  order in rural areas, persist in severely and promptly punishing  all kinds of serious criminal elements in accordance with the  law, implement legal and educational measures against people who  break the law by committing minor offenses, strengthen forces in  towns and townships in charge of comprehensive management of  public order, extensively and profoundly launch activities to  manage villages according to the law, and improve and strengthen  work of publicizing the legal system among peasants. In  particular, it is necessary to make vigorous efforts to  strengthen village party branches and village committees and to  build self-governing organizations of the masses to institute a  system of responsibility in managing public order so that there  are truly people who are in charge and attend to the work of  comprehensive management of public order. It is necessary to  establish and perfect crime prevention mechanism in society,  encourage the masses to combat bad things and bad persons, and  mobilize and organize the masses to build up grassroots  organizations and quickly change the face of public order.    Luo Gan asked all localities to closely combine efforts in  rectifying public order in rural areas with efforts to  vigorously develop the rural economy, improve public order to  safeguard economic construction in rural areas, and promote the  building of spiritual civilization and grassroots organizations.  He asked them to strengthen rural public order from the sources  by carrying out economic construction and the construction of  spiritual civilization and grassroots organizations and by  consolidating and developing the achievements made in rectifying  public order in rural areas.    Zhang Siqing, CCCMPS vice chairman, and persons in charge of  departments concerned attended the conference.</p>

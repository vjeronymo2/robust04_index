			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWEET DANNY, THEN AND NOW;  </P> <P> SOME CAN WHISTLE BY LARRY MCMURTRY (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $19.95; 348 PP.;  0-671-64267-7)  </P> <P> In "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers," Larry McMurtry's fifth novel,  published in 1972, Danny Deck is half in love with Emma Horton, the wife of his  pal and Rice University classmate Flap Horton. The feeling is mutual, but poor  Emma is eclipsed when, after an all-night party in the home of Prof. Gordon  Lloyd-Jons, Danny wakes up next to the leggy, alluring Sally Bynum. On an  impulse, they marry. Before long, Sally is pregnant. On a second impulse they  split for the coast.  </P> <P> Sally leaves Danny in San Francisco. Jill, an Oscar-winning screenwriter whom  Danny meets in Los Angeles, leaves him too -- Jill who seemed so perfect for  him, an artist who loved his writing as much as she loved him. Back in Houston,  trying to catch up with Sally and his unborn child, Danny is seduced by Jenny,  his former landlady, but that can't last. He spends a guilty night with Emma  while Flap is on a fishing trip, but that can't last either. Sally's father  attacks him outside the hospital; Danny will not be permitted to see his own  child. Despondent, he leaves for California again, but not right away. First,  there is to be a detour to the Rio Grande.  </P> <P> "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers" is a unique, Western-accented  birth-of-a-writer novel. Sally and Jill leave Danny, Danny leaves Jenny and  Emma, but along the way Danny sells his first novel, meets his first editor,  attends his first literary cocktail party and his first book-signing, and faces  the fact that he has become a strange sort of being: "The door to the ordinary  places was the door that I had missed. The door to Emma's kitchen, or to all  such places. There would never be an Emma's kitchen for me."  </P> <P> That strangeness may be nothing more than the strangeness of any novelist's  life, novelists living, as they do, more in their made-up worlds than in the  one the rest of us share. But this is a strangeness Danny is facing for the  first time. His detour to the Rio Grande becomes the occasion for the rueful  drowning of the manuscript of his second novel: "A boy drowning a manuscript. I  would have laughed, if I could have been the one watching. I was never the one  watching, though. I was always the one the hilarious things were happening to."  </P> <P> The Danny Deck of "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers" is a genuinely  lovable character. When Jill tells him "You're so lovable some girl will glom  onto you five minutes after I leave. No normal woman could ask for more than  you and a nice apartment," she is only saying what we already know. A rare  ability to portray the lovability that real people do sometimes have is  McMurtry's great gift. Not that his protagonists are saints: When a biker tries  to shake down Gordon Lloyd-Jons, Danny flips the punk over a balcony railing  and leaves him with a broken hip. But Danny's sins are sins of youth and  passion, never of venality, calculation or simple meanness.  </P> <P> McMurtry's portrayal of Danny in "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers" is  helped along, however, by two features that are missing in "Some Can Whistle,"  the sequel to that novel. The new novel is set 22 years after its predecessor.  Danny is now 51, a failed novelist but a fabulously successful television  writer, the creator of a long-running hit, "Al and Sal." The show has been  canceled, at long last, and Danny has taken a portion of his vast earnings and  moved back to Texas where, improbably, he has the white-haired Lloyd-Jons as a  roomer in his mansion.  </P> <P> One day, the phone rings at pool-side. It is his daughter, now 22. Over the  years, until he lost track of her completely, Danny sent annual birthday  presents for T. R., as she now calls herself. Sally, T. R.'s mother, returned  them all. But Danny's fame and presumed wealth have prompted the young woman to  come looking for her lost father.  </P> <P> Father welcomes daughter despite the fact that he has come to prize his  solitude: "Once I'd probably felt that I was developing my solitude for the  sake of my novel, or for some kind of art work, but in recent years I had come  to realize that that wasn't really true. I had become solitary because I liked  it and needed it. Aloneness, I had come to believe, did not need an art work to  justify it."  </P> <P> T. R. represents, in truth, Danny's last chance to break out of his solitude.  The inconclusive love affairs of "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers"  have subsided, in "Some Can Whistle," into inconclusive telephone conversations  or, worse, into inconclusive messages left on answering machines. The  rich-and-famous Danny alludes, a bit unconvincingly, to a jet-set past: "There  were Marella Miracola and Antonella Napthi, the most dazzling and most constant  of my various Italian loves. I also had a few pictures of women who had never  been girlfriends, but who nonetheless loomed large in my memories of Europe --  Pier Angeli, Francoise Dorleac, Romy Schneider; they flashed in my imagination  whenever I thought of Paris or Rome." But that, at best, was then. Now is, so  far as we can tell, a time of semi-voluntary celibacy.  </P> <P> T. R. is working in a hamburger joint when she calls. Danny will learn, in due  course, that his daughter has not been raised by Sally and her wealthy new  husband, as he thought, but by her low-life grandparents. She is coarse and  poor, knows it, and hates herself and him because of it. During the first 300  pages of this 350-page novel, Danny tracks her down, persuades her to move in  with him (she brings along her two small children and Muddy Box, the father of  the younger child), and sets about overcoming two decades' worth of suspicion  and resentment. As he does all this, he suffers recurrent migraine headaches  (the migraine is all but an independent character in the first half of the  book), drifts back in memory to the great days of "Al and Sal," and exchanges  phone messages with the glamorous or semi-glamorous women of his former life,  most notably with actress Jeanie Vertus, the one among them who seems genuinely  in love with him.  </P> <P> These 300 pages depend, novelistically, on the relationship between Danny and  T. R. Theirs is a boy-gets-girl drama, with the father cast as boy and his  daughter as girl. T. R. resists Danny's advances, but gradually he wins her  over. Her resistance ends when, against his tastes and her expectations, he  takes her dancing in a local roadhouse. En route, there glimmers the  possibility that as he warms her heart, he will warm his own; in other words,  that T. R. will, indirectly, work a change in Danny's relationship with Jeanie.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, neither T. R. nor Danny quite comes to life. In an odd, brief  chapter 10 pages before the end of the novel, Danny, now a reborn novelist,  says: "It took three years to write the novel. I thought it would be about my  daughter -- about T. R. Perhaps I thought that in writing it I would discover  some of the things about her that I didn't know; perhaps I thought the book  would bring some of her back to me. By truthful imaginings I would find my  daughter.  </P> <P> "I worked hard and in time regained a certain art, but the art refused to be  used as I had hoped to use it. It took its own path, and the path led not to T.  R. but to the old man . . . The book was a modest success."  </P> <P> "Some Can Whistle" is itself only a modest success, far inferior to the  brilliant, hilarious, vivid "All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers." Danny  is the same guy, still standing wistfully at that kitchen door. But his  innocence, his fumbling are less beguiling in a man of 50 than they were in a  boy of 25, and wistful phone messages pall more quickly than wistful sex  scenes.  </P> <P> McMurtry had Danny's youth going for him the first time around; this time he  doesn't. Worse, perhaps, the older Danny just doesn't get out and around as  much as the younger Danny did. In the earlier novel, there were a score of  minor characters: the Rice University librarian, a Mexican janitor, a pair of  Texas rangers, a gas-station attendant, a redneck landlord, all of them drawn  with stunning economy and delicious humor. There are many fewer characters in  the new novel, and they are less well drawn. The physicality of the earlier  book was exuberant: The Texas rangers toss the long-haired, hippyish young  novelist across a barbed-wire fence into a field of prickly pears; the novel  closes with him waist deep in the Rio Grande. The new novel, by contrast, seems  all talk, far too much of it tedious plot summary from "Al and Sal."  </P> <P> And yet, just at the point when this reader was ready to stop reading,  something happened in "Some Can Whistle." Life at Danny's Texas mansion flies  to pieces when Earl Dee, T. R.'s first husband, gets out of jail and commits a  multiple murder. One of his casualties, most mysteriously, is the voice of  Danny-the-TV-Writer. What we hear instead, from this point on (which is to say,  in the last 50 pages of the book), is a voice like that of Larry McMurtry in  his nonfiction memoir "In a Narrow Grave." Denouement is rarely the most  interesting part of a novel, but in this one it is. Danny tells us where the  various characters have ended up, speaking simply with a kind of quiet, adult  interest, rather as one might in a long letter. As he does this, McMurtry's  novel most unexpectedly starts to move. Reading this book is like rowing a  flat-bottomed boat through a reedy, muddy swamp. Your arms have long since  grown heavy when you notice that you're not hitting mud any more: The water is  deeper; the reeds are gone; there is a current under the boat; you are moving  at last.  </P> <P> Those closing 50 pages and a brief, earlier episode featuring Jill Reed, the  lost love of "All My Friends," are the work of the McMurtry whose devoted  reader I have been since 1972. The rest seem to be by someone else.  </P> <P> More than generally realized, Los Angeles is the second pole (Texas is the  first) in McMurtry's work. "Moving On," his fourth novel, contains the finest  brief description of the freeway ever written. "Some Can Whistle" is, in good  measure, a Los Angeles novel. There are pages in it about the television  industry that many who work there may appreciate. But when one of the two main  characters in a novel is killed and the other starts talking like someone else,  and when just at that point the reader of the novel finds his spirits picking  up, there has to be a little something wrong with those characters.  </P></p>

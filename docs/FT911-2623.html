			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Syndicated Loans: Banks consolidate position of power SYNDICATED lenders have found themselves elevated from a position of subservience to one of power in the last 18 months. There are two main explanations for the banks' current caution when it comes to lending: the Bank for International Settlements' requirements for capital adequacy ratios, and fears that some borrowers may not survive the recession. As a result, pricings have increased and, in some cases, banks have been able to negotiate tighter covenants. They are also keen to monitor a borrower's accounts more frequently. In the past 18 months, the price of corporate credit has doubled or in some cases trebled in terms of interest margins, commitment fees and front-end fees. Bankers like to boast that they now have more clout when it comes to requesting tighter financial ratios and more detailed covenants. For example, Barclays, Manufacturers Hanover and S-E Banken recently arranged a three-year Dollars 250m term loan for VME, the construction machinery group jointly owned by Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US. The covenant stipulated interest cover (profit divided by total interest charged) of 1.75 times for the first year and 2 times thereafter. According to one banker involved in the deal, had VME chosen to do such a deal a year ago, the interest cover requested probably would have been 1.5 times and 1.75 times respectively. The banker says that, in general, interest cover requested now is usually in the range of 2-2.5 times. Another banker points out that gearing (the debt-to-equity ratio) is also scrutinised more closely. Whereas a year ago, gearing ratios of up to 150 per cent were acceptable, bankers prefer gearing of 100 to 125 per cent today. Finally, where once the yearly audited accounts were considered adequate, bankers now want to see half-yearly or even quarterly management accounts to check the company is meeting the financial ratio requirements. Not surprisingly, companies tend to resist the banks' requests for financial covenants - to which the banks' reply is simply 'no covenants, no quality banks' - unless the borrower is prepared to accept a higher pricing. A handful of syndicated loans came to the market last week. Deutsche Bank is arranging a DM150m five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility for Varde Bank, Denmark's fifth largest commercial bank. The interest margin is 30 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), with a commitment fee of 15 basis points and a participation fee of 15 basis points for amounts of DM15m. The pricing is regarded as rather aggressive: one bank which arranged a similar financing for Varde Bank in recent years suggested that an interest margin of 40 basis points might be required to attract lenders. While syndication for Inntrepreneur, the holding company in a pubs-for-breweries swap between Grand Metropolitan and Elders IXL, has finally closed, there is a new Pounds 160m two-year financing in the market for Inntrepreneur Estates (CH) plc, arranged by Citicorp, Barclays, SG Warburg and National Westminster. This is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Inntrepreneur Estates Limited, which is jointly owned by GrandMet and Fosters Brewing Group. The interest margin is 1 percentage point over Libor and there are participation fees of 30 basis points on Pounds 20m, 20 basis points on Pounds 10m and 10 basis points on Pounds 5m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    EUROMARKET TURNOVER (DOLLARS M)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Primary Market                Straights   Conv    FRN        Other US dollars     2,265.1     0.0     66.0     13,618.7 Prev           1,833.2    96.9     95.0     13,039.4 Other          3,026.5   123.9    264.9      5,976.3 Prev           1,713.1     0.0    248.8      8,687.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Secondary Market US dollars    20,405.3   814.1  5,765.6      8,241.9 Prev          17,704.9   852.3  6,948.6      9,263.4 Other         32,351.2 1,283.6  4,549.7     53,297.5 Prev          26,983.3   945.5  4,569.5     57,791.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Cedel     Euroclear    Total US dollars          16,791.7     34,385.0     51,176.7 Prev                17,664.7     32,169.0     49,833.7 Other               38,765.5     62,108.1    100,873.6 Prev                40,463.5     60,475.6    100,939.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week to April 25, 1991 Source: AIBD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

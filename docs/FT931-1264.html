			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Berlitz quarterly loss cut to Dollars 3.9m BERLITZ, the language school and publishing company once controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, said yesterday it had a Dollars 3.9m, or 21 cents per share, loss in the fourth quarter of 1992. The result, while much improved on the Dollars 189.5m, or Dollars 9.97 per share, loss in the last quarter of 1991, was affected by a Dollars 1.4m charge related to the acquisition of majority control of Berlitz by Fukutake, the Japanese publishing group. That deal, which gives Fukutake 67 per cent of Berlitz, was completed on February 8. In the last quarter of 1991, Berlitz suffered from a Dollars 195.4m charge related to write-offs and reserve caused by the bankruptcy of the Maxwell Communication Corporation. Sales in the last quarter of 1992 were Dollars 70.8m, up from Dollars 66.5m a year before. Sales for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 281.3m, against Dollars 259.8m in 1991. Berlitz said net profit for the whole of last year was Dollars 4m, against a loss of Dollars 172m in 1991. Translation sales for the fourth quarter of last year were 19.6 per cent higher at Dollars 7.9m. Publishing sales were Dollars 4.9m, up from Dollars 4.5m a year before. Instruction sales were 4.8 per cent better in the quarter at Dollars 58m. After the Fukutake share deal Berlitz has long-term indebtedness of Dollars 115m. Mr Soichiro Fukutake, new chairman of Berlitz, said the two companies could become 'a global powerhouse' in education and language services.</p>

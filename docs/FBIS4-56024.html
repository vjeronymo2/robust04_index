			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross by </F> Gabriel Oszy-Toth; place and date not given: "Governing Is Not  a Triumphal March for Anyone -- Boross on the Hungarian  Democratic Forum's Election Fiasco, Handing Over Power, and  Being in Opposition"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] In recent  months the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] has been talking  constantly about the danger of a left-wing restoration. This  was emphasized in all campaign meetings, interviews, and  television interviews. Do you think that your election campaign  was flawed?    [Boross] I do not believe that our campaign was basically  mistaken. In my view, the electors did not vote mainly on the  basis of the parties' campaigns. This is proved by the fact  that in certain areas the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  candidates did not even conduct a campaign -- as we learned from  their reports. Nevertheless, they automatically received the  votes. It is a fact that, tactically, the MDF could have  conducted a better campaign, I have no doubts about this.  However, I do not think that this is a decisive factor. We had  a stable government for four years, however, in the meantime,  the opposition had time and opportunity to "consume" the MDF  through its continuous attacks. Had there been four or five  changes of government before, the MDF would not have been a  constant target.    [Oszy-Toth] How did the Socialists manage to get 32 percent  if they had not even conducted a campaign in many places?    [Boross] The masses were swept toward those who were most  antagonistic to the government, with the clear hope that prices  would decrease, pensions would increase, and it would be easier  to make ends meet. The MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] both played up to this. It is a different matter that  they are now slowly starting to reveal that not everything will  be the way people believe. The next government is facing a  difficult task because it has to live up to the wishes of the  masses that they created and I do not think that they will be  able to satisfy these wishes. [passage omitted]    [Oszy-Toth] Are you preparing for the second round, and do  you trust that the proportions can significantly change?    [Boross] I am always hopeful, and not without a basis  because public opinion on political parties is extremely  changeable. For example, one week before the elections, public  opinion researchers predicted 38 percent for the MSZP and much  less for the SZDSZ. For some reason, a certain percentage of  the votes went from the MSZP to the SZDSZ.    [Oszy-Toth] This is a possible conclusion.    [Boross] Indeed, this is only a play with logic, rather than  an analysis. However, all along we had to fight with the  disadvantage that Hungary is dominated by a media that does not  appreciate our value system. [passage omitted]    [Oszy-Toth] In what kind of economic condition will you hand  over the country? According to the MSZP, the country is in a  much worse situation than it was in 1990 when they had handed  over power. However, you claim that the country is in a better  situation now.    [Boross] If an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition is made, then they will  be saying jointly that the country is in a worse situation than  it was in 1990, and this is the reason they are forced to take  exigency measures that might not be to the liking of the  population. However, for all unbiased observers, it is clear and  evident that the country cannot be in such a bad situation  because we completed some 60 to 70 percent of the inevitable  changes. Four years ago, we received a country with a distorted  ownership system, empty treasury, immeasurable tensions, and  hidden unemployment. Those who now describe the country's  situation as worse are actually seeking explanations for the  measures to be brought that will be contrary to the promises  made during the elections. [passage omitted]    [Oszy-Toth] MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn said many times that  they are not sure about the country's situation and the parties  that will form the government will possibly have some surprises.    [Boross] What was true in 1990 is not true now,  nevertheless, I can hear the same statements. Let us remember  that, in 1989, the Socialist government wanted to deny a $1.5  billion debt, but then it admitted it. I am thinking of [former  Prime Minister] Miklos Nemeth's memorable announcement. The  MSZP is aware of everything, we do not have secrets, we cannot  even have any for certain reasons of personnel. This lack of  trust is part of the category of political games because, when  the opposition enters government, it will excuse itself by  saying that it had taken over the country in an even worse than  expected situation and that is why it cannot keep its promises.  I am convinced that the past four years will not be a reason  and an excuse the same way as the heritage of the previous 40  years was not accepted as an explanation from us. People who  are voting in the hope of better living standards will sooner or  later say that this is not what was promised. [passage omitted]    [Oszy-Toth] Can the MDF crumble or split? In the coming  four years, it will have much fewer deputies in parliament.    [Boross] The MDF's membership acknowledged its defeat in a  disciplined way. I hope that we will not have a split, although  certain initiatives to upset our unity may be possible. The  cost of this was shown by the fate of the Hungarian Justice and  Life Party and Istvan Csurka. All in all, the MDF will have to  renew itself, will have to assess the personnel and  organizational issues, and it will have to become more modern  and practical in the political struggle. In addition to this,  the conclusion has to be drawn that the vast majority of the  country's population was born after 1945 and became adults  sometime after the mid-1960's. This public has a different  attitude and does not appreciate the wounds of their  forefathers. In spite of this, I am very happy that we  fulfilled our moral obligation and implemented the compensation,  even if the people who received compensation did not vote for  us. [passage omitted]</p>

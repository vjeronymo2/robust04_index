			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, March 1 (AFP) -- The European Union missed  its Monday midnight [28 February] deadline to wrap up talks for  absorbing four new countries, but diplomats reported progress in  the negotiations which were continuing late into the night.    "We hope to see a breakthrough in coming hours," Danish  Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said as EU negotiators  bargained with Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden over terms  for their entry into the Union.    Diplomats said Brussels was offering the candidate countries  more money to help merge the highly-subsidised Nordic and Alpine  agriculture with the lower-cost EU farming system.    The EU wants the high farm prices of Austria, Norway and  Sweden cut to EU levels in one "big bang" on the day when the  applicant countries join the EU.    The candidate countries, being relatively wealthy, will  contribute a total of about one billion dollars a year more to  the the EU budget than they will get back in benefits.    The diplomats said a large part of this money could be used,  at least initially, to help the high-cost, difficult-to-farm  Nordic and Alpine regions.    French Minister for European Affairs Alain Lamassoure said  there had been little progress in one major sticking point --  Austria's insistence on keeping strict limits on truck traffic  across the Austrian Alps until 2004.    The restrictions would contravene the EU's freedom of  movement principle, but diplomats said the EU was likely to back  down on this point rather than let it torpedo the enlargement  negotiations.    There was also no change in Norway's refusal to allow EU  fishing fleets increased access to the fish-rich Norwegian  waters as part of Oslo's price for joining the Union.    However, one diplomat said the EU might reach at least the  outlines of a deal with Austria, Finland and Norway before dawn  on Tuesday, then give Norway a little more time to consider a  compromise on the fish issue.    Germany and Denmark were fighting to have the four countries  join the EU together.    Lamassoure said the negotiators might delay a decision on  another dispute -- that the applicants could tilt the EU's  balance of power towards its richer northern members, and  increase the influence of its smaller ones.    The French minister predicted that the decision, along with  the dispute over Norwegian fish, might be held over until the  weekend.    The EU had set a Monday midnight deadline to wrap up the  year-long negotiations so that the membership accords can be  ratified in time for the applicants to join the EU on January 1  next year.    But officials said the deadline could possibly be stretched  to March 10, giving Euro-parliamentarians just enough time to  cement their entry before parliament breaks up in the first week  in May for Euro-elections in June.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Investors drift from health sector to engineering, hotels and leisure THE sectors of the London stock market currently most favoured by institutional investors are engineering, hotels and leisure and other industrial companies, according to a survey by Smith New Court, the stockbrokers. Sectors least favoured by investors are oil and gas, health and household, contracting and construction, and property. The survey of 97 institutional investors, collectively managing Pounds 610bn of funds, was carried out by Gallup last week as the FT-SE 100 index was close to a record high. The biggest swing in institutional attitudes since the last survey in July is reserved for the health and household sector which was then most favoured by the investors. While the contracting and construction and property sectors remain deeply out of favour, both have swung back in relative terms and are now only marginally less favoured on balance than the food manufacturing, telephone networks, electricity and water sectors. On broader economic issues, the institutions overwhelmingly believe there will be a net increase in taxation in the spring budget to help fund the public sector borrowing requirement. Some 45 per cent think the net increase in taxation will be between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2.5bn. The report is in line with City opinion that suggests VAT may be extended to cover books, newspapers, fuel and possibly public transport. A growing number of the institutions also believe that the general UK economy will improve over the next year. They expected growth in GDP of 1.2 per cent in 1993 and 2 per cent in 1994. Base rates are expected to be 6.5 per cent in 12 months time; annual inflation is forecast to be 3.7 per cent in December and 4.4 per cent at the end of 1994.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Lamont furious over criticism by MPs A POWERFUL cross-party committee of MPs is set to attack last month's Budget and call for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to be replaced, in a move that will severely embarrass the government. A government blunder allowed the opposition minority in the Treasury and Civil Service committee to push through a report which criticised Mr Lamont and questioned his judgment. The chancellor was said by ministers last night to be furious over the mix-up. The report - agreed in the absence of two Tory members - criticised Mr Lamont's handling of a range of issues including the Budget, the public sector borrowing requirement and the European exchange rate mechanism. It is expected to be published on Monday. Labour was able to push through the critical passages when Tory MPs were absent from an important meeting, giving the opposition a de facto majority on the committee. The absentees were Mr Nicholas Budgen, the Euro-sceptic Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, and Sir Thomas Arnold, MP for Hazel Grove. Mr Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and Spalding, and Mr Giles Radice, Labour MP for Durham North, also missed part of the meeting. It coincided with a well-attended session in the Commons chamber on a motion criticising Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, for his handling of the Maastricht debate. Tory committee members, who ended by voting against the report's adoption, were last night playing down its significance, describing it as the sort of 'knockabout' that often took place in the Commons. The critical passages - which also claimed the Budget did nothing to help the unemployed - were largely the work of Mr Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Life assurance: the wrongs and rights (2) Sir, I am rather disappointed that Peter Marsh's article lacked any semblance of balance. Most of us in this industry abhor malpractice and would like to see any practitioner found guilty of fraud or misrepresentation locked away for a very long time. Only then will the public enjoy a reasonable level of protection. It is a matter of some regret that the courts have failed to pass severe custodial sentences when given the opportunity. You have chosen to highlight the sour comments of industry failures, but I challenge you to produce a single widow who will complain that her late husband was pressured into buying too much life insurance. The client of the Pegasus sales lady who had to struggle to meet his or her premiums will, I am sure, be eternally grateful in the event of a claim. Similarly, the disillusioned Allied Dunbar salesman should consider his own shortcomings rather than criticise the products of a group whose contracts are vastly superior to those peddled by most banks and building societies. The hard-working, enthusiastic and caring life insurance sales person has nothing to be ashamed of. Life insurance sales people will continue to perform a valuable function until the majority of the population makes adequate provision for themselves and their families without the need for persuasion.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan denies the  Government is stepping backwards on the issue of news media  freedom following censorship at two military stations.    Mr Banyat, who is responsible for the Government  Broadcasting  Directing Board [GBDB], said that since the Government came into  office it had been giving "full freedom" to the news media as it  promised.    This followed the events of May, 1992 when the public could  not learn what was going on from state-controlled media,  especially radio and television.    This week Independent News Net work (INN) radio, operating  from Air Force station FM 102.5 MHz and Nation Radio operating  on Army station FM 96 MHz were told by the Air Force and the  Army that they would not be allowed to present news that did not  have "solid evidence" because the stations felt they were being  used as "political tools" to get at the Government.    Mr Banyat said that before the GBDB had all the power to  control broadcasting stations but now that power had been  distributed to the individual stations which had their own  committees responsible for each station. [sentence as published]    He said that an overhaul of the radio and television  broadcasting issue was being undertaken and last Thursday he had  appointed a sub-committee to improve the law governing them in  order to allow more flexibility.    More private radio stations, would depend on the  sub-committee's findings, he said.    As for whether military stations could be turned over to the  private sector, since they were founded for security reasons and  there was no need for them now, Mr Banyat said military stations  did give opportunities for news to be broadcast on a wide range  of topics.    It was not possible for all to have the same opinion and  sometimes problems occurred.    He said it was "difficult to say" if the action of the two  Armed Forces was an infringement of news media freedom.    There was thought to invite the military to establish an  understanding on the matter.    "This problem is not about the Government and the military  or  the programmers. It's really about the station and the  programmers," Mr Banyat insisted.</p>

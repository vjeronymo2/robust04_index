Application Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans determines the final action to be taken on each grant application received under this program announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following points should be taken into consideration by all applicants:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Incomplete applications and applications that do not conform to this announcement will not be accepted for review. Applicants will be notified in writing of any such determination by ANA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Complete applications that conform to all the requirements of this program announcement are subjected to a competitive review and evaluation process (discussed in section G below). Independent review panels consisting of reviewers familiar with (1) American Indian Tribes and Native American communities and organizations, (2) environmental issues, and (3) Native American languages, as appropriate, evaluates each application using the published criteria in each funding competitive area. As a result of the review, a numerical score will be assigned to each application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Commissioner's funding decision is based on the review panel's analysis of the application, recommendation and comments of ANA staff, State and Federal agencies having contract and grant performance related information, and other interested parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Commissioner makes grant awards consistent with the purpose of the Act, all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements, this program announcement, and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;After the Commissioner has made decisions on all applications, unsuccessful applicants are notified in writing within approximately 120 days of the closing date.

The Administration for Native Americans staff cannot respond to requests for information regarding funding decisions prior to the official notification to the applicants. The FAA will state the amount of Federal funds awarded, the purpose of the grant, the terms and conditions of the grant award, the effective date of the award, the project period, the budget period, and the amount of the non-ACF matching share requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> G.

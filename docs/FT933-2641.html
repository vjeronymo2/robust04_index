			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: US helps Wassall rise 56% to Pounds 9.7m WASSALL, the conglomerate run by former Hanson executives, yesterday announced pre-tax profits up by 56 per cent to Pounds 9.74m in the first half of 1993, on increased sales of Pounds 133.1m (Pounds 117m). The results were helped by a strong performance from DAP, a US supplier of DIY products, and Metals Closures, manufacturing plastic bottle tops in the UK and South Africa. Mr Christopher Miller, chief executive, said: 'In the UK, the ingredients for a sustained economic improvement are already in place although full recovery may have to wait for further fall in continental interest rates.' Net cash at the end of the half year was Pounds 28m, down Pounds 3m on the previous year end reflecting the increased funding requirements in the last six months. Mr Miller said: 'We would increase earnings just by spending our cash, but obviously we want to use it on an acquisition which will enhance the company. We are confident we will catch our fish.' Last year the group was thwarted in its attempt to acquire Evode, the chemicals and plastics company, by Laporte, the speciality chemicals company. Increasing demand for plastic bottle tops was behind closures's 30 per cent profit increase to Pounds 5m. Although volumes from Antler, the suitcase business, were unchanged, prices suffered leading to a fall in profits to Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 638,000). Earnings per share rose to 4.2p (3.3p). The interim dividend is increased to 1p (0.76p). COMMENT: Yesterday marked the fifth anniversary of Wassall. With hindsight 1988 could not have been a worse time to start a conglomerate: the UK economic boom was on the verge of imploding and industrial holding companies were about to go out of fashion. To increase operating profits by 28 per cent to Pounds 9.5m demonstrates a resilence in the face of difficult markets. The group's size gives it an advantage over other conglomerates struggling to pull off a big deal. Its Pounds 380m market capitalisation - from Pounds 1.9m five years ago - is relatively small. That makes it easier to make another acquisition two years after it bought DAP in the US and three years after it acquired metal closures in the UK. With forecast annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 27m, the shares - up 8p to 252p - are on a justified prospective multiple of 22.</p>

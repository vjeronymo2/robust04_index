He chose Fullerton over Eastern  Michigan and Ohio University.  </P> <P> Shaw also said that Long Beach City wide receiver Oscar Ford, a former Servite  High School standout who caught 13 passes for 180 yards this season, would sign  a letter of intent with Fullerton.  </P> <P> Titan Coach Gene Murphy said he has received letters of intent from two other  community college players, Fullerton College offensive lineman Abe Elliott and  Moorpark College linebacker Matt Pearson.  </P> <P> Elliott, 6-5, 270 pounds, was a backup offensive tackle to highly regarded  Chuck Underwood, who signed with Arizona State, and Vince Galaz.  </P> <P> Elliott attended Raton High School in New Mexico and was an all-state selection  as a senior.  </P> <P> Pearson, 6 feet and 224 pounds, started at inside linebacker for Moorpark.  </P> <P> Murphy said Elliott and Pearson have obtained their Associate of Arts degrees  and will enroll at Fullerton in the spring semester.  </P></p>

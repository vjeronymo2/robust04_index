			<p>BFN     [Text] The postponement of the pope's visit to Lebanon was  the focus of a meeting yesterday between President Ilyas  al-Hirawi and His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din,  chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council. Shaykh  Shams-al-Din said: We expressed our regret over the  postponement of the pope's visit, which all Lebanese welcomed  and prepared for to ensure its success. He said: We have  already expressed our regret and repeat it now. He added: We  pray to God almighty that the pope's circumstances will allow  him to visit. He said: From this forum, the home of all  Lebanese, from the Presidential Palace, I repeat my wish that  his holiness will visit Lebanon as soon as possible because the  Lebanese people strongly desire to see this visit take place.  Also, the Lebanese Government wants the pope to visit.  President al- Hirawi has just expressed the same desire and  urges the pope to visit Lebanon as soon as possible. We hope  the competent departments in the Vatican will continue to  prepare for the visit and reconsider the decision postponing the  visit. He called on those who question Lebanon's unity to stop  putting this unity to the test, stressing that Lebanon's unity  is safe and has passed every test. He emphasized that Lebanon  is too secure for any attempt to fragment and divide it.</p>

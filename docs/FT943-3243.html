			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Gooda Names to press for damages Solicitors acting for an action group of the biggest loss-making Lloyd's syndicate will apply soon to the High Court to enforce a writ for damages against the managing agents of the Gooda Walker agency. The move has been made possible by the decision of the errors and omissions insurers, which are liable for any damages being pursued against members' and managing agents, not to defend the action. However, an action against the members' agents is being defended and that case is continuing. The Gooda Walker 387 Action Group issued the writ against the two groups - the members' agents, and the managing agents they introduced, who in turn ran the personal stock-loss syndicate - in December 1992. Annual losses for individual Lloyd's Names in the syndicate between 1983 and 1987 totalled Pounds 96,000 per Pounds 10,000 invested. However, the action group is forecasting that this figure will reach Pounds 1.25m for 1988 and 1989. Ms Mary Louise Burrows of the action group said that they intended to press for a judgment in the undefended action and then seek damages. Sources close to the insurers said, however, that they intended to claim that the underwriters were not liable for the insurance. If this were to occur it would involve the action group returning to court to get the policy reinstated, which could result in further lengthy litigation. Judgment is imminent on the action bought by the separate Gooda Walker Action Group against the same Gooda Walker managing and members' agents.</p>

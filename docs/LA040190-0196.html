			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COFFIN-BEARERS STAGE DEATH PENALTY PROTEST IN S.F.  </P> <P> "Not in California" proclaimed the signs on 121 cardboard coffins that  stretched a quarter of a mile across the Golden Gate Bridge during a mock  funeral procession Saturday to protest the death penalty.  </P> <P> More than 300 people took part in the three-mile protest march from the San  Francisco side of the bay to Vista Point in Marin County, just a few miles from  the gas chamber at San Quentin prison.  </P> <P> The march initially was scheduled as a protest of Tuesday's planned execution  of Robert Alton Harris, which on Friday was blocked indefinitely by a federal  appeals court judge. March organizers said they were heartened by the stay, but  decided to go ahead with their protest. They noted that the state wants the  U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the stay, perhaps in time to proceed with  Tuesday's execution.  </P> <P> "It's a myth to think that killing anyone will make our nation any safer,"  declared activist entertainer Joan Baez in a brief speech before the protesters  trekked across the bridge in single file. "I'm interested in creating a kinder,  gentler nation."  </P> <P> The 121 coffins, draped in black, symbolized the number of executions in the  nation since a 1976 U.S. Supreme Court decision allowed states to reinstate  capital punishment. Harris would have been the first executed in California in  23 years if the federal judge had not blocked Tuesday's execution.  </P> <P> The orderly march, sponsored by a coalition of religious and civil rights  groups, caused traffic on the bridge to back up for two miles in each direction  as curious motorists paused to watch.  </P> <P> Many of the demonstrators wore black and carried red carnations. Several  carried signs with such messages as "Execute justice, not people" and "Why do  we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?"  </P> <P> Some motorists shouted obscenities in angry disagreement with the marchers.  Others honked approval and flashed "thumbs up" signs of encouragement.  </P> <P> "I'm not excited about carrying a coffin and wearing black," said marcher Signe  Boyer, a Bay Area music teacher. "But I feel strongly. If this is the way to  take a stand against death, I'll do it."  </P> <P> Mac Nishikida, trying out his new fishing pole at the bay' edge Saturday  morning, was among a number of local residents who found themselves in the path  of the protest.  </P> <P> "The protesters are going against the people's choice of California," which  favors the death penalty, he said, folding up his rod. "The vote is in. It's a  problem of a minority trying to take over the overwhelming view of the  majority."  </P></p>

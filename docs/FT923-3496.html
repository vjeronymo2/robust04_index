			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A CLUTCH of favourable corporate results, together with a steadier performance in fixed interest markets, sent stock index futures forward in thin trade, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,342, a 10-point premium to the cash market, and moved ahead, boosted by good results from several of the UK's leading companies. The release of a CBI report showing a decline in high street sales for August led to a mid-morning setback in the contract. This, however, proved to be temporary and the contract was soon in demand again. It traded in a tight range of 2,340 and 2,350 for the next few hours before a bout of profit-taking just before the opening on Wall Street led to a retreat. The firm start in New York, together with the performance in the currency and fixed interest markets, once again helped September regain momentum and it finished at 2,353, up 17 from the previous session and at a 10-point premium to cash. Turnover, at 7,228, was thin. In traded options, volume was poor at 26,423. The FT-SE 100 option was active, trading 10,889 lots. National Power was the busiest stock option, with 4,514 contracts dealt.</p>

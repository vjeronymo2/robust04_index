			<p>BFN     [Text] Mrs. Musuleng-Cooper is to be inducted today as  foreign minister. Mrs. Cooper was yesterday confirmed by the  Transitional Legislative Assembly following confirmation  hearings at the Capitol.    Speaking during the hearing, Mrs. Cooper expressed her  desire  to work closely with all friendly nations for the speedy  restoration of general peace to this country. She said a lot is  required from the outside world for the furtherance of peace and  reconciliation. She stressed the need for proper coordination  and consultation between the transitional government and the  international community and build a vibrant nation through free  and fair democratic elections.    Mrs. Cooper pledged not to disrupt the existing operations  of  the Foreign Ministry but to improve working conditions of the  staff so that we can effectively strengthen the relationship  between Liberia and the world community.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Michel Moutot] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 8 (AFP) -- Western countries  pondering whether to launch air strikes against Bosnia's Serbs  would have trouble taking out all the heavy weaponry around  Sarajevo, a high-ranking UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection  Force] officer said here Tuesday [8 February].    "The moment the first raid takes place, it must be clear  that  the level of engagement for all UN peacekeepers stationed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina will change in nature," the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) officer, who declined to be identified, said.    His comments came on the eve of a meeting in Brussels of  NATO  ambassadors who, barring a veto by pro-Serb Greece, were likely  to authorise use of the alliance's warplanes in a punitive  action following Saturday's massacre in Sarajevo in which 68  people died and about 200 were injured.    The UNPROFOR officer said that for months, some 60 UN  military observers and thousands of pictures taken by NATO  planes have identified the precise position of Serb forces  around the capital.    He said the latest UNPROFOR figures show that the Serbs have  about 300 artillery pieces within range of the capital, meaning  30 kilometres (18 miles), and most of the weapons are stationed  southeast of Sarajevo.    The figure includes cannon, which are in fixed positions,  and  mortars which can be moved around.    The UNPROFOR officer said that even though NATO warplanes  would be able to zero in on all of the big guns stationed around  the Bosnian capital, it would be a different matter in terms of  locating the mortars.    "A mortar consists of a simple tube on a 60-kilogram  (130-pound) metal plate and all you need is two men and a pickup  truck," he said. "And in order to wipe out the mortars you  would need tactical air support which means war, and our current  mandate does not call for such action."    He added that in addition to the mortars, the Serbs  besieging  the city also have multiple rocket launchers that are mobile and  powerful.    In terms of manpower, the Serbs are said to have about  15,000  soldiers stationed around Sarajevo, while the mainly Moslem  Bosnian army has 13,000 troops with access to 150 artillery  pieces.    "Lifting a siege and using only air strikes is possible but  one must destroy everything," the UNPROFOR officer said. "If we  launch air strikes we can't give up afterwards because they will  come back and recapture their positions."    He said such strikes would also mean that the UN mandate in  Bosnia would no longer be to provide humanitarian assistance but  to reestablish peace.    "The politicians must decide what they want," he said,  adding  that the latest threats to bomb the Serbs amounted to a lot of  "gesturing."    He pointed out that similar previous attempts to intimidate  the Serbs were met with threats to retaliate against UN  peacekeepers on the ground and to stop all humanitarian aid.</p>

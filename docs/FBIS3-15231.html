Being aware of the real danger threatening the democratic  freedoms, PPG is forced to become an underground, illegal party,  declared Tausangi. According to him, having the majority in  parliament, the Democratic Agrarian Party and the socialists  will have no more reasons to say they have not enough power to  improve the situation and blame the opposition for all failures.  "We regret much that the socialists are frankly supporting the  anti-people regime of Topal-Kendighelean", Tausangi asserted.</p>

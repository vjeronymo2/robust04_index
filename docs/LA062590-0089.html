			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE DARK BOB ATTEMPTS A CROSSOVER AT HIGHWAYS  </P> <P> Perhaps inside of every performance artist is a closet pop singer. The  temptation to mix body gyrations, flamboyant costumes and raw vocal power  becomes too strong for the extroverted performer who usually does all that  anyway.  </P> <P> So, with his pencil-thin goatee, pointy Captain Kirk sideburns and balding  jet-black hair, performance artist The Dark Bob attempted such a crossover  Thursday night at Highways in Santa Monica. In "Tales From the Dark Bob,"  songs, manic monologues, action painting and a belly dancer combined into an  evening that skidded around themes of absurdity often revealing a bitter core  of political realities.  </P> <P> On hand to accompany him was an ensemble known as The Dark Band -- Paul Brown  on electric bass, Paul Castellanos on violin, James Hoskins on cello, Myrna  Neuberg on percussion, plus a bearded oud-player named Rico and a belly dancer  named Kadi. Playing arrangements that were created mostly by ear, the group  blended rock styles a la Andy Warhol's Velvet Underground with a visceral Arab  pop sound.  </P> <P> The results proved as much a satire on concertizing as a concert itself. The  Dark Bob's sophisticated wit and extended delivery carried the proceedings,  essentially an odd, pan-cultural, stand-up comedy act.  </P> <P> His talent as lyricist dominates less-developed skills. Songs such as "Everyone  Knows" succeed mostly from use of rapid-fire sentences filled with  philosophical bantering, recitations of current events, religious reflections  and proclamations that love is the most profound of all experiences.  </P> <P> Prerecorded, electronically processed monologues were inserted between musical  numbers, as The Dark Bob lip-synced to them. Other highlights included extended  bluesy soloing on the oud by Rico and a transcendental arrangement of the song  "Heroes" by David Bowie and Brian Eno.  </P></p>

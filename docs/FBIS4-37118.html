			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, comrade 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant  secretary general of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, received  Steven Day, chairman of the Council for the Advancement of  Arab-British Understanding [CAABU], now visiting the Syrian Arab  Republic at the invitation of the party's National Command. The  two reviewed CAABU's activities in Britain in relation to Arab  causes. Mr. Day stressed CAABU's support for the Arab demand  that Israeli occupation of Arab territory be removed and  legitimate Arab rights be recognized to promote a comprehensive  and fair peace predicated on international legitimacy and UN  resolutions.    The sides reviewed the state of coordination between CAABU  and political organizations active in Arab states.    Comrade al-Ahmar laid out Arab issues and Israel's  aggressive  and terrorist practices against Arabs in the occupied  territories and the obstacles it places in the path of the peace  process in order to abort it.    Comrade al-Ahmar also reviewed Arab and world developments  and the peace process, which, he emphasized, continues to  flounder thanks to Israel's intransigence. He stressed that  Syria is working for a fair and comprehensive peace settlement  providing for the restitution of occupied territories and Arab  rights.    Comrade al-Ahmar pointed to the role expected of Europe to  make peace a reality.    For his part, Mr. Day paid tribute to the Syrian position on  the peace process, indicating Syria's manifest international  standing. He wished the Syrian people increased advancement and  prosperity.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Forth Ports suffers 11.8% decline to Pounds 9.6m Forth Ports, the Scottish ports operator which was privatised just before the 1992 General Election, saw an 11.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.6m in the year to December 31 1993. Turnover rose from Pounds 32.4m to Pounds 33.1m and operating profit increased by 2 per cent to 10.2m. However, the pre-tax figure did not enjoy the Pounds 1.2m boost it received in 1992 from a gain on early repayment of government loans. The company warned when it presented its interim results last September that the second half would suffer from a reduction in business from British Steel's pipe coating business at Leith. But in the event other port business held up well, said Mr William Thomson, chairman, and the company gained from the unexpected import of large numbers of Ford Mondeo cars. Mr Thomson said there had been an encouraging start to 1994, and Forth Ports was benefiting from a new long-term agreement with BP on piped cargo from the Hound Point terminal, as well as a new 15-year towage contract with Shell for the Braefoot terminal. There was increased container traffic at Grangemouth. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 1.7m at the year end, and gearing dropped from 18 per cent to 4 per cent. During 1993 Forth Ports' joint venture company, Victoria Quay, reached agreement with the Environment Department's Property Holdings to develop a 350,000 sq ft office block for the Scottish Office in Leith. The building has been sold forward for Pounds 47.5m and Forth Ports expects to take the profit from the sale in 1994 and 1995. The company says related property developments are already going ahead as a consequence of the Victoria Quay deal, and expects a 'significant contribution' from Victoria Quay in 1994. Earnings per share were 21.4p (23.8p), or a rise of 22 per cent on 1992's figure of 17.5p, reached after adjusting for the full year's pro forma interest charge and excluding the gain on early repayment of government loans. The shares, which were floated at 110p and reached a high for 1993/94 of 508p, fell 16p yesterday to 489p. A final dividend of 5p is proposed, making 7.25p (6.25p) for the year. Analysts yesterday forecast pre-tax profits for 1994 of between Pounds 12.25m and Pounds 12.5m.</p>

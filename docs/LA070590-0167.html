			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAMSUNG ISN'T CONTENT TO BE A MERE GIANT;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: THE COMPANY IS POURING MORE MONEY INTO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,  WITH AN EYE TO OBTAINING TOP-TIER STATUS WORLDWIDE IN MANY DIVERSIFIED AREAS.  </P> <P> By the 1950s, Lee Byung Chul had become the John D. Rockefeller of South Korea;  his name synonymous with wealth, his business often the object of political  wrath.  </P> <P> What started in 1938 as a fruit and sundries trading firm became Samsung Group,  South Korea's first and biggest conglomerate. Until his death three years ago  at 77, the founder ruled with authoritarian fervor and lived in splendor. At  his estate at Yongin is his former mansion, a larger-than-life statue of Lee,  and the Ho-Am Art Museum, the only private art museum in South Korea. Peacocks  roam the gardens.  </P> <P> The founder's spirit still pervades Samsung. But his designated successor,  third son Lee Kun Hee, is marshaling Samsung's 27 companies and 18 major  affiliates to build what he describes as the company's "second foundation."  </P> <P> The new foundation, says the 48-year-old Samsung chairman, will be an emphasis  on technology, fortified with an aggressive investment program. Samsung has  more than doubled its investment in new facilities in the past three years, and  this year it will spend $4 billion.  </P> <P> Samsung also hopes to emerge from the umbrella of Korean protectionism, which  has sheltered its electronics operations from Japanese competition at home, to  become fully competitive worldwide. Here too, spending and technology are the  keys.  </P> <P> The technological drive comes in many areas: new materials for electronics,  auto parts and aerospace; aircraft production; automotive manufacturing;  consumer electronics, and telecommunications.  </P> <P> Samsung still operates textile plants, department stores and hotels. But its  new strategy is "to enter all aspects of high technology," says Lee Hyung Do,  senior managing director of Samsung General Chemicals Co., the group's newest  entry in the high-tech field,  </P> <P> If Samsung is successful, the impact will be seen not only on the  conglomerate's bottom line but throughout South Korea, where Samsung's sales  amount to 16.5% of the gross national product, and in boardrooms in the United  States and Japan.  </P> <P> The grand ambitions belie the shy nature of the Japanese- and American-educated  chairman, who was designated by his father 16 years before he died to take over  the business. Samsung, the chairman declares, intends to move up from 24th  place on Fortune magazine's list of the world's largest enterprises to the top  10 by the year 2000. In electronics, it intends to move into the top five.  </P> <P> Getting there won't be easy, and it's not hard to find skeptics. "It's nice to  have goals," a representative of one of Japan's largest conglomerates commented  wryly.  </P> <P> But with a corps of executives rated as the best in South Korea, an ability to  digest foreign technology and move on to independent development of new  products and a firm commitment to growth despite meager profits (1.3% of sales  in 1989), Samsung has been known to accomplish what others considered  impossible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Challenges  </P> <P> A decade ago, the Samsung Group was struggling to find a way to produce  microwave ovens. In aviation, it was overhauling engines. Its semiconductor  work consisted of producing the raw material, wafers, and letting others etch  in the technology. Two South Korean rivals had surpassed it in sales, and  another was breathing down its neck.  </P> <P> Today, Samsung, with help from General Electric and J. C. Penney, has become  the world's No. 1 producer of microwave ovens. The company's aerospace unit has  been selected to coordinate the $4.4-billion production of South Korea's next  mainline jet fighter, the McDonnell Douglas FA-18. Its semiconductor operation  ranks seventh in the world in production of memory chips.  </P> <P> And Samsung Group is back atop South Korea's list of the family-run chaebol, or  conglomerates, that dominate the nation's economy -- topping even Hyundai when  Samsung's insurance companies are included. Last year, Samsung's network of  companies and major affiliates racked up $34 billion in sales -- 10 times sales  a decade earlier -- and employed 180,000.  </P> <P> The Samsung Group is made up of private and publicly held entities, but the  founding family exercises absolute control. Shares in 12 Samsung companies  trade in Korea, but as with all Korean firms, foreigners are barred from direct  ownership. If Samsung's ambitious goals are met, by the year 2000 its trading  company alone -- the flagship of the group -- will have 120 subsidiaries and  annual sales of $48 billion.  </P> <P> Still, Samsung's challenges are many -- and they mirror those of its country.  The days when personnel cost less than machine power are gone. With Korean  workers refusing to work more than two hours a day of overtime, 70-hour  workweeks have disappeared. And Samsung executives blame neglect of research  and development for a loss of international competitive standing.  </P> <P> Foreign markets are vital to Samsung, as they are for so many South Korean  companies. Samsung's exports last year totaled $6.4 billion, 32 times what they  were in 1975, when the conglomerate's trading company was established. But this  year the company expects an increase of only 6%, according to Sung Hong Jae,  executive managing director.  </P> <P> So Samsung has set its sights on new markets: Japan, Southeast Asia and --  "like everybody else," as Sung put it -- Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Last year, the conglomerate set up seven branch offices in Eastern Europe, the  Soviet Union, Vietnam and China, and this year it will add four more. Russian  and Chinese language courses have been added to the curriculum at the group's  training institute.  </P> <P> "In the past," Sung said, "we could export in quantity. But now overseas  markets are demanding specialized items in small quantities. For that, we lack  an accumulation of technological expertise. Too little attention was paid to  research and development."  </P> <P> As it seeks to become more efficient and technologically advanced, Samsung has  some advantages. Lim Dong Sung, president of the Samsung Economic Research  Institute, predicts that the conglomerate's fabled success in labor-management  relations will enable it to automate faster than South Korea's other corporate  giants.  </P> <P> Since President Roh Tae Woo promised in 1987 to democratize the country,  Samsung has been the only one of the Big Four Korean conglomerates to avoid  major labor strife, even though Samsung has opposed the formation of labor  unions.  </P> <P> Pay is a factor. The average Samsung laborer -- 30 years old and five years on  the job -- is paid 11.5 million won a year, the equivalent of $16,428. This is  10% more than other conglomerates pay, according to Samsung executives. Samsung  workers also get fringe benefits worth 2.5 million won ($3,577) per worker per  year.  </P> <P> Last year, Samsung raised wages 23.3%, and Lim said this was so generous that  "we were criticized" by other conglomerates. This year, he said, the government  asked Samsung to go first in setting wage levels to ensure that it would not  give bigger raises than its competitors. It approved an 8.9% increase.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Complexes  </P> <P> Having invested in its people, the company is investing to build a  technological future.  </P> <P> Samsung General Chemicals Co. is spending $1.8 billion over three years,  building a complex of 10 plants. Under foreign technological licenses, they  will produce new materials for use in electronics, auto parts and aerospace. A  second group of plants, to cost $2 billion, is planned.  </P> <P> In such fields as construction equipment, "we expect to triple capacity by  1997," said Kim Moo, senior executive managing director of Samsung Shipbuilding  &amp; Heavy Industry.  </P> <P> Production of wristwatches will increase from 2.4 million last year to 20  million in five years, half of which will be exported, according to Kim Young  Woong, executive managing director of Samsung Watches.  </P> <P> A sharp spurt is expected in aerospace, too, as a result of Samsung's  designation as coordinator for the jet fighter project. South Korea will import  12 completed FA-18 Hornets from McDonnell Douglas, assemble 36 others and then  produce 72 units here.  </P> <P> Samsung aerospace brochures declare that the company intends to use the fighter  project to acquire the ability to "design and manufacture our own aircraft."  </P> <P> Last month, Samsung announced plans to enter yet a new field: the automotive  industry.  </P> <P> It said it planned to sign a technological assistance agreement with Nissan  Diesel of Japan to build concrete mixers, dump trucks and other heavy-duty  trucks and would invest nearly $100 million to build a factory capable of  manufacturing 5,000 units a year beginning in 1991. Although the firm said it  has no immediate plans to build passenger cars, the announcement was widely  regarded as heralding Samsung's first step toward that business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firms Protected  </P> <P> Like other conglomerates, Samsung nurtured many of its industries in a  greenhouse of government protection. For example, the import of nearly all  Japanese electronics products is banned, along with watches and cameras.  </P> <P> In the late 1970s, foreign telecommunications equipment makers were told, in  effect, to hand over technology if they wanted to participate in the growth of  Korean industry. They did; now Samsung and other Korean firms export optical  fibers and sophisticated telecommunications equipment.  </P> <P> Still, many of Samsung's products are not competitive internationally. Choe  Dong Soo, senior analyst of the credit rating firm Korea Investors Service,  cites only two exceptions: electronics and semiconductors.  </P> <P> Samsung's new commitment to research and development is designed to rectify  that. Subsidiaries that a few years ago spent only 2% of sales on research are  now devoting as much as 10% to product development.  </P> <P> The chemicals unit has not begun operations yet has set up a research and  development center and hired 400 researchers -- 40 with doctoral degrees -- to  staff it.  </P> <P> Soh Jin Wha, president of the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, said  his unit isn't "doing anything fantastically new," but its people are working  on projects ranging from television to superconductive materials to trajectory  systems for missiles.  </P> <P> As Japanese and American semiconductor makers have discovered from Samsung's  surge, things move quickly in South Korea.  </P> <P> "When Americans talk of the long term," Soh said, "they usually mean 10 years  or more. When they talk of the midterm, they usually mean five or six years.  But to us, the long term is five years. The midterm is three years."  </P> <P> Three years ago, as Samsung began acquiring prominence in the memory chip  field, Texas Instruments sued for infringement of patents. Samsung settled out  of court with a payment of about $8 million, Soh said.  </P> <P> Last year, competition from Samsung forced NEC, the giant Japanese firm, to  lower its prices on 1-megabit dynamic random access memory chips (DRAMS). It  was the first time a Japanese chip maker had reacted to competition from Korea.  </P> <P> The Samsung Group's ability to obtain and effectively use foreign technology  proved particularly crucial in semiconductors. With technology obtained in 1983  from Micron of the United States and Sharp of Japan, Samsung started producing  64-kilobit DRAMs in 1984.  </P> <P> Then, according to Lee Kwan, a former minister of science and technology,  Samsung collaborated with its Korean competitors in a project coordinated by  the government Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute to develop  the 1-megabit DRAM and the 4-megabit DRAM.  </P> <P> Samsung Electronics, which five years ago spent only 2% of its sales on  research and development, now spends 7%, which is higher than Japanese giants  Matsushita, with 5.8%, and Sony, with 5.7%. In absolute terms, however,  Samsung's $500 million for R&amp;D remains dwarfed by Matsushita's $2.3 billion  and Sony's $1.1 billion.  </P> <P> The effort to go high tech also suffers, Soh said, from the Confucian,  authority-centered nature of Korean society and its emphasis on seniority. At  Samsung, he said, "scientists and engineers are still not treated any better  than accountants."  </P> <P> At the twice-a-week meeting of company presidents in Seoul, he said, "there are  no free discussions. Everyone is frozen." He went on: "If no one says anything,  the chairman has to direct a person to speak. Younger people don't freely  express their views."  </P> <P> But Samsung's management is so well organized, he said, that when the group  decides to focus on something it usually catches up quickly with the foreign  competition. Administration, "by dedicated, highly disciplined people . . . is  very strong -- perhaps stronger than in American companies," he said.  </P> <P> "It's almost like Sparta. When a person is given a mission, he will finish it,"  Soh said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bold Strokes  </P> <P> Despite a reputation for caution, bold, expansionist gestures are well within  Samsung's tradition. When Samsung entered the credit card business in 1988, it  became No. 1 in Korea virtually overnight -- by having each of its 180,000  employees persuade at least one friend to apply for a card.  </P> <P> Indeed, the conglomerate established itself as Korea's leading business group  with two audacious, pioneering moves.  </P> <P> In 1953, founder Lee Byung Chul decided to build a sugar refinery, the first  South Korean manufacturing facility to go up after the Korean War. This is  cited at the Samsung Training Center as a key example of "Samsung spirit."  </P> <P> Choi In Il, general manager of Samsung's human resources development center,  said: "Businessmen of the early 1950s were shortsighted people who made easy  money by selling U.S. aid materials. Lee was ridiculed for bothering to  manufacture an item that could easily be obtained through American aid. But by  creating a sugar refinery, the late chairman saved dollars needed for imports  and contributed to the national economy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SAMSUNG GROUP SALES  </P> <P> In Billions of dollars  </P> <P> 1980: $3.708 billion  </P> <P> Samsung's 1990 forecast: $38.571 billion  </P></p>

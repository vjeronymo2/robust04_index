			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Air 2000 to lease four A320s A SECOND UK charter airline has decided to operate Airbus A320 narrow-body airliners, whose sophisticated computerised control systems have recently been under criticism. This followed the crash of a French Air Inter A320 last month near Strasbourg, killing 87 people. Air 2000, the charter airline of the Owners Abroad tour group, said yesterday it would lease four new A320s from ORIX Aviation Systems of Dublin. The aircraft will be powered by V2500 engines built by the IAE consortium which includes Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US, and MTU of Germany. The first two aircraft will be delivered to Air 2000 for use this summer. Meanwhile London City Airport received a boost yesterday with the announcement that CityAir Scandinavia, a new Swedish airline, plans to introduce daily services using British Aerospace 146 jets between Stockholm and London. Crossair, the regional carrier which is 51 per cent owned by Swissair, has already announced daily services between Zurich and London City using BAe 146s. Ryanair, the independent Irish carrier, is expanding its flights from London Stansted to Ireland with a daily service to Shannon from April 10. The route is already operated by Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier.</p>

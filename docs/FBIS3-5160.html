			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Khieu Rada, under secretary of state for trade,  said that after the United States opened its door to Cambodia as  one of the Most Favored Nations (MFN) early last month, many  foreign investors have expressed interest in doing business in  this country. Among them are some Hong Kong Chinese who have  contacted us and said they wanted to set up garment factories  for export. Their main market, of course, will be the lucrative  and low-tax United States.    The under secretary of state went on: When the Hong Kong  investors came to meet us, we were always glad to welcome them.  The under secretary of state said that we need both local and  foreign investors for Cambodia. We advised them to get ready to  invest in the garment industry and we told them to make advance  arrangements with American trading counterparts pending the  signature of the agreement between the Cambodian and American  sides, which will take place in the next two to three months.    The Hong Kong Chinese are not the only ones to have  expressed  the desire to invest in the garment sector. Investors from the  PRC and from other countries also have expressed interest. Each  garment factory, according to the investors, would require a  large labor force numbering in the hundreds or thousands. So,  it would help absorb the now mostly idle excess state-employed  personnel, as well as provide employment for the general public.    The under secretary of state emphatically rejected remarks  made by some administration officials who mistakenly feared  economic colonization of our country by the United States  following Cambodia's introduction into the Generalized System of  Preference (GSP) and its acquisition of MFN status. He pointed  out that in granting GSP and MFN recognition to economically  weaker nations like Cambodia, the larger and stronger countries  are the ones who assist the former by making many concessions to  them, while the smaller and weaker countries will not be  expected to return any favors.    In Cambodia's case, the United States will impose the lowest  taxes on more than 4,000 types of products that could be  imported from our country. As for goods from the United States,  our government will be asked to levy taxes equal to but not  higher than those imposed on goods imported from other  countries, such as Japan or Singapore.

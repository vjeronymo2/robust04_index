			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / DTI was asked to probe Alpine THE Department of Trade and Industry was asked in February to launch an inquiry into events at Alpine (Double Glazing), which ceased trading earlier this week. A solicitor's letter written on February 12 on behalf of some franchisees and former employees called on the DTI to investigate the activities and administration of Alpine. This was almost a year after Alpine was purchased out of administration by a group of investors backed by Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur. Mr Smith, who has a number of off-shore trusts, has been connected to several natural resource companies, two of which are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. The solicitors told the DTI in February their investigations had 'caused considerable concern about the financial stability of Alpine'. They drew attention to questions over the alleged transfer of monies. They also queried pension payments deducted from salaries, since Alpine did not have an approved pension scheme. Furthermore, the letter states, one former employee represented by the solicitor had access to bank statements which he claims show that over Pounds 600,000 was transferred out of Alpine following its purchase. It also emerged yesterday that a creditor owed Pounds 30,000 had lodged a petition to wind up Alpine, due to be heard on June 16. However, Alpine's directors recently instructed an insolvency practitioner to call a creditors meeting to vote on liquidation the day before that petition is heard.</p>

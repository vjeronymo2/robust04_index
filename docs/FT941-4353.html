			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / ABB takes Dollars 596m charge to restructure Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, yesterday announced a 7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits after financial items to Dollars 1.19bn (Pounds 793m) for 1993, on turnover 4 per cent higher at Dollars 28.3bn. The improvement was better than expected, but comes before a net non-recurring charge of Dollars 596m, mainly for restructuring in the second half of the year. This left net profits at Dollars 68m, down from Dollars 505m. Mr Percy Barnevik, president and chief executive, said that after a period of consolidation, 'the key message to our managers is to go for growth'. Mr Barnevik said profits in dollar terms reflected a year of turbulence in currency markets. Expressed in local currencies, profits rose an average 25 per cent, despite a recessionary environment. Productivity increased by an average 6 per cent and net cash improved by about Dollars 250m, mainly because of a reduction in stocks. ABB's operating margin rose from 6.1 per cent to 7.7 per cent. Research and development spending, at Dollars 2.27bn last year, was some 20-25 per cent higher than in 1990. The best performer continued to be power plants, where operating earnings rose 66 per cent to Dollars 739m. Profits fell from Dollars 642m to Dollars 520m in power transmission and distribution because of poor demand while industrial and building systems lifted profits from Dollars 606m to Dollars 649m. The restructured transportation division bounced back to profits of Dollars 84m from a Dollars 40m loss.</p>

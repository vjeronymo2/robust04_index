This is noted in a statement from the committee made  public by its chairman Konstantin Zatulin at a news conference  in Moscow.    The document notes: There are no grounds to trust the  capability of the Georgian side to guarantee that the weapons  will be handled carefully or that the treaty's stipulation on  not transferring them to third parties will be strictly  fulfilled.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PURSUING SUCCESS;  </P> <P> LAWYER LAUNCHES NEW BOARD GAME BASED ON QUOTES  </P> <P> Whoever first said, "Take a good idea and run with it," must have had George  Chanos in mind.  </P> <P> The San Diego lawyer took a leave of absence from his law firm this year to  promote Notable Quotables, a game he invented that is selling well in San Diego  stores amid a spattering of media attention.  </P> <P> "It's being heralded as the next Trivial Pursuit," the enthusiastic 32-year-old  said.  </P> <P> The game hit store shelves Nov. 29, just in time for Christmas shoppers.  Nordstrom and local game stores are reporting strong sales, with Notable  Quotables rivaling Trivial Pursuit, Scattergories and Taboo in quantities sold,  games licensed by giants in the hard-to-enter toy industry with a lot of  advertising dollars behind them.  </P> <P> "You would expect them to be blowing us out of the water," Chanos said.  </P> <P> Chanos has sold 4,489 copies of the game to date, and is confident he will sell  511 more, or the rest of the games manufactured, by January. He said he has  already met with Parker Brothers and other game companies to discuss a possible  licensing agreement and is anxiously waiting to introduce the game to the  nation at the New York Toy Fair in February.  </P> <P> Notable Quotables challenges players to match provocative quotations with the  famous people who uttered them. Less celebrity-conscious players can opt to  fill in a missing word from a quote rather than guess who said it. Answers are  provided in a  </P> <P> multiple-choice format, so "you always have something to say and you have a  33.3% chance of being right," Chanos said.  </P> <P> There are quotes from Madonna and Charles Manson, from Albert Einstein and  Leona Helmsley. Chanos' criteria were that the quotes be funny, profound or  risque.  </P> <P> "The game mirrors society," he said. "It's the news over the past five years  condensed in a box."  </P> <P> But getting the game off the drawing board and into the stores took five years  of almost obsessive dedication, during which Chanos used his business savvy and  magnetic personality to sell the idea to everyone from investors to  manufacturers to the lawyers he worked for.  </P> <P>  "I began the revolution with 82 men. It does not matter how small you are if  you have faith and a plan of action."-Fidel Castro  </P> <P> Chanos first started collecting quotes while attending law school at the  University of San Diego. He originally planned to publish a book of quotes, but  during his last year of law school, in 1984, he came across a magazine article  about Trivial Pursuit, which posted $750 million in sales just one year after  being introduced.  </P> <P> "That's a huge, huge amount of money," he said. "You could buy all of Eastern  Airlines for $500 million."  </P> <P> The article detailed how the inventors of Trivial Pursuit struggled to get  people to notice them, persevered and eventually became millionaires.  </P> <P> Chanos understood how difficult it is to introduce a new game in the toy  industry, where thousands of new games are invented each year, some by large  companies and some by individuals like Chanos, only to never be heard of again.  </P> <P> But he strongly believed in his idea, and decided to minimize his risk by  researching the game industry, studying why some games fail while others  succeed. He met with successful game inventors and traveled to the New York Toy  Fair.  </P> <P> He started a habit he maintains to this day of reading through a hundred  publications each week, most of which are unsold throwaways he gets from a  distributor. Five hundred magazines translates to about 50 quotes he feels are  appropriate for his game.  </P> <P>  "If I would believe what I read about myself, I would hate my guts, too."-Zsa  Zsa Gabor  </P> <P> In 1989, Chanos developed a prototype version of the game, bartering work from  designers in exchange for shares in a small company he created called  GameMakers Ltd., which owns the rights to the game.  </P> <P> During this time, he became a successful lawyer practicing business litigation  and transactional work for San Diego's Lorenz Alhadeff Lundin &amp; Oggel. But,  during his third year there, he decided to step off the partnership track and  work on Notable Quotables full time.  </P> <P> The law firm was sold on the idea also, offering Chanos a job if things didn't  work out, and drawing up an investment package in exchange for a stake in  GameMakers.  </P> <P> By 1990, Chanos had raised $400,000 from investors, who included fellow  lawyers, former clients, Alex Spanos, the owner of the San Diego Chargers, Mary  Papas, the owner of Athens Market, and others.  </P> <P> Many were won over more by Chanos than his idea.  </P> <P> "I invested in the person," said Donald Cohn, president of DataQuick, a San  Diego-based on-line information service. "I invested in George."  </P> <P> Cohn said he usually goes for more traditional investments, but was so  impressed with Chanos' thoroughness, which included market studies, that he  simply felt it was a worth the risk.  </P> <P>  "After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The  game is what counts."-Aristotle Onassis  </P> <P> The stores Chanos approached with his game are also glad they decided to  believe in him.  </P> <P> "It's done better than I had anticipated," said David Lyon, a buyer for the  four Nordstrom department stores in San Diego County. Lyon said he looks for a  unique game each holiday season for the men's department, and this year he  chose Notable Quotables.  </P> <P> Sales of the game, which retails for $39.95, accounted for a major percentage  of total sales for the department, especially on weekends when Chanos  demonstrates the game to passing customers, Lyon said.  </P> <P> "I don't have another single item, except socks and belts, that sells more than  this," he said.  </P> <P> Chanos believes the game is popular because people are fascinated by the famous  and what they have to say.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people in the country that like quotations," he said.  </P> <P> "Also, the timing is perfect. People played Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary.  They got used to a big new game every three to four years. I think people are  waiting for this."  </P> <P> And what is Chanos' favorite quote?  </P> <P> "Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever hope to achieve greatly." Robert  F. Kennedy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Famous Faces, Revealing Quotes  </P> <P> Are you up on the speak-styles of the rich and famous? Try your hand at the  following questions and see:  </P> <P> 1.

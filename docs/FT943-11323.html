			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: New Issues Pillar Property Investments is coming to the market valued at Pounds 169.7m. Set up by British Aerospace and financial backers as a vulture fund to prey on quality properties in 1991, it has Raymond Mould and Patrick Vaughan as chairman and chief executive respectively. Mould and Vaughan know about timing - they sold Arlington Securities, the property company they founded, to BAe for Pounds 278m in 1989. It was this expertise which led them to take the helm at Pillar. A total of 60m shares at 150p have been placed with institutions, with 15m subject to clawback for the public offer. This represents only a 5 per cent discount to the group's net asset value. The price is full, reflecting the quality of Pillar's Pounds 352m portfolio. Applications must be in by August 5 and dealing will begin on August 15. BZW underwrote the offer.</p>

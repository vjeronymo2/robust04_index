			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Have skills, will travel, if the price is right - Jurek Martin in New York casts an eye over some of the tournament's 'mercenaries' The identity of the first sporting mercenary may be debated. One may have been mentioned by Virgil but, sadly, handy copies of the Aeneid are not normally available in New York hotel rooms. Yet the sporting mercenary has certainly been a phenomenon this century. Jim Thorpe, the great American-Indian athlete, would play for pay (he had hardly any choice, given the discrimination against him). English cricket saw the likes of Learie Constantine from the West Indies before Brian Lara's father was born. The great Real Madrid soccer team of the 1950s was made by Puskas of Hungary and di Stefano of Argentina. There used to be powerful opposition to importing talent. Yorkshire County Cricket Club only recently crumbled to allow those not born in the county to perform, while limits on the number of foreign players are still commonplace across sports, and only, perhaps, most prevalent in Japan. Baseball even used to have a legal foundation for restricting the trade in players. Until the reserve clause binding a player to a club was declared illegal in the 1970s, transfers could only be effected by the club. All that has now changed, and this World Cup has brought home that soccer players are just actors on a world stage, free to find the best-paying repertory company around. Even the insular British have become accustomed to this, which says something given the hostility barely 30 years ago to the idea that John Charles and Denis Law would go off and play in Italy. (I bumped into Law on a slow train to Manchester a few years back; he said it was the best thing he ever did). Now the English fan may enjoy vicarious pleasure, or the reverse, from the performance here of Russian and Norwegian goalkeepers (Chelsea and Spurs), a Bulgarian mid-fielder (Ipswich), just about every member of the 22-strong Irish squad, and doubtless a few more besides. In fact, the only teams here whose whole squad only performs at home were Greece, for reasons which became apparent after watching the Greeks play; South Korea, which is a long way away; and Saudi Arabia, which has only recently started taking soccer seriously. But there are three or four Saudis now with real market value. African players have already begun to explore Europe and elsewhere - for the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon it may have been the only way to get paid. Rashidi Yekini, the Nigerian striker, is one who plies his wares overseas. When Spain played Italy last weekend, 16 of the 22 on the pitch as the match began had appeared in the AC Milan-Barcelona European Cup final earlier this spring. And that could not include Stoichkov, the Bulgarian wizard, who plays for the Spanish team. If Ireland are the ultimate mercenary side, with none of their squad currently playing in the Irish leagues, Bulgaria lead the semi-final pack, with two-thirds of their 22-member squad, and almost all their starters, having present or past experience in other European leagues. Romario and Bebeto of Brazil play in Spain and Portugal, as do several team-mates; there are Swedes all over the place; and if most of the Italians stay at home they have the compensation of performing in the most cosmopolitan league of the lot. This familiarity may breed personal contempt, but it also generates knowledge of the opposition, almost regardless of what national colours they are playing under. The capacity now for any side to arrive at the World Cup virtually unknown is much reduced. This seems to have been Bulgaria's particular ace-in-the-hole. Lechkov, whose goal dethroned Germany, may be the only Bulgarian at present playing in the Bundesliga (for Hamburg), but the likes of Stoichkov (Barcelona), Kostadinov (FC Porto) and Balakov (Sporting Lisbon) have been knocking the ball around against Germans at the best club level for years. At the very least, this made them unafraid. At most, it may have made them confident. Letchkov owned up after the match that he had advised his coach beforehand that Thomas Hassler was the German to watch. Hassler happens to play in Rome, which either does or does not prove the point, but he did play well, as the Bulgarian predicted. Ironically, Lechkov out-jumped the smaller Hassler to score his winning goal (and the FT apologises for fingering Kohler as the guilty party, but it was at the other end of the stadium, and delerious Bulgarian journalists - Sid and Doris Bonkov - were throwing their soft drinks, hats and programmes at the TV replay screens). It may not always work. No-one has yet figured out a way to stop Romario and Bebeto, their European familiarity notwithstanding. Nor has it proved possible entirely to neutralise the Baggios for a full game, though both have disappeared from action for long stretches at a time. Of course, mercenaries do not always win battles, and even the French Foreign Legion's batting average is less than perfect. But it did not qualify for this World Cup either.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by APS: "`Good Prospects' for Cooperation With </F> Japan"]    [Text] Economic relations between Algeria and Japan are  destined to "grow stronger" and "expand" following the visit to  Tokyo last week of Algeria's economic affairs minister, Mr.  Mourad Benachenhou, sources close to the ministry said yesterday.    "There are good prospects for strengthening and increasing  the volume of trade between Algeria and Japan," sources said,  adding that the Japanese side "reacted favorably and  sympathetically to Algeria's commitment" to move toward a market  economy.    The purpose of Mr. Benachenhou's visit was to "inform  top-level Japanese officials of the substance of the new  economic policy decided by the Algerian Government as part of  the transition to a market economy," said ministry sources,  without divulging more specifics.    The minister held talks "in an atmosphere of frankness and  professionalism" with the Japanese minister for industry and  international commerce, the deputy foreign affairs minister for  international economic relations, the directors general of  Eximbank [Export-Import Bank] and the Overseas Economic  Cooperation Fund, the vice president of Keidanren (employers'  association), and other Japanese economic leaders.    Additional meetings were planned by the two sides and should  take place "in the near future," sources added.    Japan, which after France is Algeria's biggest creditor, has  made commitments to participate in diverse investment projects  in Algeria, including the vast program to renovate Algeria's  natural gas facilities, to the tune of credits totaling close to  $1.5 billion, it was noted.    Algeria is preparing to conclude a temporary "standby"  agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to be  followed by a three-year "expanded adjustment accord" to support  an easing of the debt service burden, which at its current level  of $9 billion will consume more than 97 percent of hydrocarbon  exchange earnings this year.    Admitting for the first time that Algeria could no longer  meet its essential needs without a reduction in payments on its  external debt, which now totals close to $26 billion,  authorities last December asked for a "multilateral debt  restructuring" without the strict conditionality that generally  accompanies conventional reschedulings.    The standby accord must be accompanied by  balance-of-payments  support financing on the order of several hundred millions of  dollars, said IMF director-general Michel Camdessus on 25  February, at the conclusion of a 24-hour visit to Algeria.    The accord should also facilitate unblocking remaining  tranches of certain multilateral lines of credit, including 1992  European Community credit lines totaling 400 million ECU  [European currency units] (about $500 million).    During the negotiations that began last September between  the  IMF and Algerian authorities, the latter announced they had  appealed to the Group of Seven (G-7)--the seven major industrial  nations, including Japan--to support their request for special  treatment in view of Algeria's severe economic, political, and  social problems.    Following the example of France, which Mr. Benachenhou  visited before Tokyo, the principal partners responded favorably  to that request with statements of good intentions--but they  conditioned any concrete support to conclusion of an accord  between Algeria and the IMF.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by Antoine Kustantin from Beirut] </F>   [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] This morning, through Radio  Monte Carlo, Lebanese Information Minister Michel Samahah denied  yesterday's AL-NAHAR report on the restrictions the minister has  communicated to the owners of the media organs, including a ban  on commenting on economic and sports news. Minister Samahah  said:    [Begin recording] [Samahah] First of all, I would like to  say that I do not like posturing. While the meeting with the  officials in charge of media organs was under way, I had hoped  that the source of this report would reveal its identity and say  what it had to say at the meeting and not outside it. The  meeting was held in a normal manner at the request of some  representatives of media organs. The atmopshere was very calm,  very responsible, and nothing of what one local paper has  reported took place. The presence of his excellency the  director of the Public Security Department was natural because  in the Press and Publications Law, which is currently in force  in Lebanon, the prerogatives of the Public Security Department  concerning political censorship are very clear. I wanted his  excellency the director general to attend this meeting with the  media officials to prevent any future clamor on the contents of  the cabinet's decision. The meeting was normal, and the media  officials who attended showed a sense of responsibility. I  thank them for their cooperation during and after the meeting.    [Kustantin] Your Excellency, it has been said that some  questions were raised about broadcasting Friday sermons and  Sunday sermons, and that some Friday sermons have disturbed you?    [Samahah] There was no anxiety. There was only complete  understanding. The banning of broadcasting Friday sermons or  those delivered during Sunday masses has not been discussed at  all. What is usually said in these sermons deals with religious  topics and has nothing to do with politics. Therefore, there is  absolutely no need for interpretation on this topic.    [Kustantin] Your Excellency, two points still need to be  clarified. The first deals with one of the radio stations which  you were reportedly asked to ban because it transmits from  outside Lebanon. Is this true?    [Samahah] There is some ambiguity concerning a specific  radio station which transmits from outside Lebanon, and has...    [Kustantin, interrupting] An intermediary office, station in  Lebanon?    [Samahah] An intermediary station in Lebanon. This issue is  being tackled, and I do not want to discuss it now. We want to  tackle all issues in a calm manner.    [Kustantin] Your Excellency, one last point. It has been  mentioned that the owners of the media organs have asked you to  submit a list of what is prohibited and what is allowed and you  promised to present it at the next meeting, on Wednesday?    [Samahah] I reached an understanding with them. I do not  believe that among us, we need to set lists and limits which can  be harsh. We agreed on a group of things which have a direct  bearing on the implementation of the cabinet's decision. They  abide by this and implement them in a responsible manner. We  agreed to hold periodic meetings to discuss in detail everything  to do with the implementation of the decision and the law on  visual and audio media.    [Kustantin] Your Excellency, thank you.

Brittan went on to add how he, personally, was greatly in  favor of the proposal which had been jointly presented to the  European Union [EU] by Andreatta and British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd.    In a meeting with the press, Brittan went on to say how he  was "very impressed by the determination with which the Italian  government has moved forward with political and economic  reforms" adding how Rome's action has been "important for all of  Europe."    According to the EU executive commissioner, it is also  essential that "Italy be a founding partner in monetary union as  it was for the birth of the European Union."    For his part, Foreign Minister Andreatta told the press how  he and Brittan had spoken "in a very explicit way" about their  expectations for this year which will see, among other things,  the end of Jacques Delors' term as President of the European  Commission. "I pointed out," Andreatta said, "how it will be the  next Italian government which will adopt a position on these  arguments... I also urged that he take part in the debate on  these problems during the European election campaign, in order  to clarify certain points which have made our public opinion  somewhat suspicious in his regards."    Brittan, in fact, in recent months took very defined  positions in European matters which raised strong opinions in  Italy, in particular regarding the steel industry and state aid  to industry.    Italian Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi this evening also had  "long and cordial" talks with European Commission Vice-President  Sir Leon Brittan on the GATT trade accord, the prospects for  boosting world trade, and reinforcing European Union monetary  and economic integration while making sure that "national public  opinion and productive sectors" share the EU governments' aims,  the premier's office reported.    Brittan shared Ciampi's concerns in these areas and stressed  their importance for EU enlargement and trade competitiveness,  the premier's office communique said.</p>

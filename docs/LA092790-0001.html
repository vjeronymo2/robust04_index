			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> Raymond Chandler's "Farewell My Lovely," set in the free-wheeling era of the  1930s when gambling ships were anchored off Santa Monica, refers to that town  as Bay City. "The name's like a song," detective Philip Marlowe cracks. "A song  in a dirty bathtub."  </P> <P> In more recent years, critics of the town's liberal government nicknamed it the  People's Republic of Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Now comes a complimentary appellation from Sunset magazine. Taking note of the  Republic's growing number of galleries and public sculptures, Sunset has  rechristened it Art City in its September issue.  </P> <P> Fine, we'll go along with that. We get a thrill just driving under "The Big  Wave," the zig-zag span across Wilshire Boulevard.  </P> <P> But the article also cites Jonathan Borofsky's "Ballerina Clown," a 30-foot  bearded character in a tutu on Main Street.  </P> <P> Actually, the clown's at an entrance to a restaurant in Venice. Where else  would you expect to find a bearded clown in a tutu?  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joy Picus opened up the birthday present that her son mailed from  Houston and found a subscription to . . . Garbage.  </P> <P> It's a magazine that bills itself as "The Practical Journal for the  Environment."  </P> <P> "My son's a real environmentalist," Picus explained.  </P> <P> She added: "And I'm not an easy person to buy a gift for."  </P> <P> It was not the usual catch for L.A. County Animal Control.  </P> <P> "I had to ask our people what it was," said spokeswoman Kay Michaelson. "It  looked like a mini-anteater."  </P> <P> The creature brought in by officers turned out to be a coati-mundi, a  ring-tailed, long-nosed critter that lives in South and Central America.  </P> <P> "Apparently it had been given to a resident in East L.A. as a gift," Michaelson  said. "Some of his neighbors were concerned. Actually, it was very tame. It  even had a little collar with a bell. But the owner needed a special permit so  he just gave it to us."  </P> <P> The coati-mundi was turned over to a wild-animal facility Wednesday. It was  that or turn it over to UC Irvine as a mascot for its athletic teams, the  Anteaters.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who has asked the Coliseum Commission to ban the  sale of beer at Raiders games, told KABC's Michael Jackson that the stands have  become so rowdy that "a lot of people bring binoculars to the games -- not so  they can see the game better, but so they can see the fights better."  </P> <P> If you're running late for an appointment these days, the trendy move is to  call ahead on your car phone.  </P> <P> Insurance broker Edward Inouye recalls that in the late 1930s his father had a  different method.  </P> <P> "We lived in Rosemead, which was a rural community," said Inouye. "It was  impossible to get phone service out there.  </P> <P> "My father worked downtown (in L.A.) -- he taught in a Japanese language  school. He had trained about 48 pigeons, and he'd take one with him. If he was  going to have to work late, he'd go out to the corner of 1st and San Pedro  streets and turn the pigeon free to fly home to my mother."  </P> <P> Only one of the air-mail carriers failed to deliver, Inouye said. "And, believe  it not, he showed up at our house six months later," he added. "He probably had  a little romance in between."  </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> When 56,000-seat Dodger Stadium opened in 1962, it contained two drinking  fountains -- one in each team's dugout. More were installed elsewhere after  thirsty fans complained.  </P></p>

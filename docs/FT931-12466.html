			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Leading Article: New Mercedes AFTER TWO years of post-unity boom, the German motor industry is imbibing a high-octane dose of reality. Since the German economic downturn became evident last summer, the main German producers have been accelerating announcements of labour and output cuts. Volkswagen's new chairman estimates production costs exceed Japanese manufacturers' by 30 per cent. VW has yet to deliver a proper response. By contrast, Mercedes-Benz has unveiled a strategy to meet what may be the most wide-ranging challenges in the company's history. The motor subsidiary of Daimler-Benz is putting forward a plan with consequences and implications for the whole of German industry. It is broadening its product range, moving into the city car and 'multi-purpose vehicle' segments, pruning management, transferring assembly to Spain, South Korea and Mexico, and searching for international partners, especially in components. Mercedes' problems partly mirror those of German manufacturing in general. High labour charges, relatively short working hours and the rise in the D-Mark will lead to a deterioration in the company's costs of 15 to 20 per cent this year vis-a-vis several European countries. Competitive disadvantage is doubly hurtful during recession; German car sales may fall 15 per cent in 1993. Mercedes has to tackle weak points embedded in the company's culture. It is paying the price for failure to heed shifting international patterns of supply and demand. Japanese luxury car makers have undermined its presence in the US. Customers are turning away from status symbols in search of vehicles offering greater practicality and value for money. Preoccupation with quality is laudable, but the 'Mercedes-knows-best' mentality has sometimes insulated the company from the marketplace. Recognising this, Mr Helmut Werner, Mercedes' chief executive-designate, has condemned the company's tendency to 'over-engineer' products. Following a line taken by Chrysler in the US, Mercedes wants to move to 'target pricing'. Its engineers will no longer be driven by dreams of creating the 'ultimate' car - but by what customers want to pay. Mercedes' step down from hauteur into a wider market is not risk-free. It must cut costs, but not technical excellence. It must shed staff when Germany's traditional consensus with labour has grown brittle. Daimler's motor operations must achieve a virtual corporate revolution at a time when the company's overall diversification strategy faces difficulties. Backed by its dominant shareholder, the Deutsche Bank, Daimler-Benz undoubtedly has the long-term financial muscle to see the changes through. If the plan succeeds, Mercedes could offer a blueprint of how Germany's top companies will look after the year 2000. Mercedes will be leaner, fitter, more flexible and customer-orientated. And its manufacturing will be a lot less concentrated in Germany.</p>

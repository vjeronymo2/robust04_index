			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Dollar under strain THE DOLLAR could set a new record low against the D-Mark this week after the release of last Friday's employment report for August, writes James Blitz. The plunge in the US non-farm payrolls by 83,000 seriously undermined investors' confidence in the American economy, and is certain to hang over the market for the next few trading days. The cut in the US fed funds rate on Friday, by 0.25 percentage points to 3 per cent, is also certain to intensify speculation of more cuts in US interest rates. This will widen the differential between US and German rates which is driving the D-Mark upwards and the dollar downwards. The question on investors' minds is whether a further decline in the dollar will trigger new tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism. Sterling's problems appeared to have eased after the UK government announced its ingenious plan to borrow Pounds 7.27bn in D-Marks from the banking system, and buy the pound with them. According to Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, sterling's fate appears to be inextricably interconnected with the dollar's, whatever support scheme the UK authorities may come up with. Both currencies rose and fell in tandem last week and may do so again. The sum of money that the UK Treasury is borrowing may seem small as trading picks up after the summer. Last month, Britain's underlying gold and currency reserves fell by Pounds 639m, reflecting heavy intervention by the Bank. But this money was used in the tranquil conditions prevailing in August. As trading goes into full swing, the Bank may pay heavily to support the currency.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / No satisfaction for Little Rockologists: The transition-watchers forced to speculate on White House appointments ALREADY President-elect Bill Clinton has kept a promise. Soon after winning the election a month ago he said he would not announce any appointments to his government before December, and he has not. But December has now dawned and speculation over who gets what is starting to mount. It remains mostly speculation, because this is proving a phenomenally discreet transition operation, intent on avoiding, at all costs, some of the public tensions that have afflicted earlier interregna. Clusters of advisers have set up shop in Washington to investigate various aspects of policy, but the decision-making circle on appointments is in Little Rock and is tight - with Mr Clinton himself, his wife Hillary, Vernon Jordan and Warren Christopher, the twin transition directors, forming its core. All visitors to the Arkansas capital have been carefully noted by a press corps looking for any straw in the wind. Newspapers, magazines and news letters print lists of virtually everybody who has been mentioned anywhere for anything. And there has already been a certain amount of semi-public competition for specific positions. The Wall Street Journal, for example, this week reported on a bitter subcutaneous battle, especially rife in the semi-conductor industry, over the respective merits of two leading candidates for the job of trade representative - Ms Paula Stern and Mr Alan Wolff. Both are acknowledged trade experts but Ms Stern, it has been noted with many nudges and winks, has tended more to represent foreign interests and Mr Wolff domestic concerns in their private consulting practices. In a somewhat different vein, the New Republic magazine began what it called 'a series of brief assessments of people we believe Clinton should not appoint to his administration' with a hatchet job on Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana, a possible secretary of state. Mr Hamilton, the magazine said in an article that was the pure grinding of the Washington insider wheel, was afflicted with 'innate caution' (he believed Lt Col Oliver North was telling the truth) and 'a status quoism not unlike George Bush's'. There is also a fair amount of political game-playing afoot, as in this week's hot rumour that Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the senate finance committee, will become treasury secretary. This seems to fly in the face of previous wisdom, which had it that Mr Bentsen and Mr Clinton  -both, by Democratic standards, fiscal conservatives - might prefer Mr Bentsen not to leave the committee chairmanship, where the next in line is the less predictable, but always provocative, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. But the Texas newspapers have been awash with stories of a Bentsen move. Behind some of them may be seen the discreet hand of Mr Henry Cisneros, the former mayor of San Antonio, himself a candidate for the Clinton cabinet (transportation is most often mentioned) but possibly more interested in Mr Bentsen's Senate seat if it is vacated early. The dilemma for all prospective candidates is the extent to which they can be seen to be pushing for a particular position. As one former member of the Clinton campaign who has done some transition work put it, 'not campaigning for the job means you won't get it', and, 'like a first at Oxford or Cambridge, you've got to do a bit of work but not be seen to do too much'. A fairly typical public performance this week was that of Mr John Young, former chairman of Hewlett Packard and on many lists as a possible secretary of commerce. He drew a decent crowd to a Washington breakfast but ducked all questions about the future, preferring the safer option of talking only about the need for greater US competitiveness. Even political figures more accustomed to the limelight than Mr Young have been hiding behind bushels. Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, for instance, is now quoted at much shorter odds for the State Department than for the Treasury, in which he was once thought to have interest. There have been reports that he was sounded out by Little Rock before the Thanksgiving holiday last week about the foreign policy position but he has been far too discreet to comment at all, perhaps because he, too, was an Oxford man. The disposition of Mr Christopher, deputy to Mr Cyrus Vance in President Jimmy Carter's State Department, still seems to be central to Mr Clinton's planning. There remains an unsubstantiated assumption that he will get one of three critical jobs - secretary of state, attorney general or White House chief of staff. Once he is placed, or not, other appointments may follow more easily. Mr Tim Wirth, the outgoing senator from Colorado who was among those known to have conferred in person with Mr Clinton last week, is another given a serious shot at one of three cabinet positions - energy, interior, or the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr Bruce Babbitt, the engaging former governor of Arizona and occasional intimate of the president-elect, is also frequently mentioned as a candidate for one of these slots. Washington is likely to see Mr Clinton again next week and he might come with a few envelopes in his pocket. It is, after all, that time of year.</p>

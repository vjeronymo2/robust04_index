			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Perica Vucinic: "About a Resettlement Under His </F> Picture"]    [Text] Because of its undoubted historical and spiritual  importance as the "cradle of the Serbs," Kosovo is not used  today to rock anyone to sleep. It is a nightmare for the Serbs  who have bound up their destiny with it, a "lost land" for those  who are packing up, an excellent field to start up yet another  socioeconomic game of chance and to score a few political points  for those who have already ensconced themselves in central  Serbia.    The same picture as six or seven years ago emerged the other  day. In the village Milosevo, at the 10th kilometer of the  Pristina-Kosovska Mitrovica highway, some 20 signs offer some 20  houses for sale. "I am selling my house because of the slowness  of the state in solving the Kosovo problem," says the sign in  front of Vukasin Dutina's house. What it says is that he is  "completely fed up." After "everything else" came land  consolidation. Land was taken away from Dutina and his neighbors  30 years ago. Following the socialist collectivist  transformations, frequent sale or letting someone else cultivate  the land, people lose track of the parcels. The parcel  "returned" to Nikola Grbic is listed under two different names  by its number in the land records and its number in the opstina  archives. He knows that Ismailj Jakupi is now cultivating the  field beside the house which 30 years ago the state turned over  to the agroindustrial combine Kosovo-Eksport. Jakupi has said  that he will give up the land to him, but only when the state  returns land to him, which, it seems, is fine with Grbic. He is  waiting for the state to do its job, but he "really" is going to  go.    "Land taken away has frequently been turned over to  Albanians," says Milan Hrkalovic. He took possession of the  parcel returned by force. Dutina is unable to make a deal with  his Albanian neighbor, who has plowed over the path and the  boundaries. He is waiting for the intervention of the  law-governed state, which is slow. And along with everything  else, the inevitable story about land consolidation is being  repeated with talk about inappropriate replacement of the  quality of the land, if one is to believe Hrkalovic, in which  the best pieces of land somehow always go to people who have  some position or hold some office.    When Albanians are involved in the episodes, the whole story  inevitably takes on the Kosovo ethnic mutation, to such an  extent that an ordinary man concludes that "this is intolerable."  <H5>  Serbian Walls </H5>   The land consolidation, say the inhabitants of a village  with  250 houses, 90 of them Serbian and 160 Albanian, has been  satisfactory to only two people. They received parcels alongside  the mosque, so that they will be able to get big money from the  Albanians. Grbic says that the price of land is dropping  dramatically and that five years ago he was getting money which  he will never be able to get again. Quite often the signs which  say that a house is for sale protrude over the high walls that  surround them. Until recently, the walls were the way to  recognize only Albanian houses. Hrkalovic's house is one that is  surrounded by one. "It sells better. The Albanian is not  interested in water, nor a parquet floor, nor the house being  wired for electricity. All he is interested in is that it have a  wall around it," explains Milan Hrkalovic.    It seems the exodus is inevitable. Aside from the problems  with land consolidation, Hrkalovic has four daughters, all  unemployed. "They are all saying they are so sorry I do not have  a son, and then they would hire him. If I had a son, I would  employ him myself on the land," says the head of the house. He  is employed at Kosovosped, but on mandatory leave. He tells how  he went with a group of colleagues to the Serbian Assembly to  complain of monkey business in his firm. Bata Zivojinovic, who  headed the opstina Committee for Petitions and Grievances at  that time, told them jokes to entertain them and dispel their  concern. Zivorad Igic, deputy from Kosovo, directed them to the  Assembly restaurant, where the food is good and cheap. The  hungry people were taken in, they went to the restaurant, and  there they encountered the Assembly security. "They came after  us, and we were glad when we found the door," Hrkalovic relates.    That was his first experience with the state. Milan  Hrkalovic  has no intention of complaining again. Nikola Grbic, however,  thinks of writing to Slobodan Milosevic, Serbian president,  whose picture hangs above him in the living room as he tells his  sad tale. He was thinking, he said, of giving a house lot to his  sister, who returned to Kosovo from Krusevac, but now he does  not have it to give. "Unless Sloba helps out, I do not know who  will."    "Unless Sloba helps out," the Grbices will soon come to the  end of their own personal Kosovo cycle. They came to the village  which bears the name of the Serbian hero in 1922 from Lika.  Vukasin Dutina is "80-percent" decided to leave. He says that he  does not believe that he has a future here and that "things are  not being worked out the way they should." His younger son got a  job only at the age of 29. The elder, Slobodan, is working as an  auto mechanic at the Obilic Coal Mine for miserable pay which  does not give him the courage to establish a family. Many have  already left, and he does not know how why he is staying. Those  who have left have told me that they would return if the  situation were "the way it should be." But it is not. Vukasin  explains that he has been unable to build a new house by his own  honest labor, while others have been getting a new apartment  even when they were too lazy to paint the old one. He says that  he "had hopes," that is why he stayed even in 1981, when the  exodus was largest, he stayed all these years, but it seems that  he will have to leave in '94. He has no more hope. The state has  made promises so that fulfillment of people's hopes is bound up  with it. Hoping that the state will not betray that trust,  Vukasin Dutina's younger son waited until age 29 for his first  job, while during that period Albanians were going to the West,  opening private stores and trade establishments.    Now the Serbs from Milosevo are complaining about the venal  Kosovo (Serbian) bureaucracy. A myth which is threatening the  myth of the battle of Kosovo is being created on the theme of  corruption, venality, and crime. Just as in a myth, there is  much that cannot be checked out, the facts are mysterious,  assessments of the role of the heroes vary from case to case.  <H5>  Getting Around the Prohibitions </H5>   "The Albanians, which have exceptional economic power, buy  strategic goods and sell them not only in Kosmet, but also to  the Macedonians and Croats, with the help of irresponsible and  venal representatives of the authorities all over Serbia,"  Zejnel Zejneli, POLITIKA journalist and federal deputy from  Pristina, wrote in that newspaper. No names are given even in  his article. Zejneli says that in the end he is only a  journalist, not a judge, so he does not publish the names. This  deputy on the slate of the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] gives  among examples of machination the case of Kosmet tours, 49  percent of whose shares were sold below the price of one of the  10 buses the firm possesses. In the trade in real estate, which  is prohibited in Kosovo, Serbs and Albanians have found a way of  getting around the law. One of the ways is a fictitious marriage  between a Serb and an Albanian woman, so that later, after the  divorce, the Serb leaves, say, the apartment to his "fictitious  wife," and he gets money in return. Mortgage loans are another  way, and there are also less complicated ways reported by the  farmers in Milosevo: "You grease the right palms, and there are  no problems."    Zejneli also calls upon his obviously extensive  documentation  to tell how in Prizren, during the greatest shortages, milk was  sold from a truck with Belgrade license plates and how the  people in Subotica were forced to buy corn in Kosovo, after  previously having sold it there....    Albanian capital is conquering Kosovo. To take an obvious  example, this is how it looks: On a building bearing the name of  the publishing house RILINDJE in capital letters in the Albanian  language, following the transformation and the prohibition of  the Albanian newspaper, the stylized letters read Gracanica, so  that Gracanica is leased, and the lessee is an Albanian, and a  big sign reading "Greguri" is displayed in the window of his  shop. Thus, Albanian capital and Serbian spiritual history come  together.    Albanian demographic growth and the growth of capital are  having a depressive effect on the Serbs. The machinations of  their fellow countrymen are also discouraging. Milos Djordjevic,  chairman of the Pristina Committee of the Democratic Party of  Serbia (DSS), also complains of the very low intellectual  potential of Kosovo Serbs. "What do we amount to here when not a  single one of our people means anything in culture or science or  art? They only count for something in the government, and then  at the local level," says Djordjevic.    The chairman of the Pristina DSS suggested to a journalist  of  our newspaper "a worthwhile informant." Then that "informant"  declined. He had received a worthwhile job in a Kosovo  institution.    When someone with university education gives up his right to  free speech "on behalf of the state," then it is quite  understandable that he is turning over the question of his  survival, in Kosovo, for example, to the state.    The state is not making itself heard. The president's  half-sentence that "there are no problems" of granting broad  autonomy to Albanians has remained; now people are wondering  whether that unfinished sentence was ever uttered or not. What  is changing in Kosovo is the slow awakening of the economy. The  state appointed Vekoslav Sosevic, officially a minister without  portfolio, to be "minister for Kosovo." Sosevic, they say in  Kosovo, proved his exceptional managerial abilities in the  rebirth of the factory Balkan in Suva Reka. The Grand Hotel in  Pristina is moving faster and faster to restore its old gleam in  order to receive the numerous economic, financial, and business  experts, and Sosevic, judging from this, is becoming the Kosovo  manager.    But the problem of Kosovo, which the "minister for Kosovo,"  of course, knows as well, is not a managerial problem.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Letter: Righting the wrongs of pensions Sir, Your leader 'Pensions after Maxwell' (June 20) and its warnings are timely. There is very much more wrong with the pensions world than the issues of custodianship, and the ownership and control of pension funds and their surpluses (if any). For all their well-meaning aims, the Fowler reforms have been a bureaucratic nightmare and have lead to administrative chaos. As pensions become more attractive (solely because of the tax breaks available) so governments have had to devise ever more convoluted (and expensive) rules to prevent individuals and companies from having too much of a good thing. An entire government department, countless actuaries, lawyers and even accountants have as their raison d'etre the policing and restriction of pension contributions and benefits. In addition, the failure of government to oblige employers to fund employees' personal pensions when they do not wish to join a company scheme has reinforced the corporatist approach to pension provision and discouraged individual initiative. And why retain tax relief in its present forms? The setting up of the Goode Commission offers a marvellous opportunity for these issues to be explored and for the fundamental assumptions of the last 40 years to be questioned. One of the most attractive features of the Thatcher era was the challenge to ingrained prejudices and to vested interests. Having appointed a very distinguished lawyer to be chairman of this commission, the secretary of state will surely resist the temptation to pack the membership with pensions industry establishment figures whose life-long habits of thought have inhibited them from thinking anew and creatively about old problems.

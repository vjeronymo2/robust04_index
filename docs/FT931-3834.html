			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Mips and Fips, options for Lamont to ponder - Diary of a Private Investor CHANCELLORS of the exchequer have created a variety of new investment vehicles in recent years, such as personal equity plans (Peps) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas), while abolishing a number of low-yielding taxes - such as the excise duty on matches and mechanical lighters. Will chancellor Norman Lamont's March 16 Budget follow that pattern? If so, as a private investor I hope he will introduce two new investment vehicles - Mips and Fips - to take the place of the business expansion scheme (BES) which ends on December 31. Given the prime minister's recent statements on the need to encourage manufacturing industries, then Mips (manufacturing investment plans) might have some appeal. Investors would receive tax relief on their investment in newly-issued shares in start-up and existing small businesses which used the funds to develop or expand their manufacturing capabilities. Mips would be restricted to companies with assets less than, say, Pounds 10m. Subsidiaries, or companies associated with major companies, would not be eligible. The tax relief terms could be somewhat similar to those that apply to BES investors. There would be no limit on the total amount each company could raise by this method of funding. Fips (film investment plans) also would provide BES-style tax relief for investors who put money into encouraging and expanding the British movie industry. Each production, regardless of the size of its budget, would be open to private investors. Ideally, this would encourage production of more films with mass appeal (as opposed to art house movies, which might receive subsidies from the new national lottery). With luck, such films would lead not only to a steady stream of income from foreign sales but also act as world-wide promoters of British talent. Films with excessive violence would not qualify for Fips. The ideal tax for abolition in the Budget is stamp duty on share transactions. If the chancellor feels he cannot get rid of this iniquitous tax completely, then at least it should be abolished for private investors, leaving institutions to continue paying it. Stamp duty on house purchases could also be abolished. If this was accompanied by an announcement that mortgage interest tax relief was being phased out over, say, the next 10 years, then this would help to lubricate the housing market and, in the long term, save the government huge sums of money. It could also help shares in house-building companies. There has been much press comment about the government's need to borrow yet more money to fund its spending plans; and it has been suggested that the rules for Peps should be amended to allow gilts to qualify for inclusion. But I would much prefer that Peps were abolished. As well as an increase in capital gains tax allowances, private investors should be given roll-over relief instead. Already, some forms of institutional investment benefit effectively from such relief; unit and investment trusts pay no CGT when share-holdings are bought and sold. The individual taxpayer becomes liable for such tax when the units or investment trust shares are cashed in. A private investor should be able to benefit personally from roll-over relief on his individual share transactions. So long as the proceeds from a sale are used to fund another investment (shares or gilts), then no tax should be levied. The chancellor should also make it much easier for people to organise their own personal pension schemes without the need for fund managers and trustees. They should be allowed to set aside part of their income for pension purposes and invest it how they wish: if they lose it all, hard luck] But at least they would have direct control over their own destiny (plus the tax advantages). Fund managers in Britain have control over an uncomfortably large proportion of companies and industry. The time is long overdue to encourage and promote much more direct investment by private individuals - particularly as they are more likely to complain loudly in cases of pathetic management than some institutions. There are a number of companies that may suffer from the Budget. It has been suggested that the chancellor could extend VAT to domestic fuel and power - perhaps at 5 per cent initially - in order to help fund the government's deficit and demonstrate a 'green' policy. If that happens, shares in all utility companies could be hit. Fortunately, I hold only a modest number in Southern Electric (so I can complain at the next annual general meeting about the poor power supply to my home). But no such levy should be applied to Scottish Hydro Electric, which provides the 'cleanest' power in the UK. In his Budget last year, the chancellor increased tax on leaded petrol at a higher rate than unleaded, and said this continued the government's 'long-standing and successful policy' of encouraging people to use unleaded fuel. I expect he will widen the gap even more this year. The Inland Revenue has completed a review of company car tax and the chancellor is expected to announce further increases in this area. Suppliers of expensive vehicles may suffer as these could well attract higher tax, while the benefit of company car insurance could be affected similarly. Whatever the chancellor announces, I hope it is accompanied by a statement showing how the costs of government and administration are being reduced.</p>

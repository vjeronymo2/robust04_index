			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Technology: Trouble after hours - Since its launch the Globex trading system has provoked much criticism It is late in the afternoon and Chicago's futures trading floors are closed. But high in an office tower on LaSalle street a futures trader-turned computer operator is juggling his telephone and keying in a customer order to sell D-Mark futures. His after-hours Globex terminal asks for account information and a security code, then accepts the order. In the intervening minute, the interbank foreign exchange trader at his elbow has taken, priced and executed a telephone trade for a large quantity of D-Marks in the over-the-counter market. Long after the telephone trade is finished, the computer order glows on the Globex screen, unmatched. Globex, the after-hours trading system for futures and options contracts developed jointly by Reuters and the two largest futures exchanges, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, was conceived in 1987 as the high-tech weapon that would electronically project Chicago futures trades around the clock and around the world. It was also designed to blunt competition from overseas exchanges and turn a potential off-exchange competitor - Reuters - into a partner. Five years and an estimated Dollars 80m (Pounds 52m) later, its technology had already been overtaken by the time it was launched in June 1992. Globex's problems are rooted in both the conception and execution of the service. 'Globex was conceived when the 24-hour global dealing desk was envisaged - but that has never really happened,' said Tony La Roche, managing director of Cater Allen Futures. During the 1980s, 'globalisation' was a buzzword in the financial markets. The concept was that as barriers between markets fell, trading would cease to be concentrated in domestic markets, and would, at least in large markets such as the US Treasury market, continue 24 hours a day with flows of paper moving around the world. Instead, trading has remained concentrated within the domestic timezone of the relevant instrument. For example, the Japanese Government Bond market is highly liquid during the Far Eastern trading day, but activity tails off when that market closes. Because Globex is a futures market, it is difficult for heavy volume to be generated when the underlying cash market is closed. Futures contracts are generic agreements to buy or sell at a set price and time through an organised exchange. The only instruments listed on Globex which have liquid cash markets around the clock are Eurodollar futures and foreign currencies. So far, trading volume has been disappointing, although the recent listing of products from the Matif, the French futures exchange, helped boost volume. But the system is being used primarily as a means of finishing off late trades in a particular marketplace, rather than for trading outside a dealer's natural timezone. Even then, it is outclassed in speed and liquidity by other after-market trading opportunities. Its biggest competition comes from the Chicago exchanges. On any given night, while the Globex terminals are live, eight times as many US government bond futures contracts trade on the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, in sessions that coincide with Japan's market opening. After the closing bell at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 5,000 to 10,000 telephone trades in after-hours Japanese yen and D-Mark futures are done in transactions known as 'exchange for physicals', many more than on Globex. And in Singapore, while Chicago sleeps, 10 times more three-month Eurodollar futures are traded on the Simex floor than on Globex. The Simex trades, similar to those on Globex, can be offset by a floor trade in Chicago. Liquid floor and telephone markets, meanwhile, have improved their own technologies in the past six years. 'Globex is definitely the tail of the market, and the tail won't wag the dog,' says Brian Duff, foreign exchange product manager for Cargill Investors Services, a Chicago-based brokerage house that staffs a Globex desk. Most traders familiar with the system say it is not particularly user-friendly. In London, it is compared unfavourably with the after-hours system operated by the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe). Liffe's APT system, which is currently the subject of a development project, is liked by traders because it simulates the method of trading used in the futures pits. Globex is criticised for its time-consuming order-entry requirements, despite the heavy investment in technology. In a much-needed revival, the Matif doubled Globex volume since it began entering its contracts on the system on March 15. But the boost from Matif is purely local, as UK and US firms have been, to date, unable to trade the French products for regulatory reasons. Ominously, the rise in Matif volume on the system in April masked a decline in trades in CBoT and CME products. Jack Sandner, the eight-time CME chairman who took the helm of Globex this week, argues that building a truly international system takes time and technical and regulatory hurdles are being overcome. But international terminal placement is still sketchy; no other exchanges besides the Matif have signed on to list products and technical hitches still dog the system. Reuters, which contributed most of the estimated Dollars 80m cost of developing Globex, may find it hard to recoup its investment. Globex has cut or waived fees on some deals, but Reuters earns Dollars 1 per round trade and Dollars 800 in monthly rental for some 300 terminals installed. At the heart of Globex's troubles are the exchanges' reservations about screen-trading. 'We all really believe open outcry trading is the better way,' says Alger 'Duke' Chapman, chairman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange. 'It is cheaper and more efficient, with higher bid/ask spreads, than any computer system in the world.' Global screen-based trading may have its day. But Globex is likely to go down in history as one of a number of prototypes, before the final technological breakthrough which makes screen-trading as easy as face-to-face trading.</p>

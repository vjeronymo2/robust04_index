			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Mining Closures: Only 12 vacancies at the Jobcentre - Richard Donkin reports on the mood in Seaham where the town's last pit ceased production yesterday THE FIRST storms of the winter were sending waves crashing over the outer piers of Seaham harbour yesterday as the winding gear of the town's remaining pit winched up men on the final day of production. Facing seawards, the blank expressions of the miners gave no hint that they were witnessing the end of Seaham's industrial heritage. Mining breathed life into this Durham town. Before the last century it was a small rural settlement, but coal production led to the creation of a railway and a bustling harbour. Foundries were built and a bottle works thrived for a time. The industry has gone and the Vane Tempest colliery is the last of the town's mines. The bodies of the 163 men and boys who died in the town's great colliery disaster in 1880 are still entombed in sealed underground workings at the old Seaham colliery. Now Seaham, with a population of about 35,000, is withering with its dying pits. Seaham has seen better days, but it has never been a prosperous town. People used to search the beach for coal when times were hard. The sand is still black - so moonlike that the makers of a new science-fiction film used it as the backdrop for a desolate planet. In spite of their sadness at the pit closure, the townspeople remain stoically cheerful, retaining a sense of humour. Mr Ron Wood, who runs the franchise of Swinton Insurance, in Church Street, the main shopping centre, says: 'Personally I think the future for the area is tourism. Lord Byron used to live here. Mind you Byron hated the bloody town. I can't blame him.' This week had been 'make a will week' at Swinton's - but there had been no takers. Church Street sells everything necessary to sustain life, but little more. The few shops selling electrical goods are anxious about their prospects now all the pits have gone. Mrs Joan Frail, manager of the Northern Electric shop, is offering deferred payments until next March on some goods with a 20 per cent down payment. In a further promotion the shop is offering vouchers of Pounds 100 to Pounds 200 that can be used against holidays for customers who buy on credit. 'But if people can't afford to go on holiday in the first place it isn't much good,' she says. Her own company has just made 98 people redundant in its retail division. 'At the end of the year it's possible that more shops will close,' she says. 'I just hope that the Seaham branch of Northern Electric isn't one of them.' The town's bakeries - selling a staple food - continue to do a brisk trade. Mrs Lorna Huntley, married to a retired miner, and an assistant at Nicholson's bakery for the past 22 years, says: 'We make good bread that people can still afford. Our boss understands people's problems and hasn't increased prices for one and a half years. The bread is selling well but people are buying less confectionery and cakes.' Foggin's newsagents also looked busy. 'The local papers are going well because they have all the jobs in them,' says Mrs Dorothy Carr, the owner. Unlike most of the UK at the end of the 1980s, house prices never jumped much in Seaham so they didn't drop much either, says Mr David Shaw, who runs a town-centre estate agency. Average house prices are about Pounds 25,000. Business is slow, he says: 'The house market is so bad that I don't think the closure of the pit could make much difference.' Seaham's building societies are looking forward to a rush of deposits when miners bank their redundancy payments, but mortgage lending is low. 'These days house buyers tend to take a mortgage protection policy as a matter of course,' says Mrs Janice Ferguson, manager of the Northern Building Society. The Vane Tempest closure had not been unexpected, she says. The husband of Mrs Irene Henderson, one of the society's officers, has just taken redundancy at the pit. She has no idea where he might get another job. Not all businesses are doing badly. The Zodiac Video centre next to the parish church is part of an expanding chain. The most popular video this week is Cape Fear. Mrs Margaret Drysdale, the manager, says: 'People have nothing else to do. They probably just watch the telly.' The small jewellers' shop in Church Street gives the impression that there must be some demand for luxury items in the town, until you go inside and talk to Mr Wilfred Dunn, the proprietor. 'I don't sell much,' he says. 'It's the repairs that keep me busy. You can't sell luxury goods here.' This is confirmed by the experience of Mrs Carole Shaw, manager of Barnardo's second-hand shop. She described business as brisk, with the average price of clothes in the shop between Pounds 2 and Pounds 3. Mr Eddie Owsnett, who owns a pork and beef butcher's in the town, said one of his specialities in increasing demand is the 50p savoury dip. This consists of a bread bun, coated with peas pudding on one side, sage and onion stuffing on the other and containing meat trimmings in the middle, dipped in gravy and served up hot as a lunchtime snack. Mr Allen Brooks, the fishmonger, says: 'A few retired people are moving into the area from the south, so that could partly compensate for the downturn. But morale is certainly low in the town.' Meanwhile, the Seaham Jobcentre has just 12 local jobs on its noticeboard. The town has about 1,500 people unemployed, but the number of jobless will increase immediately after the 900 redundancies at the colliery. 'It will decrease my chances of getting a job by 50 per cent,' says one of the fishermen digging for worms in the harbour. 'There's nothing else for me to do but fish.' But it would be wrong to describe Seaham as a gloomy town. Its people have suffered too many disappointments to be depressed about the latest blow. 'We went through a year's pit strike and came through it,' says Mr John Webster, who runs a wallpaper shop. People have pride in their homes and they still want to decorate. They have time on their hands.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 4 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service has detained officials from the law  enforcement bodies suspected of corruption. ITAR-TASS has  learned from well-informed sources that among those detained are  a senior official of the directorate for administering  punishments of the Moscow Oblast Main directorate of internal  affairs, a senior officer of the investigating committee of the  Russian Interior Ministry, and a Moscow lawyer.    Being "kept" by Moscow criminal groupings, by using their  contacts with corrupt officials from the law enforcement bodies  and by using bribes in hard currency, they secured the release  of members of criminal groupings who had committed burglaries,  robberies, hostage-taking, murders, and other crimes.    During the operation, illegal firearms, several hundred  thousand U.S. dollars, gold, and precious stones were  confiscated from the suspects.    The criminal case involving the individuals is being  investigated by the Russian General Procuracy.</p>

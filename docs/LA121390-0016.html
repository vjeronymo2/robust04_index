			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN BENEFIT PARTICIPANTS  </P> <P> I was shocked and hurt by the letters (Dec. 2) about my niece Sasha Graves and  our friends, the Gun Owners REACT Committee.  </P> <P> They said Sasha was crying when Michael McNulty tried to help her pop some  balloons with a pellet gun.  </P> <P> Sasha didn't cry any time during her visit at the gun range.  </P> <P> Sasha's reaction in the picture with your article was shyness when all those  reporters crowded around her, and she couldn't see through the sight so she  scrunched up her eyes and rubbed them after trying.  </P> <P> Why didn't you use the picture you took of Sasha waving at all the folks when  they introduced her to the crowd? She was really smiling when they cheered for  her, and with the help from the gun owners she is smiling now.  </P> <P> DEIRDRE POPE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

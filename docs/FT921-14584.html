			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / New Spanish health minister appointed Spain's prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, moved quickly last night to resolve a delicate political crisis by naming a successor as health minister to Mr Julian Garcia Valverde, who was forced to resign, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. Mr Gonzalez appointed Mr Jose Antonio Grinan, an ally from his own province of Andalucia who previously held the health portfolio there. Mr Garcia Valverde was forced to resign because of a growing scandal surrounding land speculation near Madrid by the state railway monopoly, Renfe, of which he was president before being promoted to the government nearly a year ago. The Bank of Spain yesterday raised its official intervention rate to 12.65 per cent from 12.50 per cent in the first formal increase in interest rates since a series of rate cuts began early last year.</p>

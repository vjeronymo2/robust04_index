			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Part-time council staff get pensions LOCAL government employees working less than 15 hours a week are entitled to be included in the Local Government Pension Scheme, the largest in the country, under new regulations published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. This follows a campaign by the GMB general union which has argued that the overwhelming majority of part-time workers are women and that their exclusion from the scheme was discriminatory. The department said the issue had been brought to its attention and it had decided that the cut-off was discriminatory.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (4): Too bad to admit - The banks' debt burden IN protesting that they have learned the lessons of the easy money era of the late 1980s, Japanese banks stumble when asked to explain the continuing close ties to ailing developers such as Azabu Tatemono and EIE International, which have extensive property holdings and even larger piles of debt. One reason, often unstated, is that the banks are reluctant to reveal the full extent of their exposure to these companies. Another is the old justification that these developers are too big to let slip, as their fall would shatter confidence in an already battered Japanese property market. But, departing from this tradition, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan announced this month that EIE International, with outstanding debt conservatively estimated at Y700bn, will have to fend for itself. Five bank managers transferred to the company have returned to the bank, which has promised to write off the losses arising from its loans of Y190bn, about half of which are estimated to be bad. The EIE case has stirred debate in Japan over whether the banks are now prepared to own up to bad debts and deal with them aggressively, in contrast to the past practice of understating the exposure and stretching out the write offs over a decade or more. The latter approach had the blessing of the Ministry of Finance, which thought it would maintain confidence in the system and limit the losses to tax revenue arising from write offs. It was natural that LTCB, and four other leading banks linked to EIE, should be nervous about the reaction to the unusual tack of admitting to problems. On the day of the announcement, one slightly giddy banker asked this journalist: 'What do you think about our decision? Do you think it is a good thing?' But it is not clear that the EIE case marks a turning point in the attitude of Japanese banks to their problem loans. The company is a maverick, with a bizarre collection of trophy properties, ranging from a floating hotel in Vietnam to a private university in Queensland. Its president, Harunori Takahashi, is definitely not mainstream, having retreated to the golf course when told that his bankers were cutting their losses. Importantly, much of EIE International's portfolio is outside Japan, meaning that the impact on the domestic property market is limited. Harder evidence of a new attitude to problem loans would be presented if a bank put pressure on a more mainstream developer, and if banks revised their present narrow definition of a non-performing loan. Officially, the country's 11 leading commercial banks have Y8,400bn in non-performing loans, but that figure is unofficially estimated to be about half the actual total. Restructurings in which interest rates are cut to almost zero are not counted, nor are affiliates' bad loans, even though the bank will be ultimately responsible for clearing away the debris. Nippon Credit Bank, one the country's three long-term credit banks, is burdened by bad loans from three financial affiliates, which it says are not technically its responsibility. However, when dealing with the affiliates, most customers saw the respectable figure of NCB looming behind, as is the case with even the distant affiliates of other large institutions. The bank estimated its non-performing loans at end March to be Y592bn, though prominent reports in a Japanese magazine claiming to be based on internal documents from the bank have suggested the figure is higher. NCB officials say the 'worst is over' and that the arrival as president of a former finance ministry official, Mr Hiroshi Kubota, has helped morale. NCB is a good example of the difficulty of measuring the depth of bruising in the country's banking system. Instead of bad loan figures, the bank emphasises that business profits rose 68 per cent last year and that its capital adequacy ratio, as defined by the Bank for International Settlements, was 9 per cent at end March, up from 8.32 per cent a year earlier, and easily above the 8 per cent target figure. The finance ministry says the announcement of non-performing loan figures is intended to restore confidence in the banking system, as they show that the damage is not as severe as rumoured. But banks, and the ministry, are still unwilling to highlight the differences among the institutions, even though the quality of loan portfolios varies greatly. Most attention has been given to the larger Japanese banks, but cracks are also appearing in institutions such as smaller regional banks and the local shinkin banks. These institutions are suffering most during the economic downturn, particularly if they are already burdened by problem loans arising from the bubble era. The collapse of Kamaishi Shinkin last month and a rush of mergers among other smaller banks and credit associations have highlighted the pressures on these institutions. It is understood that about 11 troubled shinkin banks are receiving low interest loans from their parent association, and the longer the economic downturn, the more assistance will be required. Kamaishi's failure was linked to its role as the provider of funds to small businesses in a coastal area in northern Japan, not to rash lending to stock or property speculators. About half of the bank's loan portfolio of Y35.6bn is reckoned to be bad and it will be liquidated in October, when 12 branches will be taken over by regional banks. The disappearance of Kamaishi Shinkin, whose mistake was to keep the funds flowing to faithful but struggling clients, shows that a streamlining of the banking system is occurring, though not as quickly as was generally predicted. Japanese banks are still resisting the pressure to change, but, as the Kamaishi case shows, there comes a time when the institutions can resist no more.  ---------------------------------------------  PROPERTY LOANS EXPOSURE OF TOP 10 BANKS (%)  --------------------------------------------- Trust                              26.7 Nippon Credit                      23.8 Fukutoku                           18.3 Hanshin                            17.9 Chiba                              17.8 Taiheyo                            17.6 Chuo Trust                         17.3 Toyo Trust                         16.7 Tokuyo City                        16.6 Mitsui Trust                       16.6  --------------------------------------------- Source: Tokyo Shoko Research  ---------------------------------------------</p>

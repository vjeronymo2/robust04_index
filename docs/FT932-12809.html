			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Loss assessors see little that can be salvaged WATER poured through the ceiling of a wrecked sandwich shop, 50 yards from the crater caused by Saturday's bomb blast. Mr Justin Balcombe, of loss assessors Balcombe Group, wanders over, treading carefully through twisted metal window fittings, rubble and fragments of glass littering Bishopsgate. 'It's not the water main. It's a sprinkler that's gone off,' he says, noting the details carefully. This could be useful information for a claim. With his colleague Mr John Gale, the group's deputy managing director, Mr Balcombe has been examining damage since early yesterday, sometimes following up inquiries from anxious shop owners and businessmen, who are still denied access to the area, sometimes - as in this case - simply collecting information. Saturday's attack has brought a flood of inquiries to Balcombe Group, which advises companies on insurance coverage and claims. Both men are convinced that the loss will be greater than that caused by the Baltic Exchange bomb last year, and insist that total claims will exceed Pounds 1bn. They believe structural damage to be far heavier than in last year's bomb. 'If this building is not pulled down it will be a miracle,' says Mr Gale, pointing to an office building beside the remnants of St Ethelburga's church. Balcombe's preliminary assessments of half a dozen properties have shown that very little is salvageable. Claims for lighting and other office furniture and fittings will also mount up into hefty sums. In the buildings closest to the blast daggers of glass still hang uneasily from the windows. Removing glass and securing buildings will take at least a further week. The firm expects claims for interruption to business - what insurers call B/I - to swell the size of the total loss. B/I accounted for about a third of the Pounds 300m of damage caused by last April's bombs. Demolition work will inevitably mean curbs on access to the area even after workers return, reducing customers and hindering suppliers. 'Restriction of access will be covered under some insurance policies,' says Mr Balcombe. Damage to telecommunications links and gas, electricity and water supplies will slow construction work. 'It is going to take months to reroute them,' he adds. At the wrecked Bishopsgate branch of Pret a Manger, the takeaway food chain, Mr Sinclair Beecham, the chain's owner, has asked Balcombe to help with an overall claim for several hundred thousand pounds, of which B/I will amount to over half. Wearing an unfamiliar hard hat, he surveys staff cleaning up broken glass and predicts it could be months before the shop will open again. 'There are no customers out there. There will be no one out there for a while.'</p>

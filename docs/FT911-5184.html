			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: Mitridate, re di Ponto - Monte Carlo The Mozart opera of the 1991 'Printemps des arts de Monte Carlo' - obviously, in this year of the Mozart bicentenary, there had to be one - was Mitridate, re di Ponto. This opera seria is the success story among the early-Mozart-opera rediscoveries: productions have been cropping up all over the place, and are set to continue doing so (although the planned Covent Garden staging is rumoured to have been shelved). Would similar attention be paid to the opera if it were by another 18th-century composer, and not by an extraordinarily precocious 14-year-old who later composed Idomeneo? My answer, bolstered by knowledge of Mitridate from records, concert performances, and now by this English Bach Festival production, is a full-throated yes: for it is a work of extraordinary qualities. No-one would pretend that it is evenly inspired all the way through (though even when treading 18th-century seria water, as he does for much of the first act, Mozart writes with serene beauty for voices and instruments); but the opera contains sufficient startling, fiery, and deep-felt music to disprove Dent's assertion that in 1770 Mozart 'was not yet temperamentally equal to the treatment of such a subject' as Racine's drama in Cigna-Santi's libretto re-modelling. It is an adventurous opera - adventurous with formal procedures, with emotional statement and development, with its treatment of characterisation through voices. Even at so tender an age Mozart was capable of taking a 'given' - such as the predilection of his leading tenor, Guglielmo D'Ettore, for wide leaps from high to low or vice-versa - and turning it to dramatic account: the fantasticated vocal line for the titular king certainly depicts overweening pride. And the music for the principal pair of star-crossed lovers, Siphare (castrato soprano) and Aspasia (prima donna soprano) is vibrant with feeling. One feels strongly about the riches of Mitridate above all in the wake of this English Bach Festival presentation, which showed them off in an admirably flattering light. A modernised treatment must surely encounter greater difficulties with a work so bound up with 18th-century dramaturgy; the EBF way of honouring the terms of that dramaturgy - in stage movement (by Tom Hawke), in setting (by Terence Emery after Quaglio) - sets the scale of the drama. One accepts its pace and style - and then, in later acts, one thrills to Mozart's bold, excited re-thinking of them. In the delightfully ornate, intimate Salle Garnier, the chances of such a presentation are of course much more positive. It was not absolutely ideal: the conductor of the EBF 'period' orchestra, Antonio de Almeida, is a cultivated musician who tends to let the reins slacken just when one wants him to tauten them. The casting was uneven: Helen Field (Aspasia) carried herself and her grand dark-crimson gown with such wonderful presence that her discomforts with florid writing were easily forgiven, but the inexperienced Kiphare (Sharon Cooper, a soft-grained high mezzo) showed only flashes of promise. On the other hand, the Mitridate, Andreas Jaeggi, managed the normally agonising arias with grace, dignity, and even ease; and both Penelope Walker (the scheming Farnace) and Naomi Harvey (the gentle Ismene, second donna foil to Aspasia) proved exceptionally stylish in delivery and bearing. The long opera was cut to the bone, and beyond that in the secco recitative. But on the whole the show was a notable success for both the Monte Carlo Festival and the English Bach organisation: a pity it is apparently not to be given in London.</p>

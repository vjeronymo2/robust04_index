			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By political correspondent Pierre Claassen] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Feb 3 SAPA -- Constitutional  Development Minister Roelf Meyer has warned the National Party  [NP] federal congress against high expectations for Thursday's  [3 February] constitutional negotiations with the Freedom  Alliance. The talks are scheduled to start around midday.    Mr Meyer spoke on the NP's manifesto released earlier and  said expections had been raised by media reports around the next  round of talks. "It is important not to expect too much at this  stage," he said.    A four-point constitutional package, including a double  ballot, is to be put to the Freedom Alliance on Thursday in a  final attempt for an inclusive negotiated settlement. The double  ballot offer by the African National Congress [ANC] --  potentially a breakthrough -- has not been seen yet and Mr Meyer  expressed caution on the matter. He told SAPA he would prefer to  evaluate it within the full context of any ANC proposal.    If the new package succeeds, negotiators said Parliament was  ready to be convened for a one-day session next week to amend  the transitional constitution and the electoral act.    Deputy Constitutional Development Minister Fanus Schoeman  confirmed that a new and "definitely final" offer had been  cobbled together by the ANC and the government which he felt  substantially accommodated all the Freedom Alliance's demands.  The double ballot offer, approved by the ANC's National  Executive on Tuesday night, would remove what had become  identified as the most problematic obstacle to any agreement, he  said.    Mr Schoeman said deadlock reached at the last round of talks  with the alliance on Monday had resulted in an all-round,  all-out attempt to find a solution. Substantial agreement had  already been achieved on three of the issues which concerned  provincial powers and functions, provincial taxation autonomy  and constitutional autonomy for provinces, tying in the problems  of the demand for an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] and the  position of the Zulu king.    The government had made a proposal which offered the  Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] an option which  could ultimately accommodate its volkstaat goal.</p>

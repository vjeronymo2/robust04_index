			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): The political stock market You can trade in most things, but few would think of election candidates. York University, however, plans to use the trading instinct to attempt accurate predictions of UK elections. It is buying computer equipment for a pilot study of the 'political stock market' method successfully pioneered by the University of Iowa in the US. Participants buy shares in candidates; these are traded on the computerised market, the prices indicating the vote's outcome. York University: UK, 0904 433786</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S DRUG TEAMS BROKEN UP IN INQUIRY FALLOUT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has disbanded its four elite  narcotics squads after the recent suspensions of nine officers suspected of  stealing money seized during drug raids, The Times confirmed Wednesday.  </P> <P> At least 30 officers were moved this week from the Narcotics Bureau  headquarters in Whittier to stations throughout the county, according to union  representatives and the chairman of the county Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department has refused to comment on the reassignments, but  sources said that the narcotics teams were dispersed as a precaution until  local and federal investigations into alleged money skimming are complete.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Believed Temporary  </P> <P> "I understand that it is a temporary reassignment," said Lt. Lee Mealy,  president of the Los Angeles County Professional Peace Officers Assn., which  represents some of the reassigned officers. "They apparently began Monday."  </P> <P> Richard Shinee, chief attorney for the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs,  said there was "absolutely no evidence" that the officers were transferred  because they were suspected of wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Shinee said the reassignment did not constitute a demotion and that wages and  benefits are not affected.  </P> <P> The Times confirmed independently through calls to sheriff's stations that  officers from all three major narcotics units began working this week at a  number of stations throughout the county.  </P> <P> Ed Edelman, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, said that he met with Sheriff  Sherman Block late Wednesday and that the sheriff told him the major units have  been broken up, but the deputies still are working as narcotics officers.  </P> <P> "People were reassigned to stations, but they can follow leads anywhere,"  Edelman said.  </P> <P> "I have been reassured that there is no diminution by the Sheriff's Department  in going after major narcotics dealers," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Explanation Given  </P> <P> Edelman said the sheriff did not explain his reasons for disbanding the units  and refused to discuss the status of the investigation.  </P> <P> The dismantled units were each composed of about 10 officers, most of them  experienced in narcotics investigations. These specially trained teams,  equipped with sophisticated surveillance equipment, have investigated the most  important drug distribution and money-laundering cases handled by the  department.  </P> <P> The department's other narcotics officers are assigned to individual stations  throughout the county and generally work smaller drug cases, including street  sales.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sept. 1 Suspensions  </P> <P> One of the four elite teams was taken out of service Sept. 1 when all nine of  its members -- eight deputies and their sergeant -- were suspended on suspicion  of stealing tens of thousands of dollars seized in drug raids during the last  year. No charges have been filed.  </P> <P> The suspended officers are Deputies Terrell H. Amers, James R. Bauder, Nancy A.  Brown, Eufrasio G. Cortez, Ronald E. Daub, John C. Dickenson, Daniel M. Garner  and Michael J. Kaliterna and Sgt. Robert Sobel. The officers are being paid,  but they have surrendered their badges and guns.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department is analyzing cases assigned to the four "major  violators" narcotics teams and deciding how to proceed with them, sources said.  </P> <P> Some of the officers' unmarked cars have been taken from them, a narcotics  investigator said.  </P> <P> Members of the three reassigned teams will work as station-level narcotics  officers, sources said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Major Rethinking'  </P> <P> The reassignments show that the Sheriff's Department "is going through a major  rethinking of how they operate (narcotics investigations)," said one source  familiar with the major narcotics units, which had expanded from one unit in  1980 to the present four units.  </P> <P> A member of one of the teams, reached at his new assignment at the Lomita  station, said he could not say whether the arrangement is permanent.  </P> <P> "I don't know," he responded, "and I couldn't say if I did." He referred  questions to the Sheriff's Information Bureau, which, along with Block and  Undersheriff Robert A. Edmonds, has repeatedly refused comment on the new  assignments.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear what impact the reassignments will have on  crime-fighting efforts in the region, which federal officials say is the entry  point for 40% of the nation's cocaine.  </P> <P> "That's obviously a major shake-up, (and) it would have a pretty major impact  in Southern California, because they were one of the big enforcement groups in  the area," said Brea Police Capt. Jim Oman, whose department has participated  frequently in sheriff's raids.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Impact Expected  </P> <P> But spokesmen for the federal Drug Enforcement Agency and the U.S. Customs  Service, which also have worked closely with sheriff's investigators, said  disbanding the four teams would not have a significant impact on the federal  agencies' operations.  </P> <P> Deputy Chief Glenn Levant, head of the Los Angeles Police Department's  narcotics division, said that other law enforcement agencies that participate  in a "narcotics information network" have continued to share their intelligence  on drug dealers with the Sheriff's Department. Levant said his own department  is still working cases with sheriff's narcotics officers.  </P> <P> "I don't think this will result in anything negative," he said. "I would be  absolutely shocked if this had any impact on our major cases. What I think is  happening is that they're just sorting things out until they complete their  investigation."  </P> <P> Depending on how the shake-up ends, it could hurt the Sheriff's Department  financially if it reduces its seizures of cash and property in drug raids.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claim on Assets  </P> <P> Seizures have been a boon to local police agencies since passage of a federal  law in 1984 that allows the agencies to claim as much as 90% of the assets they  seize in criminal investigations.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department reported seizing more than $33 million in cash during  drug raids in 1988, and a large part of that will eventually be returned to the  department. In fact, the department's anti-drug efforts are funded in part with  seized money, and the most lucrative seizures have usually been made by the  teams being disbanded.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department would not provide figures on the size of its  Narcotic's Bureau budget, but the county budget for 1989-90 shows that all six  of the sheriff's criminal investigative bureaus, including narcotics, have a  total budget of about $42 million. The budget also reports that about $14  million is available in a separate special fund from seizures in drug raids.  </P> <P> "Maybe the feds will just take it all over, but I don't think the sheriff is  going to let all that easy money go," said David A. Elden, a well-known defense  attorney in drug cases.  </P></p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown Holdings Hillsdown's annual results might have dissolved the market's worst fears but they also highlight fresh anxieties. The held dividend and the new management's resolve to squeeze higher profits from its Pounds 4.4bn of sales will certainly have underpinned the strong recovery in Hillsdown's shares since September. But the yield story is rapidly exhausting itself. Further gains will depend on strong earnings. These, though, are likely to prove highly elusive. Under the new FRS 3 UK accounting standard, Hillsdown recorded losses per share of 0.3p last year. Hillsdown is wielding the butcher's knife in its attempt to improve efficiencies. The Pounds 92.3m extraordinary reorganisation charge reflects its serious intent to sort out 30 underperforming businesses. The rationalisation of its poultry division shows what can be achieved. Sterling's devaluation will also help by bolstering overseas earnings and restoring Hillsdown's competitiveness against marauding French chickens. But the diversity of Hillsdown's portfolio suggests surgery will be a drawn-out process. An increasing tax charge will further hinder earnings progress this year. The market may also question the long term future of a low margin producer of commodity foods. As yet, the management has scarcely addressed the strategic issue. They are surely right to conclude that without greater predictability of cash flow little else can follow.</p>

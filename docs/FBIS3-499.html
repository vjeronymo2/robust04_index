About 50 minority Tutsi were slain on Monday [7 March] night by  majority Hutu using machetes and clubs at Tangara in the north,  Ngozi Province Governor Joseph Ntakirutimana told state radio.  He said the Hutu then fled with their families to neighbouring  Kiremba. The radio said there had been other killings in the  past few days in Musenyi in the north-western province of  Bubanza, but gave no casualty figures. [passage omitted]</p>

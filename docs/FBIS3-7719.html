Apart from  the extension of the cease-fire, the warring sides agreed to  continue talks on reaching a general cease-fire.    This is the third time the cease-fire agreement between  Krajina and Croatia -- originally signed on 17 December 1993 --  has been extended. The cease-fire has been holding, apart from  sporadic provocations on the part of the Croatian Army,  especially in northern Dalmatia and Lika.    In the presence of Colonel Wood and UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] Commander Jean Cot the [extension] document was signed  by Colonel Kosta Novakovic, assistant commander of the Serb  Krajina army, in agreement with the civilian and military  authorities of Krajina.</p>

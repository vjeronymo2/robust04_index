			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok, April 28 KYODO -- The Cambodian border  town of Poi Pet has been virtually cut off following a  government order to close a major highway linking it to  Sisophon, according to a report Thursday [28 April] from  Aranyaprathet, a Thai border town nearby.    Government forces lost control of the highway Tuesday  following heavy Khmer Rouge [KR] guerrilla attacks through the  week, the report said.    Col. Surat Vorarak, an officer attached to Aranyaprathet's  military unit, confirmed Khmer Rouge activity in the region,  saying guerrillas have used "hit and run" tactics against  government posts but would not be allowed to control those they  have overrun.    Poi Pet is a busy border town through which consumer goods  pass between Cambodia and Thailand.    The report said the price of goods in Poi Pet market has  risen by several times and the supply of drinking water has  reached a critical stage.    About 12,000 villagers and merchants remain in the town,  some  of them preparing to cross the border into Thailand, the report  said.</p>

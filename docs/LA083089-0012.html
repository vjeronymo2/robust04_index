			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRACKDOWN VOTED ON ILLEGAL SIGNS  </P> <P> Twelve new city street maintenance employees will be hired to rid Los Angeles  of the tens of thousands of signs -- ranging from political campaign posters to  "lost pet" notices -- posted illegally on city property and parkways each year.  </P> <P> The City Council Tuesday appropriated $603,000 to gear up the clean-up program,  designed to eventually be self-supporting via a series of fines assessed to  residents and businesses illegally posting signs.  </P> <P> However, the council voted 10 to 1 to have the city attorney's office draft an  exemption for real estate agents who post signs advertising open houses on  city-owned parkways (between sidewalks and curbs). Agents may post such signs  at least 30 feet apart from each other as long as they remove them by sundown  and have permission from adjacent homeowners, the council decided.  </P> <P> City Councilman Joel Wachs urged the real estate exemption, terming it "an  established business practice of an industry that just about touches  everybody."  </P> <P> City Councilman Marvin Braude, on the other hand, was bitterly opposed. Braude  unsuccessfully urged fellow council members to reject the influence of the real  estate industry and "bite the bullet and say we are going to clean up the  city."  </P></p>

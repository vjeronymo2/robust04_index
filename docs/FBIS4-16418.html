			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan April 17 TASS--Representatives of the  Russian- speaking population in Armenia met on Saturday with the  chairman of the Duma committee for affairs of the CIS,  Konstantin Zatulin, and chief consultant of this committee and  member of the Russian Presidential Council, Andrannik Migranyan,  who arrived in Yerevan.    "Around 15,000 Russians are currently residing in Armenia  and  they have no complaints about any infringement on their rights  or ethnic discrimination," said representatives of the Russian  speaking population during the meeting.    Chairman of the "Rossiya" society, Galina Chernousova, told  Russian lawmakers that this organisation unites ethnic Russians  in Armenia, protects their interests and rights and renders them  all possible assistance. The society has branch offices in all  areas if Armenia, including in places predominantly populated by  Russians.    Chernousova pointed out that the main problem faced by the  Russian-speaking population in Armenia is the problem of  education. After Armenia proclaimed independence, all Russian  schools and faculties teaching in Russian were closed here.  Armenians who were educated in Russian face the same problems  as well. The Armenian law on the language demands that  graduates of higher educational establishments, especially in  engineering specialities, have a good command of the Armenian  language. The same applies to those looking for jobs at  state-run enterprises. Facing difficulties in education, the  young generation sees no prospects in Armenia and have to leave  Armenia and live elsewhere, Chernousova said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 3 Jan (XINHUA) -- Wang Zhongyu, minister  in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, today  urged localities to correctly understand the great significance  of reform of the taxation system; and to properly effect the  convergence and transition from the old to the new taxation  system so that enterprises can quickly meet the requirements of  new circumstances and compete in the market on equal terms.    Wang Zhongyu said: Much of the current taxation system  reform contents are entirely new. Some enterprises are  unfamiliar with the specific contents and basic guidelines of  the reform. Therefore, the first thing for them to do is  earnestly study the fundamental guidelines of the taxation  system reform and have a good grasp of its specific contents.  Meanwhile, it is also necessary for the broad masses of staff  and workers to understand the following points:    -- The current taxation system reform will not increase  enterprises' overall tax burdens. The reform has a direct  impact on the interests of the vast number of enterprises, and  their staff and workers. The program to reform the taxation  system embodies the principle -- stressed repeatedly by leading  comrades of the State Council -- of not increasing enterprises'  overall tax burdens. According to a general survey of the  Ministry of Finance, the average burden of turnover tax for  industrial enterprises will remain basically unchanged before  and after the reform. According to preliminary calculations of  282 industrial products across China, tax on 73, or 26 percent,  of them will increase, while 209, or 74 percent, will decline.  This shows the majority of industries and enterprises will not  experience a tax hike as a result of the current taxation  reform. Enterprises and products, however, vary in a thousand  ways; and there used to be numerous tax categories and tax rates  as well as diverse tax reductions, tax exemptions, and other  preferential policies applicable to different enterprises and  products. When a new and more standardized taxation system is  introduced, we certainly cannot expect changes in individual  enterprise's tax burdens to be uniform. But, the impact of tax  increases in certain links can be eased through mutual  readjustment. Take the circulation sector for example: According  to the Ministry of Finance's general survey estimations, the tax  burdens of wholesale enterprises will increase 0.44 percent,  whereas retail enterprises' tax burdens will drop 2.5 percent.  The increase in wholesale enterprises' tax burdens will be  offset by the reduction in the tax burdens of retail enterprises  and therefore, the reform will not trigger major fluctuations in  the final retail prices directly borne by the consumer.  Moreover, the reform will help further integrate production,  wholesaling, and retailing operations. Macroeconomically  speaking, because their turnover tax will not rise, retail  enterprises should have no reason to increase their prices on  account of the reform. All industrial and commercial  enterprises should focus their attention on internal operations,  take full advantage of the policies and measures for reducing  enterprise's burdens that are already in force, improve  management, and lower costs; on no account should they increase  consumers' burdens by raising prices on their own under the  pretext of taxation reform.    -- To facilitate implementation of the tax reform program,  the state has adopted policies aimed at reducing enterprises'  tax burdens, including merging enterprise income taxes, reducing  tax rates, and cutting the nominal income tax rate of  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises from 55 to 33  percent. Regulatory tax for state-owned enterprises have been  abolished and they are exempted from contributions to funds  collected for construction of key energy and transport projects,  and the state budget regulating fund (two funds in short), which  alone account for 25 percent of enterprises' after-tax profits.  Enterprises can now keep them for their own use instead of  submitting them to the state treasury. Instead of submitting  them to the state, exclusively state-owned enterprises can keep  their after-tax profits for their own use for the time being.  Two interim tax rates -- at 27 and 18 percent, respectively --  will apply to enterprises operating under thin profit margins in  the next two years. All these and other measures are aimed  reducing the tax burdens of enterprises. Enterprises must take  full advantage of these policies to build up their capacity for  sustained growth and enhance their competitiveness in the market.    -- It is necessary to distinguish new loans from old ones  and  reduce enterprises' burdens to enhance their loan service  capability. Today, many enterprises have worries about  servicing their debt in the wake of taxation reform.  Implementation of the measures for reducing enterprises'  burdens should help increase their debt service capability. In  consideration of the current status of enterprises, the state  has decided to make a distinction between new and old loans, and  introduce a new set of rules for new loans (rules for old loans  will remain unchanged). Efficiently run enterprises may enhance  their actual debt service capability by such measures as  increasing depreciation deductions or incorporating interest on  long-term loans into the production cost. As for enterprises  with heavy debt burdens accumulated over the years, the state is  formulating interim measures to solve the unreasonable debt  burdens of these enterprises caused by external factors.    Wang Zhongyu also outlined measures for ensuring smooth  implementation of the new tax system: First, it is necessary to  effect a changeover from the contract responsibility system to a  uniform tax system. Today, 80 percent of our industrial  enterprises practice the contract system of managerial  responsibility -- a form of management created by the vast  number of enterprises and workers in the course of implementing  reforms -- that has been instrumental in mobilizing the  initiative of enterprises and workers, and in developing the  productive forces. The introduction of the new tax system will  fundamentally change the foundation which the contract  responsibility system depends on for existence, because  value-added tax [VAT] -- which will become the biggest tax  category when the tax reform and tax-sharing system are put into  force -- will be shared by central and local authorities, and  collected by the State Administration of Taxation under a  unified plan. Therefore, it would be unrealistic to practice  the contract responsibility system on a large scale. Moreover,  after the two sets of rules [Rules for the Implementation of  Interim Regulations on VAT; Rules for the Implementation of  Interim Regulations on Business Tax] go into effect, the cost  structure will undergo changes and lead to a sizable drop in  profits on the books. Many enterprises will find that there are  no profit quotas or any profit at all, that serve as a basis for  a contract system of managerial responsibility. All this shows  that a nonstandard relationship of distribution cannot meet the  needs of a market economy. In the face of these circumstances,  we must further broaden our perspective of reform; instead of  being absorbed in readjusting the distribution relationship  between the state and enterprises as the only solution, we must  actively explore new ways to invigorate enterprises. We must  work conscientiously and implement, on our own initiative, the  transition from the contract responsibility system to a uniform  tax system.    Second, we should adopt flexible temporary measures in  light of different conditions. Although regional preferential  tax policies do not fully conform to the principle of equitable  taxation, the abolition of regional preferential tax policies  will affect the investment climate and impede further efforts to  reform and open up because coastal regions are the windows on  our country's reform and opening up. Bearing this prospect in  mind, the state has adopted temporary measures. For instance,  we may adopt temporary measures on refunding taxes within two  years toward taxpayers who enjoy preferential state policies on  taxation in the special economic zones and coastal areas. After  the unified imposition of VAT on both domestically- and  foreign-funded enterprises, we may adopt the method of returning  the actual increases in taxes incurred by partly or wholly  foreign-owned enterprises at the end of each year or in annual  installments, with a view to ensuring the stability and  continuity of foreign-related tax policies. Additionally, the  State Council will take temporary measures toward certain  special enterprises which originally enjoyed tax reduction and  exemption policies. These measures will facilitate the smooth  transition from the old taxation system to a new one.    Third, we should improve publicity efforts regarding our tax  laws and regulations, and swiftly formulate and promulgate  policies concerning the convergence of the old and new taxation  systems, in an effort to give enterprises an idea of how things  stand and banish unnecessary misunderstandings. Implementation  of a new taxation system is an overall reform of the old system,  as well as an important step toward the market economy.  However, it entails the solution of many specific problems.  For instance, the State Administration of Taxation has made  specific provisions regarding next year's tax deductions for  enterprises' stocks of raw and semifinished materials and  finished products on which taxes have been levied this year. It  has given full consideration to the actual conditions in  enterprises. Enterprises' tax burdens will not be overly heavy  or light. We have yet to formulate specific measures regarding  the particular problems of special businesses.    Wang Zhongyu also urged enterprises to adapt to the new  situation quickly and compete fairly in the market. He pointed  out: We should change the concept of state-owned enterprises  that they are units covered by state budgets and directly  subordinate to competent government departments, in favor of the  new notion that they are independent "taxpayers" possessing the  property rights of a legal person. Like other enterprises,  state-owned enterprises should operate independently, assume  responsibility for their own profits and losses, pay taxes  according to law, and compete fairly in the market. We should  change the state's traditional practice of assuming too much  responsibility for state-owned enterprises in favor of the  objective law of market competition based on the survival of the  fittest, as well as the new concept that chronically  deficit-ridden enterprises that cannot repay debts on schedule  should be declared bankrupt according to law. This will  heighten enterprises' sense of urgency and crisis in seeking  survival and development during market competition, as well as  change enterprises' notion of only demanding tax reductions and  profit incentives from the state during the course of reform.    Furthermore, we should earnestly implement the "two sets of  rules," improve our work of evaluating assets and funds, and lay  the foundation for enterprises' fair competition in the market.  We should accelerate the readjustment of enterprises' product  mix and organizational structure, transform state-owned  enterprises' operating mechanisms, and actively but prudently  promote a modern enterprise system.</p>

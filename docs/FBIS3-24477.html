Alumina-zirconia stands out among traditional  materials in having high hardness and resistance to wear. These  properties also make it make it difficult to machine components  made of these substances and for this reason they are shaped  directly by the Stepanov method of controlled crystal growth  which requires no further mechanical handling. It was previously  demonstrated that ceramic eutectics of the title composition, as  prepared by the Stepanov method, may be used as structural  materials, although mechanical testing demonstrated poor  consistency in properties. Bending stress, for example, varied  from 100 to 500 MPa. This low reproducibility in properties  evidently results from contamination of the melt with carbon  from the graphite heating zone. In the present work a study of  the effects of the graphite heating elements on the composition  of alumina-zirconia-ytterbia melts was made and certain measures  are presented for lowering carbon contamination.

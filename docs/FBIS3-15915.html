They made a statement to  this effect after Zyuganov's meeting with Richard Nixon, former  U.S. president.    "We do not know what Messrs. Nixon and Zyuganov talked  about,  but judging by the fact that Mr. Nixon was pleased with the  meeting, Mr. Zyuganov misrepresented the outlook for revival of  communism in the USSR. There is, however, a Bolshevik,  Leninite-Stalinite wing as well as Zyuganov's opportunistic  neo-Gorbachev wing in today's Soviet communist movement. The  former is discriminated against by opportunists of the  Zyuganov's and Shenin's kind from inside the communist camp more  than by the authorities," said the statement made public  Wednesday.    The authors of the statement believed that today a true  communist was a Stalinite and revival of the Stalin-founded  economic system was the only way to extract the country from the  plight into which the anti-Stalinists dragged it during the 40  years since Stalin's death.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] (NA-DYN) -- Yesterday, Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo said there was no possibility of him resigning while at  the same time denying that the peso would be devalued and  recessive policies would be applied to increase exports. He did  say, however, that to achieve this the current consumption rate  should be reduced.    Speaking at the American Club yesterday to a group of  businessmen, Cavallo said he does not foresee President Carlos  Menem asking for his resignation in the near future. He also  added: "I am not thinking about resigning, I will carry on for a  long time, I hope."    He repeated, however, that should this event take place  "there will surely by an economic team as good if not better  than the present one." Cavallo even went one step further and  added that "if, for example, the Radical Party win the next  elections, they will not do what (Raul) Alfonsin tells them,  rather they will field a much better team than us and manage the  economy just as we are doing."    Cavallo insisted that "one day" he would "cease to be a  minister" but "there would be no discontinuity in President  Carlos Menem's administration." Continuing on this issue he  said: "President Menem's government will probably continue until  1999 and he guessed that "I will probably continue at the head  of this Ministry. If I were not here or were only heading a  partial Ministry, then whoever replaced me would not stop the  work being done or propose a different team, but would complete  the reorganization task," Cavallo added.    Cavallo also said that now that the US economy is picking up  those dollars that are not injected into the capital markets  "should be obtained in exchange for our exports." He said that  recessionary measures or a devaluation are not the way to  increase production, rather investments," Cavallo added.    Cavallo also admitted that to encourage exports, "more  favourable relative prices are needed than there have been in  the last three years." He pointed out that these will be  achieved by "working on the service prices, all production  costs, and the tax systems that distort companies expenses."    During his speech Cavallo lashed out at Bolsa Stock Exchange  President Jorge Berrardi his "lack of professionalism and  seriousness in the statements he made. Berrardi had criticized  the 3.75-percent commission the banks charged in the repurchase  of YPF shares as excessive. "With these sort of opinions, how  are we going to have a stable market?" Cavallo wondered.</p>

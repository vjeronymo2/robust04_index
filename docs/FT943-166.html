			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / British Gas strategic review upbeat about dividend rises British Gas yesterday predicted that a strong underlying performance in its main UK businesses would enable it to increase future dividends. In a rare public review of the company's strategy, senior executives told analysts in London that a progressive dividend policy could be maintained as long there were no more 'regulatory shocks'. Its shares, however, closed 9 1/2 p lower yesterday at 290p. The upbeat assessment of financial prospects contrasted sharply with two dividend warnings British Gas issued earlier this year. Analysts said those warnings were part of the company's negotiating tactics with the government and Ofgas, its regulator, over the planned liberalisation of the domestic gas market beginning in 1996. Mr Richard Giordano, chairman, said the 'dense regulatory fog' which had enveloped the company and resulted in a 'strategic paralysis' was beginning to lift. British Gas was now confident enough to lay out a coherent way forward for the rest of the decade. This was in spite of the fact that the government has yet to decide whether to bring forward legislation this year to open the domestic market. The short-term financial performance would be underpinned by expected improvements in the UK gas business, where Pounds 600m of costs would be removed by 1998 through a radical restructuring in which 25,000 jobs would go. The reforms were running ahead of schedule, according to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive, who emphasised there were no 'sacred cows' within British Gas, and that business units which failed to return adequate shareholder value could be sold. A sharp rise in natural gas production from existing offshore reserves in the UK would account for most of the expected growth of cash flow to the year 2000, he said. UK businesses were also expected to receive the lion's share of Pounds 10bn of capital expenditure planned over the next five years. TransCo, the gas transportation and storage business, will absorb 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the total, while the UK exploration and production business would receive about 25 per cent. But the maturity of the UK continental shelf and the domestic gas market meant that long-term earnings growth would have to come from British Gas's international ventures. These would account for 25 per cent to 30 per cent of capital spending to 1999, but they would remain cash negative until the next decade. Mr Brown said the international strategy would be focused on regions where there was growing demand for gas, such as Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe. It would also be 'market driven,' and would involve British Gas forming a number of associate companies with strong local partners. That change in structure was one of the main reasons for the announcement yesterday that British Gas was replacing its earnings-based dividend policy with one based on cash flows. Over the next few years, profits from associated companies are likely to be re-invested, rather than returned in dividends. 'To take full credit for those profits in setting financial policy seems imprudent,' said Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director. The cash-based system would ensure that only actual cash receipts are taken into account. 'It will more accurately reflect the changing shape and risk profile of British Gas and remove any accounting distortions,' he added. Lex, Page 20 London stocks, Page 40</p>

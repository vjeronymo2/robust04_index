			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Pirelli in resumed talks on merger CONTINENTAL and Pirelli, the two European tyre companies which have been at each others' throats for the past few months, yesterday agreed that the crisis in the industry was so severe that merger talks should be resumed. At the same time Continental, based in Germany, confirmed that Mr Horst Urban had agreed to step down as chief executive after strong disagreement with the supervisory board over the talks' direction. His departure, which was greeted with relief by Pirelli, opens the way to a possible amalgamation. Mr Urban, 54, had defended Continental's independence against Pirelli's approaches. Pirelli, however, claimed the support of more than half of Continental's shareholders and used its backing to help overturn a voting rights curb at an extraordinary general meeting of the German company in Hanover in March. This was regarded as a moral defeat for Continental. Since then the Italian company has held out for renewed talks. Yesterday, Continental said the management of both companies had agreed to hold 'round-table' talks. Both sides regard the outcome of the talks as open. They will be kept secret and no further comment will be made until results have been reached. This is in line with the previously expressed desire of Mr Ulrich Weiss, the chairman of Continental's supervisory board, that contacts with Pirelli should be pursued in private. Mr Weiss, an executive of Deutsche Bank, is thought to have taken a tough line with Mr Urban at the supervisory board meeting. Mr Urban is succeeded by Mr Wilhelm Winterstein, 60, the purchasing and logistics director. The more placatory Mr Winterstein will lead Continental in its talks with Pirelli.

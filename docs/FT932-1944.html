			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / European consumer defies the norm THE European Community is still a long way from producing the homogenous Euro-consumer, according to a mammoth study into consumer spending and quality of life conducted across most of the EC's largest markets. Patterns of consumer spending still vary considerably across Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain - the countries that account for 93 per cent of the EC's 340m consumers. The study finds that the European drinks market is still characterised by national distinctions. While the average per capita spending on alcohol, soft drinks and other beverages (such as coffee and tea) consumed in the home was Ecu277 (Pounds 218) in 1992, Belgians spent 2.5 per cent more (Ecu455) than the Italians or Spanish. The 16-volume report, published by Mintel, discloses a wide range of similar discrepancies. The Dutch spend almost 10-times more than the British on health-care products; Italians spend Ecu950 each year on clothing, whereas Spaniards spend just Ecu647; Germans spend more than 25 per cent of disposable income on rent, fuel and power, against 12.8 per cent by Spaniards.

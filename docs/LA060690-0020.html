			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP AND L.A. SCHOOL BOARD BATTLE OVER AMBASSADOR SITE  </P> <P> Your editorial has left me speechless, almost. Let me get this right. Because  Trump has lots of attorneys on his payroll, the school board should surrender  and start evicting low-income families so more low-rent housing can be  destroyed for the high school.  </P> <P> " . . . Homes versus a school -- force a very tough choice," you said. Well,  that is just what the Ambassador site avoids. It gives us a school and keeps  the low-cost housing intact.  </P> <P> Why do you blame the school board for what you predict to be protracted  litigation? Why do you not call for Trump and his partners to accept the  decision gracefully? They will still have over 6 acres of Wilshire property for  development. So their profits will be tens of millions instead of hundreds of  millions of dollars. Hey, we all have to make sacrifices.  </P> <P> JACQUES CHAMBERS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

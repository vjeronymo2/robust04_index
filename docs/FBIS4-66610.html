			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, February 24--The Economic Survey of  1993-94 calls for a special policy thrust to maintain the export  growth and encourage non-debt creating capital inflows  (remittances and investment) aimed at putting the country's  balance of payments (BoP) position on a stable path during the  next three years.    In a review of the external sector of the economy, the  survey  says performance during the year has amply demonstrated the  benefits of the reforms and this should strengthen the resolve  to press ahead with them.    The survey finds that a sound basis has been created to  further deregulate the external sector and rationalise the  tariff structure. It expects export growth to be 20 percent in  dollar terms during 1993-94 and the year to end with foreign  exchange reserves close to $12 billion. With a substantially  lower increase in imports, the trade deficit and also the  current account deficit would narrow significantly compared to  the previous years. The financing gap will, therefore, also be  correspondingly smaller.    It has, however, a word of caution as well. Debt-serve  payments are likely to increase in the next three years.  Debt-servicing is expected to peak in 1996-97 and because of the  large interest and principal repayments, a substantial financing  gap may be expected to remain in the coming three years.    In the context of this challenge, the survey moots certain  policy measures. It says rapid and sustained export growth  remains the key to long-term viability of BoP and the reduction  of foreign debt. The policy bias against exports provided by  import licensing and high tariffs has, therefore, to be  eliminated over time.    The country's agricultural and allied exports continue to be  severely constrained by policy-imposed restrictions. Asserting  that these exports posed no threat to the objective of food  security, the survey calls for removal of these curbs which will  provide farmers with fresh incentives to increase output.    On the other hand, a major share of bulk imports continues  to  be canalised and more than a third of the tariff lines are still  covered by some form of import licensing. Quantitative  restrictions on import of consumer goods provide very high  levels of effective protection to these sectors. This results in  misallocation of investible resources from sectors where the  country may process a competitive advantage. Policy reforms in  these areas, the survey says, "merit urgent and co-ordinated  government action." Moreover, there is a need to augment  infrastructural facilities for exports.    The survey notes that with the Indian economy increasingly  integrated with the world economy, the management of the BoP  will pose major challenges. Careful attention will need to be  given to exchange rate policy, external debt strategy and  foreign exchange reserve management.    Policy must ensure that exchange rate developments do not  weaken the competitiveness of Indian exports. The large stock of  external debt has to be carefully managed to minimise the  potential for sudden pressures on liquidity of the kind that  disrupted the economy in 1990-91. Foreign exchange reserves must  be held at levels commensurate with growing trade and capital  flows and the increasing diversity and flexibility of such  flows. Anticipatory actions will have to be taken to guard  against shocks such as a sudden rise in global petroleum prices  or an agricultural drought.    On the performance in the external sector, the survey  projects import growth to be limited to 4 percent during 1993-94  despite large-scale liberalisation of import policy. The trade  deficit in the first nine months of 1993-94 was only $732  million which was less than one-fourth of the level in the  corresponding period of 1992-93. The current account deficit in  1993-94 is expected to be less than 0.5 percent of the GDP  (little over $1 billion).    The year has also seen a sharp increase in inflow of foreign  investment. The total quantum of foreign investment flows could  be about $3 billion compared to $585 million during 1992-93 and  $148 million in 1991-92.    Foreign exchange reserves had built up to $10.9 billion on  February 4, 1994. It is expected that there will be a build-up  of about $5.5 billion in reserves during 1993-94, taking these  close to $12 billion.    "The year under review has, therefore, seen the country  emerge decisively out of its BoP crisis of the past three  years," the survey noted.    The survey makes some interesting observation on the foreign  trade trends during 1993-94. Manufacturers, which had a share of  74.6 percent in 1991-92 and 76.3 percent in 1992-93 in the  country's exports, are loosing their predominance during the  current year. Agricultural exports increased by 38 percent while  manufactured exports grew by only 19 percent during the first  half of 1993-94. The survey, however, views this as a "positive  trend" which needs to be strengthened as it generates backward  linkages within the domestic economy and stimulates growth.    Similarly, the survey offers an explanation for decline in  imports which have baffled many. It says the fall in imports  cannot be explained away by pointing towards the slow recovery  in industrial output. Fertiliser imports have declined as a  result of decontrol of prices of phosphatic and potassic  fertilisers. Imports of other commodities, which are largely in  the nature of intermediate inputs, may have declined on account  of weak industrial recovery but perhaps more so because of  exchange rate changes. At the new exchange rates, domestic  substitutes, whose quality is improving, have become more  economical.    For the first time the survey reports on the developments in  the hawala foreign exchange market. It says the  premium in the hawala market for the U.S. dollar had  come down sharply by the end of 1992-93 to about 10 percent. It  reached its historically lowest level of 6 percent in mid-June  1993. This was a result of exchange rate policy and the  liberalisation of bullion imports. The premium temporarily went  up during August to October 1993 when it reached 13 percent. It  has declined during the subsequent months.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;213.102 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of positions in Schedule A, B, or C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Office of Personnel Management will decide whether the duties and requirements of any particular position justify exception from the competitive service. Upon favorable determination, OPM will authorize the position to be filled by excepted appointment under Schedule A, B, or C. Unless otherwise specified in a particular appointing authority, an agency may make Schedule A, B, or C appointments on either a permanent or nonpermanent basis, with any appropriate work schedule (i.e., full-time, part-time, seasonal, on-call, or intermittent). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) When OPM establishes eligibility requirements (e.g., residence, family income) for appointment under particular Schedule A or B exceptions, an individual's eligibility for appointment must be determined before appointment and without regard to any conditions that will result from the appointment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A new &sect;213.104 is added to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;213.104 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Special provisions for temporary, intermittent, or seasonal appointments in Schedule A, B, or C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) When OPM specifies that appointments under a particular Schedule A, B, or C authority must be temporary, intermittent, or seasonal, or when agencies elect to make temporary, intermittent, or seasonal appointments in Schedule A, B, or C, those terms have the following meanings: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Temporary appointments, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  unless otherwise specified in a particular Schedule A, B, or C exception, are made for a specified period not to exceed 1 year and are subject to the time limits in paragraph (b) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Intermittent positions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are positions in which work recurs at sporadic or irregular intervals so that an employee's tour of duty cannot be scheduled in advance of the administrative workweek. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Seasonal positions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  involve annually recurring periods of employment lasting less than 12 months each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Temporary appointments, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, are subject to the following limits: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service limits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Agencies may make temporary appointments for a period not to exceed 1 year, unless the applicable Schedule A, B, or C authority specifies a shorter period. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, agencies may extend temporary appointments for no more than 1 additional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor position (i.e., a position that replaces and absorbs the original position) is considered to be an extension of the original appointment. Appointment to a position involving the same basic duties, in the same major subdivision of the agency, and in the same local commuting area is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Restrictions on refilling positions under temporary appointments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an agency may not fill any position (or its successor) by a temporary appointment in Schedule A, B, or C if that position had previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) in either the competitive or excepted service for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the preceding 3-year period. This limitation does not apply to programs established to provide for systematic exchange between a Federal agency and nonfederal organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exceptions to the general limits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The service limits and restrictions on refilling positions set out in this section do not apply when: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Positions involve intermittent or seasonal work, and employment in the same or a successor position under one or more appointing authorities totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), excluding overtime, in a service year. The service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the employee's initial appointment in the agency. Should employment in a position filled under this exception total 6 months or more in any service year, the general limits set out in this section will apply to subsequent extension or reappointment unless OPM approves continued exception under this section. An individual may be employed for training for up to 120 days following initial appointment and up to 2 weeks a year thereafter without regard to the service year limitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Positions are filled under an authority established for the purpose of enabling the appointees to continue or enhance their education, or to meet academic or professional qualification requirements. Such authorities include those set out in paragraphs (p), (q), (v), (w), and (jj) of section 213.3102 of this part and authorities granted to individual agencies for use in connection with internship, fellowship, residency, or student programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) OPM approves extension of specific temporary appointments beyond 2 years (24 months total service) when necessitated by major reorganizations or base closings or other rare and unusual circumstances. Requests based on major reorganization, base closing, restructuring, or other unusual circumstances that apply agencywide must be made by an official at the headquarters level of the Department or agency. Requests involving extension of appointments to a specific position or project based on other unusual circumstances may be submitted by the employing office to the appropriate OPM service center. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 316_TEMPORARY AND TERM EMPLOYMENT <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

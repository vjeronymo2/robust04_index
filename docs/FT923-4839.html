			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Arts: Olga Borodina - Edinburgh International Festival THOSE who left Edinburgh before the final week must be kicking themselves. By accident, the festival brought together two recitals of Russian song and one of them proved to be unforgettable: when people look back on the 1992 festival, they will remember it as the year that Olga Borodina sang Tchaikovsky. Before she appeared, however, there was an unplanned curtain-raiser. Dawn Upshaw had cancelled a recital and her place was taken by Elena Prokina, a young soprano from Odessa, who had already appeared this year in concert. By starting with a selection of Tchaikovsky arias, she neatly fitted in with the festival theme and presented her shining Slavic timbre to good advantage. She has an appealing stage presence and her Rachmaninov songs, with Iain Burnside the pianist, were natural, genuinely felt, and often beautiful. By the end of the next morning, however, her recital had been blown out of the mind. Olga Borodina made her first Edinburgh festival appearances in concert last year. At one, which included fragments of Musorgsky's unfinished operas, she sang what was in effect a soprano part and surprised audiences expecting to hear a deep Russian mezzo with the gleaming ease of her top notes. The capabilities of her voice were thus already known. What could not have been predicted was the intensity of her singing in recital. Long pauses intervened between the songs, as Borodina prepared herself, exchanging nods and thoughtful glances with her pianist, Larissa Gergieva. If that is what it takes to summon such spell-binding concentration, it was worth it. The programme at the Queen's Hall was all Tchaikovsky. In theory, an ominous proposition, likely to be burdened with a preponderance of slow and morose music; in performance, a revelation. Borodina has the crucial recitalist's gift of being able to create for each song a mood of its own and - no less important - to focus her attention on the moment that holds the essence of what it has to say. Even 'None but the lonely heart' came across with new force. In her final group, two songs were outstanding. For 'Night', in which Tchaikovsky fearfully peers into the blackest depths of depression, the singer called up her darkest, deepest contralto tone, a searing sound that is descriptive of Russian suffering in all its forms. To follow that with 'Once again, as before, I am alone', sung in a plaintive and hollow voice, as though in the grip of intense pain, was almost too much to bear. At last the festival's theme felt complete: the whole tragic story of Tchaikovsky, the man and musician, was here. As for Olga Borodina, it is hard to believe that she is at the outset of an international career. This young Russian is already an impressive recitalist. One trembles to think what heights she might scale in the years to come.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SCHOOL WORKSHOP HELPS IMMIGRANTS  </P> <P> Assembled in a circle, a group of students enthusiastically performed "The  Hokey Pokey" in a crowded cafeteria last week. This would not be an unusual  activity for kindergartners, but these were high school freshmen and the  teachers were only a year or two older than their pupils.  </P> <P> Ten young Latinos -- new members of a group called Future Leaders of America --  joined 70 new migrant students from Oxnard Unified School District at Camp  Sholom in Malibu for a three-day workshop held under FLA auspices.  </P> <P> Used as a warm-up for a full day of lectures, discussion groups and confidence  builders, the Hokey Pokey circle helped the immigrants drop their reserve. They  also learned some English.  </P> <P> Founder Gilbert Cuevas, who designs and runs program workshops, said the  Ventura County-based Future Leaders organization has helped 2,000 students in  six California counties get started on the right track. Dedicated to boosting  Latino achievement in school and community activities since 1980, FLA has seen  about 30% of those enrolled become involved in student government, Cuevas said.  Many have gone on to college.  </P> <P> But nothing pleases Cuevas more than seeing some of his program graduates  return to help run future camps as peer counselors.  </P> <P> Among the leaders was Veronica de la Cruz, a 16-year-old junior at Hueneme High  School. Drum major for a 45-pice marching band, de la Cruz had a 4.5  grade-point average in honors classes last quarter.  </P> <P> Her sophomore year was a different story. De la Cruz declined to say just how  low her grades fell last year, but she admitted that pulling them up to Cs was  "a major improvement." Attending FLA camp last summer has made a difference.  "They really helped me pick myself up," she said.  </P> <P> Her desire to give others a hand was obvious as she tackled the day.  </P> <P> Much of the migrant workshop revolved around pitfalls to avoid in adjusting to  a new culture, where women play more assertive roles and gangs await those who  lose touch with their families.  </P> <P> Friday's agenda included a skit by the young counselors on stereotypes to avoid  -- the clown, the angry cholo, the loner, the sex bomb. The students  alternately giggled, looked solemn or cast sidelong glances at their neighbors,  recognizing themselves or fellow students in the caricatures.  </P> <P> "It works," Cuevas said, "because these are not adults talking at them. When  the message comes from their peers, it touches them."  </P> <P> The process also touches the young leaders.  </P> <P> "I never expected anybody to look up to me," de la Cruz said. "But it means a  lot, from these kids. They really say it from the heart." JANET BERGAMO  </P></p>

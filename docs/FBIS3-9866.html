			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "We Are Going To Change the System of </F> Defense"]    [Text] When the new Ustasha state threatened us with a  repeat of genocide in the summer of 1990, we had to be the first  to start an uprising against those to whom the Serbs themselves,  through their superhuman struggle, and as if on a platter,  presented a state that they had not managed to create for 1,000  years.    The just struggle for the physical survival of the Serbian  people of Krajina has put back on the world political scene the  need for Serbian national unity, which was interrupted at the  end of 19th century and the beginning of 20th century. In this  I see the greatest contribution of the Krajina people to the  universal struggle of the Serbian people for national unity.    This is what, among other things, Milan Martic, president of  the republic of Serbian Krajina, said in an interview to VOJSKA  KRAJINE. Martic pointed out the following:    "Being positioned at the far western outpost of the Serbian  nation and surrounded by the hostile politics of Croatia, the  Serbs in Krajina have managed, over three years and with many  casualties, to withstand all the assaults of the Ustasha state  and to preserve their freedom. We have managed to create a  state with all the attributes of statehood except international  recognition. The world's politicians are already getting used  to this state as a reality, and I think that, regardless of  their wishes, Croatia's politicians will also have to respect it  because there will be no peace in these regions without that."  <H5>  Not Only Defensive </H5>   I expect, Martic says, that this year a solution will be  found to the clashes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia  and thereby to the question of the unification of Serbian  states. This was my election program and, even more important,  it was with such an orientation that we set off into this new  pan-Serbian struggle in which we have suffered huge losses for  the umpteenth time.    Nobody, including those of us who now lead the people, has  the right to betray these ideals that have moved our people into  new sufferings and self-denials. Pan-Serbian unification is our  strategic aim and our program. How we will implement that  strategy is another question. I think that the obstacles will  be huge and that a lot of political wisdom and skill, and a lot  of unity and patience will be needed to realize this great aim.    In reply to the question about the defense of the republic  of  Serbian Krajina, Martic said the following:    Our defense has so far been based on outdated and  inefficient  principles -- on the principle of armed people and defending of  one's own home. We mobilized almost all the citizens who could  fight but we nevertheless had poor results in some military  operations. A large proportion of the armed men were  disorganized and resorted to their own initiative, something  that can be fatal in war. Therefore, changes that will  fundamentally modify the defense system are needed. On the one  hand, we will be working on creating a professional core of the  army, which will consist of mobile and stable maneuver units,  well equipped and paid. Such units would be able to perform all  tasks, be it defending an section of our territory under attack  or dealing a blow to the enemy where he is most sensitive. We  must no longer exclusively base our defense on a defensive  strategy, that is, on defending the regions under attack.    On the other hand, our global policy will be directed toward  creating conditions for peace, above all through political  negotiations with the side at war. We can enter these  negotiations only if we have forces that the enemy respects.  <H5>  The Return of Officers </H5>   According to some people, professionalization in the army,  in  the way it should be, will weaken our defense force, which is  completely wrong. As I have already said, now we only have  armed people, but that cannot be considered a real army. The  working population will still be military reservists who, if  need be, can be mobilized at any moment.    It is important to distribute the load of war more equally  among all republic of Serbian Krajina citizens. When I say  this I mean that all those who have so far not felt the war  should in a way in the future be included in what we call the  united defense system. As regards deserters, there are measures  to deal with them, and as regards private entrepreneurs, we have  nothing against them doing their job, but they should also  perform their duties in defense.    One component upon which we will build our defense system is  good cooperation with the armed forces of the Srpska republic  and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Now we can create a  model of armed forces that may be a basis for a united army in  the future joint state. For this, of course, we need the help  and cooperation of military and civilian structures in other  Serbian lands. As regards this help, it has never been lacking  so far. However, we must insist on the return of all militarily  fit citizens who are in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]  at the moment. Officers are particularly valuable to us and, in  this regard, we have received understanding among the FRY  authorities in helping us have these people return to the  Krajina.</p>

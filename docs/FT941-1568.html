			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / International Company News: Gerstner to unveil IBM recovery plan Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive of International Business Machines, is expected to unveil his strategies to return the ailing computer company to profitable growth at a meeting with analysts in New York tomorrow. For the past eight months IBM has been conducting a 'thorough and detailed review' of its operations and Mr Gerstner is expected to discuss the preliminary results of that review. Industry analysts are anticipating a frank discussion of IBM's problems and Mr Gerstner's plans to solve them but its executives are attempting to temper high expectations for his presentation. 'The only way he could exceed expectations is by ascending through the ceiling at the end of his presentation,' joked Mr James Cannavino, IBM senior vice-president for strategy and development. However, Mr Mark Stahlman of New Media Associates, a New York industry consulting group, said: 'He should unveil a broad set of initiatives in both the businesses the company is currently addressing and some new business areas.' In particular, IBM watchers are anxious to hear how Mr Gerstner plans to address the problems of its shrinking mainframe computer business. Last year sales of IBM's mainframes declined by 27.6 per cent to Dollars 10bn. Similarly, analysts anticipate some direction from Mr Gerstner on the company's storage products division, which has seen its sales decline by 18 per cent over the past year to Dollars 5.1bn. IBM also needs to find ways to make its Dollars 9.7bn personal computer business more profitable and to boost earnings from its growing services business, which also recorded revenues of Dollars 9.7bn last year, an increase of 32 per cent. The ailing computer company must also make decisions about investments in new semiconductor production, the core technology of its hardware products, and assigning research and development funds to new areas of potential growth. Mr Gerstner is also expected to announce new initiatives to address the emerging market for broadband multimedia communications. Yet the first public discussion of Mr Gerstner's strategic plans for IBM since he joined the company almost 12 months ago, is certain to receive broad attention from its customers as well as industry analysts.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Lloyd's wins court ruling LLOYD'S of London yesterday won a move to have a legal dispute between it and several hundred Names transferred to the Commercial Court. The Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting at the insurance market - seek injunctions to stop Lloyd's drawing on their deposits to meet cash calls. They had wanted the case to be heard in Chancery Court. Judge Mervyn Davies refused Mr Michael Freeman, the solicitor for the Names, automatic leave to appeal against the decision. Mr Freeman said last night: 'It would be a waste of time to appeal the decision. We really want to get on with it.' He said Chancery was the most appropriate court to consider the case because of its trust implications. Lloyd's argued that the Commercial Court had most experience of dealing with these matters. The case will go to the Queens Bench, but Lloyd's said yesterday that subsequent transfer to the Commercial Court would be a formality. Hearings in the case, in which about 720 Names have issued motions for injunction against members' agents, are due to take place at the end of this month. Lloyd's said yesterday that 300 syndicates named in a suit brought by 91 US Names were seeking to have the case thrown out. The Names allege that Lloyd's had breached securities laws and legislation against racketeering in the US. The syndicates say they cannot be sued because they are not legal entities. Meanwhile, Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, has consented to make available to members comprehensive details of the composition of Lloyd's syndicates. In a letter to Sir William Clark MP, Mr Coleridge said Lloyd's would give all members access to 'information about the number of working and external Names on every syndicate and the aggregate values of those participating for each of the last six years'.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / US rethink on drugs THE Clinton administration yesterday unveiled a new drug control policy that it said would concentrate government efforts on reducing hard-core drug use, instead of curbing casual use, writes George Graham in Washington. Mr Lee Brown, director of the White House's office of national drug control policy, said hard-core users not only accounted for most of the consumption of such drugs as cocaine or heroine, but also caused most of the social disruption and violence linked to drugs. The policy would also aim, Mr Brown said, more at the treatment of drug use as a medical problem, and not just on law enforcement. The new policies have already come under fire from both sides of the debate. Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, accused Mr Clinton of a 'tragic abdication of leadership' and 'slipping inexorably into the old permissiveness.' But Mr Kevin Zeese of the Drug Policy Foundation, which advocates drugs reform, complained the administration might talk about increasing emphasis on treatment, but was still devoting most money to law enforcement.</p>

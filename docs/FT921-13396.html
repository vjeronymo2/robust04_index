			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Daley eyes Dollars 10bn regional airport project: A look at the competition for the siting of a 200,000-job public works bonanza MR Richard Daley, the mayor of Chicago, is fighting to win the public works project of a lifetime - a huge new international airport. The mayor is using Chicago's considerable political clout to gain approval for his preferred site for the project, which is competing with four others. Mr Daley's choice of Lake Calumet, an area on the city's largely delapidated south-east side, would carry a price tag of more than Dollars 10bn and generate as many as 200,000 jobs. With the city's tradition of patronage, this is a politician's public works bonanza. This week a bi-state policy committee, composed of four officials from the state of Illinois, four from Indiana and three from Chicago, is expected to decide on the site of the new airport. It is aimed at supplementing O'Hare, the world's busiest airport, and Midway, the city's oldest airfield, to absorb air traffic growth over the next three decades. The other contenders are: an expansion of an existing airport in Gary, Indiana; or three greenfield sites - Kankakee and Peotone in Illinois and Beecher, on the border of the two states. Six votes are needed for selection of the site, which means that Mr Daley is expected to try to cut some sort of deal with the delegations of either Illinois or Indiana. All the other sites would be cheaper to build, but Chicago has argued that none offers the proximity to as large a number of potential passengers as Lake Calumet. In a recent report on its proposal, Chicago points out that Dulles International Airport, located 26 miles outside Washington DC has failed to perform well as a public investment because of its distance from the centre of the city. Those who oppose the Lake Calumet site say that it will be too costly - the official consulting report of the committee puts the price at Dollars 17.7bn, rather higher than Chicago's estimate - and that it will cause the most dislocation of residents. According to the official study, some 10,200 residences with 27,400 people are directly in the development area of Lake Calumet. Development at Gary, the other urban site, would affect 9,200 residences and 24,700 people. Any of the other sites affect fewer than 1,500 people. For Lake Calumet it would be an opportunity to clean up Chicago's most heavily-polluted area. It has 13 hazardous waste sites, 15 landfills and some 27 random dumps. Despite the fact that pollution tops the concerns of local residents about their neighbourhoods, there are some groups organised to fight the location of the airport there. Many are loath to move from homes they have lived in all their lives. Some of those who will not have to be relocated object because of the expected noise and air pollution. Mayor Daley is already being pressured by residents near O'Hare who are resisting plans to build an additional runway there. O'Hare operates at capacity, handling over 60m passengers annually. Chicago is keen to retain its historical role as the main US transportation hub. Since the days of riverboat and railroad travel during the 19th century, Chicago has been America's premier transportation nexus. It fears that it will lose some of its economic edge if it cannot accommodate the growth in air traffic demand. Aviation demand in the region is forecast to rise to 73.8m in originating and connecting passengers by the year 2010 and to 90m by 2020. A regional study in the summer of 1989 showed additional air carrier capacity would be needed or the area would begin to lose significant amounts of traffic to other major metropolitan hubs. Denver is the only American city to undertake construction of a big airport since the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport was built in the early 1970s. O'Hare has brought prosperity to the northern area of the city, as businesses related to air transport, those that service it or are in need of it cluster there. Mayor Daley hopes that the same could occur in Chicago's depressed south-eastern corner. But he clearly also has his eye on the political dividends such a project will pay.</p>

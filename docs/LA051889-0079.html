			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> No Results From Gibraltar Financial: The Beverly Hills-based parent of  Gibraltar Savings said that it is not able to release its financial results for  the quarter ended March 31 and that it cannot predict when, if ever, it will  have enough information to allow it to prepare financial statements that fairly  represent the company's condition. Gibraltar Savings has been placed in  conservatorship by federal regulators, and Gibraltar Financial said its access  to information has been severely restricted as a result.  </P></p>

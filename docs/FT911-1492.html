			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Books: Genius with a capital G - Goethe: The Poet And The Age, Volume 1, 1749-1790 by Nicholas Boyle Oxford Pounds 25, 807 pages HERE IS a biographical marathon, comparable in size to Ackroyd's Dickens and Holroyd's Shaw, but with much firmer control over the vast material. It is a most rewarding run for anyone, German-speaking or not, prepared to summon the stamina. The course begins in 18th century Frankfurt where Goethe was brought-up by his affluent, self-made father. Papa Goethe's early ambitions for his son lay in the law, which Goethe studied in Leipzig. He was also encouraged to travel and become an educated man. This takes him - and us - to various parts of what was still the Holy Roman Empire and to Switzerland, after which the volume is concerned with Goethe's existence in the Thuringian duchy of Saxe-Weimar. Goethe stayed there for much of his life, and this big volume, sub-titled The Poetry of Desire (1749-1790), is only half of the story. He is 40 when it ends, and he lived into his 80s. Part two, The Age of Renunciation, 1790-1832, is 'forthcoming'. When that appears, the pair of volumes will surely stand for many years as the definitive biography. Goethe was the first German literary man of universal importance. He wrote prose, poetry, fiction, drama (plays such as Faust, Goetz von Berlichingen, Iphigenia, Tasso, written primarily to be read rather than performed), travel-reporting, autobiography, letters. He excelled at all these genres, being adept in a wide variety of styles. Like Shakespeare, he unlocked the hidden resources of his native language for literature. He was the also the first German writer to be regarded by his contemporaries, and to regard himself, as a Genius with a capital G. He is a genius 'from top to toe' said one contemporary, implying that Goethe was 'incapable of acting arbitrarily'. Not only did Goethe have this impact on his own circle and on the wider public, he brought himself - more precisely, the Self - into literature in a revolutionary fashion. After publication of The Sorrows of Young Werther in 1774, which made an enormous stir - young men committed suicide in droves in emulation of its hero - practically everything Goethe did and said was recorded by someone. To escape from his own cult Goethe left mercantile Frankfurt and the world of his parents for aristocratic Weimar. He became a courtier, a Privy Counsellor, an administrator. After a while he was raised in rank and put von in front of his name. His elevation enabled him to take on greater responsibilities. These included managing a mining project at Ilmenau, negotiating with other ducal principalities, attending committees concerned with public works and finance. He was well-paid for these non-literary labours, but Goethe did not thereby neglect his own writing. In his first period at Weimar he combined his official functions with the composition of several of his most famous works. One thinks of the American poet Wallace Stevens working full-time as a top executive of the Hartford insurance company or Eliot in charge of the foreign department at Lloyds Bank. Soon after he arrived in Weimar, Goethe started a relationship with a respectable Weimar lady, Frau Charlotte von Stein. Back home he had had his youthful flings with women - see Werther - but this affair was strictly platonic, taking the form of incessant letter-writing though the two parties lived within walking-distance of each other. Although highly attractive to women, Goethe deliberately abstained from sex during his early years in Weimar. He broke that long fast at the end of his time in Rome with an obscure young Italian woman. The precise details have here eluded Boyle. Only when Goethe returned to Weimar aged nearly 40 did he enter into a long-term sexual relationship. As the book ends, his mistress has born him a son but Goethe is not yet married to her. Hearing of the affair, Frau von Stein angrily breaks off communications, and then demands the return of all her letters. The Italian expedition permitted Goethe to indulge not only his love of women and the company of artists like Tischbein and Angelica Kauffmann, but also his love of painting and drawing; and it provided material for one of his most accessible books, translated several times into English, the Italian Journey. That journey represented the second great change of environment for Goethe described in this volume. It was one that had just as far-reaching consequences for his work as the first. In discussing these, Boyle places Goethe's poetry and fiction in various cultural contexts - philosophic, scientific, political - all of which over-lapped in a period astonishingly rich in intellectual development. Boyle also interrupts the flow of the biographical narrative to reconstruct the process of composition of each of Goethe's outpourings, with further comments on each work in more general terms. Some of the key terms stem from attitudes common to both English and German literature. Thus the English reader who is not at home in German has a few points of orientation. The word 'sentimental', for instance, is frequently cited, not in its modern pejorative sense, but in the sense Sterne implied in his title, A Sentimental Journey, meaning someone who reacts to everything he sees from the heart. Taken over by Goethe and his fellow writers, this kind of sentimental approach to life points to the literary movement known as German Sentimentalism. Some of its attitudes then re-appeared in Storm and Stress, the vogue-style that dominated much of the period. Another English writer who had a great influence in Germany was Defoe, particularly Robinson Crusoe. Although the hero of this novel is not a sentimentalist, he is 'the central point from which all structural lines radiate outwards', comparable to the monad in the philosophy of Leibniz - a concept crucial to much German imaginative writing in this period. These gross simplifications of Boyle's subtle but never obscure line of exposition will perhaps give an indication of the richness of thought to be sampled in this book. It is a major contribution to the history of ideas in addition to revealing, in much greater detail than hitherto, the extraordinary story of Goethe's life.</p>

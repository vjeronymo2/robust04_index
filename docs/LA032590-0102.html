			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DECLARATION' CAUSES OUTPOURING OF DEEPLY DIVIDED OPINIONS  </P> <P> Gosh, your lesbian piece was really on key and wonderfully done.  </P> <P> You also managed to cram into the back part of the article a bunch of good info  on us male gays and the lesbian/gay situation in general.  </P> <P> Truly, the "New Gays," as I tend to call the kids in their teens and 20s who  are coming out these days (I'm 44), seem to come out more easily and into a  space we made for them. As a result, their personalities look more  straightforward because they have spent less time hiding from any part of life.  </P> <P> JAMES BAKER  </P> <P> Tecate  </P></p>

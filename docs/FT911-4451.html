			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Boddington bids Pounds 127.7m for Devenish BODDINGTON, the pubs, hotels and health-care group, yesterday launched a Pounds 127.7m hostile takeover bid for JA Devenish, the West Country brewer, aimed at merging the two businesses into 'a powerful independent force in drinks retailing'. If the move were successful, Boddington would add 400 pubs to its 490, giving it increased buying power and a strong base for further expansion. Pub retailing contributes more than 80 per cent to the trading profits of each company. Devenish, which last week sold its 4 per cent stake in Boddington, rejected the offer as 'unwelcome and wholly inadequate.' Boddington is offering 10 new ordinary shares for every seven Devenish shares, valuing each Devenish share at about 233p. There is a full cash alternative of 210p per Devenish share as well as a convertible offer. Boddington said that the offer had been accepted by Mr TJ Hedderson, a former Devenish director, and his family, for their 3.3 per cent holding. Devenish shares closed yesterday at 232p, up 12p. Boddington's shares fell 6p, closing at 157p. Devenish, which reported an almost 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.26m last year, has since restructured its management and is reviewing its brewing business. Its brewery in Redruth, Cornwall, lost Pounds 200,000 last year. It has been operating well below capacity because of problems in developing Devenish's Newquay Steam beer as a national brand. Mr Denis Cassidy, Boddington's chairman, said that this strategy was now discredited. Devenish had 'wasted millions of pounds of shareholders' money on ill-judged investments in brewing and brand development', he said. Boddington, which sold its breweries and beer brands to Whitbread for Pounds 50m two years ago, would dispose of Devenish's brewery if the bid succeeded. The benefits of Boddington's exit from brewing were reflected in a 23.6 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 20m last year, he said. The 1990s would provide 'excellent opportunities' for specialist pub retailers and the combination of the Boddington estate, mainly in north-west England, and Devenish's West Country pubs would yield benefits of scale. Mr John Clark, deputy chairman of Devenish, said that the bid would be strongly resisted. The offer reflected neither Devenish's current value nor its future prospects, he said. Lex, Page 24</p>

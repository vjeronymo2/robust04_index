			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Inspec gets Pounds 136m valuation Inspec, the speciality chemicals company which was the subject of a Pounds 40m management buy-in/buy-out from British Petroleum 18 months ago, will join the stock market with a valuation of Pounds 136.4m after a Pounds 49.5m issue of shares at 160p. The price set yesterday represents 18.4 times pro forma 1993 profits of Pounds 7.4m, including a full year from the flotation proceeds and recent US acquisition Allco. Mr John Hollowood, chairman, said the rating was a 20 per cent discount to the average of comparable speciality chemicals companies Allied Colloids, BTP and Yorkshire Chemicals. 'Its a fair price given that Inspec has no track record.' The notional dividend of 3.5p for 1993 gives a yield of 2.7 per cent which is in line with the sector. Of the shares on offer Pounds 32.2m have been placed firm with institutions and a further Pounds 17.3m are available to private investors through financial intermediaries. The issue is being handled by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, and stockbrokers Cazenove. COMMENT Inspec combines a handsome legacy from British Petroleum - including excellent facilities, market positions and operational management - with Mr Hollowood's proven ability to grow speciality chemicals businesses. The price has been set at a good discount to the sector - which has had a very strong run - though the pro forma profits for 1993 were boosted by the acquisition of Allco and a 20 per cent tax charge. This will rise only gradually over the two years and analysts are looking for earnings growth of around 15 per cent this year which cuts the rating to 16. The reception from institutions has been very good and the shares are likely to open at a healthy premium when trading starts on March 30.</p>

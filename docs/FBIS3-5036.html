On March 1, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department  confirmed that the remark of Hubbard, a senior U.S. Government  official, publicly demanding the repeal of the "NSL" reflects  the official position of the United States.    The South Korean authorities and the "Democratic Liberal  Party" side now are much upset by it, calling it an  "interference in their internal affairs".    Meanwhile, a spokesman for the opposition Democratic Party  of  South Korea in a commentary strongly demanded the authorities  repeal the "NSL", saying it is natural in view of universal  principles that the U.S. side manifested its official stand  urging the abrogation of the "NSL".</p>

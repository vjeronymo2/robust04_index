			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Eridania chairman forecasts advance NET earnings at Eridania, the Italian agro-industrial company controlled by Ferruzzi group, should rise this year, although probably not by as much as the 12 per cent forecast at the operating level, said Mr Renato Picco, chairman, writes Haig Simonian. Speaking on the eve of the Verona agricultural fair, Mr Picco stressed that the improved profits would mean this year's dividend would be at least maintained. However, he remained cautious as to the possibilities of a dividend increase. Eridania's full figures and dividend will be released later this month. Mr Picco said sales had climbed to 'just under L10,100bn (Dollars 8.03bn)' from L9,165bn in 1990, while gross operating profits had grown by around 15 per cent to over L1,000bn.</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Bangemann wants treaty change MR Martin Bangemann, the European Commission vice-president with responsibility for the internal market and industrial affairs, yesterday proposed that amendments to the Treaty of Rome should be approved by a qualified majority of EC member states rather than by a unanimous vote, writes Paul Betts from Berlin. He told a Financial Times conference in Berlin that it would be undemocratic to give up the Maastricht treaty just because of a rejection by one member state. The EC would be in an impossible position if it was eventually enlarged to incorporate 24 states and yet only one of these could block any widely agreed amendment. He proposed the introduction of a rule to enable approval of Treaty of Rome amendments by a qualified majority of two-thirds of member states. Meanwhile, he said, the Maastricht ratification process should continue.</p>

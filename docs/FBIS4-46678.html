			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Directive No. 44-r of 10 January 1994: On Procedure for </F> Coordinating the Reorganization of Check Investment Funds"]    [Text] On 10 January 1994 the State Committee on  Administration of State Property of Russia issued Directive No.  44-r "On Procedure for Coordinating the Reorganization of Check  Investment Funds." This directive established the procedure for  merging and consolidating check investment funds which should be  implemented in coordination with the State Committee on  Administration of State Property of Russia or with the  corresponding committee on administration of state property  which has issued the license to the fund.    This directive practically removes the problem of bankrupt  funds which for one reason or another are unable to continue  their activity in the future but have obligations to their  shareholders who have entrusted them with their privatization  checks. In practice this directive implements the procedure for  coordination of any reorganization of check investment funds  with the State Committee on Administration of State Property of  Russia or its territorial agency regarding questions of deciding  the future fate of the fund and its shareholders, thus  protecting their rights as stipulated by law.    The text of this directive is given below.  <H5>  Directive No. 44-r of 10 January 1994: On Procedure for </H5> Coordinating the Reorganization of Check Investment Funds    In compliance with point 45 of the Statute on Specialized  Privatization Investment Funds Accumulating Privatization Checks  of Citizens, approved by Edict No. 1186 of the President of the  Russian Federation of 7 October 1992, the following procedure  shall be established for reorganizing check investment funds:    1. The reorganization of the check investment fund  (hereinafter--fund) during the first three years of its activity  may be effected only through merging or consolidation in  coordination with the State Committee on Administration of State  Property of Russia or the corresponding committee for  administration of property that issued its license. Moreover,  all funds participating in the consolidation or merger shall be  reorganized.    2. The reorganization of the fund shall entail a transfer of  the rights and responsibilities of the fund to its successor.    3. Reorganization in the form of merger shall be effected  through merger of the assets of one fund and the assets of the  other with an equivalent exchange of shares and merger of the  balance sheets. Reorganization in the form of consolidation  shall be a unification of the controlling blocks of shares of  the funds and transfer of the property rights and  responsibilities of each of them to the fund that appears as a  result of the consolidation.    4. In order for the question of the reorganization of a  check  investment fund to be considered, the applicant must submit to  the State Committee on Administration of State Property of  Russia or the corresponding committee for management of property  the following documents:    --an application with an indication of the justification and  conditions for the reorganization signed by the chairman of the  council of directors;    --the license issued to the fund by the State Committee on  Administration of State Property of Russia or the Committee on  Administration of State Property;    --the resolution of the general meeting of shareholders  concerning reorganization of the fund adopted by a simple  majority of votes of those present at the meeting of  shareholders with a quorum;    --the original founding documents of the reorganized fund;    --properly prepared copies of agreements with the manager  and  the depository of the reorganized fund;    --a financial report of the reorganized fund as of the  moment  of the submission of the application on a form approved by the  Statute on Specialized Privatization Investment Forms  Accumulating Privatization Checks of Citizens, and verified by  an independent auditor.    The aforementioned documents shall be submitted by the funds  participating in the consolidation or merger. If funds are  consolidated, the existing licenses of various committees on  administration of state property and an application from them  shall be submitted to the State Committee on Administration of  State Property of Russia.    In the event the documents or applications are not submitted  at the same time or if even one of the aforementioned  participants submits documents in violation of the requirements  enumerated above, the applications of all the funds  participating in the reorganization shall be returned without  being considered.    5. The State Committee on Administration of State Property  of  Russia or the committee on administration of property shall be  obligated to consider the application and make a decision on  acceptance or rejection of the reorganization of the fund no  later than 25 days from the day the application is submitted. In  exceptional cases this time period may be extended by a decision  of the State Committee on Administration of State Property of  Russia or the committee on administration of property that  considers the application.    When handing down the aforementioned decision the committee  shall conduct an inspection for:    a) observance of the rights and legitimate interests of the  shareholders of the reorganized funds, taking into account the  restrictions envisioned in point 4 of the Statute on Specialized  Investment Privatization Funds;    b) possible concealment by the funds of the result of their  reorganization of their bankruptcy or credit indebtedness.    In the event of the discovery of such cases the committee on  administration of property shall have the right to refuse to  allow the fund to reorganize.    6. The consent for reorganization of the fund shall be  documented by a directive of the State Committee on  Administration of State Property of Russia or the corresponding  committee on administration of property, which shall reflect the  following issues:    --the annulment of the license and the public prospectus for  emission of the consolidated or merged funds;    --merger of the assets and balance sheets of the fund with  the corresponding instruction to the reorganized fund;    --time periods and procedure for exchange of shares of the  consolidated or merged funds;    --the corresponding changes and additions to the founding  documents and also, if necessary, to the prospectus for emission  of the reorganized fund;    --forwarding of the original founding documents of the fund  with changes and additions to organs that conduct state  registration.    7. Upon receipt of permission to reorganize, the fund must  within 10 days:    a) submit to state registration organs the corresponding  application for making changes and additions to the founding  documents and a copy of the directive on its reorganization;    b) notify shareholders in writing of its merger or  consolidation and publish the corresponding notification of this  in the open press.    The notification and public notice of the reorganization  must  indicate the location of the successor of the fund and the form  (means) of exchange of shares or certificates of the reorganized  fund for shares or certificates of its legal successor.    8. The committee on administration of state property must,  within three days after the publication of the directive  specified in point 6, send to the Main Administration on  Invested Funds of the State Committee on Administration of State  Property of Russia the following information in order to make  changes in the consolidated register of investment funds:    --the name of the consolidated fund;    --the number and date of the cancellation of the license;    --the form or reorganization;    --information about the fund to which it has been joined;    --a copy of the directive.    In the event of a consolidation, information is provided on  all consolidated funds and the newly created fund resulting from  this consolidation.    9. The fund shall be considered reorganized from the moment  it is removed from the state register.    [Signed] First Deputy Chairman A.I. Ivanenko</p>

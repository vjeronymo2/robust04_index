			<p>BFN     [Text] Malaysia's trade surplus improved 71.1 percent to RM  [Malaysian ringgit] 3.8 billion in 1993 from RM2.2 billion the  previous year.    As for the month of December 1993, a trade surplus of  RM388.6  million was recorded from deficits of RM850.2 million and  RM479.6 million in October and November 1993 respectively.    The December surplus was, however, 50.5 percent off the  RM785.4 million surplus recorded in December 1992, the  Department of Statistics said.    The continued higher surplus in 1993 was attributed mainly  to  buoyant growth in exports which expanded 16.9 percent to RM121.2  billion compared with imports which expanded 15.8 percent to  RM117.4 billion.    The main export increases were manufactured goods (up 32.7  percent), machinery and transport equipment (up 29.6 percent),  and miscellaneous manufactured articles (up 9.7 percent).    The growth in imports was mainly contributed by machinery  and  transport equipment imports which expanded 18.4 percent and  manufactured goods (up 10.7 percent).    Machinery and transport equipment and manufactured goods  accounted for 70.7 percent of total imports in 1993.    The department said earnings from major primary commodities  showed a mixed performance against strong growth for exports of  manufactured products.    Commodities which recorded higher export revenues were  thermionic valves and tubes, photocells, and others which rose  30.4 percent, while crude petroleum exports dropped 12.1 percent.</p>

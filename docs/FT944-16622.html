			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: News Corp to modify status of new shares Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has bowed to investor pressure and agreed to modify its plan for a one-for-two issue of limited voting preference shares. News directors announced yesterday that the international media company would proceed with the issue but make two important alterations to the status of the proposed new shares. The changes, to be put to shareholders by January 1995, provide that: The new preference shares would receive a dividend premium of at least 20 per cent over the company's ordinary shares. The new shares would participate, on the same basis as ordinary shares, in any takeover bid for the company. Directors said the changes would be inserted in the company's articles of association, and followed consideration of comments from the investment community since the preference share issue was announced on September 30. They pointed out that the new preference shares would carry an annual dividend of 7.5 Australian cents, and the proposed 20 per cent premium would therefore not take effect until the ordinary dividend reached 6.25 cents a share. There was 'no present intention' of increasing the 3 cents-a-share annual dividend for ordinary shares. The proposed new articles will also build in a protection if any takeover failed to include the new preference shares. In this event, any ordinary shares acquired would automatically convert to preferred limited voting ordinary shares. The alterations help to address the main concerns of News' institutional shareholders, some of whom perceived the new issue as a way for Mr Murdoch to entrench his control over the company. Others were more concerned that the preference issue might preface a large acquisition with consequent dilution of News earnings. News shares slid following the preference issue announcement last month, hitting a low of ADollars 7.72 on Australian stock exchanges, before recovering yesterday to close at ADollars 8.27. The initial price fall served as a warning that the proposed new preference shares could trade at a significant discount to the ordinaries, threatening to limit the size of future capital raisings by News. By guaranteeing a higher dividend and allowing the new shares to participate in any control premium for the company, News directors have provided encouragement for the preference shares to be priced closer to their ordinary counterparts, in spite of their non-voting status.</p>

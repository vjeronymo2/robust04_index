			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Leasing and Asset Finance (2): Lots of kick, little start - UK capital tax breaks are still needed PRESSURE IS mounting on the UK government to renew the special tax breaks on capital spending announced in last year's public spending statement as part of an effort to boost investment and economic recovery. The measures include a first-year depreciation allowance of 40 per cent on investment in plant and machinery undertaken in the 12 months to October this year. Thereafter the normal rate of 25 per cent would apply. A similar allowance of 20 per cent instead of the normal 4 per cent was established for spending on industrial buildings. Both measures run out at the end of this month. The aim was to encourage industry to move investment forward into this period in the hope of additional spending that would help kick-start the economy. But there are strong doubts about how effective the changes have been and such tinkering with the incentives remains highly controversial. One of the problems is that it is impossible to tell what would have happened if the reduction had not been in place. Some, such as the Confederation of British Industry, argue that investment could have been even lower without the concession. Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, argues, though, that the reduced rates 'appear to have been a signal failure'. He told a conference on the forthcoming budget organised jointly with Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, that he was opposed to their being renewed. 'If we were to do it, the greatest impact would be to give money to large companies who were going to invest anyway, rather than to stimulate new investment.' According to the IFS, the incentive to bring investment forward would also be reduced if the higher allowances were extended, because industry would start to think that more generous allowances were a permanent feature of the landscape. Yet, cancelling the concession has its drawbacks too. According to Mr Sudhir Junankar, deputy director of economics at the CBI, 'it would be counter-productive to take it off just when the recovery seems to be under way, when it's more likely to have an effect.' Indeed the CBI would like to see higher first year capital allowances made permanent. It sees this as a targeted way of promoting investment. As an accompanying measure it would like a 100 per cent capital allowance applied to the first Pounds 200,000 of investment which would be a special help for smaller companies. Such a change would not be an alternative to the more general stimulus of cutting interest rates, Mr Junankar says. That, as well as a determined attempt to cut public spending, is at the top of the CBI's general budget shopping list. But confirmation of a more generous approach to capital allowances is at the top of its list of more focused specific measures. Not surprisingly, the CBI's approach finds favour with Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation. His organisation, too, wants increased capital allowances made permanent. 'The taxation bias we have against investment is crazy and internationally uncompetitive, ' he says. Other countries allow for a shorter payback period in their approach to depreciation and some developing countries target specific industries for assistance, he says. This approach is markedly different from that underlying the former chancellor Mr Nigel (now Lord) Lawson's reform of corporation tax, launched in 1984. That held that a lower overall rate of corporation tax was more beneficial to industry than specific breaks for individual sectors. Mr Johnson argues that such an approach lacks focus. Everyone benefits, but in relative terms it is of greater advantage to labour intensive service industries and works against the interests of capital intensive manufacturing. It remains to be seen whether such arguments convince the Treasury to extend the benefit. There has not been much tangible evidence so far that it has stimulated investment. One possible reason cited by the IFS is that most companies finance new investment from retained earnings rather than from borrowed money. The interest on borrowings is tax-deductible, but increased capital allowances do not help in cutting the cost of using internally generated capital. Admittedly, it is possible that figures for the third quarter of 1993 will show some resurgence as companies rush to beat the eligibility deadline. In that case, there may also be a risk of the recovery appearing to falter around the turn of the year as investment levels fall back. It is more likely, though, that increased allowances have failed to stimulate activity primarily because companies simply have not felt particularly inclined to invest much over the past year. Not only is there generally a large surplus of capacity in industry; the course of demand has been difficult to forecast and confidence has been low. So perhaps the concessions were simply introduced in the wrong year. The experience of 1984-86, when time-limited concessions on capital investment were also in effect, was rather different. The evidence then was that they did stimulate investment, although it is less clear whether this simply involved bringing forward investment that was already planned. Leaving them in place for another year might finally do the trick, now that confidence is recovering. The flaw in this argument, though, is that it suggests concessions on capital allowances will have an impact only when companies are planning to invest anyway. 'So far capital spending is proving to be one of the last things in the domestic economy to turn round,' says Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Warburg Securities. There is a large amount of unused capacity in the economy, but real rates of return are relatively high for this stage in the cycle and corporate cash flow is improving. That might mean the chancellor does not need to extend the special allowances. 'We do still see the capital expenditure accelerator kicking in at some stage,' Mr Gardiner says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BUSINESS FINANCE FIGURES (POUNDS m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Jan-Sep 1993   Jan-Sep 1992          Change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                        9,891          9,400           +5.2% Leasing                      5,555          5,729           -3.0% Hire purchase                4,335          3,671          +18.1%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Direct finance Finance leasing              4,136          4,426           -8.6% Operating leasing              765            647          +18.2% Hire purchase                2,370          1,911          +24.0% Other loans                    244            222           +9.9% Purchase mortgage               69             53          +30.4%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Point of sale                2,307          2,141           +7.7%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures have been rounded up so they may not add up exactly Source: Finance and Leasing Association  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

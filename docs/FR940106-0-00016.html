A number of the revisions are required by the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1992, including provisions on: participation by foreign companies in ATP; the establishment of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act; and a new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures'' be industry-led. Further, requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under ATP have been repealed by the Act, and are thus removed from the regulations. Similarly, ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations has been repealed. Also, changes not required by the Act are made, including changes to simplify and clarify the selection criteria, and to streamline the internal operations of ATP, including the selection process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is effective on January 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> George A.

The Advanced Technology Program assists United States businesses to carry out high-risk research and development that will, if successful, improve the competitive position of the United States and its businesses by accelerating the development of technologies that have significant potential to stimulate economic growth, and raise productivity. ATP enters into cooperative agreements with United States joint research and development ventures and United States businesses, especially small businesses. Where appropriate, Federal laboratories may be involved in ATP projects consistent with other authority, such as cooperative research and development agreements under section 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Description of the Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Changes to part 295 include revisions on the following topics (please see the analysis of comments below for additional details): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The eligibility of foreign firms to participate in ATP is addressed in a new section 295.3 of the regulations, and a related definition of ``United States owned company'' is added in section 295.2(r). These revisions follow the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(9)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The establishment of a patent policy different from the government-wide policy set out by the Bayh-Dole Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;517, as amended) is set out at section 295.8(a). These revisions follow the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(d)(11)). That statute requires that title to inventions made in whole or part with Program funds reside with for-profit companies that have been incorporated in the United States. Entities that are not for-profit organizations incorporated in this country are not eligible to obtain title to inventions made under the Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A new requirement that ``joint research and development ventures'' be industry-led, set out at &sect;&sect;295.2(i) and 295.21, and the repeal of ATP authority to provide direct funding to independent research organizations, set out at &sect;295.30. These revisions follow the requirements of section 201(c)(2) and section 201(c)(4), respectively, of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991 (15 U.S.C. 278n(b)(1) and (b)(2)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Requirements for royalty-sharing by ATP recipients with the Federal government for inventions funded under ATP have been repealed, and are thus removed from existing &sect;295.7(c) of the regulations. This revision follows the requirements of section 201(c)(6) of the American Technology Preeminence Act of 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Finally, changes not required by the Act are made to the selection criteria, and to the internal operations of ATP, including the selection process. These changes particularly include revisions to the remaining definitions in &sect;295.2, changes to the selection process described in &sect;&sect;295.4 and 295.5, changes to the selection criteria as set out in &sect;295.6, and changes to program administration found in &sect;&sect;295.7 and 295.14. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television If you have been out of the country for a few years, tonight provides a chance to catch up on what you missed on television. BBC1 shows a repeat episode of Lovejoy (8.00), the series about a canny antique dealer. BBC2 repeats an episode of Rough Guide To Careers (7.30) covering money jobs: accountant, croupier, and so on. It also repeats the 'ScreenPlay' drama Journey To Knock (9.00) which contrives to squeeze laughs out of miracle cures; and its programme about Hugh McDiarmid, Rebel Poet (11.15). ITV screens repeats of the top-rated, slushy The Darling Buds of May (8.00) and of Ridley Scott's visually striking 1982 futuristic movie Blade Runner (9.00). Channel 4 has repeats of the excellent American comedy The Golden Girls (10.00), the less than excellent comedy Absolutely (10.30) and the uninspired Sticky Moments On Tour With Julian Cary (1.30). Evening's best bet, if last week's programme is any guide, will be BBC2's States Of Mind (8.10) which shows how a small lumberjacking community in Oregon reacts to a remote government decision to declare the northern spotted owl an endangered species.</p>

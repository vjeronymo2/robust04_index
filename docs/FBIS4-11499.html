			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori has personally forced a cameraman from a foreign  television station to erase part of the film he took of women  inmates during a visit made by Fujimori to a Peruvian prison.    The Association of Foreign Journalists in Peru (APEP) said  in  a communique released today that this event "is an isolated act  of censorship against freedom of the press, which should not be  allowed to be repeated." The communique adds that the cameraman  "was forced by the president himself to erase part of the film  taken during his visit" to the prison for terrorists in  Yanamayo, Puno Department, at the Bolivian border.    According to the communique, the film that was erased  includes footage of a group of women inmates, who read a  document related to their situation in the presence of the  visitors. The communique says "the correspondents and the world  were thus deprived of information of public interest, when there  was not even a warning of any restrictions" on the  correspondents who visited the prison.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Snowy wastes focus the mind - William Packer on the Canadian exhibition at the Barbican The True North is the self-consciously evocative, not to say portentous title of the exhibition that now fills the upper tier of the Barbican Art Gallery (until June 16: sponsored by The Daily Telegraph and Air Canada). But while its sub-title, 'Canadian landscape painting 1896 - 1939', might well give us pause, with thoughts inevitable of something more frozen, dull and provincial than exciting, for once the more hopeful expectation is not disappointed. As is so often the case with national schools, Canadian painting has been for far too long too well-kept a secret, to the general loss. What the Barbican now offers us is quite simply, within its own terms, as intriguing and physically enjoyable a show of well-made, honest paintings as we could wish for. The study of art is littered in paradox, not the least of them that which suggests that the more national, even local the work might be, the wider its general interest and significance. So steeped are we in the idea of Paris as the very heart of modernism through all its earlier phases, that we too easily accept that franco-centric reading at its own self-valuation, seeing everything else as but second-hand, second-best and provincial. But, paradox again, Paris was indeed at the heart of things, and artists came from across the world to see and respond to what was being done, and measure their own art by its standards. The traffic was ever all ways, and in the first decades of this century many of these expatriates clearly held much in common in that was quite distinct from Paris. The more worldly and knowing, the more true to themselves they were. The Canadians were no exception in this, but they might as well have been Scots or Scandinavians, Spaniards or Mexicans, Americans or even Japanese. The mistake was only to forget, or rather discount the fact that artists went on working wherever they were, thinking of home when they were in Paris, and quite often remembering Paris when they were home. But while this question of national self-identity is common-place, it is true that it has concerned Canadians to a peculiar degree. The looming, over-bearing presence of the US, the sense of existing along a narrow southern fringe with, at their back, the immense wilderness stretching endlessly away to the Farthest North, has always concentrated their minds wonderfully. In their artists it must surely account for the often self-consciously exhortatory quality of their writings, urging each other towards a position that is truly Canadian; for the constant groupings and regroupings of clubs and societies; and above all, for the epic and celebratory aspect of so much of the work in this exhibition. This last especially is a quality held in common with certain of the contemporary Scandinavian and Icelandic painters, but here so much more forceful and intense. The show begins with the work of the young artists who were in Paris well before the turn of the century, where they they were able to respond directly to impressionism in its later moods and phases, and to early developments in post-impressionism. These are not the most dramatic images, but their accomplishment and sophistication are incontestable, two views of 1906 by Maurice Cullen, across the St Lawrence river to and from Quebec, as subtle and exquisite in their suggestive tonality as any Monet, and the most beautiful in the entire show. Suzor-Cote, Clarence Gagnon and James Morrice, make up this first most distinctive and distinguished group. But the best known group, and indeed central to the whole study of Canadian painting in the early 20th century, is the Group of Seven, which came together informally in the 1910s and formally constituted itself just after the Great War. With certain individual artists loosely associated with it, such as Tom Thomson who died in 1917 and, much later, Emily Carr, it addressed itself consciously to the landscape not merely as a visible phenomenon, but as a moral force. In the work of all the Seven: Harris, MacDonald, Lismer, Jackson, Varley, Johnston and Carmichael, the landscape takes on an almost mystical presence, not personal exactly but alive in its physicality, the space across the lake, the form over the mountain febrile in definition, fraught with feeling. Cloud, mountain, lake and forest alike are simplified and celebrated almost as symbol and totem, the individual tree or rock itself become a monument. But there is rather more to it than simple symbolic signification. The works are beautifully painted, and with a raw but contained energy in the drawing, and rich paint on the surface. Landscape, image and experience alike are beautifully observed, realised and felt. As much is true of the work of Tom Thomson, perhaps more so, which is as impressive as anything here, though shown separately by the accident of his early death. If the exhibition does nothing more than establish his wider reputation, it will have been worthwhile. The show is rounded off by the later work of those artists who continued, by Emily Carr's overt symbolism, by younger artists such as Charles Comfort, and by perhaps the most idiosyncratic and particular of them all, David Milne, whose delicately mannered touch exquisitely combines any number of modernisms, from impressionism on. Back to the Seven for a moment, Arthur Lismer and Frederick Varley were both from Sheffield and their work is the subject of a coincidental exhibition, Our Home and Native Land, organised by the Sheffield City Art Galleries, which comes to Canada House next month (May 3 to June 18). Showing them as it does in depth, it is a necessary pendant to this Barbican exhibition. Un-Natural Traces, which fills the Barbican's lower gallery, is a complementary show of current Canadian art.</p>

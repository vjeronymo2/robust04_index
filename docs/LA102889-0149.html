			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALPHA MICRO SAYS IT WILL PURCHASE FUJITSU COMPANY  </P> <P> Alpha Microsystems, a Santa Ana computer company, said Friday that it has  agreed to buy Fujitsu America's microcomputer business in the United States for  $2.5 million and other considerations.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Alpha Micro will buy Fujitsu Microsystems of America, a  San Jose-based unit of the Japanese parent.  </P> <P> "The synergy that can be developed through a marriage of these two companies  will enhance our company's presence in the marketplace," Alpha Micro Chairman  Robert B. Hitchcock said.  </P> <P> Hitchcock said Alpha Micro is familiar with Fujitsu as both a competitor and  supplier. Alpha Micro purchases hard disk drives from Fujitsu for use in the  business computers it markets.  </P> <P> "We have been impressed with (Fujitsu's) customers, commitment and business  philosophy, so when we were offered the opportunity to expand our relationship,  we were delighted," Hitchcock said.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, Alpha Micro will acquire the marketing operations of  Fujitsu Microsystems and purchase Fujitsu microcomputers for an unspecified  time. Final terms of the purchasing deal have not yet been worked out,  according to Nyoka Criner, Alpha Micro's vice president of finance.  </P> <P> The two companies said the deal is subject to completing a definitive  agreement.  </P> <P> If the deal is completed, Alpha Micro will take over Fujitsu's San Jose  operation, which employs 50 people.  </P> <P> Fujitsu America President Yasushi Nakamura said Alpha Micro's management  philosophy "is compatible with ours, which gives us the utmost confidence that  the business is in good hands."  </P></p>

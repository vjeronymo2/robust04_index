Shilina, Kiev State University; UDC  579.841.11]    [Abstract] The broad range of human diseases caused by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well various plant and  animal ailments induced by numerous pathogenic factors in the  pseudomonads, primarily enzymes with a toxic effect, and the  resulting immunodeficiency prompted a study of the  immunosuppressive action of Pseudomonas aeruginosa  extracts with respect to the cell immune response and an attempt  to find the origin of the immunosuppressive factors. To this  end, typical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains separated  from the sputum of pneumonia patients (Nos. 140 and 3,990) and  strains which had been cultivated for a long time in nutrient  media under lab conditions (Nos. 1,961 and U-1) were examined.  In so doing, the effect of water-phenol, trichloracetic, and  salt extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the  delayed hypersensitivity of mice to the guinea pig antigen is  studied. The study reveals that the salt extracts of the wild  strains contain thermostable immunosuppressive factors of a  lipid origin with a high mass (over 800 kD) which may be  inactivated by trichloracetic acid and phenol. On the other  hand, salt extracts of museum strains as well as water and  phenol trichloracetic extracts produced from wild and museum  bacteria strains do not display immunosuppressive activity. It  is speculated that these factors may be a pseudomonad  lipopolysachharide component and that the biological properties  of pseudomonads are not related to impairments of the  oxygen-dependent processes in macrophages.

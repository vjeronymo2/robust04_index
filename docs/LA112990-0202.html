			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCO UPS STAKE IN STATE'S LARGEST OIL FIELD  </P> <P> Atlantic Richfield Co. will buy a major interest in California's largest oil  field from Oryx Energy Co. of Dallas for a total of $642 million in cash and  assumed debt, the companies said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The sale boosts Los Angeles-based Arco's oil production in the state by 60% and  gives Arco rights to a field with an estimated 140 million barrels of proven  oil reserves.  </P> <P> It also essentially completes Oryx's plan to sell non-strategic assets in order  to reduce about $1 billion in debt from the purchase in September of all shares  of its common stock held by Oryx's founding family.  </P> <P> "Net proceeds from this transaction and previously announced sales amount to  nearly $700 million," said Oryx Chairman Robert P. Hauptfuhrer in a statement.  "These funds, coupled with our substantial cash flow from operations, will  allow us to reach our billion-dollar debt reduction target much sooner than  planned."  </P> <P> Under terms of the deal, which was effective Nov. 1, Arco Oil &amp; Gas Co.  assumes $54 million in Oryx debt, and pays $588 million in cash for all of  Oryx's oil properties in the Midway-Sunset oil field in Kern County. The  interests had constituted Oryx's largest operating U.S. field.  </P> <P> The deal will make Arco, which already has extensive operations in the field,  its largest producer of oil and boost Arco's gross state oil production to  79,000 barrels a day.  </P> <P> The Oryx interests include 1,270 wells, with gross oil production of more than  29,000 barrels a day, as well as an interest in a cogeneration plant that  produces electricity and steam for use in enhanced oil recovery operations.  </P> <P> "This purchase makes good sense for Arco, given that it's a field where we have  other production with good infrastructure," said Arco spokesman Albert  Greenstein. "It's a good fit."  </P> <P> The sale was in keeping with Oryx's plans to sell off domestic oil operations  and change the company's balance of operations to emphasize U.S. natural gas  production and overseas oil production, analysts said.  </P> <P> The deal will also result in a net gain of $71 million for Oryx and reduce by  $545 million Oryx's $968-million debt from its purchase in September of 18  million shares of stock from Glenmede Trust, which represents the Pew family of  Philadelphia, founders of Oryx's predecessor, Sun Co. At the time of the stock  purchase, Oryx vowed to eliminate the debt within a year.  </P> <P> Last month, Oryx sold several properties to four companies, including Geodyne  Resources Inc., for $95 million. The sales included two offshore platforms and  five non-producing offshore blocks that went to Unocal Corp., said Oryx  spokesman Tom Sullivan.  </P> <P> The month before, Oryx sold $109 million in properties to Union Pacific  Resources Co. Together, the sales reduced Oryx's debt by $142 million.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Arco's stock closed up 50 cents at $127.875 a share in trading on  the New York Stock Exchange. Oryx's stock closed down $1 at $43.25 a share on  the NYSE.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- Senior party and  government officials Thursday appreciated the 17th part of the  multi-part feature film "The Nation and Destiny" which has been  released on the occasion of the April fete.    Appreciating the film were Kang Song-san, Pak Song-chol, Kim  Yong-chu and other senior party and government officials, Yi  Chin- kyu, first vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee  of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  (Chongnyon) who is heading a congratulatory group of Korean  residents from Japan participating in the April 15 celebrations,  and members of congratulatory groups, delegations and visiting  groups of Koreans overseas from various regions.    The 17th part of "The Nation and Destiny" which has been  completed as another masterpiece under the energetic guidance of  the party is based on the life of Ho Chong-suk who was intensely  loyal to the party and the leader till her last moments.    Through the chequered destiny and mental development of the  heroine who joined in the communist movement in the 1920s when  she was still a girl, the film shows in a profound artistic  depiction the truth that one can not fight a worthy struggle to  save the destiny of the motherland and the nation when one is  not guided by a sagacious leader.</p>

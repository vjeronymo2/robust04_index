			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jones &amp; Shipman deal with German competitor JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, one of the UK's three publicly-quoted machine tool builders, has become the sole UK agent for a wide range of grinding machines made by Overbeck, a German competitor. An agreement signed this week at the Mach '92 machine tool exhibition in Birmingham opens the way to potential future collaboration on development work in grinding machines, the two companies said. J&amp;S said many customers in manufacturing were already users of machines from both companies and the agreement provides a single source supplier for most grinding requirements. Overbeck's internal grinding machine range will complement J&amp;S' own range of cylindrical and surface grinders. Cross-border selling deals are becoming increasingly common in the European machine tool industry but it is rare for companies to bury old rivalries and work together on machine development. J&amp;S and Overbeck see the agreement as a first step which could lead to eventual co-operation on projects such as the complex control systems needed for modern grinding. The companies plan, in any case, frequent exchanges of technical information. Mr Len Weaver, J&amp;S chairman, said the deal had taken only two months to negotiate. The two companies were very similar in their commitment to quality and product development.</p>

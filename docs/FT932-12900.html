			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Slippery slopes of Bosnia The chorus of demands that something more be done to stop the interminable horror of the war in Bosnia is becoming irresistible. The present United Nations-sponsored policy, combining diplomatic persuasion, trade sanctions and humanitarian aid, is obviously not bringing peace. And since the world naturally turns to the US for leadership in a crisis, America's new president is under growing pressure to respond. Unfortunately, there are no easy alternatives to the present policy which would be safe for us and which would make things better for them. All the limited schemes currently being touted can only make matters worse. If we seriously want to do something to stop the Serbs and end the slaughter, there will be no halfway stopping point. Arming the Moslems: The proposal that the outside world should arm the Moslems seems to me indefensible on any grounds - political, practical, humanitarian or moral. In the first place, the UN would be forced to close down its humanitarian aid programme. This would be a moral setback, unless we suppose the war would end instantly. Second, I defy anyone to frame a UN resolution endorsing such a policy - not just because the Russians would object, but because it is inconceivable that the UN should actually promote a civil war. By implication, the UN would be forced to get out of the peacekeeping business, not just in Bosnia, but worldwide. Should Britain, France and the US promote the supply of arms to the Moslems, acting outside the UN and and in opposition to declared UN policy? Could they prevent other countries from supplying the Serbs? Such a policy would effectively turn a small war into a large war, with a much more unpredictable end. Some claim that a large war would be morally better because the sides might be more equally matched. But we cannot predict the balance of forces; we only know there would be much more killing. Air strikes: Some people argue that the outside world must intervene directly to compel an end to the war; they claim that this can be achieved by precision bombing against Serb artillery, supply lines, or even the Serb homeland. Such arm's-length intervention would have three advantages: it is less hypocritical than arming the Moslems; it acknowledges that any alternative to the present policy must involve direct intervention; and it is unlikely that western soldiers would be killed. Unfortunately, the disadvantages are much greater. It is virtually impossible that precision bombing in wooded mountain country can take out enough artillery pieces, which are small and mobile, to make a serious military difference. It is even less likely that it could stop the Serbs on the ground, let alone make them sign up for the Vance-Owen plan, and then surrender the vast excess territory they have conquered. Moreover, western leaders would be then hooked on the undeclared logic of military intervention. They would have denied that they were going to put troops into Bosnia; but since bombing by itself must fail, they would then face a painful choice between going back ignominiously, or going on to the next stage, which is to put fighting troops on the ground. It would be better if they spelt this out in advance. Safe havens: Some people argue for a purely defensive intervention, to create a safe haven for the Moslems. This might be militarily feasible, with a few thousand troops, in limited areas such Sarajevo. But if the safe haven were easy to set up, because it was limited to the Moslem heartland, it would in practice define the future frontiers of a new minimal Moslem state, which would be much more restricted than anything in the Vance-Owen plan. If it were less limited, it would mean fighting the Serbs and Croats. We have no reason to suppose that other outsiders would not then pile in on the side of the Serbs, ostensibly for equally 'defensive' purposes. The fundamental dividing line is between intervention and non-intervention. But there is no way we can remain at arm's length for our own safety, yet have the impact on the war that can only come from going in on the ground. There is no safety net between limited intervention at the start and total intervention at the end. This logic cannot be finessed, and the politicians must not pretend that it can. Second, there is no sense in talking about a military intervention without devising, in advance, a political strategy to go with it. The seductive lure of the arm-the-Moslems option is that it appears to exonerate us from responsibility, though of course it could not protect us from the consequences of such an incendiary policy. But any of the interventionist options, however small at the start, must end inexorably with the sending of troops. I am not against sending troops. But what will they be sent to do? The answer is, unfortunately, self-evident: it can only be to impose a settlement on the whole of Bosnia, with or without the benefit of a peace plan. There is no point starting down the road of military intervention unless the objective is a comprehensive political strategy. That means that governments must be prepared, in advance, to send very large numbers of troops. Personally, I should prefer to stick with the present policy, unsatisfactory as it may appear. The dead and the dying are a daily horror; but every single life saved is a life saved. But if governments are determined to change tack, at the very least let them spare us the pretence that their new policy will be safe and moral.</p>

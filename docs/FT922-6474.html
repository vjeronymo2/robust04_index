			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Markets: Summertime, and the market is easing - Wall Street SUMMER officially opens in the US this weekend with the Memorial Day holiday, but stock watchers on Wall Street are not approaching the new season with much enthusiasm. The omens for the coming months are not encouraging. The Dow has been flirting with 3,400 for more than a week, yet every time it passes that particular milestone investors sell enough stocks to send the index back where it came from. The selling reflects the widespread view among investors that 3,400 is too high for the Dow, and that the market is overvalued in terms of both corporate earnings and the outlook for the economy. The broader indices, meanwhile, continue to lag behind the Dow, confirming that confidence in the market is thinly spread. Trading volume is also falling off. Throughout April 200m-share days were common. Since the start of May, however, the market has not breached the 200m-share mark, and daily turnover has averaged nearer 160m to 170m shares. At the same time, equity markets have been unnerved by rising long-term interest rates. Yields on the 30-year bond refuse to come down much below 8 per cent, which is worrying stock investors who fear high interest rates will stifle any recovery in the vitally important residential housing market. Mortgages in the US are priced off Treasury bond yields, and when they remain high, potential homebuyers are discouraged from borrowing to purchase new homes. There were signs this week that the recovery in the housing market may already be in trouble. The government reported a 17 per cent drop in housing starts for April, a decline that stunned analysts, who had expected only a minor setback. Although the tumble in housing starts sparked a brief bond market rally, the dominant influence among Treasury investors this week has been monetary policy, and the worrying absence of an easing by the Federal Reserve. Hopes of another interest rate cut had been high, with analysts' increasingly confident that the Fed would react to slow money growth and a weak labour market with a final rate reduction. Those hopes were dealt a serious blow on Thursday, however, when reports from Washington DC suggested that the policy-making Fed's Open Market Committee (FOMC) had voted at its get-together on Tuesday to keep monetary policy unchanged and to drop its bias toward easing for at least one month. Although the FOMC's decision does not rule out another rate cut entirely - the Fed chairman can order a   1/4 point cut in the Fed funds rate whenever he feels economic conditions require it - the vote against easing suggests the monetary authorities are satisfied with the way the economic recovery is advancing, and see no need for further stimulus. The FOMC vote, therefore, may have kicked away the last prop holding the stock market and the Dow up at 3,400. If investors cannot look forward to another interest rate cut soon, and if economic growth and corporate earnings continue to maintain steady but unspectacular progress for the next three to six months, then there the chance of equities making much headway over the summer is remote. Supply pressures are also squeezing the stock market. Only this week a whopping Dollars 2.6bn in new stock was sold to investors, eating into the market's already dwindling stockpile of cash. The bulk of the new shares came from General Motors, which, in the biggest public common stock issue in US corporate history, sold 55m shares at Dollars 39 each on Tuesday in an effort to bolster its sagging balance sheet. The remaining Dollars 450m or so was poured into the coffers of Federated Department Stores, which sold 40m shares at Dollars 11.50 each. The success of the GM issue, upped by 5m shares at the last minute because of strong demand, was a boost to market sentiment. The company is not the force it once was, but the old adage that what is good for GM is good for America still has some relevance, and it was important that US investors (and some from overseas) displayed their confidence in GM by putting up the cash for the giant carmaker.  -------------------------------- Monday      3376.03  +  22.94 Tuesday     3397.99  +  21.96 Wednesday   3393.84  -   4.15 Thursday    3378.71  -  15.13 Friday      3386.77  +   8.06  --------------------------------</p>

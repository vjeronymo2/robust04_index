			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Amato sees delay in budget approval  -Backlog proves costly THE Italian government says there is little prospect of early parliamentary passage of its 1993 budget despite the crisis of international confidence in the lira and market pressures for quick action. The 1993 budget, which seeks to raise L93,000bn (Pounds 41.6bn) in extra revenues and spending cuts, will take at least until the end of November to pass through both houses of parliament, according to prime minister Giuliano Amato. In an interview with the FT, Mr Amato said parliament's role had to be respected. He said the process of approving the budget, which was presented to parliament last Thursday, would take 'a couple of months'. Both houses of parliament face a huge backlog of decrees and legislation. Although deputies are being pressed to approve the budget as soon as possible, they are insisting parliamentary procedures have to be respected. Mr Amato remained confident the budget would be passed with only minor amendments and appeared ready to see the blame for any delay shift directly to the politicians. Mr Amato conceded this strategy left his government in a delicate, indeed almost helpless, position to confront speculation against the lira. Locking Italy into the EMS 'with a sound parity for the lira' remained his 'preferred' strategy. Indeed, he saw no alternative to ensure international credibility and tackling the country's rapidly deteriorating public finances. He admitted he had lost 'some face' by being forced to devalue the lira. But he said the subsequent fall of the lira in its float since September 17 had reached the point of a competitive devaluation, which was of concern to Italy's commercial partners. He maintained the current devaluation of over 20 per cent against the D-Mark could be a bargaining card in discussions on Italian re-entry into the EMS. He appeared reassured of support from Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl, intimating they had reached some understanding at their summit in Florence on September 17-18. On the forthcoming Birmingham summit, he thought the exclusion of finance ministers was a positive development since this would lessen the prospect of the meeting becoming a hostage to the expectations of the markets. He was cautious about the outcome, but said he was encouraged by the 'pro-European intentions of John Major' set out in letters sent last week to European leaders. Mr Amato recognised that ERM re-entry was most unlikely before the budget had been approved. He added that budget approval was a precondition for a major policy decision on whether Italy would issue Ecu-denominated bonds or bonds indexed to a central parity against the D-Mark. Such a step would save on interest charges. It would also mean that the government would assume the foreign exchange risk that foreign investors in Italian paper would otherwise have to accept. The idea was announced last week and is another attempt to retain the credibility of Italian paper. Mr Amato confirmed last week had seen a 'significant' run on the banks, mainly in Rome, when rumours swept the capital of government plans to impose capital controls. He was scornful of the example set by Italy's senators, seen queueing to withdraw their deposits from the bank inside the parliament building. He was adamant Italy was not considering imposing foreign exchange controls, saying such a step would be 'crazy' and would only drive investors and savers away from Italian debt paper, which still needed to be renewed and rolled over. More than ever Mr Amato appeared to have few illusions about the durability of his three-month-old four party coalition government, whose strength lies in the lack of alternatives - either from the discredited and divided political parties or in terms of the direction of economic policy.</p>

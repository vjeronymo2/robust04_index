			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Reform to axe Arts Council THE Arts Council of Great Britain is to disappear as a result of the government's reform proposals for Scotland. In future the funding of the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils will be the direct responsibility of the respective secretaries of state. At the moment they receive their annual grants through the ACGB according to an agreed formula linked to their populations. The Arts Council of Great Britain will become an Arts Council for England. The change will enable arts organisations in Scotland and Wales to lobby hard for extra cash in Edinburgh and Cardiff.</p>

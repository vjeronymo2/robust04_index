			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Warning over Church finances THE Church of England will today be warned about the increasing financial difficulties it faces. The Church Commissioners report to the Church's general synod in York will tell parishes that they must prepare to meet a far bigger proportion of clergy stipends. The commissioners now finance an average of 41 per cent of stipends but this is likely to fall below 30 per cent by 1996.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A high-ranking official from the Russian Foreign  Ministry stressed that Moscow had given consideration to the  tragic incident in northern Iraq where two U.S. fighters had  erroneously shot down two helicopters carrying UN  representatives. "We would like to express our deep regret and  our condolences to the relatives and friends of those who died,"  the diplomat said in an interview with Interfax today.    "However, the incident has caused us serious concern since  this happened in the so-called no flight zone in Iraqi  Kurdistan, to the north of the 32nd parallel, controlled by the  "coalition deterrence forces" consisting of air units of the  Western participants in the anti-Iraqi coalition, the activities  of which were not defined by appropriate international  decisions," the Russian diplomat emphasized.    He said the world community should expect careful and  impartial investigations into this tragic incident and to be  informed on all the details of it.</p>

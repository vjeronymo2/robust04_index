The spokesman said that Guangdong's gross domestic product  (GDP) -- the value of goods and services produced -- amounted to  314.7 billion yuan last year, up 21 percent over the previous  year in real terms.    The province's GDP has risen at an annual rate of nearly 14  percent over the past 15 years.    He attributed the rapid growth partly to faster  infrastructure construction and undertaking of top-priority  projects.    In 1993, Guangdong added a total new generating capacity of  almost four million kilowatts, built 150 kilometers of  expressways and nearly 2,000 kilometers of highways, and  installed switchboards with a total of 2.2 million telephone  lines.    The spokesman said that Guangdong plans to undertake 31 key  projects this year, involving investment totaling 70.3 billion  yuan.    These will include a railway line, an expressway, a subway  in  the provincial capital of Guangzhou and six power plants.    This year Guangdong plans to add a total new generating  capacity of three million kilowatts and install switchboards  with 2.5 million lines, the spokesman said.    Guangdong has also expanded an export-oriented economy, he  said. Its imports and exports amounted to 45.4 billion U.S.  dollars in 1993.    Exports soared 43 percent last year to 26.3 billion dollars.  As a result, Guangdong has exported more goods than any other  province-level area in China for eight successive years.    Guangdong's major export markets include Japan, the United  States, the European Community, the Commonwealth of Independent  States, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America  and Australia, the spokesman said.    He said that in 1993 Guangdong signed 19,000 cooperation  contracts with foreign firms, involving a total overseas  investment of 34.9 billion U.S. dollars, up 76 percent over 1992.    The province also scored a big increase in major  foreign-funded businesses in 1993, he said. It had 738 such  businesses each with an investment exceeding 10 million dollars,  527 more than in 1992.    "Guangdong Province will continue to achieve rapid economic  growth in the new year," the spokesman said.    GDP is expected to shoot up by 15 percent and its exports by  15 percent this year, he said.</p>

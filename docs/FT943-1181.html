			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Blair's tax plans face leftwing challenge Labour leftwingers yesterday threatened to disrupt Mr Tony Blair's leadership honeymoon at next week's annual conference unless he drops plans to rule out higher taxes. And as taxation emerged as a key conference issue for both main parties, rightwing Tories signalled plans to demand tax cuts at the Conservative conference the following week. Conservative strategists also expect a rightwing revolt over law and order, although Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, is expected to survive calls for his resignation. Labour officials said that Mr Blair and Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, would 'flesh out' a fresh approach to taxation at an economic conference in London tomorrow. Mr Blair will confirm that Labour has no plans for higher taxation, except for the very rich, who are believed to have benefited unfairly under the Conservatives. Labour strategists believe that the party's 'tax and spend' image must be scrapped if it is to establish credibility among middle-class voters as the party of economic competence. However, leftwingers said taxation would be at the top of a list of issues on which the leadership would be challenged, including minimum wages and the role of trade unions. A prominent member of the Campaign group of Labour MPs said: 'I think there will be a row about what Blair has been saying on taxation. 'There is widespread concern that if he is going down that road, there will be continued underfunding of health and welfare, and that is unacceptable.' Shadow ministers say that the revolt will be contained by stressing Labour's plans to cut the taxation of the lower paid, and cut out 'wasteful' spending on unemployment. One shadow minister said: 'I don't think there will be much trouble. People were critical about Tony Blair's decision to attack the Tories on law and order because it was seen as their natural territory, but there is now almost complete agreement that he was right.' Labour leaders believe that the party has been adequately prepared for a shift to low taxation since the last general election, which many believe turned on Labour's plans to raise taxes. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow Treasury chief secretary, will today release a paper identifying scope for big cuts in 'wasteful' public spending which could ease pressure on Labour's budget calculations. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday sought to head off rightwing Tory demands for early tax cuts by insisting that the government could win the next general election only through fiscal prudence. He said on BBC television: 'When we cut taxes is going to be determined by when public spending is so controlled and public borrowing is so reduced that we can afford it. Everybody knows the Labour party could not do that.' However, Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the rightwing 92 Group of Tory MPs, urged Mr Clarke to start cutting taxes in his November Budget. He said on GMTV: 'Alas, Ken Clarke appears to have ruled that out. If he sticks with that judgment, I'm afraid we are in for a bumpy political ride.'</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Delaney trims loss but sees no upturn Delaney Group, the furniture maker and shopfitter, reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 495,000 on sales of Pounds 12m in the six months to end-June. The outcome compared with a loss of Pounds 646,000 from turnover of Pounds 11.2m last time and was struck after a lower interest charge of Pounds 137,000 (Pounds 186,000). Losses per share were reduced to 0.9p (1.2p). The shares were unchanged at 6 1/2 p. On prospects, Mr Nathu Puri, chairman, said it was difficult to foresee any res-pite from the repressed mar-ket conditions. In fact the economy was displaying distinct signs of further deterioration. Uncertainty about government intentions had turned decision-making into something of a lottery, he said.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / The Long View: Copycat consensus JUST HOW does your company's pension fund manager decide the investment strategy that could determine the standard of living you will enjoy in your retirement? Does he scientifically study all possible investments and select a balanced portfolio according to an elaborate analysis of return and risk, making changes according to circumstances? The answer in most cases is no. What he does instead is to monitor what other pension fund managers are doing. He copies the average portfolio, adding enough minor variations to justify charging 'active' management fees. Nearly all British pension fund portfolios now closely track the consensus. The weightings of all the components of a portfolio, whether whole asset categories (such as bonds or UK equities) or individual stock holdings, are continually monitored and checked against the average weightings. If you ask an investment manager to explain this procedure he will probably say that the consensus portfolio represents the accumulated wisdom of hundreds of senior investment professionals. Moreover, the approach works. Pension funds have performed exceptionally well during the past decade or so, easily beating minimum investment targets. This has allowed widespread upgrading of benefits at the same time as permitting many British companies to reduce or eliminate their pension contributions for years at a time. But there is another explanation. It is that investment managers - and pension fund trustees who hire and fire them - are driven by inappropriate risk criteria. They are terrified that their investment returns might differ widely from those of the average pension fund. In fact the liabilities of pension funds are extremely long-term, and short-term volatility should be of little importance to scheme members. Managers and trustees, nevertheless, see big commercial and personal risks to contracts and jobs. So they are driven to the safety of consensus. In a world of increasingly disturbed financial markets a vital question is now raised by all this. What happens if the consensus is seriously wrong? Logically speaking, if everybody copies everybody else it is impossible for the consensus strategy to change at all. In practice there will no doubt be small divergencies allowing slow shifts. Also, pension funds will be affected by external forces. If equity markets rise, as they did in the 1980s, exposures to equities will reflect that. And in the late 1980s the British government was eagerly buying back its long-dated gilts, so the decision of the pension fund managers to reduce their exposure to gilts was effectively taken for them. Nearly all the change in portfolio structure during the 1980s was explainable by such external factors. The only substantial positive decision by managers appears to have been the move to build up overseas equities from 5 per cent to over 20 per cent of portfolios. Until the early 1980s British pension fund portfolios were reasonably well diversified across equities, bonds and property. This is still the pattern for pension funds overseas, in the US and Continental Europe. But the strategy in the UK has now reached an extreme. According to Caps, an independent measurement company, exposure to equities (UK plus overseas) stood at a record 83 per cent at the end of June. Investments in bonds and property are small. Such an asset allocation may have made sense in the fast- growing and often inflationary 1980s but it now looks grotesque. Although it is almost two years since the UK entered the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System no strategic adjustment at all has yet been made by British pension fund managers. Yet it was clear at the time that bonds would become better value and offer decent real returns, and indeed since the end of September 1990 the total return on gilts has been about 43 per cent while UK equities have only returned 28 per cent. As time has gone on the comparison has become even less flattering for equities. Over the past year the return on equities has been minus 9 per cent but on long gilts it has been plus 17 per cent. You can argue that the UK will soon be forced out of the ERM and then the equity market will roar ahead again. Long-term pension fund strategists, perhaps, are simply brushing aside a temporary political diversion. But whatever the future of the sterling-DM exchange rate there is unlikely to be a simple return to the economic climate of the 1980s. There has been a change in the investment fundamentals over the past two years to which pension funds surely ought to have measurably responded. It is the absence of any such flexibility which suggests that the worship of the consensus has paralysed the pension fund investment process. We are dealing here with shifts in mass psychology. Until the 1960s equities were scarcely thought to be suitable investments for pension funds at all. Now the conventional wisdom is that only equities are natural pension fund assets. Of course, any investor in the stock market has to be prepared for a bad year, and pension fund trustees will probably not worry too much if their portfolios make a minus return this year when they could have earned a safe 10 per cent by putting the money on deposit. But another year of weak share prices and falling dividends (which have dropped 1.4 per cent over the last year in nominal terms on the All-Share Index) might cause restlessness. It may never happen. But the danger is that the herd will attempt to shift from one consensus position to a radically different one. If tens of billions of pounds are on the move the impact on asset prices could be highly disruptive. You may have cause to hope that your company's pension fund manager can keep a little ahead of the crowd.</p>

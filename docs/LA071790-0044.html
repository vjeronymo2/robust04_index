			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> U.S. OPPOSES MERGER OF CONCERT FACILITIES  </P> <P> The U.S. Justice Department said it will file a civil antitrust suit this week  opposing a proposed alliance between Orange County's two outdoor pop concert  facilities, charging that a merger would reduce competition, not enhance it as  parties to the deal have argued. Operators of the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa  Mesa plan to join with a major food concessions firm in buying a controlling  interest in the venue's longtime rival in the concert market, Irvine Meadows  Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> "It appears that the proposed transaction would create a monopoly in concert  venues in Orange County," said Assistant Atty. Gen. James F. Rill. "We found no  circumstances that would justify this result, which we believe would adversely  affect consumers." Officials at the Nederlander Organization, which owns and  operates the Pacific, maintained that in gaining ownership interest in Irvine,  they would provide equal access at both facilities to booking agents, which  would increase, rather than decrease, competition.  </P></p>

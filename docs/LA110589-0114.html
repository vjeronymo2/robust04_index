			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEDI-CAL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> I read with no surprise your article "More Doctors Shun Medi-Cal Prenatal  Coverage" (Oct. 24). Sadly, I must report that I too have stopped taking  Medi-Cal despite my strong liberal feelings and concern for the poor.  </P> <P> My problem is not the terrible pay of less than one-third of a normal fee; I  can live with that for some patients. The problem is the horrible bureaucracy.  The state agency makes collection so time-consuming and irritating that my  office manager refuses to do their billing, and I don't blame her. Therefore, I  have to pay someone else extra money for doing the laborious paper work when  full pay doesn't even cover the overhead.  </P> <P> Somehow, our Medi-Cal administrators have found a way to combine the worst of  capitalism and socialism in our bureaucracy. Perhaps it is a conspiracy to  cripple help for the poor because it sure works that way.  </P> <P> I take a modest number of very-low-pay patients to assuage my social  conscience. If the "system" ever figures out a way to run Medi-Cal competently,  I'll be glad to be reactivated.  </P> <P> LARRY MEYERS  </P> <P> Tustin  </P> <P>  Meyers is a clinical psychologist.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: A prophet overlooked CONTEMPORARY British music over the past decade has had a prophet without honour in his own land it has probably been Jonathan Harvey, whose music is widely admired and performed throughout Europe, yet has remained securely within the province of the new-music specialists here. All that may be about to change. Harvey's opera Inquest of Love opens tonight at English National Opera and his Song Offerings, a cycle of settings of Tagore from 1985, has been awarded the Britten Prize for Composition worth Pounds 10,000. Harvey is now 54, half a generation younger than Birtwistle and Maxwell Davies; he grew up in the wake of the post-war avant garde and was able to extract what he needed from their music. An early grounding in Schoenbergian serialism from Hans Keller and Erwin Stein and study for a Cambridge doctorate was followed by a year at Princeton University absorbing the structural doctrines of Milton Babbitt; overlaid on this academic progress was Harvey's discovery in the late 1960s of the music of Stockhausen, about whom he went on to write an important early study. It all went into the mill of making Harvey an outward-looking, open-minded and in many ways un-English composer; he was, for instance, one of the earliest converts to the immense possibilities of Boulez's IRCAM in Paris, where he has worked on several works that use electronics and computer-generated material. What has set him still further apart from most of his contemporaries has been the intensely wrought religious and philosophical thrust of his music - broadening out from the theosophy of Rudolf Steiner in the sequence of 1970s pieces called Inner Light with which he first established his reputation, to pieces in which he explores a pan-religious concept of consciousness, tying in elements of Buddhism and Christian thinking. It is this same mixture, unblinking and intellectually hard-centred, not at all the sentimentalised spirituality so fashionable in the music of Tavener and Gorecki, that underpins Inquest of Love. Harvey regards the new opera as the summation, philosophical and musical, of all the strands of his development so far. He first sketched ideas for the work more than 20 years ago; he returned to the idea in the early 1980s when a libretto was drafted, and that was enough to stimulate David Pountney's interest in the project. ENO offered a commission and Harvey co-opted the dramatist David Rudkin to shape and leaven his text. It tells a curious, timeless story - a wedding ceremony that disintegrates into tragedy and the eventual resolution of the suffering and its root causes in the after life. There are echoes in the text of William Blake, W. B. Yeats, Tippett's Midsummer Marriage and especially, in the second act's journey through the 'higher realm,' of Elgar's Dream of Gerontius. Harvey acknowledges the oratorio as an important influence. 'As a boy I used to play Gerontius on the piano; it was the first work that really obsessed me. I was a choirboy in Worcestershire (at St Michael's College, Tenbury) where Elgar was very much in the air.' But a music impulse was the real starting point for the opera. 'Gerontius speaks of a sound 'like the rushing of the wind', and these are sensations of which I read much later in Steiner and Yeats. When I look back on my music I realise how this scheme has been present in so much that I had done before - Stockhausen was a very important influence, suggesting that his electronic music offered a new reality, a different world, in an expanded consciousness. In the world of my opera there is really no distinction between life here and life after death - death becomes just a little gate to push open and pass through. 'It is about the idea of life after death and suffering (you could call it purgatory but I don't like the word), of living through suffering and forgiving - as one does in life anyway, but probably after death it's much more immediate and raw. It's being in a pure state of emotion with no disguise, no hiding; I knew the opera would be a process of trying to represent this suffering in the context of radiant possibilities. For me music is about suffering and release; I just can't disconnect life from music in the way some people can'. If on one plane Harvey's thinking connects with an peculiarly English vein of mysticism that stretches back through Hopkins and Blake to Thomas Traherne, on another his music, with its use of electronics and synthesisers in the orchestra, is very much late 20th-century in its spirit. Inquest of Love is that rare contemporary thing: an opera which is going to stand or fall by its music. The text has potential to be transcended by the invention or dashed by it; if the former, then Harvey's stature is going to be immeasurably enhanced.</p>

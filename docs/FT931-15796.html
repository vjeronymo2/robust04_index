			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Arts: Let the stones speak for themselves - Colin Amery considers Stonehenge and the winning design to house the tourists It was Inigo Jones who was asked by King James I of England and VI of Scotland to offer an account of the origins, meaning and purpose of Stonehenge. His thoughts and researches were not published until 1655, and when they were they were curiously inaccurate and speculative. Jones thought that the group of megalithic stones was a Roman temple in the Tuscan Order, open to the heavens, and dedicated to Coelus, or Uranus, the oldest god in the classical pantheon. Like many architects Inigo Jones was not above re-interpreting history to his own ends. He was at the time an enthusiast for the severity of the Tuscan Order and the simplicity of Roman temple architecture. It suited him to see the monument as a reinforcement of his own historical ideas. Today we look at a monument like Stonehenge in a variety of different ways. It is described as the most important pre-historic monument in Europe. It is designated as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. It is still the site of some strange solstice rites when white robed Druidic figures try to bring together the forces of time and space to manufacture a creative coincidence based on the certainties of geometry. It is a gathering place for Romanies and travellers drawn there as if by a giant magnet. Above all we still look upon Stonehenge as a place of mystery, a place that has a strange and powerful hold upon the imagination. In London until January 16 at the Royal Institute of British Architects (and later in Wiltshire) is an exhibition of the ideas of six architects, called Visions for Stonehenge. Galvanised by the energetic new chairman of English Heritage, Mr Jocelyn Stevens, 150 architects submitted proposals for new facilities for visitors to the monument. The present arrangements for the one million or more people who visit the site annually are grotesque and inconvenient. The brief for the new proposals is for a centre one kilometre to the north of the stones for visitors, where they will also park their cars. From this distant site you will walk processionally to the stones, which will be once again more isolated and united with the landscape by the removal of much of the fencing and the A344 road, which at present passes within feet of the sacred stones. The winning architect from the six short listed is Edward Cullinan - who also won the last Financial Times 'Architecture at Work Award.' The other five were: Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones; Birds Portchmouth and Russum; Future Systems; Colvin and Moggridge Landscape Architects; and Plincke Leaman and Browning. It was a difficult competition for an architect, because it really called for invisibility for any new buildings and a lot of effort to be put into the enhancement of the setting of the stones themselves - which are, as far as we know, untouched by the hands of even the most ancient architects. Circumspection and reticence are not always qualities associated with architects, but Mr Cullinan has designed a simple scheme which consists of a single storey visitors' centre with a grass roof which gives the appearance of being underground. There is a potentially handsome circular viewing terrace and a promenade along the roof top along which you can saunter and contemplate the distant view of the standing stones. The worrying thing about this new facility, which still has to go through the planning hurdles and is unlikely to be opened until 1996, at the earliest, is that it is so enormous. Much of the space is taken up by amorphous halls apparently designated for 'interpretation', exhibitions and displays. There is a separate audio visual theatre to 'introduce' the visitor to Stonehenge and a restaurant for the serving of Stonehenge snacks and Druid dinners. There will be a shop selling souvenirs - candles in the shape of Stonehenge, full length Druid outfits, horns and harps and plastic mistletoe. There are also special rooms for the changing of nappies, delivery bays for the unloading of Coca-Cola bottles and rooms for the large numbers of staff to rest their limbs and smoke their cigarettes. This Stonehenge experience will be surrounded by a 'landscaped' sea of nearly 1000 cars and coaches. Visitors will have to walk on grass paths (which will surely soon wear out) to the monument itself. The architects who have entered this important national competition are not to be blamed for the nature of the brief, which has been drawn up over eight years by endless committees of bureaucrats and well intentioned do-gooders of all kinds. But there is no doubt at all in my mind that the right thing to do at Stonehenge is to move the offending roads, so that the stones are more remote and mysterious, and then do everything possible to lessen public interest in the site. All the bogus 'interpretation' in the world is not going to add any certainty to anyone's knowledge of Stonehenge. All the shopping and parking, lavatories and nappy changing will do nothing to enhance the real nature of this monument. A distant car park and a long walk is all that is needed. It will save English Heritage from drumming up sponsorship and perhaps allow the stones to speak for themselves.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Summary] "Dear friends: After their morning group  discussions, National Assembly deputies worked in the conference  hall this afternoon and debated the revised draft law on the  organization of people's councils and people's committees. The  afternoon session was directed by National Assembly Chairman  Nong Duc Manh."    All of the fourteen deputies who spoke at the session agreed  with the views of the law drafting committee. They pointed out:  "In view of the demands arising from the renovation process and  in compliance with the 1992 Constitution, the amendment of and  supplement to this law are regarded as a pressing and necessary  requirement as the term of office of people's councils at  various levels will expire by November 1994."    The deputies concentrated their discussions on the following  major issues:    -- Term of office of people's councils at various levels.    -- Duties and powers of people's councils, of people's  councillors, and of people's committees.    -- Whether people's committee chairmen should be people's  councillors?, and so forth.    "Many deputies who spoke proposed that the term of office of  people's councils at various levels should be five years and  that people's councils should meet three times a year. They  said it would be too much of an interval if people's councils  meet only twice a year."    Many deputies called for more attention to the role of the  Fatherland Front Committees at various levels in the activities  of people's councils.    As for Article 24 and Point 4 of Article 33 on how people's  councils should resolve complaints and denunciations, many  deputies called for more specific stipulations on the powers of  people's councillors and people's council standing members with  regard to this matter.    With regard to the question of whether people's committee  chairmen should be people's councillors, "may deputies spoke in  favor of the idea that people's committee chairmen will not  necessarily be people's councillors."    "Tomorrow, National Assembly deputies will continue to meet  at the conference hall to discuss a revised draft law on the  organization of people's councils and people's committees."</p>

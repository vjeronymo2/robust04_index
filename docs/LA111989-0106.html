			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A 'THANKS' FOR DOUG  </P> <P> Driving down Laguna Canyon Road recently, my car ran out of gas in the middle  of nowhere. I was there all alone. After sitting in my car for what seemed like  forever, I decided to walk before it got too late. I heard something rolling  over the pebbles behind me, and there was a man sitting on a bike. He rode to a  phone, and in 30 minutes my family was there to get me.  </P> <P> All I know about the man is that his name is Doug. I would like to say thank  you.  </P> <P> METER JONES  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER  </P> <P> Suspected Molester Closely Guarded in Court  </P> <P> Suspected child molester James A. Hydrick appeared for arraignment in West  Orange County Municipal Court on Friday with five deputy marshals closely  guarding him.  </P> <P> Hydrick, an expert in karate who faces 13 counts of child molestation, was  denied a restraining order for what his attorney called "verbal abuse by  deputies" in jail.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Michael Beecher also postponed Hydrick's arraignment until Feb.  6 at the request of public defender Pamela Boyd. The request was "a defense  tactic," Boyd said later.  </P> <P> Boyd said she sought the restraining order because sheriff's deputies at County  Jail verbally abused Hydrick. Beecher told her that specific complaints should  be directed to jail officials.  </P> <P> Hydrick, 29, sat in a booth enclosed by a metal screen as two deputy marshals  stood behind him. Three other marshals stood by the front entrance to the  courtroom. The extra security precautions were taken because Hydrick is  considered an escape risk, Lt. Les Weaver of the marshal's office said. Hydrick  reportedly has escaped from at least three jails.  </P> <P> Hydrick was returned to Orange County earlier this month from a Georgia jail to  face the molestation charges. Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Koski said the charges  involve a small group of Huntington Beach boys that Hydrick allegedly  befriended while living there last year.  </P></p>

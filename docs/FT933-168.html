			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Small companies the victims of banks changing basis of lending Sir, Your report on financing small business emphasises the problem of adjustment to new circumstances ('Entrepreneurs complain of bank pains', September 27). Research conducted last year for the RICS by the Centre for Economics and Business Research underlined the powerful link between bank funding of industry and the state of property values. The findings in Professor McWilliams' paper indicated this relationship made money too readily available in good times and too scarce in bad times - banking conventions tended to cause overreaction at the top and bottom points of the cycle to the severe disadvantage of the British economy. On the basis of past patterns, the report suggested that a 10 per cent decline in commercial property values over a two-year period would reduce the flow of funds from banks to industry by some Pounds 9.7bn over the same period with a six months' lag. The issues are clearly strongest for small businesses. The banks tell us that they now wish to change the basis of their lending. In the long run, this may be desirable, even if it means that the price of capital to small businesses will tend to rise. However, the parallel experience in North America is worrying. It suggests that when the banking sector seeks to change the basis of lending to small business, the result tends to be that the sector stops lending to small business instead of finding a different basis for such lending. Let us hope that the Bank of England finds more effective solutions.

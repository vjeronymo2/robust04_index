			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Subdued demand eased pressure on interest rates Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, hinted that more subdued growth of consumer demand could delay further rises in interest rates at his late September monetary meeting with Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor. The minutes of the September 26 meeting, published yesterday, confirmed that the chancellor and Mr George had agreed to leave interest rates unchanged for the time being. Mr Clarke, while noting that the UK recovery remained strong, said there was little immediate prospect of inflationary pressure from the consumer side of the economy. Mr Clarke said more subdued growth of consumer demand would allow exports and investment to grow faster and for longer before capacity constraints were hit. He added that pay pressures also appeared to be under control. The September 26 meeting was brought forward because of international meetings at the end of September and took place only two weeks after UK bank base rates were raised to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent. There was, therefore, relatively little new information for the chancellor and governor to discuss. Mr George said there was no question of wanting to tighten the policy stance further in October. He said it was possible, however, that the run of favourable shocks to inflation might be coming to an end. Since Mr Clarke made his observations about consumer demand the Central Statistical Office has disclosed a relatively robust 3.7 per cent rise in retail sales volumes in the year to September and the Confederation of British Industry has reported a fall in retail sales in the year to October  -the first since December 1992. Official figures on retail sales in October will be released today and statistics of third quarter consumer demand tomorrow.</p>

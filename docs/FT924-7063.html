			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fiat in top management shake-up FIAT yesterday announced a streamlining of top management, splitting the organisation into two broad sectors - industry and industrial development, and financial control and resource management. The aim is to prepare Fiat, Italy's largest private industrial conglomerate, for lean times and costly investment in its main business, the motor industry, as well as organise the divestiture of non-core activities. The shake-up comes as Fiat prepares for the departure of chairman Mr Gianni Agnelli who is due to hand over to his brother, Umberto, in 1994. The new structure paves the way for the departure of Mr Cesare Romiti as the chief executive officer, who is thought unlikely to remain after 1994. The very obvious promotion in the reorganisation of Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, the 54-year-old chief operating officer, puts him in line for Mr Romiti's job. Mr Garuzzo's role in the group is to be substantially expanded. He is being put in charge of one of the two broad divisions of the new management - the automotive industry, Fiat's diversified industrial portfolio and industrial development. The second broad division in charge of the group's financial control has been given to Mr Paolo Mattioli with the creation of the post of chief financial officer. A Fiat spokesman said the new structure would be effective from December 1. There is no direct reference to redundancies at the head office in Turin where more than 1,000 managerial staff are employed. However, tertiary activities such as legal services, travel and property, would be conducted elsewhere. Fiat's move follows a similar shake-up by Olivetti last week. The group relies on the motor sector for more than two thirds of turnover and Fiat's profits are being squeezed (first-half 1992 profits fell to L655bn) by the recession in its main markets. It is pledged to invest some L40,000bn (Dollars 29bn) over the next decade in the motor sector alone. Already this year it has closed a Lancia plant near Turin but more widespread cuts could follow. In recent weeks speculation has mounted that Fiat has been studying possible disposals, notably its profitable store chain, Rinascente, as well as other sell-offs including Cogefar Impresit, Italy's largest private construction group, and its Toro insurance business. The sale of non-essential assets is likely to be one of the main tasks of the new chief financial officer.</p>

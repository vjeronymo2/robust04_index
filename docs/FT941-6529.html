			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ICS rises 10.5% to Pounds 2.62m Industrial Control Services Group, the electronic safety systems manufacturer, yesterday reported a 10.5 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits despite difficult economic conditions in its markets, particularly the oil sector. Profits were Pounds 2.62m (Pounds 2.37m) for the six months to November 30 on turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 39.9m (Pounds 30.1m) reflecting strong growth in control systems and the impact of the Brisco acquisition. Earnings per share slipped to 2.91p (3.82p) through the dilution from the joint venture with Elsag Bailey. However, interim dividend is being increased to 1.5p (1.33p). Operating profits increased 32 per cent to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.73m) but the gain was partly offset by Pounds 546,000 costs associated with ICS ending manufacturing in Scotland under its rationalisation programme. The control systems grew strongly with turnover more than doubled to Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 8.5m).</p>

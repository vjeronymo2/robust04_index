			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: And then there were the peas . . . - Restaurant correspondent Nicholas Lander reflects on the high and low points of a year's eating out The most exasperating experience: trying to book a table at Quaglino's in London's West End. Having tried, and failed, many times to get through by telephone, I called personally at Quaglino's a month before I wanted a table. I was ushered to a woman who, having kept me waiting, eventually turned the bookings register to the date I wanted. Even upside down, I could see there was only one reservation for the night in question. I requested a table for 8.30pm but they did not want to please me, the customer, but to fill the restaurant when it was at its most quiet. She did offer me a table - but only at 6.30 or 11. I declined. The most depressing culinary experience: lunch at Simpson's-in-the-Strand. This was not, I assure you, because of the location or the service (although the wine waiter took at least 10 minutes to find the bottle we had ordered), but because of the peas. This might sound petty but it is not meant to be. Simpson's is a great British institution, a wonderful place to take overseas visitors (I know of one French restaurateur living in London who makes a point of taking all his French friends there). With the renaissance of British produce and cooking, it is a potential flagship for all British restaurants. When I sat down to lunch there late in November, I had no compunction in ordering their daily special, steak and kidney pudding served from the trolley. But, aside from the disappointing texture of the pudding and the undercooked boiled potatoes, I was surprised that instead of serving an inventive winter vegetable - parsnip chips, braised cabbage or carrot puree  -along came peas. Fresh peas in summer are wonderful; but in mid-November, and for this number of customers, they can only be tinned or frozen. Consequently, they were dreadfully bland, reminding me instantly of miserable school lunches. Rather more significantly, they would give any overseas visitor the clear, but false, impression that British cooking had not improved at all. The most exhilarating gastronomic experience: Olivier Roellinger's cooking at Cancale, Brittany, northern France. Any weekend with a slightly sceptical wife (mine) in an unknown hotel in an area where the rain fell consistently from Friday morning to Sunday afternoon could end in disaster. But the view from our bedroom window across a bay full of oyster beds to Mont St Michel was so wonderful that it was sufficient compensation. The bonus was Roellinger's superb handling and cooking of fish and vegetables from local fishermen and growers, and his treatment of the distinctive pre-sale lamb which grazes on the salt marshes. It reinforced a growing impression that although British chefs are offering value as good as their French counterparts in the middle of the market, the finest French chefs (of whom there are only a handful) are still in a class of their own at the very top of the culinary tree. My biggest omission as a restaurant correspondent: not to have visited enough British restaurants outside London. This has been almost entirely because of family commitments which have kept me in London, but it is an omission of which I am all too conscious. It is not just because, as a Mancunian, I am aware of the perceived (and often real) pro-London bias in the media. (Several weeks ago, when I wrote a story on the top 30 young British chefs, we asked Christopher Chown from Plas Bodegroes in Pwllheli, Wales for a photograph. He was amazed - only London chefs, he felt, were featured in the national press.) I also feel an obligation to readers outside London, and to overseas readers who visit the UK but may not want to spend too much time in the capital. More importantly, I believe strongly that restaurants outside London have had three difficult years. Many have done well to survive. Those which flourish have done so only by trimming prices and margins and, in what are invariably small family businesses, their own pay packets. There could be worse to come. A recent editorial in Hotel &amp; Caterer, the restaurant industry's trade magazine, predicted a difficult 1994 as a result of the tax changes in the November Budget. It estimated that typical middle-income restaurant-goers would find their available spending money cut by up to Pounds 100 a month in 1994 - and that this would have wide repercussions for the eating-out market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 20 (AA) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman  Ferhat Ataman said today that to prevent further deaths in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  should make a decision promptly.    Ataman told a weekly press conference that the UN secretary  general had authorized the alliance to carry out air strikes not  only to protect Gorazde, but Zepa, Srebrenica, Tuzla, Bihac and  Sarajevo.    "Even though it's late, we regard this initiative as a  positive and useful step," Ataman said.    Ataman pointed out that UN Resolutions 824 and 836 had  empowered the UN secretary general to make such a demand.    "An urgent initiative to be taken by NATO in line with this  call is necessary to protect the organization's respectability,  effectiveness and deterrence," he concluded.</p>

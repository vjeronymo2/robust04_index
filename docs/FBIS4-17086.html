			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Serov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr -- Lord Owen, cochairman of the  conference on the former Yugoslavia, has arrived in Moscow from  London today. Thorvald Stoltenberg, another representative of  this forum, is expected to arrive in the Russian capital  tomorrow. The two diplomats will have talks with Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. The question of Russia's  participation in political decisionmaking on Bosnia-Herzegovina  will be at the center of their talks.    Russia should take part not only in drawing up the map of  the  division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the talks regarding  sanctions against Yugoslavia, but also in adopting resolutions  on the military actions that the international community should  be taking in this region, Lord Owen said to journalists before  his departure for Moscow. The Russians understand that we need  to use force, he noted, and our key task is to get them on our  side. What we cannot afford is to allow the UN Security Council  to be split.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: DNO seeks share suspension DNO, the oil company controlled by Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian investor, yesterday requested a suspension of trading in its shares while discussions were taking place with institutional investors in Nedlloyd, the Netherlands' biggest transportation group. DNO holds about 6 per cent of Nedlloyd's capital and is seeking to boost this shareholding significantly through purchases from institutional shareholders. Mr Tor Olav Troeim, DNO's managing director, said yesterday the company's shares could be suspended for at least two weeks, but this would depend on the outcome of discussions to increase the company's Nedlloyd stake. DNO said that negotiations with the Nedlloyd institutional shareholders were 'to gather a considerable ownership position in Nedlloyd into DNO'. Mr Troeim suggested that talks were being held with Nedlloyd institutional investors holding 50 per cent stake in the Dutch company. He would not disclose the identity of the institutions. The suspension comes a month after Mr Hagen, DNO chairman and also a shareholder in Nedlloyd, won a seat on the company's supervisory board following a ruling in his favour by the Amsterdam Court of Appeals. Mr Hagen is also the board chairman of Marine Investments, DNO's parent company, which also holds shares in Nedlloyd. In all, it is believed that Mr Hagen controls an estimated 25 per cent stake in the transport group through subsidiaries. Mr Troeim said that the suspension would stop market speculation. When DNO released its half-year results at the beginning of last month, it reported the sale of more than 600,000 Nedlloyd shares, realising a gain of NKr15.4m. At that time, DNO's board warned that the restructuring of Nedlloyd was proceeding too slowly and this was reflected by a sharp fall in the company's share price to Fl 35 at the beginning of September from Fl 56 at the end of June. The board said that several of Nedlloyd's largest shareholders had contacted Mr Hagen requesting him to accelerate the restructuring of the company. 'The board is disappointed that the matter has become so drawn out and will closely evaluate, together with other major shareholders in Nedlloyd, the alternatives available,' DNO said last month. Some analysts believe that Mr Hagen is seeking to consolidate his Nedlloyd shareholding into DNO from Marine Investments, and it was highly unlikely the company would seek to make a full bid for the Dutch group.</p>

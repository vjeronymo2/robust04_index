			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A medical report on the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Iran's 89-year-old  leader is recovering well from surgery to stop internal bleeding, and he was  shown on Iranian television sitting in his hospital bed, being fed soup and  playing with a grandson. Iranian opposition sources said, however, that  Khomeini's condition may be much worse than officially reported. A statement  from the Baghdad-based Moujahedeen organization, released in Bahrain, said  Khomeini had suffered a heart attack since the operation last week and that he  previously had required prostate surgery. Iranian television mentioned a slight  heart complication on Saturday but gave no details.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTING SAIL ANEW;  </P> <P> VENTURA YACHT CLUB EMBARKS ON ANOTHER SEASON OF RACING  </P> <P> George Roberts peers at a cluster of racing yachts jockeying into position for  the start of the Ventura Yacht Club's first regatta of the season. He checks  his wristwatch, looks to see that no yachts have lurched prematurely across the  starting line and tenses in anticipation of the shotgun blast that starts each  race.  </P> <P> Once the first wave of streamlined spinnaker racing yachts slip across the  starting line, Roberts readies himself to repeat the procedure for the next  race 5 minutes later.  </P> <P> As part of the crew on the club's racing committee yacht, Roberts oversees the  start of the races and watches for rule violations.  </P> <P> With the race underway and the yachts off on their 8-mile trek across the Santa  Barbara Channel, Dick Massa of Ventura, another member of the racing committee,  settles back to reminisce about some of the less orderly races he's seen in his  12 years with the club.  </P> <P> "You better believe it gets competitive out there," Massa said. "Sometimes,  it's worse than the America's Cup. These guys will fight to settle something."  </P> <P> While Massa has never been called upon to settle any fisticuffs, he has  refereed some strong verbal disagreements between competitors following a race.  </P> <P> Chuck Stanton, commodore of the Ventura Yacht Club, agrees that the competitors  take their racing seriously.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of Corinthian spirit among the members, but it gets  competitive," Stanton said. "Nobody goes out there to lose."  </P> <P> Races are only part of the allure of this yacht club, which draws members from  as far as Phoenix.  </P> <P> The strong prevailing winds that sweep across the Santa Barbara Channel from  Point Conception, north of Santa Barbara, to Point Dume is the biggest  attraction of the Ventura Yacht Club, which has used the channel for sloop and  yacht races for 50 years.  </P> <P> Ralph and Bonnie Koerner of Phoenix fly their private plane twice a month to  Ventura to take advantage of the channel's prime sailing conditions.  </P> <P> "Since I don't have an ocean in Arizona, I like to borrow the one in Ventura on  the weekends," Ralph Koerner said. "This Santa Barbara Channel has some of the  best sailing of anywhere on the West Coast."  </P> <P> After sailing for 20 years with the Marina del Rey Yacht Club, Roberts, of  Canoga Park switched to the Ventura club to escape the congested sailing lanes  around Marina del Rey and Catalina Island.  </P> <P> "I was looking for the smallest, most convenient club I could find and I think  I've found a gem here," Roberts said. "Everybody knows everybody, there are not  that many boats in the Ventura Harbor and when you sail to these nearby islands  you really feel like you have gotten away from it all."  </P> <P> Veteran sailors like Howard Young, 80, of Ventura can recall when club members  moored their boats in Santa Barbara -- until the Ventura Harbor was built in  1964.  </P> <P> In more than 30 years of sailing, often with his wife, Virginia, 75, as his  only crew, Young has been content not to venture beyond the 100-mile boundaries  of the Santa Barbara Channel.  </P> <P> "The farther south you go from here, the calmer the winds get," Young said.  "The conditions here would be ideal for the America's Cup."  </P> <P> For the time being, the Ventura Cup will have to do. Eight area yacht clubs are  expected to compete in this year's Ventura Cup, slated for Sept. 9-10.  </P> <P> Many of the Ventura Yacht Club's members gear up all season for the Ventura  Cup. Others, however, prefer the noncompetitive aspect of sailing.  </P> <P> "Part of the pride you get from yachting is just using the wind and water and  figuring out what to do out there," Stanton said.  </P> <P> Roberts, a devotee of noncompetitive yachting, would rather cruise his 29-foot  sloop on pleasure trips than compete for trophies in the club's monthly races.  </P> <P> "For me, sailing is a release from other things, so I'm not real anxious to get  into the stressfulness of racing," Roberts said. "For the cruising sailor, like  myself, it's the infinite variety of weather that's challenging. There is  nobody out there to tell you when to take the sail up or down. It's all up to  you."  </P> <P> There are some members, however, such as club secretary Ann Keller of Ventura,  who don't like racing or slow sailing.  </P> <P> "If it isn't at least 700 feet long, I don't get on it," Keller said. "I get  nauseous just standing on a yacht."  </P></p>

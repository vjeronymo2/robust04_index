			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Delors ducks the Ecu64,000 question: The Brussels press corps failed to get a 'Oui' or a 'Non' on his Elysee ambitions Mr Jacques Delors knew his audience was hanging on every word yesterday. But at the end of a masterly performance ahead of tomorrow's European summit in Essen, the outgoing president of the European Commission avoided revealing the answer to the Ecu64,000 question: does he want to succeed President Francois Mitterrand in the Elysee? Speculation about Mr Delors's intentions rose to fever pitch last Tuesday in Budapest on the fringes of the CSCE conference. First, he revealed that he had, at last, made up his mind on whether to stand in next year's elections; but then he refused to reveal whether the answer was Oui or Non. Yesterday, at his 28th and last pre-European Union summit briefing to the Brussels press corps, he added that he felt 'better' now he had made his decision. The dilemma for Delors-watchers is whether the mixture of philosophical musings and emotional outbursts at yesterday's briefing amounted to a swansong after 10 years in Brussels as the architect of European integration; or whether what we were witnessing was a dress-rehearsal for a presidential campaign whose goal would be to kick-start the Franco-German motor and push ahead for a political and economic union in Europe. Mr Delors, 69, revealed that he remains a man of many contradictions. At times, he bemoaned Europe's fate, riven by the Bosnian civil war in its own backyard and shaken by the forces of fragmentation let loose by the end of the cold war. He lashed governments for 'taking hostages' in order to get their own way inside the Union, claiming these blocking tactics had reached unprecedented levels. Yet in the same breath, he suggested that Europe was on the mend. The economic recovery was under way; the European exchange rate system had survived the currency crises of 1992-3; and there was the promise of peace in Northern Ireland, to be sweetened this week with a Dollars 360m (Pounds 220m) aid package which he has personally promoted. 'At some funerals, people say 'No flowers or wreaths. You do not have to send me flowers and it is not time yet for wreaths. Europe is still solid.' In schoolmasterly fashion, Mr Delors proceeded to tick off the list of reading material which he intends to present to European leaders in Essen: economic competitiveness; the labour market; a case study in job creation, and the new information society - all part of what one senior EU diplomat in Brussels describes as Mr Delors's obsession with Europe's competitive weakness in relation to the US and Asia. If there were hints of a hidden agenda, it came when Mr Delors launched an outspoken attack on the US for pressing the case for early expansion of the Nato alliance to encompass the former Soviet Union's satellites in central and eastern Europe. His criticism of the Clinton administration's tactics is shared widely in European capitals, including London; but it would do him no harm among French voters, many of whom remain reflexively anti-American. Second, his cri de coeur about an economic recovery which has failed to create jobs anticipates one of the chief topics on the Essen summit agenda; but it also matches the mood in France where the economy is pulling out of recession more slowly than its neighbours. Third, Mr Delors dropped several hints that he is deeply dissatisfied with the operation of the Maastricht treaty, particularly the 'pillar system' which mixes supranational powers in areas such as agriculture and competition policy with loose inter-governmentalism in foreign policy, security, and judicial affairs. Mr Delors has already spelled out his preference for a European federation, built around what would amount to a Franco-German political union, in a stream of interviews with the French, and latterly, the German press over the past few months. To Mr Delors, this could be the makings of a strategic bargain between France and the more powerful unified Germany; but in his native France it has led to charges that he is coming dangerously close to being a German 'collaborator'. During his news conference yesterday, Mr Delors, who remains notoriously sensitive, let slip that he felt that some of the criticism in France was way below the belt. 'Every human activity is imperfect,' he protested. Such sensitivity is not conducive to a presidential campaign; but on the other hand Mr Delors can see an opposition divided, his own Socialist party in turmoil, and a country in search of direction as Europe seeks to bring together east and west.</p>

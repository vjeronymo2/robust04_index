			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KING CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> The NFL has recently announced that it will not hold the 1993 Super Bowl in  Arizona, because Arizona voters voted against a referendum to make Dr. Martin  Luther King's birthday a state holiday.  </P> <P> Stop the car, Mayor O'Connor. How dare you invite the NFL to San Diego when our  city's voting record on Dr. King is equally as bad as Arizona's? Convention  Center, Market Street: Ring a bell?  </P> <P> TONY ROMERO  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

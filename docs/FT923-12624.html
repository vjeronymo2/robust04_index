			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Stamps expert cleared of plot on 'fakes' MR CLIVE FEIGENBAUM, a former chairman of Stanley Gibbons, the stamp dealers, was yesterday cleared of masterminding a plot to dupe collectors into buying fake rare stamps deliberately printed with errors to boost their value. After a three-month trial at Southwark Crown Court the jury acquitted him of fraud-ulent trading. Two weeks ago, at the end of the prosecution case, the judge directed the jury to acquit six men charged with Mr Feigenbaum because there was insufficient evidence against them. Another man, who had originally pleaded guilty, changed his plea and was also discharged. The prosecution had alleged that Mr Feigenbaum was behind a fraud that involved the manufacture of colonial government stamps with deliberate printing imperfections such as lack of perforations or missing colours. Such stamps, which do not normally slip past printers' checks, are known as varieties. The stamps had been advertised without Mr Feigenbaum's knowledge in collectors' catalogues as genuine 'mistakes' with rarity value. Mr Feigenbaum claimed that Commonwealth stamps produced with his authority under 'open contracts' were valid reprints and varieties to meet demand from collectors interested in special subjects such as cars and trains. He said that 'revolutions' in the stamp industry had allowed 'open contracts' to be negotiated with governments, allowing certain varieties and reprints of issues to be made. The prosecution had mixed up that sort of agreement with contracts negotiated by colonial governments through Crown Agents for new stamps, he claimed. Judge Eugene Cotran made clear during the course of the trial that the production of varieties in itself was not illegal, although it is an offence to sell them as if they were produced accidentally. Mr Feigenbaum's acquittal may disturb some sections of the philatelic world, which does not accept the practice of printing varieties. Mr Feigenbaum has collected and dealt in stamps since childhood. Over the past eight years his career has changed from the chairmanship of Stanley Gibbons, the biggest name in the stamp world, to a position outside the main industry body, the Philatelic Traders Association. The reflotation of Stanley Gibbons on the Unlisted Securities Market was called off at the last minute in 1984, when Mr Feigenbaum was chairman. He resigned and sold his stake in the company. Informed collectors are now wary of spectacular errors in newly issued stamps from certain small countries, but those in the philatelic trade say that few will follow Mr Feigenbaum into openly printing varieties. Mr Richard West, editor of Stamp Magazine, says that most printers would not touch a request to print varieties. 'In fact, it is common knowledge that another stamp printer was approached with a similar proposal and just flatly refused,' he said. 'It was more than their reputation was worth.' Printing contracts can depend on a record of producing as few accidental varieties as possible.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOWMAN IS OUSTED AS WESTMINSTER CO-COACH  </P> <P> Westminster High School administrators asked Jack Bowman Tuesday to step down  as co-coach of the football team, leaving Stan Clark as head coach.  </P> <P> "We came to that decision at the end of football season, that we needed to  return to a single head coach," Principal Robert Boehme said. "After the first  of the year, I sat down with them and they both agreed."  </P> <P> Boehme said the change was necessary because of "communication problems" caused  by having two coaches. Two coaches creates a problem "because you have two  different people speaking and sometimes you double the work and overlap the  work or sometimes things are missed," he said.  </P> <P> Boehme, Athletic Administrator Don Griffith and Assistant Principal Frank  Paredes asked Bowman and Clark, who also is the boys' athletic director, to  submit coaching plans for next season.  </P> <P> "Based on the coaching plan and interviews and the tons of intangibles, the  unanimous decision of the committee was that Stan Clark would be the head  coach," Boehme said.  </P> <P> Bowman declined to discuss the decision, but Clark said he doesn't expect  Bowman to be a member of the staff next season.  </P> <P> "Jack told me today he won't be back," Clark said. "He's hurt, and I feel bad  about that. I would be upset if the decision had been the other way. I could  see this coming, but the change was necessary.  </P> <P> "No matter how well you get along, communication becomes difficult with two  coaches in charge. It's like having two captains on a ship. Jack and I agreed  at the time to try one coach, I'm just sorry it worked out this way."  </P> <P> . Bowman, who teaches history at Westminster, was an assistant football coach  there for 13 years before becoming co-head coach in 1985.  </P> <P> In his 4 years as co-coach, Westminster compiled a 23-22-1 record, advancing to  the playoffs each year.  </P></p>

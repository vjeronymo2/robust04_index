Lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and Robert Lamm will be read to  harp music.  </P> <P> In keeping with the 1970 motif, Koenig says, in the first half of the concert  she will wear a flower-power gown; in the second half, an "I Am Woman" outfit.  The men likewise will dress in period garb, including platform shoes and  bell-bottom pants.  </P> <P> Audience members are encouraged to wear clothing appropriate to 1970 and to  bring a fondue fork for the "historically correct" reception after the concert.  </P> <P> What: 1970 concert.  </P> <P> When: 8 p.m. Friday.  </P> <P> Where: Erickson Hall, Mandeville Center, UC San Diego.

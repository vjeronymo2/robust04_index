Police have found the remains of the explosive which have  been sent for examination. This proves preliminary conclusions  of the investigating commission that the action had been planned  in advance. Police are still questioning local residents. The  power line security has been tightened.    The explosion occurred on the day when Russian and Latvian  delegations were supposed to resume their talks. Observers  believe that this is not an incidental coincidence.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Rioting spreads to Yemeni capital RIOTS engulfed five Yemeni towns, including the capital Sanaa, yesterday and the government said 11 people were killed and 48 civilians and policemen were injured, Reuter reports from Sanaa. In Sanaa, where there were no reports of casualties, police fired shots in the air and tear gas to stop hundreds of demonstrators reaching the presidential palace. Witnesses said crowds set fire to government cars. Dozens of people were arrested and some were beaten by police before being put on trucks and taken away, the witnesses said. The disorders were the worst to rock Yemen since the north and south merged in 1990. Strikes and demonstrations to demand more pay and a price freeze on essential foodstuffs have dogged Yemen since unification. The government, under its policy of democratic reforms, has tolerated them in the past.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (11): An area of prosperity - Profile: Guangdong KARAOKE sets are the latest thing at Yi Fa market, two thriving avenues containing about 300 shops in Pan Yu, a town just outside Guangzhou. Virtually all the shops, run by stall-holders who rent from the municipality, sell electronic goods, and they do brisk business in stereo equipment, air conditioners, and hand-held video games. The whole market has grown up over the past five or six years. The state-owned Friendship Store next door is like Woolworths set beside Bloomingdales. The gadgets it sells, such as telephones and electric fans, are basic by comparison with the state-of-the-art technology with which they now compete, and which Cantonese people seem to have the money to buy. Guangdong's prosperity is such that most city and town dwellers possess televisions, refrigerators, watches, electric fans, and washing machines. Nevertheless, the province still has a savings rate of well over 30 per cent and bank deposits by individuals rose 37 per cent last year. In the special economic zones, especially Shenzhen, just over the border from Hong Kong, the prosperity is even more marked - a traveller by road or rail who dozed off while leaving Hong Kong and woke up in Shenzhen would not believe that he had crossed into China. Some northerners who visit Guangdong view its rampant consumerism with distaste - but the luggage racks of trains going north carry plenty of karaoke sets and video games. The province's drive towards the market economy was given a lift this year when Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's 87-year-old paramount leader, paid it a visit. It was Mr Deng's method of forcing a new push for economic reform - though the struggle he is engaged in against more conservative rivals was evidenced by the fact that the visit was not at first reported by the official media in Beijing. Mr Deng's message was that Guangdong was on the right path and that other provinces should seek to match it. He told the province to be even bolder, and it is re-writing its 1991-95 five-year plan. A boom is evident all over the Pearl River Delta area. Last year, the value of industrial output in the province rose 27 per cent at constant prices - and in the three special economic zones (Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou) the figure was an astonishing 44 per cent. In the previous 10 years, the average annual growth for the province was 20 per cent. The driving force behind this growth has been foreign investment in manufacturing, particularly from Hong Kong. Industrialists in the British territory, which is due to become a special administrative region of China in 1997 and will therefore be tied even more closely to Guangdong, estimate that they invested Dollars 16.5bn in the Pearl River Delta during the 1980s. Guangdong's wage rates, though higher than in the rest of China, remain a fraction of Hong Kong's. It is difficult to determine precisely how much of the output is from the private sector, since a number of companies with foreign or other private investment are officially regarded as state-owned or collective. But some 40 per cent of Guangdong's production is estimated to be effectively from the private sector. Before economic reform began in 1978, there was none. Much of the new production is exported - the province's exports rose 28 per cent last year. With state-owned industries desperately over-manned and inefficient, the growth of profitable private enterprise alongside them perhaps represents China's best hope for the future. They can absorb the rapidly growing labour force and make the enterprise culture more widely accepted across the country. Provincial officials have taken to heart Mr Deng's exhortation that in 20 years Guangdong should take its place beside Asia's four industrialising dragons: Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. They have calculated that average annual growth of 12 per cent in gross domestic product would be necess ary to achieve this target. However, Guangdong still faces challenges if it is to meet Mr Deng's demand: Even though the province's infrastructure is being developed at a rapid pace, it is not keeping pace with economic growth. Roads, electricity capacity and communications will need to be built even faster. Growth of private property, private companies and financial markets demands much greater attention to legal and regulatory structures. There are no laws governing private property rights and no accounting standards. Foreign investment will need to continue to grow at a rapid pace, and to be directed steadily more towards industries involving a higher degree of transfer of management skills and technology. It will also need to spread beyond the SEZs and the counties in the Pearl River Delta which are referred to as little tigers. At the same time, the political backdrop must continue to remain favourable and nationwide economic reforms, particularly of the pricing structure, state industries and the banking system, must advance. Politically, Guangdong could benefit if Ye Xuanping, its former governor, were to receive a leading post in the political shuffle surrounding the 14th party congress, expected to take place this year. Mr Ye successfully defied Beijing on issues such as tax and led Guangdong's development on a relatively autonomous path. Though Mr Ye stepped down and was appointed to a less powerful position in Beijing, he has not moved to the capital and he remains an influen tial figure in the province. On the economic reform front, Guangdong this year became the first province to have rice prices completely freed - an experiment which has apparently avoided large fluctuations in prices. It is in the forefront of China's experiments with western-style capital markets and is expected to give foreign banks greater freedom to do business. For the rest of China its prime role is as an example of the relative prosperity reform and foreign investment can bring. The latest symbol is Gitic Plaza, a 63-storey complex being completed in central Guangzhou by Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corporation. Rivalling the most luxurious Hong Kong office blocks in lavishness, it is the tallest building in China and will house a hotel, offices, apartments, department stores, restaurants - and the inevitable Macdonald's.</p>

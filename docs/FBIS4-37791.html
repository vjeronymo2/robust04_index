			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Political commentary] </F>   [Text] Esteemed listeners: Following the savage atrocity  perpetrated by the Monafeqin [hypocrites, pejorative term for  Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] against the pilgrims at the  shrine of the eighth imam of the world Shiites, Imam Reza, peace  be upon him, the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Republic of  Iran, Dr. Velayati, sent a letter on 22 June to UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali.    In this letter, he calls on Butrus-Ghali to increase and  strengthen cooperation in the campaign against the threat of  terrorism on the national, regional, and international levels on  the basis of General Assembly Resolution 48/122 dated 28 August  1993.    As a result of the terroristic action against innocent  civilians by the Monafeqin grouplet on Monday, 20 June, when its  members planted a bomb in a holy Islamic place on a day that was  sacred, 26 pilgrims including many women, children, and old  people were martyred and 170 were wounded.    The reports and investigations by the experts and the  documentary evidence on this heinous atrocity confirm that this  act was part of a calculated program by the Monafeqin grouplet.  The letter from Dr. Velayati to Butrus-Ghali stresses that it  is the responsibility of all countries to fulfull their  international commitments in a joint international effort to  eradicate terrorism. They should not only condemn this inhuman  and dastardly act, but should also explore the possibility that  their official institutions, citizens, or their territories are  being used by this terrorist organization for planning,  financing, inciting, or supporting such crimes and should take  effective and appropriate measures to prevent this.    It is worth mentioning that unfortunately the adoption of a  two-faced stance by some of the ostensible supporters of the  political and international antiterrorist propaganda--with  regard to the activities of the terroristic groups of the  Monafeqin in their own countries--is considered responsible for  creating conditions favorable for this grouplet's premeditated  crimes. In addition, such countries do not honor their  commitments to combat international threats and merely mouth  these commitments for domestic consumption    The bloody incident in Mashhad has undoubtedly proved to the  whole world that, in order to attain its shameful and prurient  objectives, the terroristic Monafeqin group has trampled on all  ethical and international norms and does not have the slightest  regard for divine or human values.    The Muslim nation of Iran--by once again standing firm  against such dastardly catastrophes--has proved that the  cohesiveness of the Iranian nation can never be undermined and,  that, with the awareness of the Iranian people, all the cursed  plots of the foreigners and their mercenary agents will be  neutralized.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Personal View: Bridge between classroom and workplace Training currently enjoys an almost undisputed reputation as the engine of economic success and the panacea for the long-term unemployed. Industrialists can be relied upon to endorse the value of any new training initiative. Politicians reaffirm their commitment to parity of esteem for vocational and academic education as a symbol of their economic vision. The UK's latest initiative in vocational training and education is the introduction of new qualifications: General National Vocational Qualifications. GNVQs (and their Scottish equivalents) are supposed to herald enhanced status for vocational education to the benefit of industry and the enterprise culture. They are intended, says the government, to provide a bridge between the academic and vocational, leading into the workplace, giving credit towards more specific vocational qualifications, but also allowing progress into higher education. GNVQs have certainly recruited successfully among 16-18-year-olds. But this has little to do with their novel or vocational character. Research* just completed shows that GNVQs are taught, in classrooms, to teenagers whose main aspiration is higher education and who have no intention either of combining their GNVQs with the narrowly occupational NVQs (National Vocational Qualifications), or of moving on to NVQs in the future. Why are young people so apparently blind to what industrialists and politicians see as the needs of the labour market? In fact, the same patterns are to be found in other industrialised countries. In the Netherlands, the old-established junior vocational programmes are in near-terminal decline. In France, the government expanded the traditional baccalaureat programme with first technical and then vocational baccalaureats. Both were conceived as entry routes to employment, but have instead fuelled huge increases in university entrants and in numbers attempting higher technical awards. In Germany, famous for the dual system of apprenticeship, there are now more young people in higher education than there are in apprenticeships. Qualification panic has come late to England - but there too the demand is for more education. NVQs have failed as an attractive qualification for young people. People are generally more rational in serving their own interests than in their advice to others. Nothing suggests that teenagers are any different. On the contrary, their educational choices are a clear response to what employers look for when hiring. A central function of any education system is to sort people. Employers want the best employees they can find; young people want to differentiate themselves from their competitors. When few people possessed advanced educational qualifications, employers knew that the less qualified would include many able people. However, the more numerous the highly qualified, the less attractive those with few or no qualifications become. Moreover, the rhetoric about parity of esteem obscures the fact that, for most jobs, the relevant vocational skills are academic. An economy with a growing proportion of office-based jobs is one in which grammatical writing (not touch-typing) is the crucial requirement. A world of data-processing requires new and greater levels of numeracy, not a reduction in mathematics teaching. Japan's general education produces workers with many vocational skills and the capacity to learn fast on the job. The rationality of teenagers puts that of many policymakers to shame. In the UK, the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress apparently believe that what the unemployed require is government training programmes that equip them with skills. But what most companies actually look for are candidates who can be trained quickly for jobs that change constantly. That means people with high levels of general (notably academic) skills, and evidence of application, for example in pursuit of education. Little wonder that short-term government training schemes have such a dismal record, worldwide, in raising par-ticipants' chances of finding a job. Throughout the west, vocational education is converging with academic in the emphasis it gives to language skills, mathematics and science. It is doing so because of pressure from young people and parents: those affected most directly by what educational programmes offer. It is a pity that the suppliers of GNVQs have not yet learnt that the customers really do know best.

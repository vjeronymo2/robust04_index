			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Canada seeks to widen business ties with Cuba Canada's business presence in Cuba has been given a boost by a flurry of commercial and political initiatives in recent weeks. The announcement late last month that Canada was easing a 16-year aid embargo, imposed in protest at Cuba's involvement in the Angolan civil war, is expected to speed the growing involvement of Canadian non-governmental organisations and universities in Cuba. Two Canadian universities for instance, have set up English-language training courses for Cubans. Ottawa has never joined Washington in imposing trade sanctions against Cuba. Air Canada, for example, has maintained a regular service to Havana, and Canadians have been among the largest groups of foreign tourists visiting Cuba. Two-way trade totalled CDollars 311m (Dollars 224m) last year. The Canadian business presence in Cuba is centred on mining, oil and gas exploration and tourism. Joutel Resources of Toronto last year became the first western mining company to sign an exploration agreement with Geominera, the Cuban mining agency. Last month, Sherritt, a Canadian nickel and cobalt producer, unveiled plans for a joint venture with Compania General de Niquel which will include mining and ore processing facilities in Cuba, and a refinery in Alberta. In addition, Canadian hotel operators have signed management contracts with more than half a dozen Cuban hotels. Companies will also benefit by being able to draw on funds from the Canadian International Development Agency (Cida) for feasibility studies. Canadian investors and joint-venture partners have generally found a warm welcome in Cuba. Dr Jim Henderson, a member of the Ontario provincial legislature who has taken a close interest in Cuba, says that 'the wheels can turn very quickly, provided it's a kind of business that Cuba has decided it wants.' The recent shift in Ottawa's policy towards Cuba are unlikely to have a profound impact either on Cuba's tottering economy or its relations with the outside world. However, they highlight a clear division between the US and some of its allies on the best way of halting the deterioration in social and economic conditions in the country. The Clinton administration has continued to apply, though without great enthusiasm, the comprehensive embargo imposed 30 years ago. Calls from the US business community, especially hotel operators, to ease the curbs have been offset by pressure from the large Cuban community in the US to maintain them. Ottawa however, has come to the conclusion that continued isolation carries risks of its own. Its new policy is based on a view that industrial countries need to become more involved to alleviate the island's economic and social problems before they lead to an explosion. Ms Christine Stewart, a junior foreign affairs minister, told an Organisation of American States meeting in Brazil earlier this month that 'the isolation of Cuba is unhealthy, and it's within all of our interests to support change in Cuba that is positive and healthy.' The Clinton administration has taken an interest in the recent initiatives by Ottawa, but is said to have neither encouraged nor discouraged them.</p>

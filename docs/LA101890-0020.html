			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOM FOOD;  </P> <P> REMEMBERING THE WOMEN WHO SHAPED OUR TASTES. THE RECIPES ARE THE LEAST OF IT.;  </P> <P> WE REMEMBER MAMA;  </P> <P> DESSERT FOR DINNER  </P> <P> Although my mother's cooking never won any blue ribbons at the fair, we had no  problem cleaning our plates. Since money was always tight, my mom cooked a  whole repertoire of casseroles -- they all seemed to contain at least one can  of cream of mushroom soup -- and usually some Chung King chow mein noodles.  </P> <P> On the days when my dad was on the afternoon shift and wouldn't be home for  supper, my mother would often make rice pudding, and we'd make a meal of it. We  all loved it, and it was cheap. If there was any left over, we'd have it the  next day cold, for breakfast. My mom's rice pudding, hot or cold, is still one  of my favorite meals.  </P> <P> ARDELL KOCHEVAR'S RICE PUDDING  </P> <P> 1 cup rice, washed  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 4 cups milk  </P> <P> 1/2 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1 cup raisins  </P> <P> 1/4 cup butter  </P> <P> Ground cinnamon, optional  </P> <P> Place rice in saucepan and add water to just barely cover it. Add salt. Cook,  covered, until water is gone, about 5 minutes. Add milk and cook, covered, over  low heat about 1 hour, stirring occasionally. During last 10 minutes of  cooking, stir in sugar and raisins.  </P> <P> When done, remove from heat, add butter and stir until melted. Divide into 6  serving dishes. Sprinkle with cinnamon, if desired. Serve with milk or cream on  top. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> Ardell Kochevar with daughters Kathie, left, and Jackie.  </P> <P> Styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane  </P></p>

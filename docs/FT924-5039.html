			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Financier faces probe into Castor collapse MR WOLFGANG Stolzenberg, the secretive German-Canadian financier, has agreed to be examined under oath in Montreal next week over the collapse of Castor Holdings, the international property finance group which he controlled. Mr Stolzenberg, accompanied by a legal representative, is due to be questioned from Tuesday by officials of Richter &amp; Associates, Castor's bankruptcy trustee. The examination, lasting up to four days, will be in private. Castor, which specialised in high-risk second and third mortgages and construction loans, was put into receivership in July. Although the value of its assets was set at CDollars 1.9bn (Pounds 960m) in 1991, creditors are expected to lose at least CDollars 1bn. The creditors are mostly European banks and private investors, attracted by the 1980s North American property boom and tax benefits Castor obtained by channelling much of its business through offshore tax havens. The trustee is also due to provide creditors next week with a second progress report on the wind-up of Castor. They will be told investigations are at a delicate stage and little information can be divulged. Mr Stolzenberg is one of about 20 people Richter officials are interviewing. The trustee also wants to question Mr Karsten von Wersebe, co-founder of Castor with Mr Stolzenberg. Mr von Wersebe's other interests include a controlling stake in York-Hannover, another troubled Canadian property group with strong European links. Until earlier this year, he also controlled Coutinho Caro, a bankrupt Hamburg steel, shipping and construction group. Mr von Wersebe's companies have been at the centre of allegations in Switzerland that Rothschild Bank of Zurich, an associate of N M Rothschild of London, contravened banking rules by advancing more than 20 per cent of its capital in unsecured loans to a single customer. Among the subjects on which Mr Stolzenberg is likely to be questioned are his links with Castor and Imry Merchant Developers, the UK property group in which he acquired a controlling stake in 1989. Imry's affairs were discussed at a meeting in London last week between Mr Stolzenberg, Imry's other directors and officials of Barclays Bank, which has an exposure of just under Pounds 400m to Imry and faces huge losses on these loans.</p>

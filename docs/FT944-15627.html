			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Cornerstone for new Middle East: Israel and Jordan point the way to regional economic changes The Israel-Jordan peace treaty initialled in Amman yesterday is the most important cornerstone yet of plans for a new Middle East marked by Arab-Israeli trade, integration and regional economic development. The geographical proximity of the two countries and the opportunities for joint projects in energy, water, tourism and shared use of ports, airports and roads will take the new Middle East beyond the drawing board. The agreement comes two weeks before Arabs and Israelis are due to meet in Casablanca at a conference to discuss an economic blueprint to cement peace in the Middle East. On the Casablanca agenda are plans to form a regional development bank, initially capitalised at Dollars 10bn, and to raise finance for at least 150 private and public sector projects worth Dollars 25bn (Pounds 15.8bn) in investment over 10 years. Furthermore, with a second Arab neighbour formally at peace with Israel, economic relations with Egypt, a much larger economy than Jordan, should increase after more than a decade of cold and cautious peace and minimal trade. 'This is an enormously important piece of the economic puzzle,' Mr Ehud Kaufman, senior Israeli economic negotiator, said yesterday. 'Jordan is a trading country at the heart of the Middle East with western standards and a desire to boost its economy.' Economic negotiations between Israel and Jordan, backed by detailed plans, are already well advanced and yesterday's agreement will allow for speedy implementation of projects. First on the agenda is the construction of dams on the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers and a desalination plant at the Sea of Galilee. Under the peace agreement, Israel has promised to raise the finance and, says one official, the European Union has agreed to meet half the costs. There are hopes of finance from the US-backed Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The second most immediate development will be the wider opening of borders to promote trade and tourism. A new border crossing at Bet Shean south of the Sea of Galilee is expected to be opened early next month. The main aim of the crossing, supported by an upgrading of roads, will be to give Jordan access to the Israeli Mediterranean ports of Haifa and Ashdod. The new crossing, combined with that opened two months ago between Aqaba and Eilat, will also boost tourism. Once the agreement is formally signed, Jordan is expected to lift the ban on Israeli passport holders crossing into Jordan and to speed the movement of vehicles. Israel last week transferred responsibility for a third crossing at the Allenby bridge from the military to the ministry of transport and Jordan abolished the requirements for special permits to cross the bridge. In return for Jordanian access to Israel's ports, Israel is hoping for a quick agreement for shared use of Jordan's huge Red Sea port at Aqaba to gain easy access to markets in east Asia. Use of Aqaba would also allow Israel to give scarce land in Eilat, currently used by its port, over to the more profitable and booming Eilat tourism industry. In trade, Mr Kaufman said yesterday, the agreement would allow Israeli negotiators to move ahead quickly with a formal bilateral trade deal. Israel has already granted Jordan a preferential trade concession worth Dollars 30m a year for exports into the still Israeli-occupied West Bank. Mr Kaufman said both sides were committed in principle to a free trade area with the removal of customs barriers but first would conclude an agreed list of products. While Israel would continue to give Jordan preferential trade treatment to support its political courage, he said Israel now wanted a formal agreement to 'underscore the fact that the trade boycotts and barriers are removed formally and in practice'. Within a few years trade could approach Dollars 1.5bn or Dollars 2bn, Mr Kaufman said. Air links between the two states are also expected to be concluded within weeks of the formal signing ceremony. Linking the electricity grids of Israel and Jordan is already under way, starting with Eilat and Aqaba. Jordan's Dollars 4.5bn economy is dwarfed by Israel's which last year had a gross national product of Dollars 70bn. But the two countries, spurred by the political commitment of their leaders to a new Middle East, are the most likely to develop economic co-operation providing both a vital building block and a model of economic transformation in the region.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Trading under way in privatisation shares - Koninklijke PTT Nederland Trading gets under way today in shares of Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the Dutch telecommunications and postal operator which is being partially privatised in the biggest share launch in the history of the Amsterdam stock exchange. The 138.15m shares were priced at Fl 49.75 with private investors given a discount of Fl 2.50 per share up to a maximum of 75 shares. The price was at the high end of expectations but the offer was nearly three times oversubscribed. The Dutch state, which is raising nearly Fl 7bn (Pounds 2.5bn) through the sale of a 30 per cent stake in the company, is eager for trading to go well to pave the way for a second tranche by late 1997. It will also be watching to see how many private investors cash in their shares immediately to realise the difference between the price they paid and the price fixed for institutional investors. This is the first Dutch privatisation in which small shareholders have been given a financial incentive to take part. With a total market capitalisation of Fl 22.9bn, KPN will be the third largest company listed on the Amsterdam bourse, behind the exchange's two Anglo-Dutch giants, Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever. It will account for more than 7 per cent of the market's total capitalisation.</p>

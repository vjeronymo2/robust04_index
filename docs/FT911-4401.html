			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: London Options Market aims to widen retail appeal THE LONDON Traded Options Market is introducing a series of improvements designed to enhance the market's appeal to retail investors, write Tracy Corrigan and Jim McCallum. LTOM is planning firm price quotations on screen for retail orders of up to 10 contracts (10,000 shares) and a 'trade ticker' providing volume as well as price information. The changes were targeted by a special committee report by the LTOM Divisional Board, following a survey of broking houses and private customers. LTOM derives only 30 per cent of its business from retail investors, compared with about 70 per cent at other options exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Exchange and the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam, according to Mr Geoffrey Chamberlain, LTOM's chairman. Retail business on LTOM declined in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash. Mr Chamberlain underlined the importance of retail investors in enabling market-makers to balance their activities, since institutions often sell calls to hedge their share holdings, while individual investors tend to be buyers of calls. The issue of cost, considered a deterrent for investors, has not been specifically addressed. After the Big Bang reforms of 1986, share dealing commissions fell for large customers but they remain unchanged for smaller investors. On an options trade of up to Pounds 5,000, an individual investor will pay 5 per cent (2 1/2 per cent to buy and the same to sell). The number of options dealers who will offer a service to small investors has fallen. Mr Paul Hilton, options analyst at James Capel, says 'private client operations have become very expensive to run'. Consequently costs are only likely to fall if volume picks up. High clearing fees also discourage investors. A fee per contract of between Pounds 1 and Pounds 1.50 is charged by brokers for clearing through the London Clearing House (Loch). Some brokers say this could be reduced to 25p per contract. The Pounds 12 fee which is paid to Loch for margin purposes when options are sold by investors is also widely criticised as a barrier to small investors. LTOM also plans to promote the use of the Public Limit Order Board, which allows clients to place orders for execution at specific prices. Currently, this accounts for less than 2 per cent of volume. The exchange also plans to discuss with retail outlets such as banks and building societies the setting up of execution facilities for clients.</p>

As a result, raw sewage from the prison overflows  into the nearby American River. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality  Control Board issued a cleanup and abatement order at its meeting Friday,  telling prison authorities to do something about the problem. "The prisoners  jam sheets and mattress covers down the toilets," said Wayne Pierson, chief of  the regional water board's regulatory unit. "They also use oranges, shirts and  plastic bags."  </P></p>

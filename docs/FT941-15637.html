			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Malaysian success story hits currency The Malaysian ringgit, one of Asia's more stable currencies over the past year, has developed a sudden volatility. For much of last year the ringgit stuck near the MDollars 2.52 mark against the US dollar. In the last week of 1993 it plunged 7 per cent to MDollars 2.70 against the US dollar before bouncing back to under the MDollars 2.60 mark. Now the currency has again dropped sharply and yesterday was trading at a two-year low of about MDollars 2.73 against the US dollar. Currency traders say the year-end drop was mainly due to Bank Negara, the central bank, buying in large quantities of US dollars to revalue its reserves and reduce year-end book losses because of foreign exchange transactions. Last year the bank, known in the money markets as an aggressive foreign exchange dealer, was forced to reveal MDollars 9.3bn (Pounds 2.4bn) of foreign exchange losses. But this week's ringgit fall has more to do with positive factors in the Malaysian economy. Latest estimates indicate that in 1993, for the sixth consecutive year, Malaysia's gross national product grew by more than 8 per cent. The ringgit has become a victim of the country's economic success. Funds have been flooding into the country, attracted by the strong economy, comparatively high interest rates, and, until recently, the strength of the currency and the bullishness of the local stock market. This has led to excess liquidity in the financial system. To prevent inflationary pressures building up, Bank Negara has been forced to mop up large amounts of excess funds. A move last week to raise the statutory reserves requirement for banks from 8.5 to 9.5 per cent seemed to do little to ease the problems. In the last few days the central bank has taken further action: on Tuesday it announced measures to broaden its definition of banks' eligible liabilities - against which the banks have to make provisions  - in order to 'capture all inflows of funds from abroad'. Bank Negara also said that from January 17 it would impose an unspecified limit on bank holdings from external sources which were not demonstrably trade related or for genuine investment. The bank's action has sent shockwaves through the currency market, with traders moving swiftly to offload ringgit. Foreign fund managers believe this will restrict levels of investment in the Kuala Lumpur stock market, one of the world's leading performers last year.</p>

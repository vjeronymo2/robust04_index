			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / West putting east out of business: Germany's recession is making internal competition fiercer PERSISTENTLY high production costs in eastern Germany are preventing the region's companies from competing with their western counterparts and are contributing to a high rate of insolvencies, according to a survey by the Halle Institute for Economic Forecasting (IWH). A survey of 300 eastern enterprises shows how the recession in western Germany is encouraging companies there to compete for new markets in the east of the country. Faced with 'this aggressive price policy', the east is finding it impossible to compete because of its high production costs. The latter are a result of unrealistically high wages in eastern Germany. These are currently around 80 per cent of western levels, and will reach parity by 1996, despite productivity levels which are lagging behind western Lander, or states, by as much as 70 per cent in some sectors. Many enterprises bought or set up by local, west German or foreign investors have been cushioned from the effects of high wage costs by investment subsidies. Nevertheless, the level of insolvencies suggests that a stable and expanding market is far from certain. For instance, the IWH survey shows that private businesses have chosen to concentrate on the local market, even for services. What is not clear is at what point this market becomes saturated or, indeed, if the goods produced will ever be competitive enough to gain a niche in the export sector. More than 1,185 insolvencies were recorded in 1992 and had already reached that level half way through this year. The rise reflects the end of the consumer boom as indicated by the sharp rise in personal savings. For the first six months of this year, savings rose by nearly DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn), or 4.5 per cent, compared to the same period last year. Insolvencies were most marked in construction, the main growth sector in eastern Germany. The percentage of insolvencies was 30 per cent above the 1992 level.</p>

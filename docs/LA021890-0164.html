			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOY WOUNDED BY GANG BULLETS DIES  </P> <P> A 6-year-old boy died early Saturday of a head wound he suffered five days  earlier when alleged gang members opened fire at a rival in Pomona and hit the  child instead, police said.  </P> <P> The boy, Daniel Rodriguez, died at Pomona Valley Community Hospital about 1:45  a.m.  </P> <P> Authorities said a teen-ager arrested a day after the shooting on suspicion of  attempted murder will be charged with the boy's death.  </P> <P> The suspect was not identified because of his age.  </P> <P> Witnesses told police that a carload of males flashed gang hand signs Tuesday  as they drove past the home where Daniel had been staying with his mother, then  shouted a gang name and opened fire.  </P> <P> The boy, who was standing on the porch, was shot, along with a 23-year-old  woman who also lived there. The woman, Olga Perez, was reported in good  condition Saturday, recovering from a head wound.  </P> <P> The boy's mother, Marie Rodriguez, 23, said she had been staying with Perez's  family for the past month, trying to escape her estranged husband's life style  as a gang member.  </P> <P> On Friday night, hours before the boy died, several hundred people carrying  candles and signs marched in protest of the shooting through the drug- and  gang-infested neighborhood in Pomona where it occurred.  </P> <P> A record 44 homicides occurred last year in Pomona, most of them gang-related,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Pomona police officers, meanwhile, opened a bank account to help pay for  Daniel's funeral.  </P> <P> "I saw (the boy) at the hospital,"Detective Allen Maxwell said. "It was tragic  to see him lying there lifeless."  </P> <P> Contributions to the funeral fund may be made by contacting the Pomona Police  Department.  </P></p>

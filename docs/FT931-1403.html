			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report London robusta COFFEE futures closed higher, with the May contract ending at Dollars 898 a tonne. Traders had put a Dollars 900 target on May, and the market got within Dollars 1 of that in late trade. The continuing ICO council talks on a new international agreement were ignored, although traders noted that volume would remain relatively light until the meeting ended. Some store was put on a letter from US President Bill Clinton to his Colombian counterpart on the coffee pact. But it was the reflection of chart-inspired buying in New York which really encouraged business in London. COPPER came under pressure on the LME from disappointed liquidation, extending three-month metal's decline below Dollars 2,200 a tonne against a background of reduced concern over Chilean supplies as the possibility of strike action at Chuquicamata faded. New York raw SUGAR prices were mixed at midday as the market sought signs of the next move. Traders said the market continued to be prone to volatile swings after hitting a three-year high of 12.53 cents a lb on Monday. Compiled from Reuters</p>

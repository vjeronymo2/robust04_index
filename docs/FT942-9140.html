			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Corrections trim base metals gains  -Market report The bull-run in base metals prices continued at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, although some necessary downward reactions were taking place, dealers said. COPPER faltered near the Dollars 2,200-a-tonne level for three months delivery, which has assumed psychological importance, and, after peaking at a fresh 14-month high of Dollars 2,195, settled back below Dollars 2,180. NICKEL trading was again hectic and volatile, with the three months price coming within a whisker of Dollars 6,600 a tonne in the morning, before an overdue technical correction set in. From a high of Dollars 6,590, the price plunged to Dollars 6,350 before ending at Dollars 6,450, up Dollars 50 on balance. Although the threat of disruption to Falconbridge supplies from Norway had been removed by the calling off of the dock workers' strike, the nickel market was still nervous about a strike at Inco's Sudbury facilities, traders said. TIN prices broke higher in after hours 'kerb' trading following the confirmation of bullish chart signals above Dollars 5,600 a tonne. With the market emerging as the latest beneficiary of speculative interest, the three months price ended at Dollars 5,725, up Dollars 145. ZINC extended its gains on the kerb, with the triggering of stop-loss buying orders stops running three months metal up to a new high of Dollars 1,011 a tonne, despite the absence constructive fundamentals. Although mine output of zinc fell steeply in the first quarter of the year, according to latest International Lead and Zinc Study Group data, refined production is rising, and stocks are increasing. Three months ALUMINIUM hit a 22-month high of Dollars 1,360 a tonne, but proved unable to push up towards the Dollars 1,373 chart objective, and closed at Dollars 1,352, an Dollars 8 gain. London's precious metals continued quiet in the afternoon after the US markets opened with little direction being offered except in SILVER, which came under pressure and closed 7 cents down at Dollars 5.35 1/2 a troy ounce. The London Commodity Exchange COCOA market remained dull throughout the day. Buying in New York arrested the slide in the afternoon but trading remained technically-dominated. The July futures position opened Pounds 4 down at Pounds 953 a tonne before sinking to Pounds 941. But the steadier-than-expected New York opening lent support and some of the losses were recouped by late afternoon. July closed at Pounds 951. Compiled from Reuter</p>

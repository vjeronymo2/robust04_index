In the year ended May 31, about 22 per cent of the 350 companies in the association negotiated pay freezes. More than 40 per cent settled for pay rises of up to 2 per cent. Although a quarter settled at between 3.1 per cent and 4 per cent, nearly all those were concluded almost a year ago. Nationally, engineering industry pay settlements were about 8 per cent in mid-1991. Recession and a climate of falling inflation has reduced demands sharply since then.

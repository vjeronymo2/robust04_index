			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Jobseekers' allowance The government yesterday described the proposed new Jobseeker's Allowance - to replace income support and unemployment benefit from 1996 - as 'a simpler, clearer system for unemployed people and a more effective way of helping them back to work.' Three pilot schemes were announced: the Jobfinder's Grant, for those finding a job after being out of work for two years or more; an extended jobsearch and assessment course for young people, and a scheme involving providing the jobless with caseworkers to help identify the best way out of unemployment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China Editor] </F>   [Text] In an apparent move to slow the pace of reforms  amid increasing social and economic instability, China's  Communist Party chief and State President Jiang Zemin has called  for caution in economic restructuring. A reform package would  be introduced only when it would benefit the overall interest of  the general public, Mr Jiang, was recently quoted as saying. It  would be put in place only when the overall economy and society  could stand for it, Mr Jiang added. Mr Jiang appeared to be  more reserved than other leaders about the reforms.    Chinese sources said the leader's remarks were revealed by  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua during an important speech to senior  economic officials at a national meeting on price in Beijing  earlier this month. Mr Zou said the remark by the party boss  was the consensus of all senior leaders' views and should act as  a guideline for future economic reforms. The guideline,  initiated by Mr Jiang, was also discussed and agreed by the  party politburo at a recent meeting, a Chinese economic source  quoted the vice-premier as telling senior economic officials  from central ministries and provincial authorities.    China analysts and economists said the remarks were  tantamount to ruling out any radical reforms, apparently  highlighting the increasing concern among senior leaders with  projected reform packages.    Despite this leaders have been cautious about pushing  forward  reform packages, many of which were worked out late last year  and expected to be put in place either this year or next, they  appear to be striking what they call a "balance among growth,  reforms and social stability". [sentence as published]    "Now, Mr Jiang apparently rules out the possibility in  pushing forward those more sensitive reforms as they could have  by and large some impact on the economics and society," a Hong  Kong-based mainland economist said.    Mr Jiang said that as political and economic situations were  much more complicated than a decade ago, they required officials  responsible for reforms and the economy to be much more  cautious. Mr Jiang added that although reform packages could be  introduced, they should be implemented step-by-step. However,  officials should watch the implementation of reform policy  closely and review the situation and the effectiveness regularly  after it was introduced, Mr Jiang said.</p>

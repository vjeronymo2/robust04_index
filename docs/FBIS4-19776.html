			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Peter Pelinka </F> in Atlanta on 18 April: "Vranitzky: How I See Bill Clinton"]    [Text] [Pelinka] Mr. Vranitzky, you visited President  George Bush at the White House two years ago. What is the  difference between him and Bill Clinton in your view?    [Vranitzky] The atmosphere was correct and even friendly.  Yet it would have been difficult for me to discuss social and  employment issues with him. This is completely different with  Bill Clinton. I met him in 1991 during a meeting of the  so-called Bilderberger in Baden-Baden, during which these issues  were also discussed. Basically, however, it is not up to me to  define the differences in the styles of two U.S. Presidents. As  a small country that was liberated in 1945 and became fully  independent in 1955 with the help of the large United States,  Austria's main interest must be to raise its profile in the  United States.    [Pelinka] You seem to be visiting the United States quite  often.    [Vranitzky] During numerous visits -- formerly as a  financial manager and now as chancellor -- I have noticed that  Austria is not really represented on a large scale. The second  reason for my frequent visits is a political one -- specifically  the joint interest of our two countries in the stabilization of  Central and East Europe, and the joint interest in a stronger  United Nations that has one of its headquarters in Vienna.    [Pelinka] In this respect, you proposed the convening of a  conference in Vienna for the settlement of the economic problems  in the countries of the former Yugoslavia. Don't you think that  there have been enough conferences on this topic? Are the real  problems not somewhere else -- particularly in view of the  tragedy of Gorazde? Is the planned reconstruction of in this  largely destroyed region topical at a time when a bloody war is  still raging there?    [Vranitzky] Like everybody who is dealing intensively with  this problem, I am a little helpless. After the adoption of the  cease-fire in and around Sarajevo, the Serbs have again started  massive armed aggressions. First, the armed hostilities must  now be stopped with all means that seem useful. However,  generally, I am afraid that it will be even more difficult to  find a political solution for the postwar period. The world  community is currently very reserved in this conflict. For this  reason, I will submit my proposal. We Austrians are not  entitled to call for a stronger military commitment because we  cannot participate.    [Pelinka] Don't you think that the proposal that you are  presenting here in the United States might be interpreted as  another sign that the Europeans again want a stronger U.S.  commitment because they themselves cannot solve the problem?    [Vranitzky] In this specific case, this is not true because  the proposal was coordinated with Bonn, Rome, and Helsinki.    [Pelinka] Many Europeans, particularly conservative ones,  are currently displaying anti-Americanism. Has it been  triggered by the disappointment about the failure of  Reaganomics, and by the insight that the United States has  remained a superpower -- in fact, the only one -- but that it no  longer is the leading conservative power in a Cold War that no  longer exists?    [Vranitzky] Reaganomics has proved inefficient and is  outdated. However, I have never believed that European and U.S.  interests can be separated, and that efforts to assign the  United States a leading role in the Far East are not useful.  The United States has always intervened at the right time -- in  the Panama conflict against Noriega, in the Gulf war against  Saddam, now in Sarajevo, and in the Middle East Peace process.  Despite all reservations against the U.S. system -- in the  social and health spheres, for example -- it has always proven  to be able to renew itself.    [Pelinka] Are you saying that Europe should not increase its  distance from the United States if the European Union [EU] turns  out to be successful, or if the Western European Union becomes  stronger and even turns into an alternative to NATO?    [Vranitzky] Particularly from the Austrian viewpoint, a  greater distance would be nonsense. We must not advocate  Eurocentrism, and we must not pretend that Europe can become a  fortress. As far as the military aspect is concerned,  membership in NATO is not topical. We are primarily interested  in the creation of a European security system.    [Pelinka] Austria has a large trade deficit vis-a-vis the  United States. Our exports involve 15 billion schillings and  our imports 25 billion. Will we be able to develop more  strength in the U.S. market once we are a member of the EU?    [Vranitzky] We must not rely on others in this respect.  Everything depends exclusively on our own strength. Let me give  you a few positive examples: The BMW works in Steyr, the  development of a Diesel engine for passenger vehicles, the  establishment of a BMW factory in the United States, and the  development of an Austrian-produced Diesel motor for this  factory. This became possible because our tax reform has made  investment in Austria more attractive for BMW.</p>

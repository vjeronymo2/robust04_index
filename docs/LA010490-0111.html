			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> POINT GUARDS DELIVER SHARP PERFORMANCES  </P> <P> Antelope Valley (14-5) and Moorpark (12-5) have compiled the best records among  Valley-area men's basketball teams largely because of a pair of record-setting  freshman point guards who believe it's better to give than receive.  </P> <P> Dedan Thomas of Antelope Valley and Sam Crawford of Moorpark came out of high  school with glowing credentials, and both have already set school single-game  assists records and are on pace to shatter season records as well.  </P> <P> Thomas, an All-City Section 4-A Division selection at Taft High, set an  Antelope Valley mark with 17 assists against San Diego Mesa and is averaging  10.2. With 163 assists in about half a season, he ranks fifth on the school's  all-time single-season list and is only 39 short of Mike Thompson's record of  202 in the 1976-77 season.  </P> <P> Should Thomas maintain his pace, he'll shatter the season record for assists in  a game (6.7) by nearly four. The only benchmark for Thomas' performances is  Crawford's exploits.  </P> <P> Crawford, a Westchester High graduate, has 155 assists in 15 games and should  break Jim Amico's school record of 284 set in 1976-77. Crawford, like Thomas,  has already set a school single-game record of 19 assists.  </P> <P> Their excellence has not gone unnoticed. Crawford was the Most Valuable Player  of the Midstate tournament at Cuesta College, and Thomas earned the same honor  at the Golden West tournament as both led their teams to championships.  </P> <P> Rising star: It's been a disappointing season for the UC Davis men's basketball  team, but senior Tom Neumayr is leading the Aggies in scoring after playing  only 13 minutes a game last season.  </P> <P> A standout at Thousand Oaks High and Moorpark College, Neumayr is averaging  14.9 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists a game after averaging 5.8, 1.5 and  0.8 as a junior.  </P> <P> The left-handed guard scored 19 points in Davis' 69-68 victory over Cal State  Northridge on Friday night, 15 in a 87-59 win over Dominican College on Tuesday  and is shooting 50% from the field.  </P> <P> "Tom has been a stabilizing influence both on and off the court for this team,"  first-year Coach Lonnie Williams said. "We're in a transition period. This is  basically a new team from last year and Tom has really developed into a leader.  </P> <P> "He's not a rah-rah type of guy, but he's a quiet leader. He leads by example.  He doesn't say much to the other guys. He just goes out there, game after game,  and gets the job done."  </P> <P> That's been especially important because the Aggies have lost four of their  five starters from last season.  </P> <P> All of which has left the door open for Neumayr.  </P> <P> Playing the odds: Though Davis' victory over Northridge snapped an eight-game  losing streak and enraged Matador Coach Pete Cassidy, Williams figured it was  about time.  </P> <P> After all, the Aggies had played -- and lost to -- three other teams in the  California Collegiate Athletic Assn., of which Northridge is a member. Davis  lost to CCAA teams Chapman (90-80), Cal Poly Pomona (81-80 in overtime) and Cal  State Bakersfield (61-55) before beating Northridge.  </P> <P> "We're 2-9, but we could easily be 7-4 or 8-3," Williams said after Davis beat  Northridge. "We've just had some bad breaks in some close games."  </P> <P> Lost weekend: After losing their second and third game in a row to Davis and  Cal State Sacramento on Friday and Saturday, Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy  wanted nothing more than to fly home Sunday and start regrouping for Wednesday  night's game against Biola.  </P> <P> But even that was asking too much as the Matadors' noon flight to Burbank was  canceled because of heavy fog at the Sacramento airport, and they had to wait  five hours for the next flight.  </P> <P> Statwatch: Derrick Gathers led Northridge in scoring and rebounding in both  games last week.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-3, 190-pound senior from Philadelphia had 18 points and nine  rebounds against Davis and 16 points and nine rebounds against Sacramento  State.  </P> <P> Gathers, who is averaging 21 points and 8.2 rebounds, has led Northridge in  both categories in five games this season.  </P> <P> Fleet blocker: At 5-foot-9 and 175 pounds, USC wide receiver Gary Wellman is  known more for his receiving than his blocking. However, the former Westlake  High standout made a key block in the Trojans' 17-10 victory over Michigan in  Monday's Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> Wellman screened out Michigan cornerback Todd Plate at the five-yard line on  Ricky Ervins' 14-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run, which broke a 10-10 tie.  </P> <P> "I ran and stalked (Plate) for awhile, then I was right in front of him,"  Wellman said. "I looked back to see where Ricky was cutting, saw him going to  the inside, so I turned to the inside and walled him off.  </P> <P> "We're not taught to knock the defensive back down or block him real hard, but  just get in his way."  </P> <P> Wellman averaged a team-high 18.5 yards a reception this season, but was  limited to one catch for six yards against the Wolverines.  </P> <P> "We played a little more conservative, dumping the ball off, because they were  playing off and giving us the underneath routes," Wellman said. "Their  secondary will not give up the deep ball. The one attempt at a long pass we did  have, Todd (Marinovich) more or less threw it out of bounds because Michigan  had it covered."  </P> <P> Wellman considered the Trojans' win as a "ghost-busting."  </P> <P> "The past two years we've had a ghost hanging over us that we couldn't win the  Rose Bowl," Wellman said. "Now we've proven everybody wrong."  </P> <P> Gary Klein and staff writers Brendan Healey, Steven Herbert and John Ortega  contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Letter: BICC's role in development of semiconductor Sir, In his article 'GEC breakthrough improves prospects for superconductors' (February 26), your science editor gives the impression that the discovery of a new high temperature semiconductor was a General Electric Company development. The discovery was, in fact, the work of a joint team of BICC and GEC engineers and has been patented jointly by BICC and GEC researchers. Both companies are members of a European Community collaborative project on superconductivity which also includes Asea Brown Boveri, Alcatel Cable, Pirelli Cavi and Siemens. BICC is co-ordinating a related EC techno-economic study of the applications of superconductors, particularly for power cables. BICC also funds, with the fellowship of engineering, a senior research fellowship at the University of Cambridge in superconductivity. Among other results, this has led to an improved high temperature superconductor showing superconductivity at -145 deg C.

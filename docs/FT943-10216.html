			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / A funny way to sell a railway: The UK rail strike has made privatisation of the system more difficult to pull off The UK rail strike, about to enter its ninth week, is more than a conflict over the pay of a few thousand signalling staff. It is a struggle over the future of the railways that could derail the government's plans to privatise British Rail. The likelihood that the strike would spread diminished with the announcement on Thursday that supervisors had voted not to join the action. Their efforts, combined with those of non-striking signalmen, have allowed British Rail to run an increasing number of services on strike days. But the stoppages have revealed the vulnerability of the companies that will run trains after privatisation to action by small groups of workers. It is not clear at present just how much compensation they will be entitled to if the trains are brought to a standstill. As a result the companies look much less attractive to potential bidders for train-operating franchises and to their backers. The strikes have been a 'death blow' to privatisation, says Mr Roger Brooke, chairman of Candover, the venture capital group which had expressed interest in backing bids. 'I think they have killed it stone dead,' he says. And an adviser to the government involved in the privatisation process admits that the dispute will have deterred a lot of bidders. 'The general effect of the action must be to make what is a difficult privatisation even more difficult to pull off,' he says. This will be music to the ears of Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT, who laid out the union's battle-plans on privatisation in a briefing on March 24, just days before the process began. He warned that the railways faced a summer of disruption, with five issues which could provoke strikes, overtime bans and work-to-rules. 'Trouble is going to break out if British Rail do not come to terms with us,' he said. 'There is a genuine fear of the future among my members.' The first issue was over the terms for transferring BR staff to Railtrack, the company set up on April 1 to run the track and signalling operations. The union complained this would mean staff would no longer be able to move from one job to another across the railway network. The RMT balloted the staff over strike action but to the union's disappointment the members rejected the call by a decisive majority. The second potential source of trouble on Mr Knapp's list was the pay of signalling staff - the issue behind the current dispute. The long-standing grievances of the signalmen had come to a head with BR's rejection of the union's interim pay claim of an 11 per cent increase as a reward for productivity improvements. The union ballotted the staff, securing a four-to-one majority in favour of action on an 80 per cent turn-out. In pursuing its demands, the union has been helped by the behaviour of Railtrack and the government. Railtrack's board - led by the abrasive Mr Bob Horton, former chairman of BP - is largely new to the rail industry. It has failed to win the hearts and minds of the signalling staff or, if opinion polls are to be believed, the public. Railtrack's shortcomings have been compounded by the transport department's intervention to veto a 5.7 per cent interim pay deal linked to past productivity improvements. The offer was not a breach of the government's public sector pay freeze but an attempt to prepare the ground for restructuring the often archaic working practices of signalling staff. By intervening, the government not only prolonged a dispute that might otherwise have stopped short of strike action. It has helped draw attention to weaknesses in its privatisation plans that could yet derail the sell-off. The government's plans involve breaking British Rail into some 40 independent businesses and selling them off. The infrastructure of track and signals has been separated from the operation of trains, and passenger services split into 25 companies to be franchised out to private operators. The structure is designed to allow for the possibility of running competitive services over the same tracks. However, a consequence of the separation of track and trains is that train-operating companies will have to pay track charges to Railtrack under the watchful eye of a regulator. This will leave them with direct control of only half their running costs. Being able to control just part of the cost-base is one reason why Badgerline, a bus company that was one of the first companies to declare an interest in running trains, has now cooled towards the idea. The dispute, leading to losses for the train operators which cannot run their services, has highlighted the dangers, according to Mr Philip Snowden, a director of the company. 'If we were to make a bid for a franchise, we would want suitable protection against the sort of losses that the train operators are currently incurring,' he says. Candover's Mr Brooke says that the strike has shown how disputes in one part of the rail system can affect the finances of the train-operating companies. 'It's not just Railtrack,' he says. 'What happens if ScotRail goes on strike? The English train-operating companies would lose revenue from passengers travelling to and from Scotland. 'With the rail unions still in an antediluvian age, they can pick off one or two companies and damage all the others. 'Unless the train operators can send everyone home on no pay when they can't run trains in such circumstances, it will seriously diminish interest in investing.' Mr Chris Green, director of Scotrail, one of the first six passenger franchises to be auctioned, says that the strike has been a 'chastening experience'. He is running the company as a 'shadow' franchise in preparation for privatisation and hopes to lead a management buy-out. 'The point of shadow franchises is to get experience of running trains under the new arrangements,' he says. 'This has been an unexpected experience in cash-flow management. We are currently haemorrhaging cash at a rate of Pounds 300,000 for each strike day. We can recover costs from Railtrack for the trains we don't run. But we get no compensation for losses on lines that do run, or for loss of business long-term.' His solution would be for some sort of collective insurance policy, under which train operators would be compensated from a central fund for losses incurred because of disruption to one part of the network. Potential investors in Railtrack - which Mr Horton would like to see as an early candidate for privatisation - will be equally nervous about the consequences of strikes. 'If I were considering investing in Railtrack, I'd be terribly interested in seeing what sort of compensation the train operators will get from the company,' says a venture capitalist who is considering getting involved. 'The balance of risk looks pretty one-sided in Railtrack's favour at the moment, but that may not last.' One businessman who says that he is not fazed by the current dispute is Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, the shipping company, who is keen to acquire BR's Freightliner business. 'I think we'll look back on this as a blip in the process of change,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this week. 'Both the workforce and management have got to be much more flexible in the years to come. 'Frankly, nothing in my view is going to stop the revitalisation of the railway system in this country. I think the rail strike has heightened people's interest as to what the railway system can really produce for this country.' But most people in the industry - or thinking of entering it - will agree with Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, when he warned that continuing conflict on the railways would 'devastate the industry and the livelihoods of those who work in it'. For the RMT, the stakes are equally high. Other unions in recent years - most notably the mineworkers - have been all but wrecked by resistance to change. Mr Knapp and his colleagues recognise the risks involved in a fight to the finish for the signalling staff. Over the years, the union has been able to block efforts to modernise working practices on the railways. Avoiding trouble was often the preferred BR option in dealing with archaic working practices. But privatisation looks set to change this, with a more entrepreurial attitude to the management of the railways already apparent. Railtrack, for example, will buy in engineering services from the private sector rather than employ thousands of staff to maintain track and signalling. The train-operating companies are expected to root out inefficiencies and look for more flexibility in working practices. Changes such as these threaten RMT's membership base at a time when the union is in deep financial trouble. After a previous dispute, BR ended the check-off arrangement which collected union dues direct from the pay packets of rail workers. Its membership has fallen sharply in the past two years from more than 100,000 to about 60,000. The union is running a Pounds 2m deficit on its current account for the second successive year and is having to make painful cuts in its operations. One option would be for the union to show greater willingness to come to terms with privatisation. Unions in other privatised industries such as gas, water and electricity have reached agreements with the new employers to reform working practices in return for better terms and conditions. But the RMT appears to have chosen the alternative of trying to block change. It has already secured a promise from Labour that the railway network will be returned to state ownership if the party wins the next general election. 'Our commitment to take the network back into public ownership is absolute,' said the party's transport spokesman Mr Frank Dobson yesterday. It may be that the failure of the supervisors' ballot to produce a strike vote heralds a realisation among rail staff that opposition to privatisation is ultimately doomed. But there remain plenty of opportunities for investors to be reminded of the vulnerability of the railways to costly disruption under the new arrangements.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PROTESTERS CALL FOR BORDER ENFORCEMENT  </P> <P> A group of protesters denounced U.S. immigration policies Wednesday and urged  Congress to deliver money promised years ago to tighten security along  America's borders.  </P> <P> About a dozen demonstrators from Citizens for Responsible Immigration gathered  in front of the Federal Building in Santa Ana on Wednesday, carrying placards  calling attention to what they see as a lack of law enforcement officers to  patrol U.S. borders.  </P> <P> "Basically, we're here because our borders are not secure. We're fighting  anarchy here," said Richard Avard, 55, a roofing contractor from Fountain  Valley. "Mexican laborers are being exploited. As a legitimate contractor, I'm  competing against the unscrupulous contractor who is knowingly hiring illegal  aliens. We can't compete. How are we going to compete when a guy doesn't pay  any taxes?"  </P> <P> Several protesters said their concerns stem from dissatisfaction with  enforcement of the 1986 federal immigration act. That law provides fines and  the possibility of jail time for employers who hire illegal aliens. It also  gave amnesty to thousands of illegal migrants already in the United States and  authorized more than 1,500 border patrol agent positions.  </P> <P> Ben Davidian, western regional commissioner for the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service, said that no money has been allocated to hire those  agents, however.  </P> <P> The protesters said employers have been hiring illegal immigrants because there  are not enough agents to stop them.  </P> <P> "If they are going to have a law, enforce it," Avard said. "If not, get rid of  it because it's a farce."  </P> <P> Maria Maldonado, 52, who traveled to the protest from her home in Imperial  Beach, said the issue is immigrants who are breaking the law.  </P> <P> "They hear all the things about this country and when they get here, they are  living in the streets and in the canyons in San Diego," Maldonado said.  </P> <P> Some Mexican-Americans who stopped to observe the protest Wednesday said they  did not think the protesters had their interests in mind.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's right," said 14-year-old Rachel Gonzalez, who listened to  the demonstrators with several members of her family. Gonzalez said she thought  the demonstrators were unfairly attacking Mexican immigrants, who only "come  here to work, make money, make a better life. Like for me, to be here and get  an education and go to college."  </P> <P> Lilia Powell, executive director for the Orange County Coalition for Immigrant  Rights and Responsibilities, said illegal immigrants should not be hired but  that the protesters were making their point the wrong way.  </P> <P> "Having a demonstration of that sort does not contribute a solution to the  problem," Powell said from her office in Santa Ana. "In the long run, they are  contributing to the anti-immigrant sentiment. . . . We have labor laws that  deal with (workers hired illegally). These need to be enforced instead of  making an immigration issue out of it." LUCY CHABOT  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Working Russia movement will "do everything to  prevent provocations on May 1" (by the authorities - IF's  note), the leader of the movement and the Russian Communist  Workers' Party, Viktor Anpilov, told a news conference in Moscow  Friday. Anpilov said he feared that exercises by the Moscow OMON  (special purpose police units) held a few days ago were  connected with the coming May rallies organized by the  opposition. In Anpilov's opinion, President Yeltsin is "morally  interested in finally removing the issue of early presidential  elections" in June 1994 and "needs to provoke disorders, any  conflict on the streets of Moscow," in order to be able to blame  the opposition.    Anpilov said he was ready to discuss all aspects of the May  1  march with the Moscow authorities. The organizers of the march  intend to start from Kaluzhskaya (formerly Oktyabrskaya) square  at 11:00 via Yakimanka (formerly Dimitrova street), Bolshoy  Kamenny Bridge, the Kremlin Embankment to Vasiliyevskiy Spusk  where a festive concert is planned to be held.    If the Moscow authorities do not permit this route, the  organizers of the march will propose another one, from the  Kaluzhskaya square to the viewing site on the Vorobiyovy (Lenin)  Hills along Leninskiy Prospekt, Anpilov said.    When the demonstrators disobeyed to the Moscow authorities  in  May 1 1993 and moved along this very route, they clashed with  regular and special purpose police units. As a result of  clashes, one policeman was killed, while dozens of people were  injured. A criminal case was filed following the incident, but  the State Duma's decision of February 23 1994 declared an  amnesty for all participants.    According to Anpilov, this time up to 100,000 people will  attend to the demonstration. He told Interfax that Working  Russia had formed an unarmed squad of its supporters to maintain  order. No less than 300 members of this squad will stand by,  while another thousand will be dispersed among the  demonstrators. The May 1 rally will be carried out under the  slogans "All Power To Workers!" and "No To The Colonization Of  Russia!"    In Anpilov's opinion, the May 1 rallies which will be held  in  all cities will be a rehearsal for a general political strike in  Russia. He believes that only wide workers movement is capable  of changing the political and economic course within the  framework of the Constitution. However, Anpilov declined to  indicate any possible dates of the general political strike.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kang Xinwen (1660 2450 2429)] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 19 May (XINHUA) -- Belgian Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene on 19 May met Li Ruihuan, visiting chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference. The two sides expressed satisfaction  over the very successful economic and trade cooperation between  China and Belgium, and hoped for long-term and stable  development of friendly ties and cooperation between the two  countries.    Dehaene said: Belgium and China enjoy friendly ties, the  exchange of high-level visits between them increased in recent  years, and Belgium's investments in China have continued to  expand and have produced good results. The past few years saw  China's economy develop very rapidly, and this will produce a  major impact on the Asian region. We attach importance to and  appreciate China's constructive role in the UN Security Council.    Dehaene was confident that Li Ruihuan's visit would promote  continuous development of Sino-Belgian ties in political,  economic, and other fields.    Li Ruihuan said one of the main aims of his tour to Belgium  and four other north European nations is to learn from and draw  on experiences which will benefit China. China hopes to develop  long- term and stable friendships and cooperative ties with  other countries in the world, as this will promote modernization  in China and contribute to world peace and development.    Li Ruihuan said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out that  we must absorb and draw lessons from all fruits of civilization  created by human societies, including advanced science and  technology and experiences in management and administration from  advanced capitalist countries. This is a thesis which is full  of foresight. The thesis is extremely important in that it  offers guidance on China's reform, opening up, and modernization  and the way China conducts exchanges with foreign countries and  handles issues concerning international relations.    He pointed out: Experiences of mankind include direct and  indirect experiences. From the vertical perspective, human  knowledge means inheritance, but from the horizontal  perspective, it means drawing on experiences. A country which  stands still and refuses to make progress, closes itself to  international intercourse, and refuses to accept useful things  from other countries will be left behind by the trend of the  times.    He said: In the past century or so, the Chinese nation fully  suffered from imperialist aggression and plundering. It had no  choice but to devote its main energies on national liberation  and was unable to concentrate its energies on economic  construction. Thus, it lost a lot of precious time and fell far  behind developed nations in the West in economics, science, and  technology.    With the implementation of reform and opening up, we have  marched into the world, entered the international market, and  continued to absorb and draw on experiences which benefit us  from all countries. We have not only accelerated our  development, we have also made corresponding contributions to  the international community.    Li Ruihuan said emphatically: We must not forget that in the  history of development stretching over thousands of years, the  Chinese nation accumulated a very rich cultural heritage, and  that a complete set of fine traditions took shape despite its  having to go through nearly a century of struggle. We must  greatly treasure these good things, and care must be taken to  preserve them and carry them forward. Only by preserving our  good things and absorbing good things from other countries are  we "adding one good thing to another" and making ourselves  better. This is just what we have often said: Learn from other  people's good points, carry forward our good qualities, absorb  the strong points from various people, and follow our own path.    Today, Li Ruihuan also met Robert Urbain, Belgium minister  of  foreign trade [and European affairs]. The two sides praised the  smooth development of bilateral economic and trade ties.    Li Ruihuan said: Sino-Belgian economic and trade cooperation  developed rather rapidly in recent years. The two countries'  economies are highly complementary to each other. There is  great potential and broad prospects for the two sides to conduct  mutually beneficial cooperation. We are willing to work  together with the Belgian side to push bilateral economic and  trade ties to a new stage of development.    Urbain said: China has made remarkable success in economic  development. The Belgian Government attaches much importance to  the development of economic and trade ties with China. It is  ready to continue strengthening friendship and cooperation with  China. It believes that Li Ruihuan's visit to Belgium will  promote bilateral ties, particularly further development in  bilateral economic and trade ties.</p>

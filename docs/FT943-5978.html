			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / People: Northern Leisure selects managing director Clive Preston, 55, has been appointed managing director of Northern Leisure, the Preston-based group which is recovering from a period of over-expansion and heavy losses. Preston, who joined the group in 1990, is currently the operations director. In his new role he will run the group on a day-to-day basis and take some of the weight off the shoulders of Nicholas Oppenheim, the group's vice chairman. Oppenheim had got more heavily involved in the company's affairs after it ran into trouble and has helped oversee the slimming down of the business and its refinancing. Robert Wickham, 61, a former general manager of the Bank of Scotland, has also joined the board as a non-executive director. Graham Massey, 39, who runs the group's bowling centres, has also been appointed to the board.</p>

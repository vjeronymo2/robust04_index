			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["R.O"-signed report: "Submarine Deal With Taiwan To Be </F> Taken Before the Security Council Again?"]    [Text] Bonn -- The German shipyards that were interested  in participating in the construction of 10 submarines for Taiwan  want to go ahead with the project.    The shipyards do not want to accept the sweeping rejection  by  the Federal Government. According to information received by  WELT AM SONNTAG, they want to take the weapons deal once more to  the Security Council of the government if a cooperation  agreement with U.S. companies should be concluded.    Currently, a group of German companies  (Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, Thyssen-Nordseewerke, and  Ferrostahl) are holding talks with a U.S. shipyard consortium on  the construction of small submarines for Taiwan.    The Germans are to supply the body, and the Americans will  equip the ships. A total of 10 ships worth a billion German  marks each are involved. No decision has been made.    If a cooperation should come about, the government in  Washington would approach the German Government concerning the  wish for cooperation, the companies involved hope. On this  basis, the Security Council would have to make a new decision.  The supporters of this deal hope that it would be difficult for  the Federal Government to reject the U.S. wish because this  would have a negative impact on Germany's reliability as a  cooperation partner in international weapons deals.    The Security Council banned the delivery of submarines to  Taiwan in 1993 out of consideration for communist China. Since  then, the German group has been trying to obtain a participation  in the construction of submarines abroad. Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) stated last week  that German submarines will not be supplied to Taiwan by a  roundabout way.    The companies did not want to accept that. "The decision of  the Security Council only applied to direct supplies to Taiwan,"  a spokesman of the shipyards told WELT AM SONNTAG. The  consortium is being supported by a group of about 150 officials  from the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and Free Democratic  Party of Germany in Bonn who also supported the direct deal with  Taiwan. The decision of the Security Council does not apply to  supplies for companies in NATO countries, CDU official Guenter  Klein from Bremen told WELT AM SONNTAG.    According to Klein, the cooperation would be covered by the  existing principles of the Federal Government for the export of  military equipment, adopted in 1982. They contain the following  regulation: "As far as cooperation between weapons companies in  different NATO countries that are not the subject of government  agreements is concerned, supplies for these countries are,  basically, not subject to any restriction -- in accordance with  the regulations on direct supplies." However, the government  reserves the right to influence exports.</p>

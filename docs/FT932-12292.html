			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / New job for head of private prison MR STEPHEN Twinn, director of Wolds Remand Prison, the UK's first privately run prison, is to become executive director of communications for Group 4 Prison and Court Services, little more than a year after the prison opened. Group 4 manages the prison and privatised prison escort services for Humberside and the east Midlands. Eight prisoners have escaped since it started its escorting service. The Prison Reform Trust described the move as an acknowledgement by Group 4 of problems at the prison. The trust recently criticised the level of incidents and disturbances at Wolds. Group 4 denied that the move had anything to do with the operation of the prison. The new director of the Wolds is Mr Walter Mac-Gowan, former governor of Lincoln Prison, who joined Group 4 last year.</p>

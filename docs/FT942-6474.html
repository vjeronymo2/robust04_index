			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank sees signs of solid full-year results Commerzbank's partial operating profits rose more than 11 per cent in the first four months of this year, indicating a successful full 12 months, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, chairman, told shareholders yesterday. Interest earnings rose 6.9 per cent, due largely to strong demand for building loans, and commission income from securities trading was up 6 per cent, helped by a particularly strong month in January. Own-account trading made a satisfactory contribution, in spite of more difficult conditions on international financial markets. On full operating profits for the early part of the year - after allowing for loan provisions - Mr Kohlhaussen said the group result was higher than last time. The need for further provisions would decrease, he said, although economic volatility still apparent in Germany and elsewhere meant there had been no easing in the credit risk situation. The bank expected no losses on its exposure of around DM200m (Dollars 121.9m) to the recently-collapsed Schneider property business. The buildings involved had been completed, Mr Kohlhaussen said. Deutsche Bank, Schneider's biggest creditor, recently said it had provided some DM500m against possible risks. Mr Kohlhaussen said pre-tax earnings had shown double-digit growth. He attributed this to the inclusion of extraordinary profits from the sale of stakes in the Karstadt retailing group and the DBV Holding insurance business. He agreed with a shareholder who suggested the DBV deal with Switzerland's Winterthur was worth up to DM500m. However, the full effect would not show this year, because the sale was to take effect in several stages. Shareholders later approved a board proposal to increase the bank's authorised capital by up to DM400m. They also authorised the issue of up to DM2bn worth of convertible bonds and other paper. Earlier this year, the bank raised DM945m through the issue of 3m new shares in a 1-for-10 rights offering. Insurance group Aachener und Munchner Versicherung reported a 7 per cent rise in premium income in the first four months of this year. Combined with falling claims, this led to a 'very satisfactory' start to the year, the annual meeting was told.</p>

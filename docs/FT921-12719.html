			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Small companies For the first time in its 35-year history, the Hoare Govett small companies index has underperformed the main market in three consecutive years. Moreover, this recession appears to have shaken the constituents like no other. Since 1955, the bottom 10 per cent of the sector by size has made a compound annual return of 35 per cent. Last year, because so many of the group's constituents became valueless, it made no return at all. Many specialist fund managers outperformed the broad index simply because they held stocks in the middle range where it was easier to buy and sell. History suggests that small companies should begin to outperform at this stage of the economic cycle, with survivors bouncing back. The picture is clouded this time by the uncertainty over dealing arrangements. According to Hoare, the marketability of small companies declined last year as fewer market makers fought over smaller deals. Although the Stock Exchange is working on proposals for trading small company shares, the omens are not good. There has always been something of a 'small firm effect', whereby investors require a reward for the risks posed by illiquidity. That may now increase accordingly. But for the professional investor, the answer always lay in diversifying the portfolio and waiting until the liquidity problem solved itself through growth in the individual stocks. Given patience, small companies should logically be a better bargain than ever.</p>

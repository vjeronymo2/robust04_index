However, in the interests of planning for developing  structure for high technology industry in the twenty-first  century, in 1976 the Toyama Technology Promotion Association was  founded for the diffusion of high technology to and support of  R&amp;D by medium and small to medium-sized companies.    The Association mainly assisted technical development and  did  research. It attracted attention from across Japan since there  weren't many such local third-sector support organizations  focusing on medium and small to medium-sized companies.    The Association was reorganized and re-named the Toyama  Technology Development Foundation in 1983 when Toyama was named  one of the first eight technopolises under the Law for  Accelerating Regional Development Based Upon High Technology  Complexes (Technopolis Law) which aimed to create new cities in  which industry, academia, and residents would coordinate their  efforts.    The Foundation uses the Toyama Technology Exchange Center  constructed in 1985 as its base of operations. This year it will  celebrate its tenth anniversary with ceremonies and  commemorative lectures to which Tsukuba University president  Reona Esaki is invited. Activities focus in three areas:  technology development, personnel development, and technology  exchange. An industrial design center has been established, so  the Foundation is also cooperating in promoting design  development activities.    Technology development includes technical research aid  activities in which grants of up to one-third of research costs  (to a maximum of &yen;10 million) are given to medium and small  to medium-sized companies for advanced technology research for  new technologies or new products. These subsidies are paid upon  successful completion. Since their inauguration in 1976, 84  grants have been made.    One recent example of success: a precision machinery  manufacturer developed an automatic punching planter for  shiitake mushrooms which has received favorable response in  sales throughout Japan.    In the area of personnel development, the Foundation  conducts  training for corporate technicians on topics such as ``Training  for High Technology Staff'' and ``High-Tech Seminar'' and also  trains managers in order to assure the nurturing and retention  of personnel who will be outstanding in dealing with high  technology. It also conducts study meetings every Monday on  product development methods. It also holds student field trips  to corporations and provides employment counseling to promote  college student hiring within the prefecture.    In the area of technology exchange, the Foundation tries to  improve corporate management resources and technology strengths  by carrying out exchanges between different industries,  industry-academia-government exchanges, and exchanges with  advanced regions.    The Manager-Researcher Exchange Forum is an annual event  held  since 1987 at Toyama University's engineering faculty in  cooperation with the University's Regional Cooperative Research  Center. Participants number more than two hundred. It has become  a model for alliances between regional cooperative research  centers and regional foundations established later.    The Toyama Technology Exchange Club which is run on a  membership basis holds monthly seminars focused on central  lecturers to promote the members' mutual studies as well as  cooperative research and market development. The Toyama  Industrial Design Center was established in 1985 to plan for the  improvement of design development capabilities among small to  medium-sized companies. The Center is mainly active in education  and training, design exchange, development support, and  dissemination of information.    The Center holds a monthly Night Forum which expands  designers' circles and which has met 60 times. Information  dissemination includes many events in which designers  participate, such as the 1992 International Craft Festival which  drew 33 participants from 16 countries. These build the appeal  of Toyama as a prefecture which supports design.    Beginning 1 December 1993, a design conference and various  other design events will be held at Design Wave to show Toyama's  appeal as a place from where design information is disseminated.    Ten years of the Technopolis plan have also passed. It's the  second stage now. Now the goal is to use the soil that has been  cultivated by the technician training and technology exchange  that has already occurred to support further exchanges between  industry and academia and between different industries and to  raise technology to the level appropriate to the Toyama  technopolis.</p>

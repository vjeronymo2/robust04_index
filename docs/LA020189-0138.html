Sales  rose 26% to $3.1 million from $2.5 million.  </P> <P> The current year's first-quarter loss included a pretax charge against  operations of $1.1 million resulting from the write-down of certain assets  associated with the company's realignment of technical, financial and  management resources. Partially offsetting the loss was a gain of $748,000  resulting from an accounting change.  </P> <P> The company manufactures microwave test and measurement instruments used in the  defense and telecommunications industries.  </P></p>

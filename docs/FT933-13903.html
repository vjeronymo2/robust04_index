			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Goldstrike mine boosts American Barrick RISING production at the Goldstrike mine in Nevada has enabled American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, to post another jump in quarterly earnings. Net second-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 57.2m or 20 cents a share from Dollars 36.8m or 13 cents a year earlier. The per-share figures reflect a two-for-one share split last March. Revenues climbed to Dollars 175.2m from Dollars 115.5m. The average gold price received in the second quarter was Dollars 410 per ounce, down from Dollars 422 a year earlier. Barrick's extensive hedging programme again ensured it received a price well above current market levels, but meant it did not benefit from the recent jump in precious metal prices. Goldstrike's output rose to 356,900 ounces from 238,300 ounces a year earlier, contributing 83 per cent of production from Barrick's four mines in the US and Canada. Average cash costs fell to Dollars 201 from Dollars 229 per ounce, with costs at Goldstrike dropping to Dollars 194 from Dollars 219. The company said it was now processing only high-grade sulphide ore at Goldstrike. However, grades have fallen since sulphide-bearing ore was first mined late last year. The average second-quarter grade was 0.26 ounces per ton, down from 0.31 in the first three months. Besides expansion at Goldstrike, Barrick's exploration and development activities are focused on Latin America. It has recently opened offices in Mexico and Chile.</p>

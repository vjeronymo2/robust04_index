Participating in the  meeting are Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, Justice  Minister Andres Gonzalez, and Attorney General Carlos Gustavo  Arrieta.    Prosecutor General de Greiff has reappeared with firm steps.  This time, speaking to Attorney General Arrieta, Justice  Minister Gonzalez, and hundreds of agents of the Attorney  General's Office, he defended the benefits of the law on  surrender and reduction of penalties in Colombia, and questioned  the double standards the United States has on the subject.  [Begin recording]    de Greiff: The United States criticizes Colombia  because supposedly we have very mild sentences against drug  traffickers, especially when they surrender to justice. They  claim that the United States has the right system, which  consists of very tough sentences. Those high sentences are  applied to some Colombians, but I do not know of any case in  which U.S. drug traffickers have been sentenced for life. [end  recording]    De Greiff also referred to the possible surrender of Cali  Cartel leaders. [Begin recording]    de Greiff: I believe that would be their best  choice because otherwise, the Prosecutor General's Office will  continue its policy of pursuing them. [end recording]    With regard to the scandalous espionage case at the  residence  of Presidential Candidate Ernesto Samper, de Greiff said that  espionage is a crime, and therefore those reports will be  investigated.    De Greiff also proposed a legislative reform to regulate  arrests in Colombia.</p>

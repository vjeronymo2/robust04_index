			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Next steps at the EBRD IF THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development did not already exist, it would perhaps now not be necessary to invent it. The bank does, however, exist, with a mandate to promote the vital objective of regenerating eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The EBRD has spent two years establishing its credentials in a troubled economic and political environment. After Friday's announcement of the departure of its president, Mr Jacques Attali, the bank must address a host of questions on its future responsibilities, management and leadership. The first task is to win back the confidence of its partners and shareholders, not least the US, which is demanding changes as a condition for paying its next year's capital allocation. Much hope, as well as money, has been invested in this institution. In the interest of Europe east and west, it needs urgently to find the right answers. Criticism of the bank's operations has centred on two areas. First, start-up costs - on both buildings and personnel - have been too high. Responsibility for excess spending on the bank's London headquarters lies not only with the EBRD, but also with shareholder governments, which should have checked more closely spending of taxpayers' cash. Caution Second, bureaucratic procedures, partly a reflection of top-heavy management, have held back disbursements of loans and equity. A recent report commissioned by Mr Attali concluded the bank had failed to make sufficient impact. At a time of great difficulty for the fledgling private-sector entrepreneurial activities which the EBRD was set up to support, the bank justifiably stresses the need for caution. Its resources, after all, stem from the public sector, and there are inevitable complexities in providing funds in co-financing deals. None the less, the EBRD needs to search more energetically for smaller venture capital-type outlets for its funds. It can also learn from the European Investment Bank, which in some ways has a better record for disbursing relatively low-cost loans in eastern Europe, as a small part of its overall credit business. To address its perceived failings, the EBRD has recently proposed a management shake-up. This is centred on the appointment of Mr Ernest Stern, the present number two at the World Bank, in a new chief executive position. The bank's board has also been debating a shift away from the EBRD's concentration on private-sector projects towards World Bank-style lending for public-sector development. Flexibility There is certainly merit in interpreting with as much flexibility as possible the bank's statutory duty to channel 60 per cent of its loans to the private sector. Greater emphasis on public-sector infrastructure finance, however, would heighten the need for better co-ordination with other public lending agencies, above all the World Bank. Mr Attali backed the proposed management restructuring, but now that the bank is seeking a new president as well as a new approach, it would be sensible to delay the changes until a successor has been appointed. The bank should use the time to take speedy outside advice on increasing its efficiency, in the same way that it has asked external accountants to examine charges of over-spending. It may also be that the bank needs fewer and less interventionist executive directors. Mr Attali's decision to quit was painful, but necessary. The question of who takes over is crucial. The EBRD needs to find a president of calibre, experience and energy, combining genuine commitment to European integration with aptitude for the practical side of running a multinational bank. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the governor of the Bank of France and former IMF managing director, possesses some of those attributes, as do Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister, and Mr Karl Otto Pohl and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the past and present heads of the Bundesbank. The EBRD's role is to aid economies ruined by decades of mismanagement. A quick recovery from its own debacle would strengthen Europe's chances of achieving this essential goal.</p>

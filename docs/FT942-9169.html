			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Dasa and Siemens in talks on co-operation Deutsche Aerospace, the Daimler-Benz aerospace subsidiary, and the Siemens electrical and electronics group confirmed yesterday that they are holding talks about co-operating in the defence technology business. The two German companies said the discussions were at an extremely early stage and that further details were unlikely to emerge before the summer. However, they said that the discussions would cover a range of structures for strategic and operational co-operation, including the possibility of setting up a joint venture in the area. The talks take place against a backdrop of declining sales and orders for the German defence industry as the government cuts expenditure. However, the government is keen to ensure that Germany maintains its manufacturing expertise in core defence sectors. The companies have been forced to cut jobs in their defence technology businesses and co-operation may lead to more efficient use of existing capacity, the two groups said yesterday.</p>

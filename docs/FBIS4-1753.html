			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 27 (XINHUA) -- Profits created by  Beijing's service industry have by now accounted for 46.4  percent of the city's total, topping all cities in the country,  according to the Statistics Bureau of the Beijing Municipal  Government.    Last year, the output value of the capital's service sector  increased by 39.5 billion yuan, with a growth rate of 12.9  percent over the previous year, stated a bureau spokesman.    Burgeoning of the sector can be largely accredited to  persistent efforts and preferential policies of the municipal  government during the past several years.    Large scale restructuring has been carried out according to  the city's overall development strategy and many industrial  enterprises incurring losses or causing pollution in downtown  areas have been moved to the suburbs to make room for commercial  activities.    The Beijing Municipal Government has stepped up utilization  of foreign investment in infrastructural fields like  transportation and telecommunications, creating better  conditions for the booming of service businesses.    Taking full advantage of its wealth of science and  technology, Beijing has put a great number of scientific  inventions and achievements into production and gained much  commercial success.    Increase rates for its finance, insurance, international  tourism, foreign trade and public utilities all topped the 11  percent mark last year.    An official in the Beijing Municipal Government said, the  output value of Beijing's service industry is expected to occupy  60 percent of the city's total by the end of the century,  further consolidating its position as China's political and  cultural center.</p>

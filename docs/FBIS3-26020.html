The company raises capital  through the issuance of shares (or stock certificates).  Stockholders assume limited liability for the company in  proportion to their share subscriptions, and the company pledges  all its assets in assuming responsibility for its debt.    A joint stock limited company's basic traits follow: Its  total capital is divided into shares of equal value, with the  stockholders assuming limited liability for the company in  proportion to their share subscriptions. The company may issue  shares to the public, and the shares can be traded or  transferred. Although the number of stockholders may not fall  short of the specified number, there is no upper limit.  Stockholders enjoy the company's rights and assume obligations  by virtue of their stock holdings. The company must release its  accounting statements, reviewed and verified by a certified  public accountant, on schedule.    A joint stock limited company is the typical form of a joint  stock company. Its first advantage is that it is conducive to  attracting capital. It may issue shares to raise capital, and  its shares are negotiable. Specifically, it may issue various  types of shares to lure investors, as well as shares of small  face values to attract some idle, small-sum capital from  society. This will expand the sources of capital for the joint  stock limited company, which can quickly raise a huge sum of  capital for use in large-scale operations. Second, when the  company goes into bankruptcy, the stockholders will not be  encumbered beyond the scope of their share subscriptions. This  is because the company implements a limited liability system.  This helps protect stockholders' interests. Third, a joint  stock limited company is the typical capital partnership, whose  ownership and management are separated. It can be managed by  specifically trained and experienced professionals. This helps  improve managerial level and efficiency. Moreover, a joint  stock limited company's large numbers of shares and stockholders  make it easy to control small amounts of capital with large  amounts of capital. Nevertheless, a joint stock limited company  also has its own shortcomings. First, a joint stock limited  company must go through an elaborate process of incorporation.  It can ill afford to maintain its confidentiality because it  must release information on its financial status on a regular  basis. Second, stockholders are highly mobile, and the company  can hardly control them. In buying shares, stockholders largely  do so for their dividends and lack a sense of responsibility to  the company.    A joint stock limited company should be incorporated  according to the "Company Law."    A limited liability company is a business corporation  jointly  funded by two or more stockholders. Each stockholder assumes  limited liability for the company in proportion to his or her  capital contributions, whereas the company pledges all its  assets in assuming responsibility for its debt.    A limited liability company's basic traits follow: The  company's assets are composed of several portions but are not  divided into shares of equal value. The company issues capital  contribution certificates, instead of shares, to stockholders.  Stockholders' capital contributions can be transferred, but any  transfer must be effected according to specific rules. The  number of stockholders may not surpass a certain level.  Stockholders enjoy various rights and undertake various  obligations by virtue of their capital contributions.    Limited liability companies came into existence relatively  late. It was only until the mid-19th century that one such  company came into being in Britain, in the form of a "private  company," and this was approximately 250 years after the world's  first joint stock limited company -- the British East India  Company -- was established in 1600. Because of its traits as  both a capital partnership or a partnership between individuals,  a limited liability company is a very suitable form for  incorporating small and medium enterprises. A limited liability  company cannot issue its shares to the public, and it is known  as a "private company" in Britain and a "closed company" in the  United States.</p>

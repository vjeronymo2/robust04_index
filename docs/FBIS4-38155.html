			<p>BFN     [Text] Partial strike by the business community continued  throughout the country for the second day today. The call for  the strike was given by the Pakistan Federation of Chambers of  Commerce and Industry to protest against certain taxation  proposals in the federal budget. Our correspondents from major  cities and towns say that as compared to yesterday, most of  small traders today carried out their business. The impact of  strike was however witnessed in major shopping centers, big  business establishments, commercial houses, and industrial  estates. Our representatives say most of small traders opened  their premises in the morning, but under pressure from chamber's  representatives they pulled down their shutters later in the  day. Like yesterday, transporters and petroleum dealers  remained averse to the strike call and carried on their normal  activities. Fruit and vegetable markets remained open and  normal rush of buyers was visible. The life was normal as  strike did not affect the common man who was least concerned by  the shutdown in the major markets and shopping centers.</p>

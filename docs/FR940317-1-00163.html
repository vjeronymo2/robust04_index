			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the above hypothetical example, the table shows the effect on rural areas of a proposed intrastate funding formula which would reduce the funds allocated to PSA&hyph;A and PSA&hyph;D, and increase the funds allocated to PSA&hyph;F. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Section 1321.17(f)(9)(i) (previously 1321.17(f)(14)(i)) is revised to clarify when a State agency may permit an area agency to use Title III service dollars to fund program development and coordination activities. Under current policy, AoA provides State and area agencies with the flexibility to explore new and alternative methods for providing supportive and nutrition services through a comprehensive and coordinated delivery system by permitting the expenditure of service dollars, under section 304(d)(1)(D), for that purpose. During the past five years, State and area agencies have raised issues about whether section 1321.17(c)(14)(i) of the current rule clearly establishes the threshold at which State agencies may allow area agencies to so use section 304(d)(1)(D) service funds is based on the total allotment of Title III dollars awarded a State, including State plan administration, or based on the total amount of Title III dollars awarded to area agencies for the provision of supportive and nutrition services under section 304(d)(1)(D) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This regulation makes clear that a State agency may not fund program development and coordinated activities as a cost of supportive services until the State agency has funded area plan administration to a level of at least 10 percent of the Title III funds in section 304(d)(1)(D), with the exception of those funds provided for in section 303(b)(3) and section 303(f), which are not distributed through the State's IFF. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Section 1321.17(f)(10) is added to require a new assurance that States provide the Commissioner with a periodic update of the plan to reflect the actual and projected additional costs of providing services in rural areas, as required by the new section 307(a)(37) of the Act; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Section 1321.17(f)(11) is added to require a new assurance that the State agency, in consultation with each area agency, will set specific objectives for the provision of Title III funded services to low-income minority older individuals, and assure that such objectives are included in the area plan; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Section 1321.17(f)(12) is added to require a new assurance that the State will support area plan objectives by undertaking specific program development, advocacy, and outreach efforts focused on the needs of low-income minority older individuals and provide the Commissioner with a written description of its activities to be included in the Commissioner's annual report to the Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Section 1321.17(g) is added to clarify and set out those requirements that States which are designated Single Planning and Service Areas must meet to receive a grant under Title III of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1321.21&blank;Submission of the State plan or plan amendments to the Commissioner for approval_this section is revised by requiring States to submit their State plans or plan amendments for approval at least 90 days prior to the effective date of the plan or plan amendment rather than the current 45 days. This change was made in order to facilitate simultaneous review and technical assistance, if needed, by the AoA Regional Office. The additional 45 days also provides the State agency with additional time to discuss any deficiencies the Regional Office may find in the State plan or the intrastate funding formula and for the State to correct them. It is AoA's intention that this additional time during the pre-approval period will assist States and AoA in assuring that State plans and intrastate funding formulas are approved in a timely manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1321.37&blank;Intrastate funding formula_this section is revised to comply with the 1992 amendments to the Act that require the Commissioner to provide guidelines to State agencies in the development of their intrastate funding formulas, and to approve each State's intrastate funding formula as a condition of approving the State plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Crash course in survival teaches caution: FT writers asks a range of businesses whether they believe a recovery may have begun Signs of a modest revival in consumer demand have begun to raise hopes of recovery. The outlook for unemployment and new credit business remains bleak but the governor of the Bank of England thinks that 'in all probability' the recession is over. Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist of Nomura Research Institute in London, says there are 'enough green shoots to make a salad' but the downturn in Germany and other Continental markets bodes ill for exports, and consumer confidence at home remains fragile. THE SUN has brought out the shoppers at Peacock's Stores, but the retailer says it would be premature to see that as the dawn of recovery. 'The first seven weeks of this year weren't too clever - we weren't achieving our targets nor year-for-year growth. But the past five or six weeks have been pretty good,' says Robert Peacock, chairman and joint managing director of the budget clothing and household textiles stores. 'We are incredibly dependent, as every retailer is, on the weather. I certainly don't detect any underlying strength in increased spending.' Mr Peacock, 51 - grandson of the company's founder, who started selling pinafores and aprons in 1882 - says that gaining an edge on his rivals, not increased demand, has been the principal reason for increased business. 'Any gains we are making is that we have sharpened our pencil, reduced our profit margin slightly and we are looking for more growth from more competitive prices.' Peacock's, a chain of 142 shops including the camping and country-wear stores Millett's, might have expected to gain as shoppers traded down in the recession. But Mr Peacock says it has not worked out that way. 'I think many retailers have become more streetwise. 'The major chains and even department stores have traded down to maintain their customer base. In common with many other retailers we've had to reduce prices to turn stock faster. There is a lot of stunting on the high street now - prices being marked up in order to be marked down.' Peacock's, a private company based on a Cardiff trading estate, has grown by opening stores. Even during the recession it has continued to do so, although not at the same rate as during the 1980s. It has plans for two more this year. The company's turnover increased from Pounds 42.78m in 1991 to Pounds 54.22m last year but profitability has been cut. Reflecting on last week's statement by the governor of the Bank of England that the recession was 'in all probability' over, Mr Peacock says: 'I am cautiously optimistic for this company by virtue of the measures we have taken. But for UK Ltd, until confidence returns and until people are not frightened they are going to lose their jobs, I'm not sure it is all over yet.' Some companies in the building sector, one of the hardest hit, are a little more upbeat. Mr Martin Smout, regional director of Wimpey Construction in Bristol, says: 'I think everybody in the industry feels we have touched bottom. There is confidence in the fact that we are at the bottom. The concern has to be that this is now going to be the norm, and I don't see these green shoots springing into daffodils in the spring. We see very, very gradual growth but nothing like a recovery to where we stood in the past. There is still a lot of overcapacity.' Last month Wimpey reported a Pounds 112.4m pre-tax loss in 1992 but Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, says the worst might be over, with house sales up a third in the first 10 weeks of 1993 compared with 1992. Mr Smout's region covers the south-west, Wales and the west Midlands and includes work other than private housing, which comes under Wimpey Homes. The recession, he says, has been 'desperate - very severe. We as a company had a large percentage of our turnover coming out of the private sector. In the late 1980s the tap was turned off. 'The biggest stimulus we need is confidence. Housing has been identified as the engine for recovery, but we need confidence to act as the fuel. The private industrial sector is dead because the confidence isn't there.' This year, he says, there has been an increase in invitations to tender  - 'albeit that bid levels are suicidal'. Most contracts are from the public sector, with his region's largest current contract being Pounds 21m for a new hospital in Exeter. Mr Smout says the recession has forced change: 'The industry was overheating, you couldn't get labour, you couldn't get materials. We have all had to pull ourselves up over the last three or four years and improve the quality of what we do.' Bluebird Toys, the Swindon-based manufacturer which includes Peter Pan Playthings, makers of Plasticine, describes itself as 'quietly confident' for 1993. But Mr David Sandilands, finance director, says: 'We are not expecting an easy time. Of course you are in a buyer's market and so you have to have the right products and a hell of a negotiating team.' Orders are up both in the UK and internationally compared with the same time last year, although Mr Sandilands says it is a cyclical business: 'It is difficult to know what is going to happen in this industry until it has happened.' Before the recession, nearly all Bluebird's sales were in the UK; now more than a third are overseas. 'The UK market has been a declining market for us. Because of the recession there is just less money around, which isn't helped by the fact that you've got these video games (which Bluebird does not make) draining an awful lot of cash from disposable income.' Bluebird has responded by making cheaper toys and it has been encouraged by this year's trade fair at Earls Court in London. 'Attendances at both of our stands were definitely up. There was a lot of interest with the obvious success of Polly Pocket and Mighty Max.' The Polly Pocket, a range of cheap plastic toys for girls, and Mighty Max, the boys' equivalent ('His fate is in your hands'), are currently the company's 'hot toys'. Last month, Bluebird reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.55m in 1992 after losses of Pounds 3.55m the previous year when there were exceptional costs due to restructuring. The recession has spurred a rethink. Factories at Peterborough and Swindon have closed and production switched to Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales, and to China. Mr Sandilands also believes adversity has had its benefits: 'If there is a good thing to come out of the recession, probably the only good thing, it is that it teaches companies how to run their business, because they have to run it properly to survive.' But even so Mr Sandilands won't be rushing to increase production: 'Retailers would love to latch on to hard evidence that the industry is coming out of the doldrums. But they are exercising a high degree of caution. They want to be in with the hot products, but they don't want to catch a cold by overstocking with products that don't sell.'</p>

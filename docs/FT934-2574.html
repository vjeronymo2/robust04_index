			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Portugal Socialists sense poll victory The Portuguese voted yesterday in nationwide municipal elections in which the opposition Socialists were expected to inflict a significant defeat over the ruling Social Democrats of Prime Minister Anbal Cavaco Silva. Mr Cavaco Silva accused opposition forces of trying to push the vote beyond local issues into a national verdict on government performance in the hope of persuading President Mario Soares, himself a Socialist, to dissolve parliament and call an early general election before the next scheduled ballot in October 1995. Mr Soares would consider calling an early election if the Social Democrats suffered successive defeats in yesterday's poll and a ballot for the European parliament in June, according to those close to the president. He would also take into account the economic and social climate. The Socialist party distanced itself from the threatening signs coming from Mr Soares. 'We will not call for a dissolution of parliament even if we win every council in the country,' guaranteed Mr Antonio Guterres, the Socialist leader. Instead, the Socialists accused the government of deliberately dramatising the issue. 'Aware that they face an overriding defeat, the Social Democrats are trying to convince the country that the municipal elections could affect the stability of the government in the hope that this will play in their favour,' said Mr Guterres. Opinion polls were unanimous in forecasting that the Socialists would extend the majority of the country's 305 municipal councils that they already held after a backlash vote against the Social Democrat government in the previous elections in 1989. Social Democrat campaign managers say the party should improve its position in the Alentejo plains of southern Portugal, a traditional Communist stronghold, and in the south coast Algarve region, until now solidly Socialist. But the Socialist and Communist alliance ruling Lisbon is expected to renew its mandate and Socialist domination of Portugal's second city Oporto is unlikely to be dented. Social Democrat officials also admit privately that the Socialists and Communists are likely to win most other large cities.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON OIL SPILL AND HIGHER GAS PRICES  </P> <P> Twenty years ago it was decided after considerable debate that there was a  compelling reason to drill for Alaskan crude oil and build a pipeline to the  south. The system has worked well for nearly two decades. The tanker disaster  will have long-range consequences.  </P> <P> However, the need for Alaskan crude remains and the companies operating the  system have to be even more vigilant in the pipeline and tanker shipments to  preclude having another similar disaster. Considering the large number of  supertankers plying the oceans today, the rarity of a spill is a wonder.  </P> <P> Let the accidents of Torrey Canyon, Santa Barbara Channel, Gulf of Mexico and  North Sea platform failures, and other spills remind us of the world we live  in. We need oil to fuel much of the world's economies. And there is no 100%  safe way of extracting it, shipping, and using it. But let's at least strive  for 100%.  </P> <P> SOL TAYLOR  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

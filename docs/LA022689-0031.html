			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACISM IN INVESTMENT  </P> <P> Regarding James Flanigan's Jan. 29 column, "Best Foreign Buyout Policy Is  Self-Interest":  </P> <P> Flanigan's comment on Japanese officials' puzzlement over the clamor that their  nation's investments arouse in this country, even though they are dwarfed by  British investments, is rather naive.  </P> <P> First of all, even Dutch investment in the United States is greater than  Japanese investment, and the Swiss are not far behind. What is different about  Japanese investment and the reason it arouses the media and Congress is simply  because it is the first nation of color that is making any kind of inroads in  the United States.  </P> <P> The fact that the British invested 2 1/2 times as much as the Japanese last  year would probably surprise nearly everybody. But it's no big deal with the  media because, after all, they are the mother country. Likewise when any other  white majority nation invests heavily here: It is ho-hum time.  </P> <P> I am sensitive to the issue of Japan-bashing because I have learned from bitter  experience that as favorable sentiment toward Japan diminishes, the rising  resentment is easily transferred to Japanese-Americans as well. The point I am  trying to make is that if one peels away all the furor and arguments about  Japanese trade and investment, one will find racism at the core. Think about  it.  </P> <P> SHIGEO YUGE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

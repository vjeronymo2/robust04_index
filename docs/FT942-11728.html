			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Ansett flies abroad from September Ansett, the Australian airline owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and TNT, the transportation group, yesterday unveiled plans to become an international carrier. It will focus on routes to Japan and Hong Kong but defer plans for Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea. The services will start in September, using Boeing 747s leased from Singapore Airlines. There will be five flights a week to Osaka, and three services a week to Hong Kong. Mr Ken Cowely, Ansett's chairman, said he expected the operation to generate positive cashflow in the second year of operation. He said that start-up losses in the first year should not exceed ADollars 50m (USDollars 36m) while revenues should total about ADollars 150m.</p>

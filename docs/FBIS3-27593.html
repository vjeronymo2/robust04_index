This was revealed today by Liu Baofu, head of the  advertising  department under the State Administration of Industry and  Commerce (SAIC).    Specialized advertising companies in China totalled 11,000  last year, earning 4.6 billion yuan, that is, a hike of 150  percent over 1992, according to Liu.    To boost the advertising sector, the four publishing media  of  TV, radio, newspapers and magazines vigorously developed their  own advertising enterprises in 1993, which gained an average  business volume rise of 64.5 percent over the 1992 figure.    The advertising enterprises affiliated with cable TV,  airlines, railways and theaters reaped a total of 1.54 billion  yuan, sharing 11.5 percent of the total advertising business  volume of the country, said Liu.    The SAIC official attributed the vigorous growth in the  advertising sector to various reasons.    According to Liu, Chinese entrepreneurs have become more  aware of the importance of advertising for their products amid  fierce market competition and are willing to spend more on the  sector.    Meanwhile, advertising companies are offering more  satisfactory services in market investigation and research,  advertising planning and media arrangement, in line with the  so-called "modern advertising concept."    More significantly, the overall quality of advertising  services has been heightened through the government's efforts in  regulating the advertising market, in which all private,  collectively-owned or state-run enterprises are encouraged to  compete for market share.    Besides, more and more foreign enterprises are vying for the  Chinese market and are investing more to advertise their  products.    To ensure a sound and healthy development of the sector, the  government has promulgated a series of rules and regulations to  tighten control over advertising for food items, cosmetics and  medicines in 1993, Liu added.</p>

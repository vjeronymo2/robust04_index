			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Jerzy Milewski, secretary of state of national </F> defense, at the Polish-Russian conference "Toward a New  Partnership" in Krakow on 23 February]    [Text] The basis of Polish domestic and external security  policy has been laid down in the "Principles of Polish Security  Policy" signed by President Lech Walesa on 2 November 1992. The  document entitled "The Security Policy and Defense Strategy of  the Republic of Poland," adopted by the National Defense  Committee on the same day, explains and expounds upon the  principles adopted by the Polish president. The "Principles"  clearly state that Poland sees no danger to it from any existing  country. We are of the opinion that economic cooperation and  joint activity in the security sphere, as well as in some  military spheres, with our neighbors and other countries in the  region helps eliminate potential dangers.    Given that NATO remains the basic factor of political  stability and peace in Europe, Poland highly appreciates the  Euroatlantic nature of this alliance and supports the presence  of American forces in Europe. Poland's strategic objective in  the 1990's is membership of NATO and of the WEU as NATO's  European arm and a major component of the European system of  collective security.    In accordance with the "Principles of Polish Security  Policy," the Polish Armed Forces are deployed more or less  uniformly all over Poland, thanks, among other things, to the  formation of the Krakow Military District, which embraces the  southern and eastern part of the country. The numerical status  and equipment of our Armed Forces are regulated in the  international commitments that Poland has signed. The army is  governed by a civilian Ministry of National Defense, which is  answerable to parliament, whereas supreme command over the Armed  Forces is exercised by the president, who is also a civilian.    As was very much expected, the NATO summit in Brussels in  January confirmed the desire to preserve NATO, and reached  essential decisions concerning an adaptation of NATO structures  and tasks to modern requirements. Until now, NATO doctrine has  been based on the assumption that a mass attack by Warsaw Pact  forces might occur one day. Today, the Warsaw Pact no longer  exists, and the danger of a world war has shrunk to a minimum.  However, the international experience of recent years reveals  to us that local wars and conflicts are occurring with  increasing frequency. Even more dangerous are paramilitary  terrorist organizations. These are the real dangers of the  1990's. NATO has expressed the will to meet the new challenges  by preventing the formation of conflicts and undertaking  energetic action to extinguish existing conflicts and combating  the aforementioned terrorist organizations.    Such a development of NATO coincides with our strategic  objective. Poland wants to see the emergence of a single  Euroatlantic security system by means of an eastward expansion  of NATO and the gradual incorporation of all European countries  therein. It is essential to establish such a system in order to  guarantee political stability on our continent. We do not view  today's NATO and the future security system based on it as a  passive alliance meant to protect us from another lost war if  Poland were ever to be attacked again.    We imagine NATO as an organization guaranteeing all over  Europe the status quo, the inviolability of borders, respect for  human rights, and the preservation of modern UN and CSCE  standards in the spheres of civic and economic freedoms, in  keeping with European culture. We want to be an equal-ranking  member of this organization, and make an appropriate political,  military, and economic contribution to its joint defense  potential. We are prepared to take part in joint political and  military actions undertaken by NATO in order to fulfill its  objectives.    We have no intention of undermining the correctness of the  Sejm remarks of Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski whereby in  the medium and long term, there is no danger to Poland's  territorial integrity and "no state, no significant political  force, and no significant politician is staking any claims  against us." But there is a fear, justified by our historical  experience, that negative phenomena will develop faster than  positive ones, and that a Euroatlantic system of security, with  Poland a participant therein, will never materialize because  someone will effectively prevent it from doing so.    No doubt the biggest visible danger is Russia's return to  the  imperial policy first pursued by the Czars and then by the  Soviet Union. The idea of so-called nearest foreign territory  that we hear from the lips of leading Russian politicians,  references to alleged "historic Russian spheres of influence"  which include Poland; the loud objections to the possibility of  Poland joining NATO, and remarks about an alleged duty to  protect all Russian-speaking peoples in the countries of the  former Soviet Union--all this we consider an expression of  imperial policy, contrary to the standards of CSCE and hostile  to Poland. Right now the greatest danger is that Russia might  interpret an absence of reaction to such rhetoric as silent  approval thereof, or even as an encouragement to proceed from  words to deeds. Therefore someone has to say loudly that these  are wrong things to say and do, so as to prevent the emergence  of some irreversible situation. For every case of expansionism  possesses its own dynamics. If it does not meet any resistance,  it simply keeps on expanding.    Therefore we believe that keeping Poland and the other  Visegrad countries, as well as the Baltic countries and Ukraine,  within the gray zone of uncertain security, in isolation and  without any political screen, encourages the development of  imperial trends in Russia. The young Russian democracy may and  should be helped by preventing the rebirth of imperial expansion  policy; a policy, I hasten to add, that also collides with the  interests of the Russians themselves and those of the other  peoples that form the Russian Federation.    Is Poland's membership of NATO a threat to Russia? Many  Russian politicians are fond of saying that it is. Here are a  few examples of the arguments used to justify such an belief.    1. In the opinion of Andranik Migranian, adviser to  President Yeltsin, NATO's expansion to the border of the former  Soviet Union is to be viewed not as a desire to guarantee the  security, sovereignty, and integrity of the borders of Poland,  Hungary, Czech Republic, or Slovakia, but as an attempt to  isolate Russia even further. One hears the thesis about  isolation or about the creation of a feeling of isolation quite  frequently from the lips of Russian politicians.    The first question raised by this argument is: Is it at all  possible to isolate a country that is as big as a continent? Is  this not merely a counterargument being employed by a power that  is actually intent on keeping the abovementioned countries  isolated from the West European security system? And the second  question: Can one employ such an ambiguous and irrational  argument as a feeling of danger? Is this not merely a  development of the principle that the only right thing is what  we ourselves want?    2. Mr. Yuriy Kashlev, Russian ambassador to Poland, says:  "The efforts of some of our neighbors to join NATO already  today and a shift of the NATO borders are grist to the mill of  all the opponents of the reforms, conservative forces, and  nationalists who are trying to block our reforms and our efforts  to combat the crisis."    Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian presidential spokesman, says:  "If the countries of Central and Eastern Europe join NATO, the  reforms will collapse and the army will be angry. I think that  in such a case, the army will exert strong pressure on the  government and president to increase military spending and alter  the present peaceful defense doctrine of Russia."    These are very odd things to come from the lips of  representatives of a country that considers itself democratic.  It is very odd for such a country to threaten other countries  with the dissatisfaction of its own army or that of some of its  political groups. We, however, insist that a chance for a real  democratization of Russia will occur only when the policy of  Russian imperial expansion becomes unrealistic. As long as the  countries of Central and Eastern Europe are isolated and  constitute a potential target of Russian expansion, it is hard  to expect Russian leaders of whatever political orientation to  give up such a policy voluntarily. To justify this thesis one  can cite the examples of postwar Japan and Germany, which became  economic powers with an unquestionably democratic system because  they were deprived of the possibility of pursuing an  expansionist imperial policy.    3. Again Yuriy Kashlev, Russian ambassador to Poland: "NATO  arose at a time when the Warsaw Pact existed, and at that time  its objective was clear. Today the Warsaw Pact no longer  exists, but the arrows on NATO war charts are still pointing in  the same direction. NATO has failed to undergo an adequate  transformation, its member countries are still looking about  them and waiting. As a military alliance, NATO has to have an  enemy and be directed against someone." But, I ask you, against  whom?    An acceptance of the principle that every military alliance  must be directed against someone creates another question:  Against whom is the CIS defense alliance directed? How are the  countries of Central and Eastern Europe, especially the Baltics  and Ukraine, to view this system? Perhaps the principle alone  is faulty, perhaps it is still enshrined in the cold war reality?    "Partnership for Peace" [PFP] is the path to NATO. Poland's  decision to accept the NATO-proposed PFP was dictated by the  conviction that it is possible to form a military alliance "for"  something, and not just "against" someone or something. Poland  has already signed an initial agreement, and is preparing  specific plans of military cooperation with NATO countries and  other PFP participants. We view PFP as our road to full NATO  membership. As I said in the beginning, this is Poland's  strategic choice. We consider PFP a good preparatory program  that makes our gradual integration with NATO very much easier.    The reservations expressed by the Polish authorities did not  concern PFP itself, but the fact that the latest NATO summit  failed to provide us with a political screen in the form of NATO  associate membership or participation in the NATO political  structures, a political screen that we need today in view of the  growing political threat from the East. We will continue to ask  for this political screen, not relinquishing for a single  instant our active participation in PFP.    To sum up, it must be emphasized that:    1. We consider NATO membership not just a chance to include  Poland in the "good" part of Europe, as Ambassador Kashev puts  it. We consider NATO membership as a brick in the building of a  Euroatlantic security system in which every country interested  in this security and willing to fulfill basic conditions should  take part.    2. We do not think Poland's membership of NATO involves any  threat to any of our neighbors. On the contrary, we believe it  would provide them with extra security.    3. I hope that Poland's unequivocal and clear stance  concerning our country's security and that of this region and of  the whole of Europe will be understood by our partners and  neighbors.

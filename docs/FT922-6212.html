			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (6): Unnatural silence - Why the stock exchange is still subdued KOREA'S reputation as the land of the morning calm may strike visitors caught up in one of Seoul's rush hour traffic jams as singularly undeserved. But it sums up the mood on the Korean stock exchange (KSE). Its performance this year has been subdued despite the infusion of funds from abroad after the limited opening of the market to foreign investors in January. The composite index has hovered around the 600 level for much of the year, compared with an all-time high of 1,008 in April 1989. Interest rates at around 16 per cent, a relatively low GDP growth rate of about 7.5 per cent and political uncertainty surrounding December's presidential election explain the poor performance, according to local brokers. Their foreign counterparts say the same factors have put off many international investors, who have also been deterred by the remaining government restrictions on their activities. These include a 10 per cent limit on foreign ownership of individual shares and a three per cent ceiling on holdings in a Korean company by any single foreign investor. Other barriers to greater foreign participation include a requirement to secure an investor identification number and a capital gains tax which has proved to be a big deterrent to investors from Germany, Japan and Hong Kong, countries which do not have double taxation treaties with South Korea. Some foreign investors have also been annoyed at having to trade under their real names, rather than through the usual nominees, though it appears that this requirement is being eased, according to Mr Peter Thorn, the chief representative in Seoul of brokers WI Carr. Another factor which has dampened the interest of those investors who missed the first wave of buying is the fact that foreign holdings in the most liquid stocks quickly reached their ceiling, forcing latecomers to pay a premium in the over-the-counter market. Ministry of Finance officials note, however, that only 18 companies out of the 688 listed have reached their foreign quotas. Ministry figures show that foreigners invested Dollars 917m as of May 6, while withdrawing only Dollars 125m. The net foreign position at the end of April represented just 0.73 per cent of the market's capitalisation, suggesting that government fears that a 'wall of Japanese money' would be used to pick off the choicest bits of Korean industry were overstated. The lacklustre performance of the composite index so far this year conceals sharp price rises in the shares of some smaller companies, a sector in which foreign buyers have been particularly active. Mr Thorn notes that the shares of some smaller companies are trading on 'multiples of only six, seven or eight and are extraordinarily cheap'. The low price/earnings ratios are largely the result of the sector having been ignored by domestic investors, who have traditionally focused instead on the absolute price of the more liquid shares of large companies. Foreign infatuation with the smaller companies has struck a welcome chord with the government, which is keen to encourage greater capital flows to small and medium-sized businesses as part of its policy to reduce the economic dominance of big conglomerates. The initial pattern and volume of investment from abroad has also done much to calm government fears over the impact of market liberalisation, and has strengthened the hand of those officials who would like to see the stock exchange opened more widely to overseas funds. Mr Philip Smiley, branch manager of Jardine Fleming Securities in Seoul, says: 'The commitment shown by most foreign investors to stay in the market' has largely dispelled government worries that 'hot money' from abroad would wreak havoc in the domestic economy. But few brokers, whether foreign or domestic, expect radical reforms to replace the government's cautious approach. 'The officials have learned much over the past three or four months', says Mr Thorn. 'The Ministry of Finance is now saying to brokers 'how can we make things better?' But there is still a reluctance to give up control.' The government is under pressure from foreign brokers to raise the 10 per cent limit on overseas ownership to 25 per cent, according to Mr Duncan Ross, manager of Baring Securities in Korea. But a senior finance ministry official countered that 'it is a little hasty to talk about expansion after only five months', and said investors 'should not expect such a decision this year'. The lack of movement on the issue is unlikely to stop the steady inflow of foreign funds, but it leaves the KSE standing out among other Asian markets, such as Hong Kong, where large international investors can move in and out of big blocks of highly liquid stocks with ease. US-based investors, in particular, have been put off by the lack of opportunities to invest Dollars 5-10m in one stock, according to Mr Smiley. The fact that Erisa-regulated US pension funds have been unable to comply with Korea's standing proxy rule, which conflicts with accepted American practice, has also been a barrier to US investment. But Ministry of Finance officials say a change in the rules this month should solve the problem. Nonetheless, US investors represented 20.2 per cent of total foreign investment at the end of April, while their British-based counterparts accounted for 42.3 per cent. New Zealand, through which some Hong Kong money is reportedly funnelled to avoid the Korean capital gains tax, represented 14.2 per cent of the total. But Japanese investors had come forth with little more than Dollars 1m, according to the ministry. The simplification or removal of the remaining regulatory restrictions will continue to be a top priority of the government, according to Mr Kim Tae-hyun, the director of the Ministry's Securities Policy Division. But he concedes that there has been 'no progress' on the avoidance of double taxation for Japanese, German and Hong Kong investors.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / BA and Virgin close to settlement BRITISH Airways and Virgin Atlantic last night appeared to be moving towards an agreement intended to end their 'dirty tricks' battle and to lift the threat of a further, protracted legal fight. After a day of talks in London which continued into the night - well beyond the 24-hour deadline for agreement set on Monday by Virgin - Mr Richard Branson, the head of Virgin, said there were signs of a breakthrough. Mr Branson said he was more optimistic that the two sides could reach agreement, although 'stumbling blocks' remained. Virgin last month won Pounds 610,000 in libel damages from BA and a public apology, following revelations that BA had been engaged in covert operations to undermine Virgin's business. BA last night made an offer in response to Mr Branson's demands for cash compensation for the commercial damage inflicted on his airline by BA. Mr Branson said: 'They have put some money on the table, finally, to pay for the people they have taken from us.' Although the sum Virgin has sought has never been disclosed it is thought to be about Pounds 25m. Virgin has also been seeking a legally binding agreement from BA that it will not repeat its activities against its smaller competitor. Mr Branson indicated last night that this issue was still causing disagreement. BA, he said, was still suggesting that it should be able to talk to Virgin passengers to persuade them to upgrade to Concorde flights. Allegations earlier this week that some BA employees in the US were encouraging Virgin passengers to switch airlines placed a further strain on relations between the companies.</p>

If 10,000 signatures are  collected, the recall will be placed on the ballot. A jury found Gary Parsons  guilty Sept. 11 of molesting three boys. Hider sentenced him to 22 years, but  ruled that Parsons could remain free in lieu of $300,000 bail, pending his  appeal. Parsons failed to post the bail but has remained free.  </P></p>

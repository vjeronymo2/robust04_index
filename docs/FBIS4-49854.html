			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cao Min and Hong Xia: "Most Units Complying With New </F> Work Hours"]    [Text] More than 90 percent of State and collective  enterprises have complied with the State Council decree to  reduce the work week from 48 to 44 hours, a labour official said  yesterday.    Enterprises that have failed to make the change will be  criticized and ordered to implement the practice within the  shortest possible period, according to Lin Xiaoning, an official  of the Ministry of Labour.    Since the law took effect on March 1, the Beijing Labour  Bureau has received over 20 complaints from workers, most of  whom blamed their employers for forcing them to work overtime in  violation of the government decree.    Employees at the Shougang General Company (formally Capital  Iron and Steel Company) complained last month to the mayor that  they still were not getting two days off every other weekend.    They said in addition to working the maximum 44 hours a  week,  they were also asked to spend another four hours on political  study and training each week.    Several days later, Shougang granted them their two days off  every other weekend.    Under the work-week law, which all companies were to comply  with by May 1, workers must be paid overtime if they put in more  than 44 hours per week. Extra hours may not exceed three hours  per day.    To ensure companies meet these requirements, Beijing will  offer more subsidies to units such as the public buses that have  a hard time providing normal services within the shortened work  week.    Trade unions have been asked to help supervise the new  system  to protect workers' rights, Lin said.    China replaced the 48-hour week, practised nationwide for  the  past 40 years, with the 44-hour week on March 1. Companies had  until May 1 to adopt the system.    Lin was unclear about how well private and foreign-funded  enterprises were complying with the law. Such companies  employed 3 percent of China's 147 million urban workers as of  the end of March this year.    But Lin said many State and collective enterprises,  including  all 14 bureaus under the Ministry of Railways, have made great  efforts to adopt the system.    In Shanghai, where 1,727 enterprises started introducing a  44-hour work week beginning in 1992, worker productivity has  risen by 10 to 30 percent, Lin said.    The new work week has also been successfully introduced in  most of Beijing's enterprises, institutions, hospitals and  schools.</p>

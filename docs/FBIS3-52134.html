In an exclusive statement to MENA, the Kuwaiti information  minister added that the countries that broke ranks, departed  from pan-Arab unanimity, and backed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait  must first reconsider their position and recognize the relevant  UN Security Council resolutions, particularly those dealing with  border demarcation and the liberation of Kuwait. He said that  this demand is not negotiable and that the countries that backed  Iraq must take the first step on this matter.    He pointed out that Kuwait regards its borders, its  existence, and its POW's as nonnegotiable, fundamental, and  fateful issues.    Shaykh Sa'ud Nasir al-Sabah regretted the current lack of  inter-Arab solidarity and hoped that the Arab countries will  succeed in surmounting this ordeal so that matters can return to  normal and those in error can rectify their stances.    It should be noted that Kuwait refers to the countries that  supported the Iraqi invasion as the adversary countries. They  include Jordan, the PLO, Yemen, Sudan, Mauritania, and Algeria.</p>

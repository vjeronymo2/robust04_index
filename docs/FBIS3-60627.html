			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, Dec. 8 [as received] (YONHAP) -- UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will visit Seoul on Dec.  22-24 and then travel to Pyongyang on an official visit, one of  his aides said Wednesday.    Negotiations on the visit were proceeding well, Alvard de  Soto, a political adviser to Butrus-Ghali, said. De Soto said  Butrus-Ghali was going to Pyongyang at the invitation of North  Korea, which is a UN member. He denied the possibility of the  UN leader playing as a mediator in talks over the North Korean  nuclear issue.    The nuclear issue is being dealt with in talks between North  Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency and between  North Korea and the United States, and should be handled by the  Security Council but not by the secretary-general, de Soto said.    He, however, suggested the possibility of Butrus-Ghali  playing a certain role in the resolution process in his personal  capacity and said the nuclear issue is on the agenda of his  meeting with North Korean leaders.    A highly-placed official on the South Korean Mission to the  United Nations said it was unlikely Butrus-Ghali would mediate  in the North Korean nuclear issue because it is being dealt with  in negotiations between the parties concerned. North Korea,  which is demanding direct talks with the United States, will not  want him to play such a role, he added.    The secretary-general will convey to North Korean leaders  the  international community's position and mood on the nuclear  issue, including resolutions by the UN Security Council and  International Atomic Energy Agency, the official said.    His visit to Pyongyang when diplomatic efforts to settle the  North Korean nuclear issue have made little progress and the  imposition of UN sanctions appears imminent opens the  possibility he will act as a go-between.    A UN source, noting that the U.S.-North Korea talks are at a  level below vice minister, said there is a possibility the U.S.  Government will use the visit to convey a message to Kim Il-song.    Butrus-Ghali said in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy  last month that Kim Il-song had rejected his request for a  visit, suggesting that he planned to visit Pyongyang some time  ago.    Butrus-Ghali will be the first UN leader to visit Pyongyang  in 14 years and the first ever to visit Seoul. Kurt Waldheim  made a brief stop in Pyongyang in 1979.</p>

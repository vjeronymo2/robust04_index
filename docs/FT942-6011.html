			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Move to cool Crimea row thrown out Ukraine's divided parliament yesterday rejected a proposal by President Leonid Kravchuk to set up a constitutional court to resolve the status of the disputed Crimean peninsula. Instead, it voted for a four-point resolution which suspended the quasi-independence constitution reintroduced by Crimea two weeks ago and called on the president to come up with a list of 'concrete measures' by June 6 to ensure Crimea's compliance with Kiev's wishes. It also set up a parliamentary commission to seek ways of harmonising Ukrainian and Crimean legislation within the next month. The rejection of Mr Kravchuk's proposals was another step in the internal power struggle between parliament and president but merely led to the search for another formula which gave the semblance of activity while holding back from actions which carry the risk of conflict between Ukrainians and ethnic Russians. The long-standing dispute between Kiev and the ethnic-Russian dominated Crimean parliament reignited earlier this month when the latter unilaterally reintroduced a constitution which barely stops short of bestowing full sovereignty on the region. The peninsula, a holiday area, was part of Russia for two centuries until transferred to Ukraine in 1954. A 10-day Ukrainian-imposed deadline to rescind the constitution passed unobserved two days ago. Mr Kravchuk's attempt to cool the temperature of a dispute which threatens to grow into violent conflict between Russians and Ukrainians earned a contemptuous response from many Ukrainian nationalist MPs in the deeply divided Ukrainian parliament. It was interpreted as a sign of weak leadership from a lame duck president hobbled by the proximity of presidential elections on June 26. The Crimean dispute is closely linked to the status of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet which is based in the peninsula. Three days of talks between the Russian and Ukrainian prime ministers last week failed to remove the impasse. Mr Kravchuk stated yesterday that while Russia had no objective need for a fleet based on Ukrainian territory it was unrealistic for it to be withdrawn immediately. Yesterday was doubly humiliating for Mr Kravchuk as rejection of his constitutional court proposal by the bitterly divided Ukrainian parliament was matched by the studied indifference of the Crimean parliament to his repeated call for Crimea to rescind its quasi-independence constitution.</p>

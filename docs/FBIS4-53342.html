In  the course of these meetings, the possibility of cooperation  with South Korea's oil companies and commercial firms in the  fields of importing natural gas and liquified petroleum gas from  Iran and their participation at the oil, gas, and petrochemical  projects in the Persian Gulf were investigated, and it was  agreed to exchange expert delegations in this connection.

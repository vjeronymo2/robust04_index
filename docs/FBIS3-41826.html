It is up to HIV-carriers and persons who have developed the  full symptoms of AIDS to decide whether to accept the proposal  for taking part in the clinical tests of Factor-R which will be  carried out in Bulgaria for the first time.    Factor-R has been developed by a medical team headed by  Prof.  Bogdan Petrunov, director of the National Centre of Infectious  and Parasitic Diseases. The team has been working jointly with  Life Choice International and the Applied Research Combine of  Pharmaceutics. The tests of the preparation began in October  last year. It is tested on a voluntary basis in the United  States, being administered to subjects from Austin, Texas. The  blood tests of the patient who was the first to start taking  Factor-R show a definite improvement, BTA was told by Life  Choice International.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Clinton pushes jobs package POLITICAL Washington moved into high gear yesterday as the Senate reconvened after the Easter recess to take up President Bill Clinton's long-stalled and now reduced economic stimulus package. Mr Clinton stepped up his lobbying campaign with an address to a trade union convention emphasising the need for short- and long-term job creation. Over the weekend he had sought to prise loose selected moderate Republicans who have so far sustained the party's united filibuster against his proposals. Senator George Mitchell and Senator Robert Dole, the Democratic and Republican leaders, also planned a private session to see if a compromise could be ironed out. In public, however, neither seemed in a mood to give in. Mr Mitchell described the Republican strategy as one of 'gridlock, filibuster, obstruction, delay, defeat and embarrass President Clinton'. But he conceded that the original Dollars 16.3bn (Pounds 10.7bn) package, cut by about Dollars 4bn by the president last Friday, had no chance of passage. Mr Dole said he could accept one part of the proposals - Dollars 4bn to extend unemployment benefits - and might make 'exceptions' for other elements, including a Dollars 300m national immunisation plan. But he insisted emergency spending was unnecessary in the current economic climate unless financed by additional spending reductions. The affair is proving a test both of Mr Clinton's political muscle and of the Republican blocking tactics. Partly distracted by other events, including the summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the continuing Bosnian crisis and concern about the aftermath of last weekend's Los Angeles trial verdict, and with Congress in recess, Mr Clinton has not focused as much on ending the Republican filibuster as he had earlier on getting his substantive budget-cutting plan through the legislature. The current impression, which Mr Clinton needs to dispel, is that his initial victories led him to underestimate opposition to the stimulus package, which includes some Democrats. Simultaneously, he is being accused of trying to do too many things at once. Last week's speculation that the administration was considering a national value added tax to help finance health care reform, seems not to have helped Mr Clinton. For his part, Mr Dole seems conscious of the need to avoid being labelled as the prime perpetrator of the dreaded political 'gridlock', but is equally mindful of the importance of giving his own party, a minority in both houses of Congress and facing a Democratic president for the first time in 12 years, a distinctive mission. He is accorded much credit for keeping the 43 Senate Republicans in line on the filibuster, only breakable if 60 members of the 100-strong Senate vote to end it. He has been encouraged by some measurable recent declines in Mr Clinton's popularity ratings. But Mr Dole, a close friend of Mr Mitchell, also has a reputation for preferring compromise to the confrontational approach typical of his party's right wing.</p>

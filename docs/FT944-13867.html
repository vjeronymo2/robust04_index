			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Spain and Germany talk tanks Spain and Germany have begun talks on equipping the Spanish army with Leopard 2 tanks, potentially worth several hundred million dollars. Defence officials in Madrid emphasised yesterday, however, that the choice of a new tank to succeed US and French models was 'not closed'. Proposals under discussion between the two defence ministries would involve assembly in Spain and use of locally made components. This would require an agreement with the Leopard's manufacturer, Krauss-Maffei. The German company, controlled by the Mannesmann group, won a deal worth almost Dollars 800m with Sweden earlier this year to supply 120 Leopard 2 tanks, with an option for 80 more.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Shawqi Armali, PLO representative to </F> Belgium, by anchorman Xavier Lambrechts -- live]    [Excerpts] [Lambrechts] Mr. Armali, do you think that the  Hebron massacre marks the end of the peace process?    [Armali] Well, I hope things will not reach that extreme,  but  we are very likely to reach it if the current situation  continues. It must be stressed that the Israeli Government has  a particular responsibility for today's events -- this Hebron  butchery. First, it is the Israeli Government that settled the  colonies everywhere in the occupied territories after 1967 in  violation of all international conventions and rights. Second,  the Qiryat Arba' colony where the most fanatic settlers live was  supported and established by the Israeli Government of that  time, i.e., 15 years ago. But the worst is that the same  government tolerated the creation of militias among the settlers  and the arming of the settlers. We have seen just how some  people can stroll with impunity among the civilian population  with their weapons. Those conditions made it possible for the  perpetrator of the Hebron slaughter to do what he did with the  unquestioned complicity of several other people. Because this  is absolutely....    [Lambrechts, interrupting] Mr. Armali, I was just about to  ask you this question: Do you think this massacre was  perpetrated by one man only?    [Armali] Absolutely not. When you look at the number of the  victims and the injured -- which might exceed 130 people -- it  is absolutely certain that only one perpetrator was involved.    [Lambrechts] Do you think the Israeli Armed Forces or  Government should have disarmed the Israeli militias and  settlers?    [Armali] Definitely. The Israeli Government must see to it  that security is enforced in the occupied territories through  its security forces and it should not encourage the creation of  militias and armed groups, the result of which can be seen  today. On the other hand, the Israeli Government has shown just  that it is unable to ensure security in the area of the holy  places, be they Christian or Muslim, not only in Hebron but also  in Jerusalem. The Hebron mosque, for example, was the  responsibility of the Israeli soldiers.    [Lambrechts] Yes, one will remember that the Hebron mosque  is  also an Israeli and Christian religious place.    [Armali] You are right. After today's sad events, the whole  international community must be concerned about the [security  of] other holy places in the Palestine.    [Lambrechts] Mr. Armali, do you -- as PLO representative to  Belgium -- think the peace negotiations with Israel are in  jeopardy. Are you ready to sit down at the same table as Mr.  Rabin?    [Armali] This is one of the most serious threats since the  signing of the 13 December peace accord and the hopes for peace  that it brought to both populations -- Palestinians and Jews.  Unfortunately, since that historic date, all the deadlines set  in the Oslo agreements have not been met. Furthermore, the  Israeli prime minister repeated over and over again that there  is no sacred date. This has increased the frustration among the  Palestinian public. And today 25 February, the Palestinians are  being repressed still by the Israeli Armed Forces. Over 11,000  Palestinians are detained still in Israeli prisons and the date  for the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho is still not  known. Things must move along quickly. I must stress this is  the last chance for the peace process to continue. As we know,  the U.S. Administration has decided -- with the approval of Mr.  'Arafat and Mr. Rabin -- to convene....    [Lambrechst, interrupting] We will raise this issue in a few  seconds. But the PLO demands -- and this is important to  mention -- international protection in the occupied territories.  The possible presence of UN troops or U.S. or British soldiers  has even been envisaged. Does it sound realistic to you?    [Armali] Yes, of course. Because these territories are  occupied, the UN Security Council, which is expected to meet at  any time now, will have to examine the issue and decide to send  U.S., European, or other international troops to protect the  Palestinian population because it is not clear whether the  Israeli Government really wants to make decisions to disarm the  settlers. We have no other option left. As long as the  settlers are armed, today's tragic events can happen again. And  it could give a fatal blow to any hope for peace. In order to  secure this peace process that was initiated with so much  difficulty, a decision must be made as quickly as possible to  ensure the protection of the Palestinian civilian population  which is still under occupation. [passage omitted]    [Lambrechts] Mr. Armali, what do you specifically expect  from  the U.S. side?    [Armali] What we always have requested from Washington: A  greater presence and a more active role in the ongoing  negotiations.    [Lambrechts] Does President Clinton's proposal go in the  right direction?    [Armali] It was accepted by the PLO and I hope that today's  tragedy will convince many people -- mainly on the Israeli side  -- that the deadlines set [in the peace negotiation process]  must be pushed forward and that the withdrawal from the occupied  territories is necessary. This is a unanimous request from the  international community, so that the Palestinians can take their  destiny in hand and continue to serenely negotiate this final  and long-lasting peace for which we all long.    [Lambrechst] Thank you for being our guest tonight Mr.  Armali.</p>

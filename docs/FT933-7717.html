			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Yen's rise reversed after Fed intervenes MONETARY authorities in the US yesterday dramatically reversed the yen's powerful rise by intervening in the foreign exchange markets and buying the dollar. The move surprised currency dealers. Four interventions by the New York Federal Reserve Bank triggered a surge in the dollar which earlier this week looked set to fall through the Y100 level. The Fed conducts open market operations for the US central bank. The interventions pushed up the value of the dollar by 4.6 per cent in four hours. In late New York trading, the dollar stood at Y105.90, up from its London close of Y104.15. In early New York trading, it was as low as Y101.20. The move was substantial, even by recent market standards. In Tokyo today, the dollar opened at Y104.80. The Fed's intervention will surprise and gratify the new Japanese government, which has said for the past week that it would like central banks from other Group of Seven industrialised countries to help stem the yen's rise. The Bank of Japan bought dollars again earlier yesterday in the Tokyo market but until now has felt friendless. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, sworn in as prime minister last week, spoke by telephone to President Bill Clinton yesterday. Issues discussed included Japan's continuing high trade surplus with the US, which analysts in Tokyo thought would militate against any effort by the west to ease the plight of Japanese exporters. The two countries are to hold bilateral trade talks next month. In the US, Mr Lawrence Sum mers, the treasury under-secretary for international affairs, said the US was 'concerned that the recent rapid rise in the value of the Japanese yen could retard growth in the Japanese and world economies'. Without the intervention, the yen would probably have continued to rise on news that the US trade deficit had widened to Dollars 12.06bn in June, the biggest monthly gap since October 1987. Some analysts suggested that the intervention, the first by the US in three months, may have been part of an as yet covert deal between the US and Japanese administrations. Some Wall Street analysts guessed that the Fed's action was linked to a cabinet meeting in Tokyo yesterday which pledged to introduce another fiscal stimulus in the Japanese economy in the autumn. Mr Joe Taylor, a currency analyst with Technical Data, a market analysis group, said: 'Possibly, the Japanese gave some sort of assurance to the Clinton administration that the structural impediments to a healthy trade relationship would be smoothed out.' Another interpretation was that, while Washington and Tokyo were still willing to let the dollar fall against the yen, they were concerned about the speed of the recent decline. An analyst at one of the largest US securities houses said: 'I think the intervention is a gesture to the markets, a signal that everyone should not go too long (on) yen, too aggressively. It's a dampening move.' The intervention led investors to sell Japanese government bonds in the belief that a weaker yen would reduce the chance that the Bank of Japan would cut the official discount rate.

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Modern art depressed: Saleroom SOTHEBY'S sale yesterday of medium-quality British and Irish modern pictures offered a good snapshot of the state of the contemporary art market. It was predictably depressing, with a total of Pounds 332,362 and 44 per cent unsold. Ms Susie Pollen, expert in charge, said the auction confirmed that demand is patchy and unpredictable. Dealers have virtually disappeared as buyers and the taste of private collectors is variable. Irish paintings did best, with The Red Table by Colin Middleton beating its estimate at Pounds 10,285 and Winter in Galway by Jack Butler Yeats selling within forecast at Pounds 9,922. A typical marine picture by Edward Seago made Pounds 10,285, the bottom of its estimate. Dull pictures and modern abstracts were particularly ignored, although the trend was bucked by Untitled 1960, by Adrian Heath, which did well at Pounds 9,317. Even in a depressed antiques market, exceptional items still sell. A Thomas Tompion ebony miniature striking bracket clock from the early 1690s sold at Christie's yesterday for Pounds 85,800, within estimate. In 1951 Christie's had auctioned it for 1,800 guineas. A similar Tompion clock reflected the caution in the market by selling for Pounds 49,400, below forecast. It had belonged to the celebrated furniture collector Geoffrey Blackwell. A walnut bracket timepiece by Joseph Knibb from the Blackwell collection was just above target at Pounds 35,200. The surprise of the session, which totalled Pounds 441,000 with 11 per cent unsold, was a silver-cased perpetual calendar astronomical carriage timepiece made in 1897 by Joseph Jump. It sold for Pounds 52,800, around twice its estimate. Christie's Swire had a disappointment at its Hong Kong sale of Chinese art when the top lot, an important wood sculpture of the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy, carved in the 12th century AD, was unsold at HKDollars 7.5m (Pounds 530,000).</p>

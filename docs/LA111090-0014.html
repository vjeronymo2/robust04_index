			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> TOP FUND-RAISERS GO TO SCHOOL IN STYLE  </P> <P> The trip to school Friday was a smooth ride for a dozen students at Loma Vista  Elementary School, who were picked up in limousines and dropped off at the  Ventura school as a reward for their PTA fund-raising efforts.  </P> <P> As the Ventura High School band played and their classmates cheered, the 12  students -- top fund-raisers in a school-wide campaign that raised more than  $12,000 -- arrived with their chaperons, Principal Diane Peterson and Supt.  </P> <P> Cesare Caldarelli of the Ventura Unified School District.  </P> <P> The annual fund-raising drive took place in October in the form of a  jog-a-thon. Students, who had received pledges from relatives and local  businesses in advance, ran up to 20 laps around a course in exchange for  varying amounts of money for each lap completed, Peterson said.  </P> <P> PTA member Jennifer Mitchell said the previous record for Loma Vista's  fund-raising efforts was $7,000.  </P> <P> The money will be used to pay for PTA-sponsored activities and school  equipment, including field trips, visual arts performances and computer  software, Mitchell said.  </P> <P> In addition to the limousine rides, dozens of other prizes were awarded,  including bumper stickers, boogie boards, an aquarium, cassette tapes, a camera  and a bicycle, Mitchell said. The fifth-grade class that raised the most money  also received a pizza party in the classroom Friday, she said. ADRIANNE GOODMAN  </P></p>

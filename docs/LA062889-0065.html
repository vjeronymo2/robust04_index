One would target potential gun owners by  requiring pre-sale certification that they have no criminal record. The other  would target gun dealers, requiring them to check with police agencies that  would be equipped to search criminal records quickly. One proposal calls for  all Americans to be issued a "smart card," an identification card that would be  encoded with electronically imprinted identification information, including  fingerprints.  </P></p>

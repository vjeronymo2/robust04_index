			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The European Market: Poor prognosis for EC drug agency - A new body streamlining drug authorisations is facing delay THE European Medicines Evaluation Agency, intended to streamline drug authorisations within the European Community, faces an uphill struggle to get under way by 1995. The main decisions on the agency's operations - including location, cost and staffing - remain to be taken. Prof Duilio Poggiolini, chairman of the EC's committee for proprietary medicinal products (CPMP), which will advise the new agency, says he hopes heads of government will agree a location when they meet in Copenhagen in June. But with several countries, including Britain, lobbying hard for the EMEA, this may prove optimistic. The EMEA is a crucial plank of the EC's single market programme for the free circulation of goods within the 12 member states. Once the new system is operational by the end of the decade, the same drugs, conforming to standards of safety, effectiveness and quality, should be available throughout the Community. There will be Community-wide monitoring of adverse reactions. Pharmaceuticals companies will submit new drugs for approval either directly to the EMEA through a centralised procedure, or through a decentralised route based on mutual recognition of authorisations by national authorities, with binding EMEA arbitration in case of argument. Biotech drugs will have to go through a centralised assessment by the CPMP, which will be optional for other high-tech drugs. For the foreseeable future, however, most drug approvals will go through the decentralised system - which means companies can still choose which country they go to for initial authorisation. 'What industry wants is a speedy decision at reasonable cost,' says Mr Ben Hayes of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. 'In the end, companies will take a commercial decision on which route to take.' Both procedures are supposed to be quick - crucial when limited patent life can leave only a few years for companies to recoup costly investments - and should obviate the need for separate sets of clinical trials and repetitive paperwork now demanded by national medicines agencies. Under the centralised system the CPMP, which consists of pharmaceutical regulators and experts from the 12 member states, will appoint one or maybe two national agencies to act as rapporteurs, or assessors, for a drug application. The verdict, which must be delivered in 210 days, will normally be made binding across the Community within another 90 days. Under the decentralised procedure an even tighter timetable is envisaged for marketing approvals granted by one member state to be recognised by others, although arbitration could stretch this to 10 months or so. Company preferences will be influenced by how smoothly the two procedures work. Prof Poggiolini points out that the risk of national objections is lower when people get together to discuss scientific evidence - a plus for the centralised procedure. However, pharmaceutical companies which have already established good lines of communication with national agencies may be reluctant to switch to the new, and therefore uncertain, EMEA system. There are also worries the CPMP may choose rapporteurs on a rotational basis rather than for their expertise in evaluating particular types of product. As for cost, a recent report for the European Commission by consultants Touche Ross and Besselaar suggests the EMEA may be more expensive to run than originally envisaged, even though it is intended to co-ordinate rather than replace the functions of national medicines agencies. They estimate that by 1999 the EMEA will need a staff of about 250 and an annual budget of some Dollars 60m (Pounds 42.2m). Prof Poggiolini describes these figures as 'a basis for discussion'. No decision has yet been taken on how this might be split between fees charged to companies and direct funding by the EC. The 12 Community countries employ 2,000-2,500 full-time staff, plus about 1,000 expert consultants, on drug evaluation. According to Touche Ross and Besselaar this costs about Dollars 300m a year. The consultants calculate that, by the end of the century, perhaps 40 per cent of the 8,000-10,000 applications handled by national agencies each year will no longer be necessary. Prof Poggiolini argues that the new system should spur innovation and become a platform for worldwide efforts to harmonise drug standards. The CPMP is already involved in discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration and its Japanese counterpart on standardising requirements for drug effectiveness, quality and safety, in the International Conference on Harmonisation. However, Prof Poggiolini says harmonisation on a global basis will not be a reality before 'the early years of the next century'.</p>

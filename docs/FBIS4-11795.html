			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pe'erli Shahar] </F>   [Excerpts] Political sources in Jerusalem have revealed  that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will begin withdrawing from  the Gaza Strip in the second half of April even if by then there  is no signed agreement with the Palestinians, provided that  there is momentum of progress in the negotiations. Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres said yesterday that Israel is considering  the option of starting the transfer of self-authority powers  over to the Palestinians in Gaza even before ending the  negotiations and signing the agreement.    Senior political sources have recently hinted that this  option is being seriously considered particularly in view of the  unrest in the territories expected to take place in the coming  days of "twilight" when Israel will still be in charge of the  territories while the locals expect to assume self-government  authorities.    It is obvious that the move will not be made on 13 April,  which marks Memorial Day for the IDF fallen. The last week of  April is currently being mentioned. [passage omitted]    Palestinian policemen will enter Gaza as soon as the middle  of next week, in coordination with the IDF forces there. This  is one of the issues Israeli and PLO representatives agreed on  in Cairo. Initially, the delegations convened to discuss  security arrangements in Hebron in view of the Cave of the  Patriarchs massacre, but the killing of the six senior PLO  members in Gaza made it necessary to discuss a change in  security concepts in the Gaza Strip as well.    For that reason, Major General Yom-Tov Sami', former  commander of the IDF in the Gaza Strip, arrived in Cairo  yesterday. He was party to the decision to formulate new joint  working procedures in the strip. It has been decided that the  PLO delegation will arrive in Gaza next week for a first-hand  examination of the deployment of the forces. Obviously, the  Palestinian police will be subject to IDF instructions.  [passage omitted]    It is worth mentioning that the members of the delegation  for  the discussion on the Gaza and Jericho agreement have arrived in  Cairo. This team does not include the delegates who discuss  economic issues.</p>

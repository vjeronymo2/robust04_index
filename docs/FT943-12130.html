			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan Gatt move puts Beijing on spot Taiwan yesterday said it was prepared to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with the status of a developed country in a move that will increase pressure on China to bow to tough entry terms for Gatt membership. The announcement, to the Gatt working party negotiating Taipei's membership, comes three days before a meeting of the working party for China to discuss the basic elements of China's accession protocol. Beijing, which has been negotiating Gatt membership since 1987, has angrily rejected Washington's insistence that as a leading exporter it should take on the obligations of a developed country. The Chinese government is anxious to rejoin Gatt, which it left in 1950 after the communist takeover in China, by the end of the year to qualify as a founder member of the World Trade Organisation, Gatt's successor. However, officials have said Beijing will not push for membership 'at any cost'. China is seeking developing country status, entitling it to a lengthy transition period to phase in market-opening commitments. Beijing says it is preparing a 'final' trade liberalisation offer to put to Gatt members. Intensive negotiations are expected in September - the deadline for agreement on entry terms if China is to join before 1995. Following pressure from Beijing, there is an understanding between Gatt members that Taiwan will not be allowed to join the world trade body before China does. Known in Gatt as Chinese Taipei, Taiwan began accession talks in 1992. These have made steady if not spectacular progress, while the Chinese talks have been repeatedly delayed by rows with the US over trade and human rights issues. Trading partners reacted coolly yesterday to Taiwan's plea for exceptions to the developed country rule, but agreed there had been significant recent improvements in its offers to reduce barriers to foreign goods and services. Taiwan said yesterday it would scrap all geographical import restrictions and was ready to join Gatt's government procurement code. However, Taipei is asking for special treatment for fish, rice and port taxes. Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

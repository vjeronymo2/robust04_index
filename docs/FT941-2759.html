			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (21): Unions fail to learn their lessons - Education In the 1970s, all Polish schoolchildren were required to memorise a poem, in Russian, about the portrait of Lenin which hung from their classroom walls: 'When the sun rises and looks into our classroom, it lights up brightly a painting on the wall; like a word of greeting for a good day, Vladimir Ilyich, as if alive, is looking at me.' These days, Polish children no longer learn such rhymes. The textbooks are different, the lectures in atheism have been replaced by catechism, references to Marx and Engels have been eliminated from lessons. But while Lenin may have disappeared from the classroom walls, the structure of the Polish educational system itself remains essentially unchanged. Politics determined the shape of the system in the past, and politics continue to shape the reform of the system even now. The Polish parliament contains fewer than a dozen lawyers but more than five dozen teachers, most of whom are members of the ZNP, the former communist Polish Teachers' Union. Together with workers from the health services, whose salaries also come out of the central budget, teachers form the largest pressure group in parliament. On the ground, teachers also represent a large source of votes for the former communists and communist allies who now lead Poland's ruling coalition. For four years, however, the teachers' unions have also been in the forefront of resistance to change, economic and otherwise. Not that anyone outside the teaching profession doubts the need for educational reforms. A World Bank report on Polish education, published in June 1993, found irrelevant vocational programmes, serious shortages of foreign language teachers and a lack of technical and computer literacy. It concluded that 'failure to increase (secondary education's) relevance and to improve its cost-effectiveness . . . will constrain the capacity of enterprises and individuals to adjust to their new economic environment.' Expenditure on education is declining in Poland, from 4.6 per cent of GDP in 1990, to 3.1 per cent in 1992, well below the average of about 5 per cent of GDP spent in most west European countries. Yet reduction of financing has not been accompanied by better management. Polish schools have run up high debts, and although theoretically free, often require parental funding to stay afloat. This is true not only of the 600 or so new private and non-profit schools which have appeared since 1989, but of most ordinary primary and secondary schools as well. Teachers themselves are a particular problem. About 10 per cent of Polish teachers do not have a university education, while others teach subjects (most notably the Russian language) which are no longer required. The ministry of education estimates that at least half are under-qualified and in some subjects - chemistry, for example - the figure is closer to 75 per cent. Yet university classes are notoriously overcrowded, and academic pay is so low that Andrzej Siemaszko, a professor of sociology at Warsaw University, believes that within a few years, universities may find it impossible to employ anyone. Mr Siemaszko, who supplements his own salary by playing the new stock market in Warsaw, said that 'no professors here can afford to work for the university alone'. Polish primary and secondary school teachers work unusually short hours (on average, 18 hours a week) but are paid to match: last year, the average secondary school teacher earned a monthly salary of 3.7m zlotys (Dollars 170). To solve this problem, the former government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka published a reform programme in 1993 which called for teachers to obtain higher qualifications, to work 40 hours a week, and to receive higher pay as well. That proposal was heavily criticised by the ZNP, which believed, probably rightly, that such a change would make many teachers redundant. Asked recently whether the union would agree to longer hours and higher standards, Jan Zaciura, the chairman of the ZNP, replied that the union would not, because 'that would be a revolution. Besides, law cannot work retroactively.' By that, he meant that those teachers who are now irrelevant or under-qualified should not be threatened with the loss of their jobs. The union has also opposed attempts to decentralise education - to hand responsibility for financing over to local government, for example  - on the grounds that such a change would weaken the strength of the union. About a quarter of schools are financed by gminy (local governments); during a nationwide teachers' strike last May, only teachers from centrally-funded schools stayed away, while teachers in locally-funded schools refused to join. While it has not, so far, bowed to the demands of its electorate in other spheres, the government appears prepared to do so in the field of education. Aleksander Luczak, the new minister of education, has not openly reversed the Suchocka government programme, but sources in the ministry say that he does not intend to fight the ZNP. Already, about 10 per cent of the ministry employees hired by past Solidarity governments have been made redundant, including at least one of the authors of the Suchocka government programme.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Signal workers reach crucial turning point: Today's stoppage will decide if the dispute is to turn into a war of attrition The success or failure of today's strike by railway signal workers could decide whether their industrial conflict is going to turn into a war of attrition. For if British Rail is able to run 20 per cent of its normal services, as it has promised, the RMT transport union will find itself on the defensive for the first time since the weekly one-day stoppages began. Its executive committee is expected to step up the action tomorrow to two days a week from July 24. But this move could rebound on the union if Railtrack's contingency plans prove to be successful today. For the past few weeks the RMT has displayed considerable tactical skill in wrongfooting an often disorganised and feeble Railtrack management. As a result, the union has won widespread public sympathy, even from long-suffering commuters in the south-east, who have blamed the disruption on the government rather than the RMT or Railtrack. But RMT general secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp and his executive are in real danger now of losing the battle for public opinion. Solidarity and morale among the signal workers are said to remain high, fueled by a genuine sense of grievance about eroded pay differentials. But RMT leaders are growing more sensitive to suggestions that resolve might start to crumble as more trains are seen to be running on strike days. Railtrack management believes some signal workers may decide to return now that they stand to lose an average of Pounds 120 for each two-day stoppage. It also thinks many will come to see that the current offer is more attractive than they first realised. After the failure of 13 hours of negotiations at the conciliatory service Acas early yesterday morning, Mr Knapp said the 'real difference between the two sides is not great' and that the dispute was 'only complex and intractable because the government has made it so'. He believes only last-minute intervention by the Department of Transport prevented Railtrack reaching a deal with the signal workers around June 9 which would have given them a 5.7 per cent interim pay increase and led on to a more wide-ranging productivity settlement. Yesterday the RMT insisted that Railtrack was 'not being allowed to negotiate with any flexibility at all' and offering the signal workers less than it was doing five weeks ago. The union negotiators repeated their call for an 'up-front' pay rise for past productivity improvements before talks could start on restructuring. The only apparent shift in Railtrack's three-stage productivity offer was to improve its one-off payment for the introduction of cashless pay for everybody by Pounds 50 to Pounds 250. But Railtrack insists that its Pounds 4.38m package is still negotiable and its value could go up if only the RMT negotiates seriously. Railtrack says that in the latest talks union negotiators hardened their position at around 2am after earlier appearing more conciliatory. Blaming the government may no longer prove a sensible tactic for the RMT. With a continuing internal financial crisis and dwindling membership because of the ending of the check-off system under which union subscriptions are deducted from pay packets, the union is in no condition to sustain a protracted fight. The conflict has reached a crucial turning point. If one in five of all trains run today, it will be a warning to the RMT that it might be better to settle now than to turn up the heat after July 24.</p>

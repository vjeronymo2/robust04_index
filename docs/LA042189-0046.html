			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART SECURES AT LEAST A SHARE OF FIRST LEAGUE TRACK CROWN  </P> <P> There might have been better boys' track teams at Hart High in the past 44  years, but this year's team will go down as the first to win at least a share  of a varsity league title.  </P> <P> Hart, which has failed to win a boys' varsity track title in any league since  the school opened in 1945, defeated Burroughs, 69-58, in a Foothill League meet  Thursday to guarantee this year's team a place in the history books.  </P> <P> Hart (5-1, 4-0 in league meets) can clinch the title outright with a victory  against Alhambra in the regular-season finale next Thursday.  </P> <P> Hart's victory overshadowed a fine triple by Burroughs' Steve Hubbell.  </P> <P> Hubbell won the 100 yards in a wind-aided 10.2 seconds, the 220 in 22.6 and the  long jump at 20 feet. He also anchored Burroughs' 440 relay team to a  come-from-behind victory in 45.4.  </P> <P> Teammate John Yim added victories in the 120-yard high hurdles (wind-aided  15.3) and the 330-yard intermediate hurdles (43.2), but superior depth helped  Hart turn back the three-time defending league champions.  </P> <P> Although Burroughs (4-2, 2-2) won eight of 15 events, Hart placed second in 10  of the 13 events that awarded three points for second. First place in the  relays (440 and mile) is worth five points; second gets none.  </P> <P> Hart, which has won six consecutive league titles in cross-country, also made  good use of its superior distance strength, sweeping the 880 and mile. Hart  also finished one-two in the two mile to outscore Burroughs, 26-1, in those  events.  </P> <P> "We knew we'd score big in the distance races," first-year Hart Coach Dan  Houghton said. "But we got some unexpected performances from other athletes  that really turned it around for us."  </P> <P> Jerry Miller was an example of that.  </P> <P> Miller placed second in the 100 (10.5) and 220 (23.4) to temper Burroughs'  expected sprint dominance. He also finished second in the long jump at 19-4 as  Hart clinched the victory in the next-to-last event of the meet.  </P> <P> Howard Blackwell and Jerry Smith added victories in the triple jump (42-1 1/2)  and the shotput (49-0 1/2) for Hart.  </P> <P> In the girls' meet, Tracy McCauley won three events to lead Burroughs (3-4,  3-1) to a 68-50 win.  </P> <P> McCauley used a strong finishing kick to win the 880 in 2:36.3, the mile in  5:54.5 and the two mile in 12:54.7.  </P> <P> Shelley Alesso won the high jump with a season best of 5-3 for Hart (2-5, 1-3).  </P></p>

[passage omitted]    The privatization in agriculture has helped remarkedly  increase the country's food output without depending on  government's investment. In 1988, Vietnam's food output was  only 19.5 million tonnes, and it had to import more than 450,000  tonnes of rice.    By 1993, its food output had reached nearly 5 million  tonnes,  enough not only for domestic consumption and reserve, but also  for export. [passage omitted]    By August 1993, there had been nearly 9,400 non-state  businesses in sectors other than agriculture. They included  limited liability companies, joint stock companies, private  enterprises, co-operatives and production groups with a combined  capital of 3,144 billion VN dong (roughly USD 300 million).    The non-state investment capital in 1993 made up 26 per cent  of the country's total investment capital of 30,800 billion VN  dong (roughly USD three billion). However, investment by  private businesses accounted for only 40 per cent of the  population's savings.    Thanks to the development of the private economic sector,  400,000 jobs have been created each year. That means to  generate one job, investment capital of six million VN dong  (approximately USD 600) was needed, compared with the direct  foreign investment capital of USD 110,000.    In 1991, the private economic sector remitted to the state  budget through taxes VND 870 billion (nearly USD 87 million),  accounting for 15 per cent of the total taxes collected in the  whole country. The private sector's taxes increased to 1,746  billion VN dong in 1992, and 2,600 billion VN dong in 1993.</p>

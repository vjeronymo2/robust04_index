			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: HK hotels group lifts earnings 27% HONGKONG and Shanghai Hotels, the Kadoorie family's hotels and property company, yesterday unveiled a 27 per cent rise in earnings to HKDollars 159m (USDollars 20.56m) from HKDollars 125m for the six months to June 30. The rise in interim profit was struck on a 9 per cent growth in turnover to HKDollars 989m from HKDollars 906m. Earnings per share were up 15 per cent to 15 cents from 13 cents. Directors declared a dividend of 6 cents a share, the same as last time. Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels is the owner of the Peninsula and the Kowloon Hotels in Hong Kong. It has residential and office property interests in the colony and it also owns the Peak Tram. Outside Hong Kong it owns the Peninsula in New York and is a part owner of the Peninsula in Manila, the Peninsula Beverly Hills, and the Palace Hotel in Beijing. Mr Hanmer Webb-Peploe, managing director, said that during the first half tourist arrivals in Hong Kong were up 19 per cent on the Gulf war-induced depressed levels of a year ago. Occupancy of its two Hong Kong hotels was up from 72 per cent to 78 per cent while levels in the company's other hotels around the world also showed an improvement, he said. Mr Webb-Peploe said the upward trend in occupancy and rents was expected to continue for the rest of this year. Hongkong and Shanghai's US hotels were finally getting the 'recognition they deserve,' the current wave of reform in China boded well for its Beijing interest and, in the Philippines, with the election out of the way, there was greater optimism, he said.</p>

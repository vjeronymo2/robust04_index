			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Poll on Fujimori, La Cantuta, Phone  Company Sale    A March poll shows that in a two-way presidential contest,  President Alberto Fujimori would trail slightly behind former UN  Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, but in a  multicandidate election, Fujimori would lead, as he also would  do in a two-way race with Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont. In the  same poll, 40.9 percent of the respondents thought that  Fujimori's chances of being reelected had gone down "in recent  months."    The IMASEN poll shows that Perez de Cuellar has moved  slightly up since January, with 45.2 percent in a two-way  contest (from 43.1 percent in January) to Fujimori's 43.4  percent (essentially the same as in January). If the contest  were between Fujimori and Belmont only and were held "tomorrow,"  Fujimori would lead Belmont with 49.6 percent of the vote to  Belmont's 31.3 percent, while 19.1 percent did not respond to  this question. If the candidates were Fujimori, Perez de  Cuellar, Belmont, and "others," Fujimori would lead Perez de  Cuellar by 3.2 percent (down from a lead of 4.7 percent in  January), with Belmont and "others trailing far behind. The  respondents were fairly evenly divided over whether Fujimori's  reelection chances had improved or diminished in recent months,  with 38.5 percent saying his chances had improved, 40.9 percent  saying diminished, and 19.9 percent believing Fujimori's chances  remained the same. There were 403 respondents interviewed.    The March poll also showed that 69.7 percent approved of the  highly profitable privatization sale of the Peruvian Telephone  Company, with 24.3 percent disapproving.    In a poll on the La Cantuta affair, 354 interviews were  conducted. Asked whether all involved in the affair had been  prosecuted, 84.7 said not all had been, and only 8.8 percent  thought they had. Some 66.1 percent thought the speed with which  the military trial was conducted was cause for distrust, while  only 27.7 thought it was not. Asked whether the sentences had  been just or light, 54.5 percent said they had been light and  34.5 percent believed they were just.    The data indicate that gender, age, and socioeconomic status  were not significant factors in determining responses. The polls  were conducted 1-4 March and covered all age and socioeconomic  groups. Margin of error was not given.</p>

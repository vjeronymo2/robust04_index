The IAEA, in a statement available here, said it had  suspended the investigation because some "important measures  which had been agreed were refused at the radiochemical  laboratory in Yongbyon."    "As a result of this rejection, the IAEA Secretariat had to  brief the board that the agency was not in a position to verify  that there had been no diversion of nuclear material at the  facility where the relevant measures were rejected," the  statement said.    The IAEA team of inspectors made an inspection visit to the  DPRK from March 1 to 15, based upon an understanding as to the  aim and scope of the inspection reached in Vienna on February 15.    In an informal briefing in Vienna earlier today the team  informed the board of governors the detailed results must await  performance of follow-up analytical and evaluation work in  Vienna.    However, the board members were informed that although many  of the agreed inspection measures were carried out as envisaged,  "other important measures" which had been agreed were refused.    According to the statement, a meeting of the board of  governors on this subject will be held on Monday [21 March].</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 6 (YONHAP) -- The betting is on as to  whether the government will lift financial sanctions on the  Hyundai Business Group as four banks and financial institutes  have offered to lend 110 billion won to Hyundai Petrochemical Co.    If it is approved, the joint loan from Boram, Korea  Long-term  Credit, Kwangju Bank, and KKBC International will be the largest  form of financial assistance to a Hyundai affiliate since the  inauguration of the Kim Yong-sam government.    Financial sources say that except for the main trading banks  -- Korea Exchange and Korea Development -- Hyundai had  experienced no trouble in trading with commercial banks.    Nevertheless, Hyundai is reportedly attaching great meaning  to the 110-billion-won loan, considering it a cue on whether the  government still has hard feelings against the business giant,  which allegedly helped fund the presidential campaign for its  founder Chong Chu-yong in the 1992 election.    If the loan goes through, the group is poised to initiate  various investments it has so far shelved or scaled down.    Hyundai had initially planned to spend 4.5 trillion won this  year, 3.3 trillion won on facilities and 1.2 trillion won on  research and development.    It had hoped to receive assistance worth 1.54 trillion won  from the Korea Development Bank for spending on seven affiliates  including Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Precision and Industry.    But when its application for facility funding at the state-  financed bank was not even registered, Hyundai had to put off  some projects or scale down investment.    Hyundai officials say they anticipate smooth funding by  banks  now that Chong has announced his plans to retire from active  business management.    The group had planned to invest 1.1 trillion won in its  biggest company, Hyundai Motor, to expand production lines. But  construction of the factory with an output capacity of 100,000  trucks and buses has been put on hold because of slow financial  assistance.    Hyundai Electronics hopes to finish constructing assembly  lines for 16 megabyte dynamic random access memory chips by the  latter part of the year after a long delay.    Company officials say they could have fully enjoyed the  semiconductor boom like other firms in the industry had the  plant been built on schedule.    The group is apparently getting restless just thinking about  how rival companies are forging ahead due to its delayed  investments.    "Frankly, we would like to register the shares of our  affiliates on the over-the-counter market and apply for a loan  at the Korea Development Bank right now," one official says.    But Hyundai is refraining from any hasty action lest it  irritate the government.    "For the time being, we will just wait and see," he says.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Power company cuts 250 jobs Eastern Electricity, the biggest of the regional power companies in England and Wales, is to shed 250 white collar jobs through voluntary severance and early retirement under a reorganisation plan aimed at cutting costs. The company, which employs about 5,700 workers, said the reductions, on top of 2,000 job losses since privatisation three years ago, were in response to the electricity industry regulator's review of its supply business.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Since early this afternoon, the State Chamber  has been discussing the Slovene public debt and Slovenia's  strategy in the negotiations with a consortium of commercial  banks at an extraordinary session convened at the request of a  group of 25 deputies. After the initial appearance by Marjan  Podobnik, who spoke in the name of the proposers of the session,  and the representatives of the monetary and financial  authorities, who called for the continuation of negotiations  with the foreign debtors, the parliamentary debate followed.  During the debate, the finance minister, the governor of the  National Bank of Slovenia, and other representatives of the  legal organs took the floor on several occasions.    The session was interrupted half an hour ago and it will  continue behind closed doors. In the closed part of the session  the deputies are to discuss the negotiating positions in the  talks with the consortium of commercial banks, which have not  ended yet. The last one to speak before the interruption was  Finance Minister Gaspari, who explained that the purchase of  debts prior to their falling due would be nonsensical, as we  would not receive confirmation that we had actually purchased  them. Here is a report by Vesna Burnik:    [Begin recording] [Burnik] [passage omitted] The debate  proceeded in the well-known direction -- retorts and mutual  accusations followed each other that the opposition was  politicizing the public debt for its own purposes and  vice-versa, that the ruling parties were pretending to be smart  and the exclusive experts on the public debt.    The stumbling block was evidently the question as to when  and  how Slovenia actually agreed to the payment of at least a  portion of the former SFRY debt and what the basis for it is.  Governor Franc Arhar replied:    [Arhar] For the time being the declarative document, if I  may say so, is the Constitutional Law that was passed in June.  The law provides for the willingness and undertaking. At that  time, everybody, the government and the parliament, whenever the  issue surfaced and, of course, also last January, if you recall,  when the parliament was passing the law about the membership in  the International Monetary Fund [IMF] [sentence as heard]. When  the IMF initiated the procedure regarding Slovenia, in  establishing its share, it, of course, departed from the  stipulation, from that very clear article of the Constitutional  Law.    [Burnik] In the debate Marjan Poljsak demanded to know why  Slovenia was not purchasing its portion of the debt if it really  was so cheap at this moment. Minister Gaspari replied that the  debts would not disappear with their purchase, because since the  disintegration of Yugoslavia the creditors have not recognized  the transactions, and the National Bank of Yugoslavia, of  course, would not sign them off. The Ljubljana Bank used to do  that, too, until the disintegration of the country. A more  detailed debate on the topic will continue in the closed part of  the session. [end recording]</p>

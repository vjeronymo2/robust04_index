			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 18 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin said, opening the next round of Russo-Finnish talks  attended by other officials, that at a meeting of Russian and  Finnish presidents, which just ended in the Kremlin, a broad  range of problems was discussed.    According to the Russian president, the head of the two  countries discussed political, socio-economic issues and  international problems. "It is very good that there is no pause  in our relations: the recently elected new Finnish president  paid one of his first visits to Russia," Yeltsin said.    Apart from the Russian president, the official talks are  being attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev,  Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin and other officials.    "There are no political problems between the two countries,"  said Russian President Boris Yeltsin, answering journalists'  questions about the results of Russo-Finnish summit talks.  Yeltsin said that during one-on-one talks with the Finnish  President Martti Ahtisaari as well as during talks between the  Russian and Finnish delegations about 20 different problems were  discussed. Yeltsin pointed out that on all international  problems, including the Yugoslav crisis, the position of the two  sides coincide.    In particular, the Russian president mentioned the  construction of a big gas pipe line Yamburg-Germany in the north  with an extension to Finland. According to the Russian  president, an agreement was reached on the settlement of the  problem of Russia's inconsiderable foreign debt. There is no  agreement between Russia and Finland yet on double taxation and  protection of investments, the Russian president said, adding  that the sides agreed to prepare such agreements.    Yeltsin pointed out that one of the main problems discussed  was Russia's decision to give special guarantees to foreign  companies which will make investments into Russia at the level  of the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry, guaranteeing them  against political risks.    "This was one of the most important questions raised by  foreign companies which was lifted today," Yeltsin said.    For his part, the Finnish president said that the fact that  he arrived in Russia almost immediately after he was elected  president shows that relations of cooperation between the two  countries are at a good level. Bilateral economic cooperation  has been successfully developing for a number of years,  Ahtisaari said. The Finnish president shared Yeltsin's opinion  that there are no political problems between the two countries.  He expressed the hope that in future, when Finland joins the  economic union, its cooperation with Russia will successfully  develop as well.</p>

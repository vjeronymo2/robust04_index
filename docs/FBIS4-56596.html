			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua BARRTCADA in Spanish of 20 April  1994 on pages 1 and 5 reports that Sandinist Youth (JS) members  charge that the Sandinist National Liberation Front (FSLN) is  "divorced" from its youth members. In addition to the accusation  that the FSLN "is turning into a party for the old," JS members  say the party suffers from a lack of unity and democracy and  "has lost credibility...due to the behavior of its leaders."  Former JS leader Roberto Stuart points out that the party is no  longer influential with young people because FSLN leaders "do  not listen" to the ideas of others. Javier Cardoze, JS secretary  in Rivas, warns that the FSLN will be hard pressed "to attract  the youth vote in 1996." Youth leaders call for wider  participation by JS members in decisionmaking activities and a  higher standard of ethics.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraphs (h)(2) (v), (vi) and (vii) require undercutting and backcutting of each tree being felled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (h)(2)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each tree being felled be undercut unless the employer demonstrates that felling the particular tree without an undercut will not create a hazard for an employee. This paragraph also requires that the undercut be of a size so the tree will not split and will fall in the intended direction. The proposed rule contained a provision requiring undercutting of each tree being felled, however, the proposed provision did not provide for any exceptions. OSHA received many comments on this provision, which have been discussed above in the Major Issues section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraphs (h)(2) (vi) and (vii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each tree be backcut. OSHA is also requiring that the backcut allow for sufficient hinge wood to guide the tree and prevent it from prematurely slipping or twisting off the trunk. OSHA is requiring that the backcut be above the horizontal cut of the undercut. In the final rule, OSHA is allowing one exception to the backcut requirements. In tree pulling operations, the backcut may be at or below the horizontal cut of the undercut. The proposed rule also contained provision requiring backcutting of each tree being felled. The proposed rule did not allow any exceptions to the backcut requirement. OSHA received many comments on these provisions, which have been discussed above in the Major Issues section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Bucking and Limbing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h)(3) of the final rule establishes various necessary work practices for bucking and limbing activities. According to the WIR survey, 12 percent of the reported logging injuries occurred when the employee was bucking or limbing (Ex. 2&hyph;1). The OSHA FCI report showed that 16 employees were killed during bucking and limbing operations (Ex. 4&hyph;61). The work practice requirements contained in this paragraph address the hazards presented by log movement on slopes, by wind-thrown timber and by trees that are yarded for bucking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h)(3)(i) of the final rule requires that bucking and limbing that are done on any slope where rolling or sliding of trees or logs is reasonably foreseeable must be done on the uphill side of the tree, unless the employer demonstrates that it is not feasible for bucking or limbing to be done on the uphill side. This paragraph also requires that whenever bucking or limbing is done on the downhill side, the tree must be secured against movement to prevent rolling or sliding. The proposed rule also contained a provision requiring bucking and limbing to be done from the uphill side.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision was supported by one commenter (Ex. 5&hyph;17). The record shows that bucking and limbing from the uphill side is necessary to protect employees from being hit or crushed by rolling or sliding trees or logs. As discussed above, according to the WIR survey, nearly three-fifths of workers who reported injuries were working on moderate to steep terrain at the time of their accident, and 10 percent of all injured workers said steep terrain had been a factor in their accident (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Bucking or limbing can cause loss of support for the tree and cause it to shift, roll or slide unexpectedly. Blocking or chocking a tree on a slope can never provide as much protection as avoiding the hazard in the first place. The record shows that the only work method in which it can be assured that an employee will not be hurt by a rolling or sliding tree is by performing bucking and limbing on the uphill side. As such, bucking and limbing from the downhill side is permitted only in those cases when the employer is able to demonstrate that it is not feasible to work from the uphill side. In those particular cases, the tree must be restrained to reduce as much as possible the possibility of the tree rolling or sliding. OSHA notes that the burden of demonstrating infeasibility is on the employer. In addition, the issue of the infeasibility of bucking and limbing from the uphill side must be determined on a case-by-case basis when the tree and the conditions in the area are carefully assessed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

[Begin Klaus recording, in English] Finland definitely  discovered that EC membership, this is now my terminology and  not the terminology of the Finnish prime minister or anybody  else, that EC membership is an investment. [end recording]    Klaus said that EU membership is not a miraculous cure but  an  investment that has its costs and its benefits.

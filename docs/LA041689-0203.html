			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRONG PUBLISHER  </P> <P> I am very pleased with John Allyn's positive review of my anthology, "The Best  Japanese Science Fiction Stories" (Book Review, March 26); however, I found two  errors worth mentioning: First, the book was not published by W. W. Norton. It  was published by Dembner Books, a small New York company, and distributed by  Norton. Second, a quote in the final sentence contains a typo that garbles the  meaning of the sentence. The quote should read: "These seem like things  scarcely to be believed, but they all happened." Not "These men like things. .  . ."  </P> <P> JOHN L. APOSTOLOU  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P></p>

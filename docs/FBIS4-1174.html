			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marianne Merten] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- ANC Johannesburg  sub-regional executive member Susan Keane was killed in Sunday's  [24 April] carbomb blast which rocked central Johannesburg on  Sunday. Ms Keane was the 41st candidate on the regional election  list.    Another regional executive member and regional candidate,  Joan Fubbs, who was with Miss Keane, survived unhurt. Ms Keane  died in hospital.    Speaking at a press briefing at the ANC PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional offices, PWV premier  candidate Tokyo Sexwale described this as a cowardly action  designed to disrupt the elections. Mr Sexwale confirmed an  earlier report from a man claiming to be an eye witnesses, who  saw a white person fleeing from a white car just before the  explosion.    According to ANC information at least seven people were  killed and 45 injured. However, police have put the injury toll  at 92.    Mr Sexwale called on all people to remain calm. "There must  be maximum restraint here and there must be no retaliation  because we don't know what is involved. Police were  "co-operating extremely well", he said.    "This type of action in Johannesburg is intended to send  indications of negativity through the country and abroad."    He said the election would go ahead "full steam". "The  election must proceed. This (blast) was intended to frighten  away voters."    He said the security forces and police would be out to  protect voters and to ensure elections went ahead.    Mr Sexwale said it was not possible to identify a specific  target so far but believed the ANC offices were the intended  target.</p>

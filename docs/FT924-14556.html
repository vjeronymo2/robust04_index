			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Ibstock Johnsen cuts payment to 0.5p IBSTOCK JOHNSEN, one of Britain's few remaining independent brick manufacturers, has joined the growing ranks of building material producers and contractors to cut dividends. The company, like many others in the recession-hit sector, made a rights call in spring last year and raised Pounds 44m at 90p a share. Yesterday, the shares fell a further 4p to 45p after the company announced it was reducing its interim dividend from 2.25p to just 0.5p. It had been hit by the big fall in housebuilding and commercial property development, both heavy users of bricks. Pre-tax profits during the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 3.1m. Earnings per share declined from 1.97p to 0.76p leaving the much reduced dividend comfortably covered. Profits would have been even lower but for a rise of almost Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 857,000 in interest receivable following the rights issue. Trading prospects continued to look bleak. Mr Paul Hyde-Thomson, who retires as chairman at the end of this year, said that there was still substantial over-capacity in the UK bricks industry while its main markets remained extremely depressed. More than 1.4bn unsold bricks, equivalent to six months' supply and enough to build 170,000 homes, were stockpiled by British manufacturers at the end of July. Tarmac, Blockley and Redland recently had announced plans for reducing capacity. Despite this, UK sales were still running at about 75 per cent of the industry's production capacity. Brick prices had fallen sharply as a consequence, said Mr Hyde-Thomson. Profits before interest from Ibstock's UK building products division fell by Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.7m even though volume sales were broadly similar to the first half of 1991. Its US operations were in the north east of the country which had been hit hard by a recession in housebuilding and commercial property development, and had been very slow to recover. First half there rose from Pounds 796,000 to Pounds 1.08m. Profits also dipped from Pounds 1.57m to Pounds 1.02m in the continental European building products market where Ibstock had tile and sanitary-ware operations. Forestry products, which earlier in the recession had provided a shelter against a downturn in UK and US construction, made slightly reduced loss of Pounds 409,000 (Pounds 586,000) with the pulp and paper industry at a low ebb. COMMENT Ibstock can be excused for feeling besieged. Every market in which it operates is in recession with little prospect for significant recovery for another 12 to 18 months. The biggest problem is over-capacity in the UK brick industry where more plant closures and job losses are inevitable. On the plus side Ibstock has a gearing of only 12 per cent despite increased investment in cheaper production; unfortunately, it may not feel the benefit of its spending for some time. In the US, recovery in construction has been slow and patchy and still has to take off in the north east. Total dividends this year, at best, may be no more than 1p on pre-tax profits Pounds 4m-Pounds 5m. The possibility of a merger may help underpin the shares - Tarmac is known to have looked at the possibility - but the company is likely to attract few supporters until the industry's general problems can be resolved.</p>

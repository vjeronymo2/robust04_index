			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- More than nine million  poor people in Northwest China have cast off poverty over the  past eight years thanks to government efforts, the "ECONOMIC  INFORMATION NEWS" reported today.    Northwest China includes Gansu, Shaanxi and Qinghai  Provinces, and the Ningxia Hui and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Regions, where many people still had a per capita share of less  than 200 kg of grain a year and cash income below 200 yuan in  the early 1980s, due to historical, natural and economic  conditions.    During the 1986-1990 period the central government expanded  its allocation of funds to help the poor areas, where local  governments focused on improving farmland to raise output,  moving people from ecologically deteriorated areas to areas with  better living conditions, and organizing labor to contract for  projects outside, in line with actual conditions.    While organizing farmers to undertake farmland capital  construction to boost grain output, local governments encouraged  local people to grow more cash crops and breed more domestic  animals, including sheep and long-haired rabbits, in line with  their local conditions and the market needs.    Yanan Prefecture, in Shaanxi Province, produced 860 million  yuan-worth of tobacco, fruit, sheep and potatoes last year,  accounting for two-thirds of its gross agricultural output value.    Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai Province, has built four  commodity production bases for oil-bearing crops, broad beans,  cattle and sheep, and long-haired rabbits respectively; and the  poor areas in Gansu Province have set up a number of processing  industrial bases for fruit, traditional herbal medicine, carpets  and embroidery.    A survey shows that Northwest China's provinces and regions  have sponsored many technical training courses specially for  farmers, and sent agro-technicians to help popularize  cultivation under plastic sheeting, intercropping and  water-saving irrigation techniques.    About 500,000 people living in Xiji, Guyuan and Haiyuan  Counties in southern Ningxia and Dingxi County in Gansu  Province, where natural conditions are harsh, have been moved to  the irrigated areas in the valley of the Yellow River, China's  second longest such after the Chang Jiang River, over the past  decade.    "With government aid, these people settled down in the areas  in the first two years and began to make both ends meet in the  third year," the paper said.    To help people in the remote mountainous areas to live  better  lives, Haidong Prefectural Government has encouraged local  people to set up manufacturing plants outside the prefecture by  using local raw materials.    So far, the prefecture has 26 such industrial enterprises,  which generate a gross output value totalling 40 million yuan a  year.    In addition, Northwest China's provinces and regions have  organized labor forces in the poor villages to carry out labor  services in a planned way.    Southern Ningxia has sent about 200,000 rural laborers to  urban areas to contract for construction and other manual work,  and obtained more than 100 million yuan in remittances a year.    Farmers in Qinan County, Gansu Province, have set up 53  share- holding co-operative businesses, and the Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region has boosted border trade to help poor people  in the border areas improve their lives.</p>

A day before  this, Mr. Fedorov did not accept Viktor Chernomyrdin's official  proposal to retain for himself the post of chief financier, with  direct subordination to the prime minister and broadened powers  at the expense of a cut in the functions of Aleksandr Shokhin  (negotiations with the West on debts). It was not the lowering  of his status as deputy prime minister as such that Boris  Fedorov considered "insulting" to himself, but the background  against which it occurred: the purely formal, from his  standpoint, reorganization of the Cabinet of Ministers and the  more and more apparent departure from the reform policy of 1993.  "If the policy is being changed, evidently another minister of  finance is needed," he said at a press conference. Commenting on  Viktor Chernomyrdin's statement heard four hours earlier on the  transition to "the fight against inflation through nonmonetary  methods," Boris Fedorov said that he did not know what this was,  implying by this a hopeless attempt to raise production through  inflationary emissions. "Even given three times as many big  infusions, production will fall in 1994 by 5 percent," he said.    Monetary emissions in the past year, according to Ministry  of  Finance calculations, amounted to 30-35 percent of all  expenditures of the republic budget. Not one economy in the  world had such a ratio. If this share is raised, which,  apparently, the government and the Central Bank intend to do,  then, according to the conviction of the ex-minister of finance,  "we are on the threshold of Ukrainization." In this case the  country, in the words of Boris Fedorov, "is being doomed to a  pitiful existence." He noted though that in January-February of  1994 the factors of a tough financial policy for the four last  months of last year will still restrain the acceleration of  inflation. However, as early as in March-April, "an explosion  will occur." A monstrous increase in prices, a drop in the real  incomes of the population, and an unavoidable breakdown in  production will be the result for the year. "I was the minister  of finance, and the country had a financial policy," said Boris  Fedorov. "But where is our industrial and agrarian policy, and  where were those who in their positions were responsible for  them?"    The ex-minister proved to be true to himself in the  straightforwardness of his political formulations, and he did  not decline a personal assessment of the activity of the  agrarian deputy prime minister, M. Zaveryukha, and the chief  banker, Mr. Gerashchenko. He defined their role as "destructive"  for reform. Boris Fedorov responded just as harshly to the  statements of Professor Yasin and ex-ministers of the economy  Saburov and Nechayev who claimed that allegedly in 1993 the  ruble rate of exchange was held in check by monetary  interventions on the stock exchange. Mr. Fedorov attributed  these conclusions to the fact that the economists were poorly  informed: "We supported the exchange rate of the dollar and not  of the ruble, in order to preserve the effectiveness of our  exports. He cited this fact as evidence: out of $4 billion given  by the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank, the latter used  only $1.5 billion at the auctions of the MMVB [Moscow Interbank  Currency Exchange]. The report of the Ministry of Finance,  "Russian Finances for 1993," according to the assurances of the  ex-minister, will show the real economic policy and its results.    In this connection, the former deputy prime minister  subjected Strobe Talbott--the second person in the hierarchy of  the State Department of the United States and a personal friend  of President Clinton--to sharp criticism. He called Mr.  Talbott's recommendation--"less shock and more  therapy"--inexpert. "In what did he see the shock?" asked Boris  Fedorov. "In the fact that inflation was 20-30 percent, that in  one year there was only a total of five bankrupt enterprises,  and that the level of unemployment amounted to 1 percent of the  number of those employed? We are moving to the market rather  softly, and let Mr. Talbott cite another example."    The minister, who is resigning, sees the main danger  precisely in the departure from a moderately tough policy. This,  in his words, is even more regrettable, because "the time for  radicalism in economic policy has ended, it is not necessary in  1994 to make even one major radical decision." The main things  have been done: favorable credits and import subsidies have been  canceled, prices for bread and coal have been liberalized, and  the refinancing rate of the Central Bank has practically become  positive. The question now concerns only the creation and  reinforcement of the market institutions. The time has arrived  for professional and "conservative" work, according to Boris  Fedorov's observation. He is not convinced that the current  staff of the Cabinet of Ministers, a coalition in composition,  conforms to these tasks. It reminds Mr. Fedorov "of something  like Silayev's cabinet, where there was movement neither  forward, nor backward." To the question concerning the prospects  of Mr. Chernomyrdin's government, "resigner" Fedorov answered  with meaning: "The president has the right to change the  government. I hope that he will use it."</p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Leading Article: What haunts the markets Polonius advised his son, brother of Hamlet's Ophelia, to be neither a lender nor a borrower. If people had taken this sage counsel, there would not be much of a capital market, nor indeed much capitalism. But what has happened to global markets this year reinforces the sense behind his advice. It is not so much that one should be neither a borrower nor a lender. It is more that only one of those roles is worth playing at any moment. It has been a mistake to be a long-term lender in 1994. Now it will prove costly to be a long-term borrower. In the 1970s, long-term lending to such previously sound borrowers as the US and UK governments proved financially suicidal. Fears of a repeat haunt markets. During periods of declining inflation investors forget their fears, like hungry mice braving a sleeping cat. But as soon as inflation stabilises and prospects for short-term gains on long-term loans vanish, they remember once again. So far, 1994 has been a year for remembering. Naturally, policymakers condemn such fears as irrational. In response to the decline of the dollar to below Y100, President Bill Clinton said only this week that 'this is the first time in 30 years that we have had growth in the economy, with no inflation, led by investment that will create jobs'. Thank you, Mr Greenspan, he might have added, but did not. He has, instead, appointed two people to the board of the Federal Reserve, Alan Blinder and Janet Yellen, who are thought to be soft on inflation. Why did he do that, wonder those spooked markets? He is hardly likely to admit that he hopes to manage a default on Reagan-era federal debt, via a bout of good old-fashioned inflation. He had to say what he did, argue the doubters, whether he is sincere on inflation or not. Inflation fears The return of fears about inflation is one reason for the linked phenomena of declining bond markets and a falling US dollar, another being the strength of the US recovery. Investors no longer wished to buy US financial assets. Once that mood took hold, the size of the US current account deficit made a weakening of the currency likely. If this is so obvious in retrospect, why was it not in advance? The general assumption at the beginning of the year was that the dollar would strengthen with US economic recovery, as short-term interest rates rose in the US and continued to fall elsewhere, particularly in Europe. The relative short-term interest rate part of this story has worked out more or less as expected, but it has not had the expected effect on the dollar. The main reason is that people did not foresee what would happen to long-term rates. What has since been called the world's biggest ever margin call, following the Federal Reserve's minuscule monetary tightening last February, led to larger bond market declines than expected. These increases in long-term interest rates reflect partly the reversal of earlier speculation, partly a return of fears about inflation, but also higher real rates of interest. Higher rates The fact of higher real interest rates is demonstrated by the one more or less incontrovertible piece of evidence, the rise in the real yield on index-linked sterling gilts from 2.9 to 4 per cent since January. This increase explains almost half the rise in the yield on conventional long-term gilts in this period, the rest being presumably due to deteriorating inflationary expectations. Why should higher real rates hurt the dollar? One reason is that investment opportunities elsewhere are better, partly because recovery in continental Europe and Japan is becoming evident. Investors will wish to invest in other markets, something that is hurtful to a country such as the US which is dependent for exchange rate stability on a continuing inflow of foreign capital. Also important in a more inflationary environment is past history. It is not an accident that Japan and Germany, both of which have relatively good historical records on inflation and historically strong external positions, have suffered the smallest declines in their bond markets among leading industrial countries. Meanwhile, Canada, Italy and the UK have suffered most. Japan and Germany also tend to have the strongest currencies, Japan most of all, given its still huge current account surplus. Three conclusions emerge. The first is that with real interest rates back to 4 per cent, being a borrower is a risky business, even for governments. This has to be true when real interest rates exceed the prospective real rate of growth of an economy. The second is that more governments should borrow on inflation-indexed terms. Not only would this help analysts understand bond markets better, it would also protect markets from the fear of inflation. Finally, the spooked markets of today are the price of deceit years ago. The only possible response is to go on trying every day to earn their trust.</p>

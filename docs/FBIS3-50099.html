			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Forbelsky: "In the Interest of </F> Europe's Security"]    [Text] It was apparent from the U.S. President's  "soothing" visit to Prague and from his momentous visit to the  Kremlin that the United States and Russia will in the future  "cooperate in the interest of Europe's security." In practice,  this means that stability on the continent -- and, more broadly  speaking, its fate -- will be the upshot of cooperation between  two powers ensconced outside Europe itself. It was confirmed  that our continent has ceased to be the arena of a possible  clash between them, but that -- as far as their interests are  concerned -- it remains divided between them in accordance with  the outcome of World War II. Compared with past decades, the  only difference now is that the two super-victors are moving  away from confrontation, with its risk of mutual destruction,  toward cooperation. Central Europe should now also infiltrate  into this concept for cooperation made possible by the collapse  of the Soviet regime.    Of course, as is becoming ever more obvious, the interests  of  the Central European countries -- until recently, part of the  so-called Soviet bloc -- are not completely safeguarded by this  global plan for U.S.-Russian cooperation. This disharmony is  due to the fact that their post-war "discomfort" was caused not  only by Soviet-U.S. nuclear rivalry, which is now being  eradicated but also by these Central European countries being  forced to subordinate themselves to unorganized development as a  result of Europe's partition after 1945, development that ran  counter to their historical, cultural, and economic existence.  This pitched them into backwardness from which they now want to  extricate themselves by a return to the community that  corresponds to their interests. The possibility of such a  return is also a crucial condition for their favorable future,  for their newly open historical perspective. An inconsistency  between the most intrinsic interests of former Soviet Central  Europe and the Partnership for Peace plan, which -- a little in  the style of consultations with Central American republics --  President Clinton came to Prague to explain, is foreshadowed  here. Partnership for Peace gives the Central European countries  the theoretical possibility of being selectively admitted into  NATO, an organization guaranteeing their security, only this  same possibility is also being offered -- without limits -- to  the whole of the Euro- Asian region, right up to Vladivostok.  This is the intention of Partnership, because it eradicates the  mutual Russian-U.S. challenge and creates a basis for strategic  cooperation.    However, as far as the Central European countries are  concerned, it is obvious that such a broadly proposed plan may  problematize, if not stymie, their development prospects,  because it preserves the former Soviet empire in a region  stretching from Prague to Vladivostok. These countries'  life-saving trek toward their original European ties, so  different from their Euro-Asian ones, makes them uncertain.  This is also at the heart of their anxiety about "the fate of  the small in the game of the large," which President Lech Walesa  -- a politician of refined instinct -- expressed so emphatically  prior to the Prague meeting. Czech policy's solo journey -- in  this context -- seems more like shortsightedness than foresight.  If it reckons that the Czech Republic will escape from the cage  of global power interests thanks to its declared advantages,  then this is reminiscent of the tragic ingenuity of Edvard  Benes. Many things imply that the new era of cooperation  between America and Russia is not evolving merely to allow these  two powers to rid themselves of the phantom of mutual  destruction, but also because the two -- not Europe -- have  analogous, if not identical, interests in relation to the rest  of the world, first and foremost, Asia, against which they will  have to measure themselves more and more explicitly.    In view of all these circumstances, Central Europe's  strategic interest is defined differently. It cannot have only  a U.S. or a Euro-Asian dimension -- except in a tactical context  -- but just, and only just, a pan-European dimension. Only the  reassurance of being in its original European environment and a  thorough reintegration into it can offer the Central European  countries -- including the Czech Republic -- a suitable  development perspective. Of course, this presumes that their  inhabitants will be clear about this aim, that they will take it  into consideration, and that they will not overshadow it with  obsolete historical reminiscences.    Central Europe, and the Czech Republic in it, cannot now, or  in the future, function like an uncertain weld in U.S.-Russian  special-interest cooperation but must concentrate on returning  to the locus of its historical definition: to the center of the  European continent. Only in this regenerated unit will it feel  safe and only here will it be able -- within the framework of  the European defense, economic, and cultural institutions -- to  fulfill its own destiny.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Poles told of threat to growth ANY loosening of Polish monetary policy this year would dash hopes of reversing a two-year recessionary trend, the government's Central Planning Office (CUP) warned yesterday as the government prepared for a new round of talks with the International Monetary Fund on a suspended a Dollars 1.6bn extended facility. Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, responsible with Mr Andrzej Olechowski, finance minister, for economic policy, said yesterday that positive first quarter trends suggested the economy could bottom out to produce zero growth this year after an 8 per cent fall in gross domestic product last year, and a 15 per cent fall in 1990. If budgetary and other monetary targets were adhered to exports should grow by 6 per cent and imports fall by 3 per cent to give a trade surplus of around Dollars 500m, he added. However, the CUP warned that if the budget deficit were allowed to exceed the 5 per cent of GDP limit or the government bowed to union pressure for higher wages, GDP could fall a further 5 per cent.</p>

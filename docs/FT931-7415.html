			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Japanese trust banks may be downgraded by S&amp;P STANDARD and Poor's, the US credit rating agency, has placed four leading Japanese trust banks under review for possible downgrade. S&amp;P said long and short-term debts of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, Mitsui Trust and Banking, Sumitomo Trust and Banking, and Yasuda Trust and Banking were being reviewed. Japan's trust banks have suffered from problem loans and large exposure to the property market. The banks also face lower fee income on the stock and land trust businesses due to the slump on both the Tokyo stock market and property market. S&amp;P said the four banks were faced with 'a high and still-growing level of problem loans reflecting the weak real estate market and the sluggish Japanese economy'. The credit agency also said the profit ratios of the banks were under pressure. S&amp;P also announced the downgrading of Sumitomo Life Insurance's claims paying ability to AA plus from AAA. Japan's life assurance companies face a sharp fall in unrealised assets amid the current slump of Japanese shares, at a time when dividend payments to policyholders are higher than returns on investments due to lower interest rates and a sluggish stock market.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / White House firm on Adams stance Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, has no plans to meet Mr Gerry Adams, US officials repeated yesterday in the face of the Sinn Fein president's continued campaign for a White House meeting. 'He will meet with officials from the State Department and White House at the working level, but not here,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, Mr Clinton's press secretary. White House officials said final decisions on who would meet Mr Adams when he visits Washington on Monday and Tuesday were likely to be taken yesterday. On his tour of the US, Mr Adams has been campaigning to have his reception upgraded. This week, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, mayor of New York, welcomed him as a 'harbinger of peace'. He added: 'I think President Clinton should greet him.' But the Clinton administration is sticking to its promise to the British government that Mr Adams would not be received at the White House.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK will borrow D-Marks to aid Pounds: Sterling up 1 1/4 pfennigs - FT-SE gains 68 points / Pressure on interest rates eases THE government acted decisively to support sterling yesterday with an innovative plan to borrow D-Marks that immediately eased pressure for an increase in UK interest rates. The announcement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the government would borrow Pounds 7.27bn of D-Marks and other currencies and sell these for sterling lifted the pound by 1 1/4 pfennigs. It closed at DM2.80 in London - its highest close against the D-Mark since the dollar began its plunge to record lows nearly a fortnight ago. In New York it edged further ahead to DM2.803, while in early Far East trading today it was quoted at DM2.8065. The decision also gave UK equities their biggest one-day gain since the Conservative election victory in April. The FT-SE 100 index gained 68.9 to 2,381.9. The plans to borrow the equivalent of Ecu10bn in foreign currencies and the unprecedented commitment to convert the proceeds into pounds ensure strong demand for the pound in the weeks ahead. The plans were quickly interpreted by the foreign exchange market as tangible proof that the UK government was determined not to devalue the pound from its DM2.95 parity in the ERM. That message was hammered home by Mr Lamont: 'These arrangements demonstrate once again the government's clear determination and ability to maintain sterling's position in the ERM at the existing central rate, regardless of the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty,' he said. The dollar also rose yesterday, gaining some 2 pfennigs in London to DM1.4115 and improving further in New York to DM1.4155. In Tokyo this morning it opened at DM1.41625. Interest rates and yields fell on the sterling money and gilt-edged markets, raising hopes that the government will be able to avoid an increase in bank base rates from 10 per cent, even if the French vote against the Maastricht treaty on September 20. The borrowing plan - which consists of a three-year multi- currency revolving credit facility with a group of international banks and a longer-term multi-currency note issue programme - begins almost immediately. The Treasury said the government would borrow half the Ecu10bn in D-Marks this month. It will borrow some DM5bn from the banks 'over the next few days' and convert the proceeds into sterling. Further borrowings of about DM5bn will follow later this month. The UK government has won attractive terms from the banks with an interest rate on the three-year loan of only  3/32 point over the London interbank offered rate. On sterling money markets, the three-month interbank rate, which often acts as a guide to future base rate movements, closed down  1/4 per cent at about 10 5/16 per cent. Prices of UK gilt-edged stock advanced strongly by 2 points. Officials were also keen to release the news ahead of this weekend's informal meeting of European Community finance ministers in Bath, which had been widely expected to discuss contingency plans in case of a French No vote. Yesterday began on a more optimistic note after a sharp rise in Japanese equities lifted the Nikkei average by 798.77 or 4.54 per cent to 18,386.49. The upward trend continued this morning, with the Nikkei up another 135 points in early trading. In France, where Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said long-term interest rates may come down in the event of a Yes vote in the referendum, shares advanced by 4 per cent. The day brought no further increase in German borrowing costs. The Bundesbank left its leading interest rates unchanged. Yesterday's UK action was discussed in advance with the German central bank, although it was not contingent on the outcome of yesterday's discussions of its decision-making central council.

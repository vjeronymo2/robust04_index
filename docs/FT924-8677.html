			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: Marlowe's 'Dr Faustus' - Theatre The Nottingham Playhouse has here an example of director's theatre at its most superficial, with poor Marlowe's Dr Faustus served up as (a) style and (b) comedy. Director Phelim McDermott and designer Julian Crouch have dressed Faustus, Wagner and other mortals in darkly drab Dickensian attire while the devils are kitted in modern suits and primary colours. (Mephistopheles is in bright yellow from head to toe.) The music, by John Winfield, is booming sub-Vangelis stuff that drowns many of the words. You do not see Helen of Troy; you just see wind pouring through a red-tunnel. And, thanks to the wind and the music, you can't hear what Faustus says about her, though this  -'Is this the face that launched a thousand ships?' - is the most famous speech in the play. The action all takes place in Faustus's study, a tall library stuffed with books - reminiscent of the set for the 1975 RSC staging (with Ian McKellen). An ensemble of seven plays all the characters other than Faustus and Mephistopheles, and they seldom leave F and M alone. They keep filing through the library as if it were the British Library's Reading Room; they wear books as mortar-boards, they plant books down as stepping-stones, they flutter books in the air like birds, they pop in and out of their study's doors and windows and the perpetuate a constantly surreal, amusingly bizarre, atmosphere. Thanks to them, the interest of this Faustus is all on the sidelines. The main event is the comic masque of the seven deadly sins. With grotesque masks and costumes - a witty mix of Bosch, Daumier and Dali but in pale papier-mache. Lechery is a woman with a parasol, a bustle and a huge phallus rearing up from under her skirts. Amid a production that is generally unconcerned with fidelity to Marlowe's text, these sins are encouraged to ad-lib, commenting on their role-playing with campy lines like 'that's a lovely line, that. Next line is better.' Another romp is the knockabout treatment of the Pope in Rome, with wordless chanting and silly ritual, which Faustus and Mephistopheles disrupt with various invisible-man tactics. And the sorcerer's-apprentice scenes for the servants with Faustus's books are the best fun of all. McDermott's direction, however, makes Faustus himself flimsy. Jamie Newall is a smug Oxford-postgrad Faustus, with a wretched habit of leaving his mouth gaping open at the end of a line. Though he has worked out a carefully mannered, would-be classical, actorly interpretation of the text, he has no urgency. Michael Cashman's Mephistopheles is more natural in emphasis but nothing about him is as forceful as the colour of his suit. Both he and Newall are lightweight baritones who ensure that the play's central drama remains in a stuffy shade of woollen grey. It is hard to forgive actors wasting such roles as these - but the fault is less theirs than McDermott's. Dr Faustus has both comedy and surrealism, sure. But, according to McDermott, not much else. At the Nottingham Playhouse until November 28</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Fresh evidence on US drug Clinical trials results for Antril, a US septic shock drug, say it is effective in many cases, contradicting evidence published last year which led to a collapse in the share price of its Colorado manufacturer Synergen. The research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, says Antril helps very ill patients live longer. The company's market capitalisation fell from Dollars 1.5bn to less than Dollars 400m on the news early last year.</p>

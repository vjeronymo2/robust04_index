			<p>BFN     [Text] The latest program of the naval forces of the  Islamic Republic of Iran regarding the manufacture of  submarines, docks [preceding word in English], the  reconstruction of vessels, warships and weapons related to  identifying units below sea level has been announced.    Speaking to our correspondent, Captain Mahmud Bidel, the  head of the research unit and self-sufficiency department of the  naval forces referred to the exhortations of his eminence, Imam  Khomeyni (may God be pleased with him) in 1362 [year beginning  21 March 1983] on the need to attain self-sufficiency in the  three branches of the armed forces and the corps, said:  According to the decree of His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i,  the great leader and the commander in chief of the armed forces,  which he issued at the end of last year, a research unit was  added to the self-sufficiency department. He added: The  objectives of this measure were to strengthen the base of the  country's defense. The naval forces have carried out effective  work in the field of electronic warfare and have attained  remarkable success.    The head of the research unit and self-sufficiency  department  of the naval forces continued: One of the most important tasks  of this force in the aftermath of the imposed war has been to  modernize the radar systems of the naval forces and to  coordinate them with the latest techniques currently being used  in the world.    Referring to the continued military embargo against Iran by  world powers, Captain Bidel said: The necessary links have been  forged with the industrial university and with the country's  industry for the manufacture of the components needed for the  various units of the Navy.    He said: According to my estimates, we saved 765 million  rials last year on the purchase of various components for  military equipment. Fortunately, now that we have forged the  necessary links with the industrial university and the country's  industry, there has been a 93-percent saving.    He added: Last year, the Navy succeeded in manufacturing one  of the strategic weapons used in the naval fleet's aviation  division. He referred to the fact that these weapons will help  in strengthening the projects above sea level and in underwater  defense which can assist in search, defense, and reconnaissance  tactics. He said: These weapons were used in the joint  Iran-Pakistan maneuvers (IR-PAK 94) and amazed the Pakistani  naval officials and the international observers.    Elaborating on the fact that an underwater reconnaissance  unit of Iran would be ready by the end of this year, Captain  Bidel said: Armaments related to the identification of  underwater units and fleet helicopters will be ready by the end  of this year. Regarding the Hamzeh warship (formerly known as  the Shahsavar) which had been completed in Azar [22 November-21  December] last year, he said: Preliminaries for the manufacture  of submarines that can be used for deep sea diving fitted with  heavy-duty equipment have been initiated.    He added: The renovation of one hovercraft [preceding word  in English] will be completed by the end of this year and it  will become operational. Captain Bidel said that an  astronomical system had been developed by the marine sciences  academy in Nowshahr in collaboration with the research unit and  self-sufficiency department of the naval forces and has been put  into use. He stated that the preliminaries for the utilization  of this system at the marine sciences academy in Sistan va  Baluchestan have been completed.    He stressed: With the help of this system we can identify  celestial bodies from inside the submarine. He added that the  naval forces have attained great success in manufacturing  underwater communications and said: The research unit and  self-sufficiency department has set up an inverse engineering  section, in collaboration with the Sharif industrial university  and has implemented four projects, including duplication of the  computers currently being used worldwide.    In conclusion, the head of the research unit and the  self-sufficiency department of the naval forces said that the  work for the construction of a 150-ton dock has been initiated  in Bushehr and will become operational on 22 Bahman [11  February] this [Iranian] year. He said that this dock would be  able to accommodate small and large vessels for repairs.</p>

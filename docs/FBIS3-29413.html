For a month long, from mid-January to  mid-February, the two-headed government and the puppets of  communist Vietnam and their masters have time and again claimed  that they have captured Anlung Veng. On 15 January and on 17,  20, 23, 27, and 31 January, they claimed the capture of Anlung  Veng and informed national and international news reporters of  the visit to Anlung Veng.    II. However, the news reporters have been waiting from one  day to another till they have lost patience and accused the  two-headed government of deceitful attempts. Such a scornful  accusation has become the talk of the town, as the reporters and  people in Phnom Penh know that the two-headed government and the  puppets have suffered defeat after defeat in their operations in  the direction of Anlung Veng. They had been severely defeated  in their first, second, and third attempts. Their soldiers have  suffered heavy casualties, both killed and wounded. They have  died on the battlefield and from starvation, lack of water,  malaria. Many of them have deserted. Even with such heavy  casualties, the Hanoi authority and the entente continue to  order the two-headed government and the puppets to launch the  fourth attempt of military operation starting from 9 February.  However, their soldiers -- who have low morale -- have  deserted. Even the commanders of the operation -- such as Long  Sopheap, Prum Samen, Keo Pisit -- have been scared of the  battlefield as they have seen many generals, colonels, and other  military officers killed or wounded at the front, and they are  facing a deadly encirclement by the National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea [NADK].    III. The spokesman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea  [PDK] would like to make the following clarification:    First, the region of Anlung Veng still remains in the hands  of the PDK, but it has been transformed into a battleground  between, on the one hand, the forces of the two-headed  government and the puppets, and on the other hand, the forces of  the NADK and the local people. The fighting continues unabated.  However, the most outstanding feature is the fact that the NADK  and the local people have been able to encircle the headquarters  of the enemy commanding post where Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, Keo  Pisit, and quite a number of other generals have to stay  permanently in their tanks and always on the move in western and  southern parts of Anlung Veng region. Their tanks and heavy guns  have been under constant attacks by the NADK and must be on the  move at all times. But they are facing another difficulty; that  is, the shortage of gasoline.    Secondly, from 9 to 15 February, for seven days, the  front-line commanders of the troops of the two-headed government  had been encircled by the NADK and local people who can see that  those puppet commanders were either put to rout or killed on the  spot. Those who were able to escape with their troops from the  frontline were intercepted and inflicted heavy casualties by our  NADK units. The enemy situation has been in a desperate  position because of several factors:    1. They are hundreds of kilometers far from their near  bases;    2. They have no one civilian who supports them in the  region;    3. They cannot supply themselves on the spot. In a word,  they are like in desert. Everyday, because of food supply, they  complain about ammunition shortage, about the non-forthcoming of  tanks, heavy guns because they had in Phnom Penh, and complain  about diarrhea and other diseases which have target their  troops. [sentence as heard] On top of the list, because of  fatigue, desertion has increased.    Thirdly, experiences of wars in the world have indicated  that  when the enemies stay in such an encircled position, cut off  from their supply bases -- such were the case of Stalingrad  during the Second World War and Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam -- they  are finally annihilated.    Fourthly, during the course of the war in general and during  a major operation in particular, the gain of lots of towns has  its own significance [words indistinct]. The most important one  is the elimination of the enemy strength. If the enemies lose  their strength on the battlefield, they will lose their fighting  forces and the towns they occupy. Experiences of the wars in  Cambodia and in the world have clearly vindicated that  particular view.    IV. Can communist Vietnam and its puppets and the two-  headed government and the entente -- who have worked out and  implemented their strategies and tactics of starting the current  situation through the pursuit of the war -- resolve the problem?  What will be their fate? Is not a peaceful conciliation better?  To such questions, the answers are as follows:    Firstly, the above-cited questions can be answered by  another  question. On the battlefield of Anlung Veng, how many more days  or months or seasons can the forces of the two-headed government  continue the fighting, as they are in a desert land; they are  encircled and cut off from their supply bases; and they have  been under a constant attack, especially the guerrilla warfare  of the NADK and local people?    Secondly, another question is: Taking into consideration the  situation in Cambodia as a whole, are the old and new aggressors  and their puppets as strong as Americans and Lon Nol? Do they  have as much money as at that time? Are they as strong as the  first Khmer war of the communist Vietnamese with hundreds of  thousands of troops from 1978 to 1991? The next question that  comes to mind is: What will be the fate of the two-headed  government who wants to continue the Vietnamese war?    Thirdly, another question is: Who wants national  conciliation and peace? Who are against them? These questions  are linked to the question of forces. Those who want national  conciliation and peace will have forces. Those who are against  them will not have forces. That is indeed a basic and strategic  issue. Who supports the national conciliation and peace in  accordance with His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point  guideline? It is the entire Cambodian nation and people based  in the countryside and in the cities, at home and abroad, and  peace-loving countries and people in the world, especially those  of Asia, who want peace, security, and stability in the region.    Fourth, the entire Cambodian nation and people have risen up  to uphold the five-point national conciliation banner of His  Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. These forces are gaining  strength by the day from one month or season to another. These  forces will certainly get rid of the aggressors, the warmongers,  those who oppose national conciliation and peace, and the  puppets of communist Vietnam until the banner of national  conciliation and peace of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk will  fly all over the country.    World War I and World War II experiences, as well as  regional  wars, have vindicated that the aggressors and their puppets will  be eliminated by the forces of the entire nation and people.  The fate of the old and new aggressors and their puppets in  Cambodia will certainly not be different.    [Dated] 16 February 1994    [Signed] The spokesman of the PDK</p>

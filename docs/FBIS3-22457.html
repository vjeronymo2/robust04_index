			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lidiya Ivchenko: "Education Is the Most Reliable </F> Means of Combating AIDS at Present"]    [Text] World AIDS Day has been marked for the sixth time,  drawing universal attention to the terrible disease which has  struck at least 14-15 million inhabitants of the planet.    It is no coincidence that such attention has been devoted to  AIDS: It is a disease of young people, and its wide spread,  first, threatens to cause the degeneration of the human race  and, second, is a heavy economic burden upon society. Treatment  for AIDS, which can, at best, only prolong life somewhat, is  very expensive -- according to U.S. estimates, approximately  $80,000 a year. The disease is still incurable, with the  majority of patients dying within five to 10 years despite all  the efforts of medicine, and at present just one reliable means  exists against it -- people's education. Information and  literacy relating to all aspects of the problem -- this is one  condition for prevention.    This is why medics urge the press and representatives of  various organizations, including religious ones, to assist them  in propaganda and educational work in everything concerning AIDS.    In Russia, as is well known, the incidence of infection with  HIV is considerably lower than in the West. In the opinion of  Vadim Pokrovskiy, leader of the Russian Center for the  Prevention and Combating of AIDS, its slower pace is connected  with our society's considerable isolation in the eighties. The  situation is changing now. This year 80 cases of infection with  AIDS have been registered.    "This infection is now recorded in 53 of Russia's 88  administrative territories," Valentin Pokrovskiy, president of  the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, said. "This year 32  people have passed from the infected category to the sick  category -- as is well known, AIDS develops slowly, and it takes  several years for the disease to show itself. In all, we have  registered 692 cases of AIDS infection since 1987, 124 people  have fallen ill, and 96 have died. During the same time 435  HIV-positive foreign citizens have been detected and deported."    Much has been done in Russia in recent years to organize the  struggle against AIDS. Precisely 748 diagnostic laboratories  are operating, and the Russian Scientific Methods Center, six  regional centers, 73 territorial centers, and 128 anonymous  screening clinics have been set up.    A federal targeted program for 1993-1995 to prevent the  spread of AIDS was adopted this year. Despite all the economic  difficulties, its funding will begin in December. The draft law  "On Preventing AIDS Sickness" has been prepared and is already  being examined.    How has the Russian public charitable organization  "Association for Combating AIDS" marked World AIDS Day?    "We have published AIDS references for physicians and  distributed them to many medical establishments in the country,"  Yu. Malyutin, the association's responsible secretary, said. "A  collection of articles for middle-level medical workers has been  published, as well as masses of brochures, booklets, and other  literature which is being distributed free to the population.  Two special editions of MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA devoted to the  problem of preventing HIV infection have been published, and an  amateur talent competition for medical establishment students on  the subject of 'All About AIDS and Drugs' has been held in  conjunction with Moscow's Main Medical Administration. The  students' best works -- posters, wall newspapers, photographs --  are being exhibited in the Satirikon Theater."</p>

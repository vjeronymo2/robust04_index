			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Cookery: Count your free-range chickens Many cooks struck veal and chicken off their menus when details of intensive  -often cruel - production methods filtered through to the public. The resulting drop in sales led to farmers making extra efforts to grow meat more kindly and the results are becoming available more widely. Genuine free-range chickens have been available for some time at good supermarkets and specialist butchers (although, alas, it is increasingly difficult to find a chicken complete with its giblets). More recently, whole free-range chickens have been joined on supermarket shelves by free-range chicken joints - packets of breast, thigh, drumstick or wing meat that are very handy indeed for quick and easy meals. Veal produced by humane methods is also becoming easier to buy. The Quantock system, a more humane method of raising calves, is a definite step forward from the so-called New British Standard method and the intensive crate system. Fully free-range veal is rarer than the Quantock variety - but it is preferable and worth asking for. This is the meat of calves raised with their mothers and slaughtered at the weaning stage, rather than grown on as beef cattle. Unlike intensively reared veal, which is anaemically white and fine-textured but almost tasteless, the free-range meat is pearly pink and tastes like very mild and sweet young beef. SCALLOPINE AL BALSAMICO (serves 4) Veal sauced with Marsala was a favourite entree of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and very good it was, too. I have replaced the fortified wine with balsamic vinegar to give the dish a new lease of life in the 1990s. Ingredients: 1lb (or just under) escalopes of veal (or escalopes of pork); 1oz unsalted butter; 3-4 tablespoons balsamic vinegar; 4 tablespoons stock; 3-4 tablespoons thick cream (optional) Method: Heat a large saute pan until very hot. Add the butter and, when the butter foam dies down, saute the veal in batches for 2-3 minutes on each side (or less if the meat has been beaten very thinly). Remove and keep hot. Add the vinegar and stock to the pan. Scrape and swirl the mixture around, letting it bubble up and blend. Add the cream if using it, season to taste, and continue bubbling briefly to make a smooth, very savoury sauce. Turn the heat right down. Return the meat to the pan, turning each slice as you add it to coat it with the sauce. When all are in, tip the contents of the pan on to a warmed serving dish. Wilted spinach scattered with toasted pine nuts goes well with this dish. LEMON TARRAGON CHICKEN WITH COURGETTES (serves 4) Ingredients: 4 small boned and skinned chicken breasts weighing 3 1/2 -4oz each; 1 1/4 lb courgettes; 2oz unsalted butter; 2 tablespoons lemon juice; 2 slightly heaped teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon. Method: Separate the small fillets from the chicken breasts. Then, slice the main part of each breast in two to make two thinner slices. Cut the courgettes into batons. Heat a large saute pan until very hot. Add a little of the butter and, when the butter foam dies down, fry the courgettes until streaked with gold and just cooked through. Remove and keep hot. Add a little more butter to the pan and saute the chicken a few slices at a time until gilded without and tender within. Remove and keep hot. Add the rest of the butter, the lemon juice and a teaspoon or two of water to the pan. Scrape, swirl, let the mixture bubble up, and season with salt, pepper and tarragon. Turn off the heat but leave the pan where it is. Slip the chicken quickly into the pan and turn the slices to coat them with the fragrant, buttery juices. Lay the meat on a warmed serving dish, tip the courgettes into the pan, and toss to anoint them with the remains of the sauce. Arrange the vegetables alongside the chicken and serve with new potatoes or basmati rice.</p>

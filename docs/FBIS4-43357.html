			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jerry Van Waterschoot: "Obstacles"] </F>   [Text] Contrary to all expectations, the Dehaene government  emerged strengthened from the European elections, at least in  its Flemish wing. Even when it came to a fight at the ballot  box for the European Parliament, voters did not make the most of  their opportunity to give the CVP [Flemish Christian People's  Party] and SP [Flemish Socialist Party] a drubbing. Whether or  not this can be taken to mean that they approve of the  government's policy is an open question. However, evidently  voters were not totally indignant at the actions of the Dehaene  government.    The most important event of the elections, namely, the fact  that the renewed VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] failed to make  a breakthrough, is a nonevent in Flanders. One may puzzle for  weeks over why the blue [color of VLD] tidal wave never came  about, but there would be little sense in doing so. No tidal  wave materialized, except in the predictions made by the opinion  polls. The citizens did not turn their backs on the message  issued by the VLD. Indeed, unlike a number of politicians, they  never went over to it in the voting booth in the first place.    If there is relief in the Flemish Government camp, then this  is less true for the PS [Walloon Socialist Party] and PSC  [Walloon Social Christian Party]. Some serious blows were dealt  in comparison with 24 November 1991. Two years after it did so  in Flanders, the far right has also made inroads in Wallonia, to  the great dismay of a large number of Walloons, who thought they  were immune to that virus, which they pityingly viewed as a  Germanic phenomenon.    As was the case at the last European elections, [PS] Jose  Happart succeeded in channeling a large number of dissatisfied  citizens in his direction. The farmer and former mayor from  Voeren is a populist maverick. An accident-prone individual who  is looked askance on by the PS leadership, but who is tolerated  on the party's list because he brings in as many 250,000  write-in votes, a figure which represents as much as 13 percent  of all Walloon voters.    So the government will find it heavy going on its Walloon  flank. Not only are the PSC and the PS seeing their support cave  in, but Happart's influence within the PS is also growing. He  is already busily cashing in on it. Happart is threatening to  become Voeren's mayor again. He is calling for a fresh "return  of heart" by increasing minimum wages and minimum benefit  payments. Happart can hamper the coalition. With the St.  Michael accord, the government succeeded in putting the  community pests on ice. They did so in expectation of the  regional parliaments also being directly elected in the general  elections at the end of 1995, and of calling upon the community  energy at that time.    At the economic level, this government has just recently  significantly scaled down its "return of heart," which the  previous government had hastily embarked on. In a country where  the end of the restructuring of the budget and social security  is not yet in sight, and in a Europe where the meaning of  minimum thresholds for the payment of wages and benefits is  increasingly coming up for discussion, Happart certainly intends  to row very much against the current.    The Dehaene government is not taking things as far as some  other European countries, where left-wing or center-left  governments are implementing a "right-wing" policy. In recent  years, at the social and economic level, the coalition of  Dehaene has set to work in an unmistakably "labor party" manner.  However, at the same time, the policy falls within the logic of  the restructuring process, and circumstances are resulting in  the emergence of traits that can be described as liberal:  privatization, flexibility, imposing responsibility,  competitive companies. Perhaps that is why voters did not  consider it worthwhile to defect to the VLD.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, April 25, RIA -- The existing power shall  not, and will not be deposed by violence, President  Ter-Petrosyan said to parliament today to propose a provisional  arrangement before the new constitution is passed. According to  it, parliament shall offer for referendum, without preliminary  debates, either of the two constitutional drafts or both--the  official version from the president-headed Constitutional  Commission, and six opposition parties' alternative draft.    If the latter is adopted, the president will immediately  resign. If his variant passes, Armenia will need new  presidential and parliamentary elections, holds Mr.  Ter-Petrosyan. He also deems it necessary for parliament to  pass the citizenship and election bills within the current  session, reports SNARK news agency.</p>

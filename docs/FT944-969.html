			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Syndicated Loans: Swedish deal increased to Dollars 6bn after strong response A jumbo syndicated loan for Sweden has been increased to Dollars 6bn from Dollars 5bn after a strong response from international banks. The deal, arranged by Citibank and JP Morgan, is notable for its low pricing and is likely to set a benchmark for sovereign borrowers in the international credits market. The revolving loan has a facility fee of 4 basis points plus a cost if drawn of 4 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), making a total of 8 basis points over Libor. The loan replaces two existing and more expensive credits which mature in 1995. Ms Christine Holm, director of the Swedish National Debt Office, said around Dollars 1bn was outstanding of the two loans maturing next year and the remainder of the new loan would be kept in reserve. She said: 'We are very happy with this facility. It has been a very good exercise for us.' The cost of international bank loans has fallen by almost half this year. Banks have become more competitive as they seek new assets while corporate borrowers have been reluctant to take on debt. This competition has resulted in an increase in activity as well as a tendency for loans to highly-respected credits to be oversubscribed. A total of 27 banks offered to underwrite Dollars 8bn for the Sweden deal, and a further 19 banks joined in syndication for the loan, which is due to be signed on January 9. In November, Sweden voted to join the European Union and bankers involved in the jumbo loan are planning a trip from London to Brussels via Eurostar, the Channel tunnel train, for a celebratory dinner. Portugal plans a large external loan, between Dollars 100m and Dollars 500m, in the first quarter of 1995, a senior Treasury source said, Reuter reports from Lisbon.</p>

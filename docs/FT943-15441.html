			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Gas regulator may act to widen competition Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, will use her powers to introduce wider competition if the government fails to put forward legislation to deregulate the gas market. She told the Financial Times she has the power to lower the present 2,500 therm-a-year threshold, below which British Gas is the monopoly supplier to a customer. Parliament would still need to approve such a scheme, which would leave British Gas as the sole holder of a public gas supply licence. Ms Spottiswoode was speaking as senior gas industry figures stepped up pressure on ministers to renew their commitment to gas deregulation amid fears the timetable for introducing competition in gas supply may be slipping. Legislation to pave the way for the reform is thought not to have been included in the list of core bills for the autumn agreed by the cabinet last week, raising the prospect the measure may not be placed before MPs until parliament's 1995-96 session. Such a delay would make it difficult for the passage of the bill to be secured in time to implement proposals to open 5 per cent of the gas supply market in 1996. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, unveiled the plan last December, saying the gas market should be opened up to full competition by 1998. Ms Spottiswoode has urged politicians to 'make some statements pretty fast' to counter the growing impression that government support for deregulation is fading. She told the FT she was 'not surprised' there could be problems in including a gas bill in the next legislative programme because of the complexity of some other bills. But she said any delay would need to be accompanied by a strong statement of support from a broad range of ministers in order to encourage independent gas marketers to make the necessary investments. 'It is very difficult for industry to live with the current uncertainty because they need to make early investment decisions,' she said. These include commitments to develop new North Sea gas fields as well as investment in the information technology systems which need to be in place before companies can compete in the domestic market of 18m households. Ms Spottiswoode warned that any delay in legislation could cause companies to 'lose heart' and withdraw from discussions to develop the detailed network code that will be 'profoundly important' to the structure of the industry. If the threshold for allowing competition were lowered this would burden the company with the social obligations. It would also limit the degree to which the corporation could restructure its operations, in effect barring it from divesting its trading operation for the transportation and storage business. Royal assent for a bill could still in theory be obtained in time to permit the government's plans to go ahead on schedule even if it was not tabled until 1995-96. But debating time at the start of the parliamentary year has become scarce since the Budget was moved to November. The government could in theory press on with deregulation without primary legislation. But a bill is required to ensure that consumer safeguards are maintained.</p>

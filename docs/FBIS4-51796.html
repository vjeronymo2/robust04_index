			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- The foreign ministers of  South Korea and Cote d'Ivoire met Wednesday for talks on  promoting bilateral relations and cooperation in the  international arena.    Han Sung-chu greeted his counterpart Amara Essy at the  Foreign Ministry and exchanged opinions on recent developments  on the Korean peninsula and in Africa, officials said. The two  foreign ministers shared the view that the North Korean nuclear  problem should be solved through peaceful means, they said.  Essy is the west African country's first foreign minister to  visit South Korea. The two nations established diplomatic ties  in 1961. Essy was to meet South Korean President Kim Yong-sam  in the afternoon. He will tour major industrial plants and meet  with business leaders before leaving on Saturday.</p>

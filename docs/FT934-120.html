			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Call renewed for Greater Serbia A Bosnian Serb leader yesterday signalled plans to push forward with the creation of Greater Serbia by the end of next year, regardless of punitive sanctions against Serb-led Yugoslavia. Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, the speaker of the Serb parliament, said he expected a union of self-styled Serb states in Bosnia and Croatia with 'one government, one parliament'. The leaders of Bosnia's three warring communities at partition talks in Geneva have already endorsed the creation of three republics, but Mr Krajisnik's remarks indicate that, despite their formal agreement, Serb leaders have no intention of backing the accord. 'Demarcation between national communities in Bosnia will be created soon and the Bosnian Serb Republic and the Republic of Serb Krajina will create a common state by the second half of 1994 at the latest,' Mr Krajisnik told the Serb 'parliament' which met to debate whether to give the negotiating team a new mandate at talks in Geneva. Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has exerted pressure on his Bosnian proxies to hand over land to their Moslem adversaries in exchange for the easing of sanctions imposed on Belgrade 19 months ago for its role in the partition of Bosnia. Serbian authorities yesterday announced power cuts after coal miners went on strike demanding their wages in hard currency. The miners at the Kolubara mining basin on Wednesday stopped all coal deliveries to the Nikola Tesla thermal power plant, which supplies half of Serbia's electricity. Diplomats say Serbia still sells electricity to neighbouring countries in exchange for hard currency. Printing presses cannot keep up with inflation, which economists yesterday said ran at 1m per cent in December, according to Belgrade radio. Buses carrying 800 civilians evacuated from Sarajevo limped across the Bosnian border into Croatia yesterday, Reuter adds. The buses left the city on Tuesday after months of haggling between Moslem authorities and besieging Bosnian Serbs.</p>

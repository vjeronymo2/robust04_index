			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANNEL 7 CATCHES FLAK FOR ALLOWING PRESS COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: POLITICAL WATCHDOG GROUP TELLS POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR STATE  INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO LEAVE THE AIR, BUT COMMENTATOR SAYS HE WILL STAY  UNTIL HE MAKES A DECISION.  </P> <P> A political reform group is criticizing KABC-TV Channel 7 for allowing Bill  Press to remain on its news broadcasts while conducting an exploratory campaign  for state insurance commissioner. Press says he will remain on the air until  making a decision to run.  </P> <P> "KABC should have asked Bill Press to leave the moment he even began thinking  about running for office," said Mark Haarer, acting director of California  Common Cause. "The airwaves have a tremendous impact on how people think, and  this relationship will have a tremendous impact on his potential candidacy. It  is unfair and may be an abuse of the airwaves for a candidate or potential  candidate's own selfish need."  </P> <P> While Common Cause has complained directly to KABC when similar cases arose in  the past, it has not done so this year, Haarer said, because its executive  director, Walter Zelman, also is exploring the possibility of running for state  insurance commissioner. Zelman began a leave of absence from his job Sept. 25.  </P> <P> "I did not surrender my constitutional rights when I went to work on radio and  television," Press responded in an interview. "I think it is outrageous for  anyone to think I would have to. As a civil libertarian, I find that  offensive."  </P> <P> KABC General Manager Terry Crofoot and news director Roger Bell did not return  phone calls from The Times. A broadcaster seeking public office does not come  under federal regulation until becoming an official candidate. If he or she  remains on the air after that, the station is subject to equal-time requests  from other candidates.  </P> <P> Press also co-hosts a weekday talk show on radio station KABC-AM (790), whose  general manager, George Green, has no objections to Press remaining on the air.  </P> <P> "He hasn't made an announcement to me, and until he makes an announcement, he's  not a candidate," Green said. "Our position is that he has to announce his  candidacy, and we'll treat that situation as we did we with Bruce Herschensohn"  -- another KABC-AM commentator who continued in his job until he declared  himself a U.S. Senate candidate in 1986.  </P> <P> But critics believe that what the Cap Cities/ABC-owned stations are doing is  ethically wrong. Bill Zimmerman, campaign consultant for Conway Collis, a Board  of Equalization member who has declared his candidacy for insurance  commissioner, contends that Channel 7's decision to allow Press to remain on  the air gives him an electoral advantage.  </P> <P> "For a minor office, there are all kind of studies that indicate that name  identification is the single largest determinate of voting patterns," Zimmerman  said. "If you don't have name identification, you have to spend a great amount  of money to get it. Bill is getting tens of thousands of dollars of television  time weekly and none of that is being disclosed as an in-kind campaign  contribution by KABC."  </P> <P> Press launched his self-described exploratory campaign Oct. 5 with a  $250-per-person fund-raiser at a Beverly Hills hotel, and claims to have raised  nearly $300,000. Press has also conducted Los Angeles and San Francisco press  conferences on earthquake insurance and has participated in three candidate  forums.  </P> <P> "Many times, an exploratory campaign is nothing but a device from keeping it an  official campaign," veteran political consultant Joe Cerrell said. "Some people  conduct exploratory campaigns when they're not sure if they are going to run or  to keep a job or stay on the air. In Bill's case, I think it is a case where he  wants to stay on the air."  </P> <P> Press said he has yet to decide if he will officially seek the Democratic  nomination for insurance commissioner.  </P> <P> "It looks very good for me, but I have not made a final decision," Press said.  "Running for statewide office is an enormous undertaking, particularly for  someone who has never run for public office. I have to be sure all the elements  are there before I make a final decision. If my final decision is to go, then I  will resign my position, but not before."  </P> <P> Candidates for all offices on the June ballot are required to file a  declaration of intention with the Secretary of State's office between Jan. 29  and Feb. 7, then must file nomination papers between Feb. 12 and March 9. Press  could remain on the air without KABC-TV and KABC-AM falling under the  equal-time requirements until turning in his nomination papers.  </P> <P> Press said that he has neither shied away from nor emphasized insurance-related  issues on his commentaries.  </P> <P> "The way I approach my job is to discuss the hottest issue of the day," Press  said. "I only talk about insurance when it is far and away the biggest story of  the day. I think I probably have talked about insurance three times in the past  four or five months."  </P> <P> This is the third time in four years that Common Cause has raised this issue.  In 1985, Zelman wrote to Channel 7 and KABC radio to furlough Herschensohn.  </P> <P> The stations rejected the request. Herschensohn resigned from both stations  after announcing his candidacy on Channel 7, then returned after being  defeated.  </P> <P> In 1987, Zelman questioned the propriety of Channel 7 allowing Press to give a  farewell commentary Nov. 3, 1987, a day after announcing he would be resigning  from Channel 7 to seek the 1988 Democratic Senate nomination.  </P> <P> Crofoot, then KABC-TV news director, said at the time that the Federal  Communications Commission had concurred with the station's decision to permit  Press on the air and not offer equal time to his then-rival, Lt. Gov. Leo T.  McCarthy, because Press had not qualified for the ballot yet.  </P> <P> Press withdrew from that race before the June primary, rejoining Channel 7 in  April, 1988.  </P> <P> Under federal law, stations must provide equal time to opposing candidates  whenever a candidate appears on a broadcast outside of bona-fide newscasts,  interview programs, documentaries and on-the-spot coverage of news events.  </P> <P> The practical impact of the law forces candidates with jobs in the media to  relinquish their positions during the campaign.  </P> <P> The law also applies to actors turned candidates, which barred Ronald Reagan  movies from the airwaves during his political campaigns.  </P> <P> In 1980, when KHJ-TV inadvertently ran "Starfighters," a movie starring Rep.  Robert K. Dornan, the station gave his opponent, Carey Peck, 16 minutes of air  time to equalize the time Dornan was on the screen.  </P> <P> Perhaps the strictest interpretation of the law came when George Takei sought a  Los Angeles City Council seat in 1973. Channel 4 refrained from showing  animated versions of "Star Trek," which included him supplying the voice of Mr.  Sulu.  </P></p>

The court continued to look into the case of  the defendants accused of belonging to al-Tahrir [Liberation]  Party. The court summoned a new witness who testified before the  court panel and the defense representatives. The defense  representatives objected to the testimony of the witness,  arguing that the case had already been referred to the panel for  a final verdict. Besides, the defense representatives were not  informed of the name of the witness in advance. Some of the  defendants parents objected to the witness. This prompted the  president of the court to order them to leave the courtroom.    The session lasted five hours. The court is expected to  issue a verdict next Sunday. It is worth mentioning that the  decisions of the State Security Court are not final. The  decisions, along with all the papers of the case, will be  referred to the Court of Appeals.    PETRA reported that the court heard testimony from the court  witness, a bailiff who wrote down the minutes of the  investigation. The bailiff asserted that the prosecutor of the  State Security Court, after identifying himself to the  defendants, read them the charges and their rights before they  made any statements at the military judiciary building, and that  no other parties were present. When the defense lawyers asked  the bailiff about the way the defendants were brought to the  military court, there was debate between the defense lawyer and  the public prosecutor. Afterward, some 20 attendees left the  courtroom after making threats and disrupting order.    On their way out, these people attacked court guards,  smashed  windows, and banged wooden doors and walls. Immediately, the  court president ordered that they be arrested for disrupting  order and committing an act punishable by law. He ordered that  those people be referred to competent agencies for interrogation.</p>

The final session,  held at the Prime Ministry, was cochaired by Prime Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi.    At the conclusion of the session, Dr. al-Majali and Dr.  Sidqi  signed the minutes of the committee. A final statement was then  issued. The statement addressed the current Arab situation and  the growing relations between the two fraternal countries, as  well as ways of enhancing them in all fields. Dr. al-Majali and  Dr. Sidqi also held a news conference in which they answered  reporters' questions in all fields. Details are in the  following report:    Following the signing ceremony of the minutes of the Joint  Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee, Prime Minister Dr.  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi held a news conference in which they spoke about the  results of the meetings and answered questions by reporters and  other media representatives.    Dr. Ziyad Fariz, the minister of planning and acting  minister  of industry and trade, who chaired the Jordanian side to the  meetings of the preparatory committee, read a press statement,  saying:    "In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. A  press statement: On this blessed morning, praise be to God, the  Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee concluded its meetings  at the Prime Ministry under Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, prime  minister of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi, prime minister of the Arab Republic of Egypt.    "The two sides stressed the importance of these meetings  within the framework of their quest for cooperation,  coordination, and joint action launched by the two countries  years ago in order to lay the foundations for developing  relations between the two fraternal countries in all fields.    "During these meetings, there was a review of Arab,  regional,  and international developments, as well as the role of the  leadership in both countries, and their fraternal relations, in  promoting joint Arab action and achieving Arab interests in the  face of challenges and threats to the region and the problems  and disputes this region is suffering, which could subject it to  foreign intervention and ambitions.    "The two sides called for efforts to resume the drive for  Arab solidarity and for organizing inter-Arab relations through  resolving Arab differences in accordance with a pan-Arab  perspective that focuses on the Arab nation's common interests  and concerns.    "Out of the awareness of the two sides of the critical and  important nature of the current stage being experienced by the  Arab nation and the region in general, in addition to  international changes, such as the emergence of influential  regional economic blocs, the two sides stressed the importance  of a comprehensive review of the Arab situation, in terms of its  political, security, and economic aspects, to help in facing the  emergent challenges.    "The two sides expressed their intense concern and distress  over the serious, fast-paced developments in Yemen. They urge  the brothers to stop fighting immediately and return to  political dialogue to settle the crisis. This would preserve  the unity and interests of the fraternal Yemeni people.    "The two sides also expressed hope that the problem of  inspecting al-'Aqabah-bound vessels would be settled in a manner  that safeguards Jordan's interests.    "The two sides stressed the importance of activating the  work  of the committees studying the relations of various sectors in  the two countries, as well as the need for these committees to  meet to ensure continued dialogue and coordination between the  two sides on all levels.    "The decisions also provide for cooperation in all fields,  the most important of which are: Political coordination: The  two sides stressed the important role that Egypt and Jordan can  play to restore Arab solidarity and create a unified Arab  position on various issues. This is in addition to coordination  and consultation on various regional and international issues,  and facing the new developments on the regional and Arab levels.  They also welcome the signing of the Cairo agreement for  Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, as a step down the  road to reaching a just, lasting, and comprehensive solution in  the region."    In the economic field, the statement notes an agreement to  form an economic working team to devise a joint mechanism to  discuss regional and international issues and cooperation and  coordination in these fields. The two sides also reviewed the  status of the Egyptian-Jordanian Investment Company and its  plans in both countries.    The statement also notes an agreement to implement Trade  Protocol No. 1 that stemmed from the agreement signed in 1992.  The two sides stressed the importance and need for coordination  and exchange of expertise in financial affairs, planning,  energy, mining, agriculture, water, transportation and  communications, health and medicine, tourism, culture and  information, in addition to activating a cooperation agreement  in the field of manpower.    In the field of higher education, the final statement says:    "It has been agreed that the Jordanian Ministry of Higher  Education will set aside 100 seats annually for the Egyptian  Ministry of Higher Education for the first university degree in  various specialties. In return, the Egyptian Ministry of Higher  Education will set aside 110 seats for the Jordanian Ministry of  Higher Education for graduate studies, in addition to 15 seats  as scholarships for graduate studies and 300 seats annually for  the first university degree at Egyptian universities."    After the press statement was read, Dr.al-Majali and Dr.  Sidqi replied to journalists' questions.    On his meeting with His Majesty King Husayn yesterday,  Dr.'Atif Sidqi said:    "The truth is that I was honored yesterday when His Majesty  King Husayn received me and my colleagues, the members of the  accompanying delegation. We spoke with all clarity and  frankness about the present Arab state of affairs, the state of  affairs the Arab nation is experiencing. His majesty's  viewpoints and those of the prime minister are nearly the same  as our viewpoints and analysis in Egypt, both of His Excellency  President Husni Mubarak and the government. Of course, there is  always a complete agreement on these issues.    "However, the main problem, the topical issue during this  meeting was the question of Yemen -- of course, you all are  following this issue -- and the efforts Jordan has exerted to  reconcile the two Yemeni sides, as well as the efforts Egypt has  and is still exerting in this respect. These efforts were also  discussed. The objective of his majesty the king and of Jordan  is the same as that of His Excellency President Mubarak and of  Egypt.    "There were also His Majesty King Husayn's statements about  the relations between Egypt and Jordan. I would like to  emphasize to you that these relations have always been good.  His majesty the king visited Egypt. God willing, His  Excellency President Husni Mubarak will do the same, will visit  his brother in Jordan. Thanks be to God, we overcame the  susceptibilities that used to exist. I say that I sensed during  my meeting with his majesty the king that his policies are  pan-Arab and in the interest of the entire Arab nation. His  majesty is fully concerned that we emerge from the present  differences in the Arab arena to a state of affairs that will  bring good through peaceful and objective methods."    Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali replied to a  question on the nature of the Jordanian-Palestinian relations,  saying:    "The Jordanian-Palestinian relationship is a unique  relationship that stands out. We were not satisfied with the  coordination because we always felt and believed that  coordination should always be on all levels and in the best of  circumstances. But, at the same time, we excused the brothers  because they were busy with major political issues in their  negotiations with Israel. There was no opportunity for  coordination as we had wished. However, the coordination, to  some extent, was good. Now that the signing has taken place, we  hope and I explained this to His Excellency President Yasir  'Arafat -- and His Majesty King Husayn has also told brother  'Arafat -- that the time has come to have the various committees  meet because it is essential to do so. We believe that the  reasons that may once have stood in the way of good coordination  no longer exist after the signing. We ask God that this takes  place in the near future."    In response to a question concerning developments on the  Jordanian-Israeli track in the peace process and the siege  imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah, especially after His Majesty  King Husayn's recent meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, Dr. al-Majali said:    "Concerning the siege of al-'Aqabah, I have recently noted  that, since that meeting, no inspections have been carried out.  But is it over? We are still awaiting the final word and final  decision. We hope that we will receive word soon. There are  still some complications regarding the way matters will be  conducted. As to what extent this issue will influence the  course of events, I told you that we cannot have intensive  participation in the multilateral talks, in which the main  focuses are economic and social, at a time when we are still  under the economic pressure of the siege.    "However, in such matters, we do not believe in secrecy,  threats, or warnings. We have pursued a cultural approach. We  have participated in multilateral negotiations, but at a low  level. This is because we want the entire world to hear that we  are being wronged. I believe that the world has heard us. We  have noticed interest by all parties. A short while ago and  during the meetings, his excellency the brother [Egyptian] prime  minister clearly expressed concern over the situation to which  this siege has led. We will collectively work to make sure that  the siege will not be maintained or reimposed.    "The bilateral talks, I believe, were suspended because of  what had happened in Hebron. After the signing of Palestinian  agreement in Cairo, I believe the two cosponsors will make sure  that these negotiations are resumed. Of course, we always  believe in the need for a comprehensive solution. Therefore, we  hope that there will be progress on other tracks, besides the  Jordanian track, so that we can arrive at a comprehensive, just  solution.    "By the way, I want to answer a question that has not been  posed. Some people, misunderstanding the situation, believe that  the Palestinians have reached a separate solution. For the next  two years, it should be noted, the brother Palestinians will be  negotiating what we started negotiating two years ago. The  issue they are negotiating differs from the issues that we, the  Syrians, and the Lebanese are negotiating. Therefore, I believe  that what they have arrived at is an essential step. God  willing, this step will be so positive that they will need less  than two years and they will begin negotiations on the final  status as soon as possible so that all these tracks can move  with relatively equal pace."    On the positive steps being taken to achieve Arab  reconciliation, Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said:    "It is official Egyptian policy that Egypt welcomes Arab  reconciliation. Therefore, we have welcomed the Arab League's  efforts in this regard. Arab reconciliation has started, but we  have not reached the end. We must be frank with ourselves. We  must not bury our heads in the sand. A reconciliation must be  effected."    [Al-Majali] "If his excellency the prime minister permits me  to interrupt, I would like to say that the appropriate approach  would be to declare that we [the Arabs] will solve our  differences, but over a specific number of years [Egyptian Prime  Minister Sidqi is heard saying "exactly"]. The first three to  four years would serve as a grace period, during which we would  not raise this issue, but look for points of agreement. We  should have a collective stand on the new regional order being  planned for this region. If we can do so and put off the  differences until a later stage. Then, differences will be  examined and everyone will be told whether he is right or wrong.  This may be the key. The Arab League will then call on all  brothers to put off their differences. We cannot tell them  forget these differences all at once. [Sidqi is heard  commenting "this is impossible"] Rather, shelve them for a  while until we cross the very serious bridge lying ahead of us,  for fear that we all might be drowned."    [Sidqi] "Also, with the permission of His Excellency  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, please allow to reaffirm that this is  the best approach. We should go into this process step by step.  Sharp differences can be shelved. We can start from the points  of agreement. This is the practical and sound approach. I  believe this is the approach that is being pursued."</p>

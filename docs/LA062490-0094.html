			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ICN CHALLENGES 'CONTROVERSIAL' DRUG DESCRIPTION  </P> <P> We would like to point out that the antiviral drug ribavirin is not in itself  "controversial" (as stated in Gregory Crouch's June 16, 1990, story, "Ireland  Approves ICN's Ribavirin for Treating HIV").  </P> <P> At present, ribavirin is authorized for a variety of viral infections in over  30 countries throughout the world.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of ribavirin in the United  States in late 1985 for the aerosolized treatment of infants and young children  hospitalized with severe respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory  syncytial virus (RSV), and since that time over 65,000 babies in the United  States have been treated with ribavirin for RSV infection. In addition, 16  other countries outside the United States, including seven European countries,  have authorized ribavirin for use in the treatment of RSV.  </P> <P> For well over a decade, ribavirin has been used by some five million patients  throughout the world, without significant adverse experience. Other indications  for which ribavirin is authorized in countries outside the United States  include herpes simplex virus, influenza, hepatitis and measles and chickenpox.  </P> <P> The Army has worked extensively with ribavirin in evaluating its efficacy  against viruses. The Army's most advanced work with ribavirin has been in  testing it against the hemorrhagic fevers. An Army study conducted in 1988 in  China in conjunction with the Hubei Medical College in Wuhan, China, along with  a Centers for Disease Control study with ribavirin against Lassa Fever in  Sierre Leone, will form the basis of a new drug application the Army plans to  submit to the FDA for marketing authorization for hemorrhagic fever with renal  syndrome.  </P> <P> Ribavirin, synthesized in 1970, is scientifically well documented. Over 700  scientific papers have been published in its support. Over 5,400 patients have  participated in 139 controlled and non-controlled clinical trials with  ribavirin.  </P> <P> What the Times should have said in its June 16 article is that ribavirin was  the subject of two clinical trials in 1986 that some considered controversial  -- not that the drug itself is controversial. Surely, for example, to U.S.  infants hospitalized with RSV, patients outside the U.S. hospitalized for  severe cases of measles and to patients afflicted with hemorrhagic fevers in  African nations, ribavirin is hardly controversial.  </P> <P> JACK SHOLL  </P> <P> Corporate vice president, public relations  </P> <P> ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.  </P></p>

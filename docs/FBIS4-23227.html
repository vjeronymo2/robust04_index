			<p>BFN     [Text] Malawi President Bakili Muluzi has already returned  home from his first visit abroad since his election. He was in  Maputo for a few hours for talks with Mozambican officials.  President Chissano described the visit as one of courtesy.  Journalists who were at the airport to cover the departure of  the Malawian head of state wanted to know what solution had been  found to resolve the question of the Malawi Young Pioneers  [MYP]. President Chissano said:    [Begin recording] [Chissano] Our plan is to avoid any  friction that could lead to a violent or armed dispute,  regardless of the reasons that prompted the MYP to come to  Mozambique. They should rest assured that they may return home  in peace. The Malawian Government will receive them and give  them protection. Actually, I do not know whether they have  started to go back home. In view of the prevailing calm in  Malawi, it is possible that some of them... [pause] if they left  their country because they were afraid, it could be that they  have begun going back home. If there are other reasons, then I  cannot comment. [end recording]    Afonso Dhlakama's Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]  says it should take part in discussions about the MYP issue  because there have been accusations that MYP members are in  Renamo bases. President Chissano comments:    [Begin recording] [Chissano] Obviously, I think there is no  interest in discussing this issue because if MYP members were at  Renamo bases, Renamo would not give us proof of that. That is  not what matters. What matters is that MYP members should  return home.    [Unidentified correspondent] Do you not want to involve  Renamo in the discussions?    [Chissano] Renamo is free to contact the Malawian  Government.  If Renamo has no MYP members in its bases, than all the better.  The information we have say they are there [words indistinct]  so, it is not up to us to prove that they are there. All we can  do is to say that we have information about the MYP. What  matters for us is that MYP members return home. Their country is  willing to receive them. So, if Renamo has no MYP members, we  have no problems with that. If Renamo has them, then it should  help us to remove them. [end recording]    President Chissano said a number of Renamo members have been  involved with the MYP. He did not rule out Renamo's  responsibility over the issue. This is a controversial issue  about which President Muluzi only said that officially he had no  knowledge of the situation. Will the issue be ever known fully?    Today's talks also dealt with bilateral cooperation.    [Begin Chissano recording] We noted that it was necessary to  activate the cooperation and security commissions. The security  commission now has a different role to play because both sides  no longer suspect one another. The idea is to create peace in  the two countries and to contribute to peace in the region. The  commission will meet not only to discuss the MYP issue, but also  peace in general. The cooperation commission will discuss trade  along the border area to make it a formal activity, serving the  two sides. I have suggested that efforts should be made to  complete the last 73 km of the Nacala railroad by raising  financial assistance. The cooperation commission will discuss  other issues. [end recording]    There are prospects of good cooperation between the two  countries. President Chissano noted that past problems were  with the previous government and not with the people of Malawi.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vitaliy Chukseyev] </F>   [Text] Washington, 24 June -- It may be said that the  talks were a success, Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the  Russia Federation Government, declared on Thursday at the end of  the work of the Chernomyrdin-Gore commission and of the  Washington part of his visit. All in all, 26 agreements were  signed, providing for the development of Russo-American  cooperation in various fields.    In Washington, he said, agreements were signed that were  essentially contracts that would help to support our industries  that are currently in a difficult position. First and foremost,  the prime minister noted, there is the space industry and the  industries that back it up. Like the "Sakhalin-2" agreement,  they mean the creation of many jobs and a solution to the  financial problems. Beyond this, I am also keeping an eye on the  social issues; in other words, we shall not let any agreements  through unless there is provision in them for resolving social  issues. Take the agreements in the field of ecology and power  engineering -- here too the social sphere is discernible.    Touching on his meeting with the U.S. President Bill Clinton  on Thursday Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed that during it a very  good and positive assessment had been given of relations between  the two countries.    The ITAR-TASS correspondent asked to what extent the coming  meeting in September between the Russian President Boris Yeltsin  and Bill Clinton had been discussed during his stay in  Washington. These matters, Viktor Chernomyrdin said, had been  touched on, but a number of them can be decided only at  presidential level and not at government level. In addition it  needs to be seen how the agreements already signed will develop  and be implemented.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Three chemical companies -- Toagosei Chemical  Industry Co., Ltd. (Toagosei), Kanegafuchi Chemical Industry  Co., Ltd. (Kanegafuchi), and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc.  (Mitsui Toatsu) -- will embark on a joint project for developing  a new, energy-saving electrolysis technology that is expected to  reduce electric power costs to nearly 40 percent below the  existing ion-exchange membrane electrolysis. The group plans to  spend six years starting in FY93 and approximately &yen;500  million in the context of the efficient energy utilization  development technology-implementation subsidy system of MITI.  Medium-sized electrolyzers will be installed in Toagosei's  Nagoya Plant and Kanegafuchi's Takasago Plant for the project.  This technology originated from the basic study by Professor  Keiichi Furuya, of Yamanashi University, and was further  developed with the assistance of the Japan Soda Industry  Association. Essentially, the project appears to be a  cooperative project for all soda makers in Japan.    Japan produces approximately 3.84 million tons per year  (FY92) of sodium hydroxide. About 90 percent of this quantity is  produced by the ion exchange membrane method, which had saved  considerably more energy than the previous diaphragm process.  However, the soda industry is still among the industries  notorious for their energy-consumption.    The industry has been waiting for a new energy-saving  electrolysis technology to be developed. The process originally  developed by Professor Furuya lowers voltage to eliminate the  cause for the deterioration of energy efficiency by preventing  the generation of hydrogen, a by-product of the electrolysis.  Hydrogen is formed at the anode, and the prevention was achieved  by using a new gas-diffusion electrode. There will still be  problems with the process if it is industrialized, including the  life of this electrode.    Therefore, with a subsidy from MITI, the above-mentioned  three companies will embark on the six-year project starting in  FY93, with a budget of &yen;479 million to solve the problems of  the new technology for industrialization. The three companies  recently submitted to MITI a formal application for the subsidy  and are scheduled to begin research in December 1993. Small  electrolyzers will be installed at Toagosei's Nagoya Plant and  Kanegafuchi's Takasago Plant to study the electrode's  performances, confirm its life, evaluate its structure and  materials, evaluate the materials for the construction of the  electrolyzer, and modify or improve them as much as possible.  Based on the results of the studies, the group will design a  1.2-m-tall, medium-sized electrolyzer and will optimize the  production method for the gas-diffusion electrode. Engineering  data will be gathered with the medium-sized electrolyzer for the  industrialization of the technology.    According to MITI, in FY92, Japan's soda industry consumed  9,780 megakilowatt-hours of electric power. When the new  electrolysis technology is developed, the power consumption is  expected to be reduced by approximately 36 percent. Furthermore,  this gas-diffusion electrode is said to be broadly applicable in  the electrochemical industry, including for high-performance  cells such as fuel cells and for electroplating processes.</p>

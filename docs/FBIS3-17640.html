Several observers are convinced that the intensified  activity  of Azerbaijan's military forces at the front lines is linked  with the multilateral talks that are being held in Moscow with  the mediation of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. NKR  experts are also participating in the talks. Obviously,  Azerbaijan's leaders wish to direct a new wave of pressure on  the NKR.    The NKR Defense Army Headquarters has disclosed that bloody  clashes took place at several important heights close to  Alkhanly in Fizulinskiy Rayon yesterday. Some 38 Azerbaijani  officers and men were killed and dozens of troops were wounded  in the fighting. Azerbaijan also lost military equipment and  armored vehicles. One of its T-72 tanks and a rocket launcher  were destroyed. Two men were killed and 11 others were wounded  on the Armenian side.</p>

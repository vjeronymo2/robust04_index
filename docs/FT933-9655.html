			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Singapore poll candidate Mr Joshua Jeyaretnam, an opposition leader in Singapore, is to contest the republic's first presidential election, due to be held at the end of this month, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. Mr Jeyaretnam, a lawyer who once held senior positions in Singapore's judiciary, became Singapore's first opposition MP in 1981. An outspoken critic of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's former prime minister, and the governing People's Action party, Mr Jeyaretnam has frequently been in trouble with the Singapore authorities. In 1985 he was convicted for improper use of his Workers party funds and barred from contesting elections for five years. He was also struck off the roll of lawyers. Under Singapore's new presidential rules a three-member presidential election committee decides on the eligibility of candidates to contest an election. Two other leading Singapore figures have put themselves forward as candidates - Mr Ong Teng Cheong, now deputy prime minister, and Mr Chua Kem Yeow, a former accountant general.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGREEMENT IS SET FOR STANDARDBREDS TO TRAIN AT DEL MAR  </P> <P> Southern California harness horsemen began moving many of their standardbreds  to Del Mar Sunday after a 42-night stand concluded Saturday at Los Alamitos  Race Course.  </P> <P> The horsemen were rescued from limbo Saturday by the Western Standardbred  Assn., which had been negotiating for the state-owned Del Mar site during the  week with the California Horse Racing Board, California Thoroughbred Breeders  Assn. and the 22nd Agricultural District of Del Mar.  </P> <P> Standardbreds will be allowed to use the Del Mar race track through Feb. 2 and  remain in the barn area through Feb. 8.  </P> <P> Quarter horses take over Los Alamitos this week for a meet to begin Friday and  run through Feb. 2. Harness horses return the following week for a 10-week meet  through mid-April.  </P> <P> "Probably 600 to 700 horses from here will go down, plus another 300 yearlings  from the East," said Lloyd Arnold, president and general manager of Los  Alamitos. "The Del Mar training site is very critical. Without it, we'd be in  trouble. Horses have to be ready for opening day here.  </P> <P> "Still, we won't open here in February unless we can put on a first-class meet.  If we don't get the Pomona dates we've requested from April to August, the  horses at Del Mar will leave. Del Mar is just a holding pen until we find out  what the CHRB is going to do with our dates."  </P> <P> Los Alamitos has applied to lease dates from Fairplex Park in Pomona.  </P> <P> The Los Alamitos meet concluded with an average nightly attendance of 4,495 and  an average nightly handle of $773,985.  </P></p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Clinton moves on community service: Congress urged to act quickly on pilot scheme PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled a pilot scheme he hopes to develop into a far-reaching national service programme with the impact of the GI bill in the 1950s or the Peace Corps in the 1960s. Mr Clinton asked Congress to act quickly on a summer initiative designed to create a core group of about 1,000 leaders to spur community service programmes around the country. The pilot programme is intended to develop into a broader scheme to provide loans for university education, to be paid off by community service, which the president hopes will involve 100,000 people by 1997. He proposes that participating graduates would undertake either one or two years of direct community service, or repay the loans as a percentage of the graduate's subsequent income. The president's promise that 'in a Clinton administration everyone will be able to get a college loan as long as they're willing to give something back to their country in return' was one of his most productive themes during last year's presidential campaign. With tuition costs at US universities rising by an average of more than 10 per cent a year throughout the 1980s, the cost of higher education has become a particularly daunting prospect for the middle-income families that Mr Clinton targeted during the campaign. Budget realities, however, have forced the new president to scale back some of his ideas. The programme is now budgeted at Dollars 98m (Pounds 69m) next year, climbing to Dollars 3.4bn in 1998, as part of a broader 'lifelong learning' spending package totalling Dollars 37.8bn in 1994-97, compared with Dollars 63.3bn spent over four years in Mr Clinton's campaign manifesto. The president said in an article in the New York Times on Sunday that his national service programme would concentrate on providing young people to work in schools, immunisation clinics, police forces and environmental projects. He argued, however, that the programme could have a wider impact on a whole generation, as the Peace Corps created by President John Kennedy had for his own generation. 'At its peak, the Peace Corps enrolled only 16,000 volunteers yet it changed the way a generation of Americans look at themselves and the world,' Mr Clinton wrote. He was also due to present his national service scheme last night on a special programme on MTV, the music video channel which last year became the favourite means of targeting younger voters for both Mr Clinton and his opponent, former President George Bush.</p>

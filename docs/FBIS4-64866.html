			<p>BFN     [Text] Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany, has called upon his counterparts of  the Christian Democratic Union, Christian Social Union, Free  Democratic Party, and Alliance 90/Greens to form an alliance to  act against the radical right-wing Republikaner. In a letter  cited by the ZDF "Bonn Direkt" program on Sunday [8 May],  Verheugen suggests that the democratic parties should hold  counterdemonstrations against Republikaner election campaign  rallies in communities, cities, and rural districts. According  to Verheugen, people react helplessly time and again, by  counterdemonstrations that often end up in violence and "provoke  civil war-like scenes."    Meanwhile, Republikaner Chairman Franz Schoenhuber told a  ZDF  reporter why he is so often absent from committee meetings in  the European Parliament. He said he does not want taxpayers to  pay for the presence of a deputy who "cannot move anything  anyway" in the committees.</p>

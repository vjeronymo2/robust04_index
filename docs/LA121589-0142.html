			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET LOOK AT SDI DRAWS INTEREST, IRE  </P> <P> The 2,770-acre Capistrano Test Site in South Orange County doesn't look like  much from the front gate, and it doesn't attract much attention from its  neighbors.  </P> <P> Nestled in the dry hills above San Clemente, the TRW Inc. facility houses a  $250-million laser research project, part of the nation's so-called "Star Wars"  defense, but it is closed to the public, and no signs on the exterior of the  site give any hint about the work going on inside. Residents of the laid-back  beach community just a few miles away appear to know little if anything about  it, and local law enforcement officials say they rarely concern themselves with  it.  </P> <P> "That place is pretty quiet as far as we're concerned," said Lt. Richard J.  Olson of the Orange County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> But the same facility that draws little public notice in Orange County has  stirred interest and concern in the upper reaches of the Kremlin, where  American high-energy laser research never fails to ruffle feathers.  </P> <P> After months of discussion, 10 Soviet scientists -- led by Ambassador Yuri  Nazarkin, head of the Soviet delegation to the strategic arms and space defense  talks in Geneva -- will visit the Orange County lab Saturday, escorted by  company executives and U.S. government officials. There the Soviets will get a  look at the "Alpha laser," and it will mark the first time Soviet officials  have ever laid eyes on a Strategic Defense Initiative project.  </P> <P> American officials say that Soviet scientists picked the sprawling Orange  County facility as one of only two to visit in this country -- the other, Los  Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, is well-known to laymen and  physicists alike.  </P> <P> When they arrive, the Soviets will suit up in sterile "bunny suits" and climb  inside a 50-foot-tall vacuum chamber to behold a hydrogen fluoride, high-power  chemical laser, the kind of equipment that science fiction writers like to  weave into their tales. But while the laser may be the stuff of fiction and  fantasy, physicists say it's not much to look at.  </P> <P> "It's a big mess," said John Pike, associate director for space policy of the  Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. "It looks like what you see  in your car when you open up the hood."  </P> <P> Herbert York, a physicist at UC San Diego, who served as chief negotiator in  the U.S.-Soviet test ban talks from 1978 to 1980, agreed that the Soviets may  not be rendered breathless by their glimpse of the laser.  </P> <P> "It's a modest-sized building, and an elegant, high-tech laser, but it's  nothing that's that impressive," he said, adding that he has visited the  facility on several occasions to examine the Alpha laser. "I'm really surprised  that they would choose the San Juan facility to visit."  </P> <P> York, who heard of the Soviet visit several weeks ago, said that he first  thought U.S. officials must have picked the TRW facility because they did not  want the scientists to see more advanced research being conducted at other  laboratories, including the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near  Berkeley. That center is testing space-based "kinetic kill" systems, also known  as "brilliant pebbles."  </P> <P> TRW officials will not discuss the visit in detail, and most of the 2 1/2-half  day trip is out of public view. The Soviet team will arrive at the Marine Corps  Air Station in El Toro this afternoon and, after a brief session for reporters  and photographers, will drop out of sight for two days.  </P> <P> San Clemente officials complained that they did not learn of the visit until  reading of it in the newspaper, and other local officials said they, too, have  been kept in the dark. A Marine Corps spokesman said he has been given an  itinerary but would not release it except to confirm the arrival time and the  Saturday visit to the facility. The Soviets will be "in the area" Sunday,  officials acknowledged, but they declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> In Washington, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization at the Pentagon  referred questions to TRW and the State Department, which referred them back to  the SDIO. Montye C. Male, a spokeswoman for TRW, called the tour a  "government-to-government event. We'll provide whatever we're asked to provide,  but we really are, by design, keeping a low profile on this."  </P> <P> Local reaction to the visit was less muddled.  </P> <P> In San Clemente, which was founded by a staunch anti-communist who sought  refuge from the the Bolshevik movement of the 1920s, the spirit of glasnost  echoed in the remarks of residents and merchants along the waterfront and in  the quaint shopping centers of the 71-year-old beach community.  </P> <P> "I don't think it is a bad idea to have more communication between the two  countries, said Sandy Bushfield, owner of a pier-side sandwich shop. "I'm for  (the visit) if it makes the world a better place to live in. If we can all work  together and learn to live with one another, we can save mankind."  </P> <P> Alexander Barron, a 21-year-old construction worker, said he has been heartened  by events in Eastern Europe and the spirit of openness. "In fact, I am pretty  happy with the way things are going with the Russians," he said.  </P> <P> But Barron, along with several scientists and local officials, said he was  puzzled and annoyed by the secrecy surrounding the trip. The laser is not  classified, and once the TRW lab opens its doors to Soviet officials, many  asked, from whom are the secrets being kept?  </P> <P> Councilman Thomas Lorch, who opposed the visit, complained about what he  considers the federal government's double standard: "The local people are not  allowed to visit and be allowed to be briefed on the operation of the facility,  but the Russians can come out and get the red carpet treatment, so to speak,"  Lorch said. "This takes me aback."  </P> <P> TRW officials maintained their silence: "We at TRW have a standing policy of no  media involvement," Male said. "We have maintained a closed facility."  </P> <P> That policy will stand.  </P> <P> "I find it outrageous but not at all surprising," Pike said. "You'd be  surprised at how much information is shared between the U.S. and Soviet  governments that is not shared with the American people. . . . It's weird."  </P> <P> </P> <P> ALL ABOUT ALPHA  </P> <P> Alpha, a high-energy chemical laser under development by TRW Space and  Technology Group for the Air Force Weapons Laboratory, is a $250-million  project being undertaken as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Here are  some facts about program:  </P> <P> The laser was designed from 1980-83 at a cost of $50 million. Construction  began in 1984.  </P> <P> A four-phase test program now under way will measure power, beam quality and  other aspects of the laser.  </P> <P> The laser is made primarily of extruded aluminum. It derives its beam from a  chemical reaction. The fuels used to ignite Alpha are nitrogen fluoride,  deuterium, hydrogen and helium.  </P> <P> Alpha is now being assembled and tested under the guidance of Weapons  Laboratory officials at the TRW Corp.'s test site near San Clemente.  </P> <P> The first test in a four-phase series was in August, 1987.  </P> <P> The first partial firing was Dec. 23, 1987. Further tests are scheduled for the  next few months.  </P> <P> Source: TRW  </P></p>

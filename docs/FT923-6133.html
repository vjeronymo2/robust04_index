			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bad debts leave Bradford &amp; Bingley lower BAD DEBTS on its residential mortgage book resulted in a sharp drop in interim profits at Bradford &amp; Bingley, the seventh largest UK building society. The pre-tax line for the six months to June 30 was Pounds 38.9m, down 27 per cent on last time's Pounds 52.9m. The bad debt charge rose from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 25.7m. Mr John Smith, finance director, said that just under half the bad debts came from loans made by Leamington Spa, the loss-making building society which Bradford &amp; Bingley rescued a year ago, and the remainder from its own residential mortgage lending. 'The housing market is not making the recovery we all hoped for and these results reflect this fact,' Mr Smith said. During the half year, assets rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 12.5bn (Pounds 11.9bn); the figure was Pounds 9.84bn a year ago before the takeover of Leamington Spa. Net operating profit before provisions rose by only 8 per cent, from Pounds 59.8m to Pounds 64.8m. The society's loan book has grown to Pounds 10.1bn, against Pounds 7.91bn a year earlier and Pounds 9.53bn in December. Non-interest income was up from Pounds 27.7m to Pounds 30.6m, of which Pounds 9.6m came from insurance income (up from Pounds 9.1m). Life-backed commissions were down, but income from Peps advanced 31 per cent. Retail deposits were Pounds 8.98bn, slightly up from Pounds 8.69bn at the end of 1991. In July, the society issued Pounds 50m of permanent interest bearing shares, bring its Tier 1 capital ration to over 10.25 per cent, up from 9.52 per cent at the end of December.</p>

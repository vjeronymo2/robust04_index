The total migrant work force (in residence 6 months-13  years) was 34.4%. The studied sample was made up of 635  males;  the control group consisted of an equal number of locally born  males. The sample was then broken down into three age groups,  work categories and regions of origin. Among the many factors  considered were: education, family makeup and living conditions  (a total of 34 variables were defined). Correlation coefficients  were found between 10 subjective and objective health indices,  on the one hand, and 9 life style factors, on the other hand. It  was found that the key factors responsible for an increase in  the number and duration of illnesses, in decreasing order of  correlation with health indices, are: low education, absence of  a family, absence of earlier migrations, urban origin, low  physical activity, poor eating habits, greatest geographical  contrast from region of origin, inadequate knowledge about a  healthy life style and unsatisfactory living conditions. The  incidence of illness among these migrants was much greater than  for native inhabitants and the costs for their medical care were  correspondingly much greater. All this is particularly true for  the first three years of adaptation. Accordingly, the employment  of local inhabitants is economically far more advantageous. In  the event of a labor shortage in a particular place special  health facilities and monitoring must be made available for  those brought in from the outside.</p>

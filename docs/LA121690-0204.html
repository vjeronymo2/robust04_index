			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARMORIES OPEN FOR HOMELESS AS TEMPERATURES FALL  </P> <P> Prompted by chilly temperatures and the threat of rain, county officials opened  the National Guard armories in Santa Ana and Fullerton to the homeless Saturday  for the first time this winter.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, a dozen men and women were waiting in line outside the armory at  612 E. Warner Ave. before the makeshift shelter had even opened its doors.  Within the first hour, some 40 people from across Orange County had arrived for  a hot meal of chili, a shower and a dry bed. Another 50 people converged on the  temporary shelter in Fullerton.  </P> <P> The armories appeared to have plenty of room. Each could hold 100 or more cots,  officials said.  </P> <P> Some of those bedding down for the night in Santa Ana had been homeless for  just a day. Others said they had been living on the streets for a decade. Many  said they have been unable to make a steady living because of a history of  mental illness, while some said they began to lose control of their lives after  deaths in their families.  </P> <P> "This sure beats sleeping out in the cold in a pickup truck," said Frank  Wiercyski, 39, of Huntington Harbour, as he settled onto a green cot at the  Santa Ana armory for the night. "I had been working day jobs but today I didn't  get sent out, so here I am."  </P> <P> It was the first trip ever to a homeless shelter for Wiercyski, who, in better  times, worked as a sound and light technician for a motion picture studio  before being suspended two years ago. He said he and his girlfriend had been  trying to stretch his meager earnings from odd jobs by sleeping half the week  in motels and the other half in his pickup truck, parked behind the YMCA on  Sycamore Street in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Wiercyski said his life first took a turn for the worse two years ago when a  security guard at work discovered him using drugs. He said he was suspended  from his job and suddenly found himself unable to make a living. Last November,  his mother and father died in an automobile accident, followed by the sudden  death of his two children.  </P> <P> "It all just got to me," he said. "Finally, I tried to shoot myself but my  girlfriend wrestled the gun away from me and had me committed."  </P> <P> Nearby, dozens of men and women waited in line for shelter volunteers to heap  spoonfuls of mashed potatoes, peas and fresh fruit on their plates. Brian  Blanchard, 33, of Whittier, was one.  </P> <P> Blanchard said he has lived on the street 10 years, most recently making his  home in a vacant lot in Fullerton. He travels to Santa Ana regularly, he said,  for the free feedings at various parks.  </P> <P> "I've tried living in shelters and stuff to keep me off the streets," he said,  between mouthfuls of chili. "But none of that ever seemed to work because they  have too many restrictions on what you can and can't do."  </P> <P> Blanchard, who said he completed two years of college, has been unable to find  steady work since 1979, when his mother remarried and his stepfather kicked him  out of the house. Even if he were to find work, he said, he would not be able  to afford an apartment.  </P> <P> Although dozens of people had arrived at the shelter by early evening, shelter  officials said they had expected a larger turnout.  </P></p>

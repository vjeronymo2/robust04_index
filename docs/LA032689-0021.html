			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALK LIKE A MAN  </P> <P> Littwin is miserable in class and should do herself a favor and take private  dance lessons, where she will not be distracted to critique other members of  her class. The fact that she allows a locker key pinned to the shorts of  another class member to irritate her underscores her pettiness. Unlike Littwin,  not everyone who attends aerobics classes thinks he is perfect. Many of us  attend for cardiovascular exercise to improve as well as to maintain our  stamina and coordination. A group workout offers everyone a higher level of  enthusiasm, spirit -- and fun.  </P> <P> STEVE MATHIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Technology: Conflict in the computer market - Technically Speaking THE WORD 'proprietary' to the computer market these days elicits much the same response as 'cold war' does to the world at large. If the battle has not been won, then at least it has gone away. We now live in an open world. Unfortunately, it is not true, and it would be dangerously complacent to think otherwise. The cold war is not over, only the players and territory have changed. Open systems mean that users are not tied in to any hardware or software that will limit their future room for manoeuvre. They can select what is best for their needs, rather than what their supplier chooses to give them. The traditional enemy of open systems was the hardware supplier. Mainframe and supermini suppliers provided computers with unique operating systems. If you built your company's computer strategy on such a platform, you were stuck with it. However today, open systems users can rejoice in the knowledge that they have in the Unix operating system a stable software platform on which to build and a range of hardware from which to choose. All of the leading Unix vendors - including some of its erstwhile enemies - are now party to the Common Open Software Environment, or Cose, which aims to bring further commonality to the Unix world in such important areas as screen windowing. This is good news for the user, but it is not being done entirely for the sake of standardisation. It is also being done because Cose members see the threat to openness of the dominance of a new proprietary enemy - Microsoft. The software company has given the PC user an operating system and a range of tools and applications that dominate their markets. Microsoft's more recent product offerings - its larger applications and, in particular, the Windows NT operating environment - are set to take it into the multi-user, multi-tasking domain - the province of the Unix vendor. There is an uneasy alliance between the two sides of Microsoft's business - operating and applications software - which has given rise to anti-trust investigations at the US justice department. Rival applications vendors contend that Microsoft's ownership of Windows gives it an unfair time-to-market advantage. It is in no one's interests that the balance of power should tip towards one company. Such a shift limits a customer's ability to choose, leading to less competition and less innovation. There are already similar danger signs in the Unix-led market that Microsoft is now attacking. There is much at stake with Windows NT, Microsoft's Unix competitor, and Microsoft has said that it may alter the source code - the heart of the software - to prevent other companies from running applications in an NT-like environment. What is more, despite claims to the contrary, NT is currently not based on recognised standards. (It has, for example, no X/Open recognition - the universally recognised mark of a standards-based open system.) If Microsoft continues to ignore this issue there will be a return to the days when users were beholden to the dictates of their suppliers which would be the very antithesis of openness. There is a far more worrying threat to open systems. Novell acquired Unix Labs, which owns Unix, a few months ago. The company is determined to challenge Microsoft's dominance and it will build volume not just for Unix, but for its own Unix applications. But Novell may go further than this. One senior vice-president was quoted in July as saying, 'Unix will be proprietary'. Suddenly the idea of a closed Unix is no longer unthinkable. The computer market is intensely competitive. But unfortunately, the hard-fought principle of open systems is in danger of being lost in the process. It was users who fought for open systems; it will be users who suffer in a conflict of this kind. Bill Passmore is vice-president, northern Europe for Sun Microsystems.</p>

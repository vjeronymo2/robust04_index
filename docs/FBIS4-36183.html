			<p>BFN     [Text] The Peres letter on Jerusalem has angered political  leaders on the right of the Israeli spectrum and raised  questions in East Jerusalem. Details from Steven Pantanowitz:    [Begin recording] [Pantanowitz] There have been reactions  from leading members of the Likud and other parties further to  the right in the Israeli political arena. Likud Knesset Member  [MK] Beni Begin, who for some time has been charging that such a  letter exists, issued a statement saying that publication proved  the government was trying to lead the nation astray. He said  only a few hours before it was put out, government spokesmen  were claiming that it was merely a copy of the foreign  minister's Knesset speech in September. This is not true, Begin  said. He charged that the Israeli Government, with the  agreement of the prime minister, had given the PLO a commitment  under which the status of its institutions in Jerusalem would be  preserved without any time limit whatsoever. In so doing, Begin  said, the government had struck a substantive blow at Israeli  sovereignty in Jerusalem, and he forecast the publication of  more documents in this vein.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0400 GMT on 7 June adds  that "the Tzomet Knesset faction joins the Likud demand to have  a revote on the Cairo agreements following the disclosure of  Peres' letter. MK Moshe Peled told our correspondent Hayim  Hecht that Tzomet is demanding that the government make public  two other annexes to the Cairo agreement dealing with Yasir  'Arafat's status."]    The National Religious Party spoke of double moral standards  and a cover-up. Israel, the statement said, was abandoning its  basic positions of principles, and the government was falling  into a trap laid by 'Arafat on the way to turning Jerusalem into  the capital of Palestine.    MK Rehav'am Ze'evi, the leader of the small Moledet faction,  talked of an Israeli Government participating in another march  of folly, as he put it.    In defense of the letter, Shulamit Aloni, leader of the  left-wing Meretz coalition party, criticized the lack of  forthrightness in the affair and said it was better to tell the  truth and not to hide one's convictions.    Police Minister Moshe Shahal met last night with Faysal  al-Husayni and told him that Israel had no intention of changing  the status quo that existed in Jerusalem before the Oslo  conference. The two met after Faysal al-Husayni held an urgent  meeting of the Arab Committee on Jerusalem. Hanan 'Ashrawi, a  member of the committee, on the controversial Peres letter:    ['Ashrawi] Very clearly, the Israeli officials knew about  it, and they still persisted in a policy of undermining  Palestinian presence and Palestinian rights. So there is, in a  sense, a violation of trust. And because the letter was  supposed to be kept secret until both sides agreed -- or not to  be disclosed -- then it means that they used this lack of  disclosure in order to create facts which are prejudicial to  Palestinian institutions.

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Perry tumbles 47% to Pounds 2.23m PERRY GROUP, one of the UK's largest motor dealers, has maintained its dividend in spite of a 47 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.23m for the year to December 31. Mr Richard Allan, chairman, said the 9p dividend - which has been maintained since 1988 - was just covered. 'We are confident that when the economy improves profits will improve significantly,' he said. Mr Allan added, however, that so far there had been no signs of a pick up. Losses in contract hire and new car sales clipped both profits and sales, which fell by 8 per cent to Pounds 301.1m. The new car division had reversed from a profit of Pounds 597,000 in 1990 to a loss of Pounds 233,000 last year. Contract hire reported a Pounds 750,000 loss beacause a large number of customers went into liquidation and returned fleet cars. On the brighter side, Perry's remaining four divisions reported record results. Used car profits - which account for about 23 per cent of the total  -rose by 20 per cent, the parts division increased its contribution by 18 per cent, the body and parts operations by 14 per cent and the service business by 4 per cent. Mr Allan said Perry's had experienced mixed results from its seven Ford dealerships, although the parts depot had performed well. Perry, which has a total of 30 dealerships, claims about 3 per cent of Ford's UK sales. During the year, the group spent Pounds 2.9m on new dealerships, including a Nissan outlet. Mr Allan said that figure would be reduced to Pounds 1m in 1992. 'We are cutting back until we are happy the recession is behind us,' he said. Gearing rose from 24 per cent to 32 per cent, although the chairman said 1990's figure had been helped by a last minute property deal. Earnings per share tumbled from 17.2p to 9.2p. The proposed final dividend is maintained at 6.25p.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Letter: Go-between urgently needed to resolve Russia's 'Falklands' Sir, Edward Mortimer's article, 'Cost of Russia's Falklands' (March 25), made an important suggestion to world leaders about solving the northern territorial problem between Japan and the former Soviet Union. Both countries have discussed the problem for a long time and have entered a cul-de-sac. The other day, the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, said 'Japan is regarded as one of our allies', but he will surely hesitate to take a bold step to solve the problem, considering the pride of the nation and the practical gains of the inhabitants on four islands. Although the Okinawa islands were returned to Japan through the direct talks between Japan and the US, the relationship between Japan and Russia is so complicated historically that the northern territorial issue cannot be solved easily by direct negotiations. So, a geo-political solution is desperately needed with the help of a go-between like Mr James Baker. Regrettably, we are not pleased to co-operate with Russia to rebuild that country until the spine between two countries is pulled out. Masayuki Tomimoto, 5-48-28 Mukonoso Amagasaki, Japan 661</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: MONEY CAN'T BUY LOVE -- JUST ASK SALLY AND AGA  </P> <P> THE AGAS go gaga! Remember Sally Croker Poole, the beautiful former model who  became the wife of the fabulously rich Aga Kahn, spiritual leader of 12 million  Ismaeli Muslims, 20 years ago? Now all of Europe is abuzz with the story that  Sally and the Aga Kahn are on the verge of divorce.  </P> <P> The Begum, once regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the world, spent  her recent 50th birthday alone in Switzerland. Her three children, ages 19, 18  and 15, are in school or traveling. As for the Aga, he spends his time, as he  has for the past five years, with gorgeous Pilar Goess, a 32-year-old Austrian  model. The Aga sees his wife only when he must make an official appearance  before his followers.  </P> <P> It is expected there will be a quiet divorce in the not-too-distant future.  Whether Pilar, who sports a $1-million pink diamond on her left hand, will  become the next Begum, is anyone's guess.  </P> <P> BRYANT GUMBEL of the "Today" show is certainly stepping out into public life.  Last week he appeared at the big Council of Fashion Designers fashion tribute  in New York and gave out an award. Now comes word that Bryant will be master of  ceremonies on June 2, when the Friars Clubs pay tribute to Diana Ross as  Entertainer of the Year. This event happens at the Waldorf Astoria in New York,  and the lure of Ross is expected to pack the place to the rafters. The occasion  will also mark the 85th anniversary of the New York Friars Club.  </P> <P> MICHAEL WINNER, the director, persuaded that wonderful British actor John  Cleese to put in an unbilled guest appearance in Winner's upcoming "Bullseye,"  which stars Michael Caine and Roger Moore. He came upon Cleese quite  unexpectedly in Barbados, where "Bullseye" was wrapping production and where  Cleese vacations every year. I guess basking in the sun on the beach in  Barbados lowers an actor's resistance.  </P> <P> ADVANCE WORD on "State of Grace," Phil Joanou's movie based on the Westies gang  and Gambino family, is that the film will hit very close to home and pull no  punches in its shocking tale of murder and terror in New York's Hell's Kitchen.  </P> <P> The movie has a knockout cast that includes Ed Harris, Gary Oldman and Sean  Penn. "State of Grace," which filmed in New York City under unusually tight  security, opens this summer.  </P> <P> PERHAPS LESLEY-ANNE Down won't be able to lift "Dallas" back to its glory days  of ratings supremacy, but for now, at least, the British beauty is adding some  much needed spice and glamour to the granddaddy of nighttime soaps. Down looks  ravishing -- better than she has for some time -- and she's quite effective  playing a high-powered PR woman. She comes off like a softer version of Joan  Collins.  </P> <P> And "Dallas" has more good news. They've invited the divine Alexis Smith back  to reprise her role as that very soigne madwoman, Lady Jessica. (She kidnaped  and attempted to murder Miss Ellie a few seasons back.) Well, maybe "Dallas"  will make a ratings comeback, now that it has all this delicious womanpower  behind it.  </P></p>

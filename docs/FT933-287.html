			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (20): Pensions chain 'helps to create new jobs' / A look at the new private funds PERUVIANS intent on visiting the central Lima office of Integra, one of the country's eight new private pension funds, are obliged to press their way past a thicket of street hawkers, shoeshine boys, newspaper vendors and makeshift food stalls. These members of Peru's black economy, the so-called 'informals', are one of the biggest obstacles in the path of the government as it tries to set up a national private pension scheme. Unlike Chile, which established its successful system in 1981, Peru has had to design its scheme in the knowledge that most of its population, many of them slum-dwellers or peasants living high on the Andean plains, are beyond the reach of pension funds, private or otherwise. Mr Jaime Caceres, executive president of Integra, agrees that Peru's scheme is not, at least at first, likely to be as all-embracing as that of Chile, which obliges all workers to pay 10 per cent of their salary into private pension funds, or AFPs. Nevertheless, he argues, the 2m Peruvians who are now being encouraged to swap from state to private pensions should provide a large enough base for the new system to take off. Between the end of June, when the AFPs began to operate, and mid-September, a total of 275,000 people switched to the new funds, according to Mr Augusto Mouchard, the AFP superintendent. Many of these had lost their faith in the near-bankrupt state system, which provides pensioners with a pittance in return for a lifetime's contributions. It has been estimated that the state scheme, which should hold Dollars 14bn, has been left with only Dollars 350m after years of hyperinflation and government diversion of funds. Mr Mouchard expects 600,000 to 800,000 people to join an AFP in the first 12 months, investing funds of at least Dollars 200m. In five years, he says, AFPs could control Dollars 2-3bn. The hope is that these funds will kick-start Peru's underdeveloped capital markets, providing much-needed cash for struggling industry. Chilean pension funds, which have amassed more than Dollars 12bn in a decade, have provided a stable institutional base that has triggered tremendous growth in the size and sophistication of the domestic market. 'There is a simple chain,' says Mr Caceres. 'New funds lead to new investments which help to create new jobs. This, in turn, produces more funds.' The AFPs, he argues, will play a crucial role in 'reactivating the economy'. Mr Mouchard agrees that, as AFP resources grow, their investments will have a snowball effect. He expects the system to begin to draw in people currently outside the formal economy. 'This is a way of formalisation,' he says. The process will not be easy. An impediment is likely to be a shortage of investment opportunities for new institutions in a country with a small, volatile stock market and few investment vehicles such as corporate bonds. Only weeks after the AFPs began to operate, the government was forced to change investment limits - raising that of fixed term bank deposits to 60 per cent - because of a lack of alternatives. A commission, set up to assess the risk of corporate bonds and stocks, had not started work by August, forcing the government to restrict these types of investment. Mr Mouchard insists that the new limits, brought in for 60 days, are only temporary. He believes that the presence of institutional funds will create the impetus for investment opportunities. 'Above all, the AFPs will provide the stability that any emerging market needs,' he says. 'Most of the large companies in Peru are getting ready to issue bonds,' says Mr Caceres. 'In time, there will be more financial instruments to buy.' He is not alarmed at the current paucity of investment opportunities. 'Our funds are going to grow little by little so we don't need everything in place today.' The AFPs, whose number is likely to rise as professionals such as teachers and engineers establish their own funds, are strictly regulated. Mr Caceres says he must supply daily details of investments to the superintendent. Pension fund contributions must be kept totally separate from the running costs of the business. The superintendent even has the right to screen AFP advertisements before transmission. The Peruvian state will not guarantee minimum benefits, unlike in Chile, where private pensions that fall short of an agreed level are topped up by the government. However, AFPs whose performance is well below the average of other institutions will be forced to make up the difference from their own reserves. No Peruvian will be obliged to opt out of the state pension system which the government has promised to maintain. Those who do, however, will be rewarded with a state bond, calculated according to age and recent earnings, and a one-off pay rise. Peru's scheme is attracting much international interest, with companies such as Aetna and Citibank of the US and the Dutch insurance group ING taking out stakes in AFPs. All eight private pension funds have had input from Chilean counterparts. 'Every day more and more people are convincing themselves that, whatever the risks, they will lose nothing by leaving the state system,' says Mr Caceres. However, even he is cautious of making long-term predictions. 'No-one in this country can tell you what's going to happen in 10 years. It all depends on the development of the economy in general.'</p>

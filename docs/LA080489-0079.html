			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS' 6-3 VICTORY CAPS OFF A ROUGH DAY FOR GIANT ROOKIE SWAN  </P> <P> This was not in rookie pitcher Russ Swan's dreams. Not even his bad ones.  </P> <P> Recalled from triple-A Phoenix to help rescue the sickly San Francisco Giants  pitching staff, Swan was racing to catch a morning plane to Los Angeles  Thursday when he was pulled over by a policeman. He was handed a speeding  ticket for going 57 m.p.h. in a 45-m.p.h. zone. When he finally reached the  airplane, his seat had been filled.  </P> <P> "It was insane," Swan said. "I get called up to the big leagues, and I can't  go."  </P> <P> Swan caught the next flight, reassured by a television report that said he  wouldn't start for the Giants until Saturday. He arrived at Dodger Stadium for  Thursday night's game at 5:10 p.m.  </P> <P> The Giants met him with a smile, then told him not to believe everything he  heard on television. They told him he was starting in two hours.  </P> <P> "I walk in the dugout, and (Manager) Roger (Craig) says, 'Hurry up,' and I  said, 'What?' " Swan recalled. "When they called me up, I didn't even know  whether I would be a starter or a reliever. And now I'm starting. It was a  shock."  </P> <P> His shock, not to mention his problems with speed, were just beginning.  </P> <P> Staked to a 3-0 lead on Kevin Mitchell's 34th homer in the first inning, Swan's  major league debut was bombed by Dodger feet and bats in a 6-3 Los Angeles  victory before a crowd of 43,516 at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Swan gave up an unearned run in the third inning when Jose Gonzalez sprinted  all the way home from first base on a five-foot bunt and an error.  </P> <P> Swan was hit for four more runs in the fourth on Eddie Murray's first triple of  the season, a two-run shot, and Mike Marshall's seventh homer of the season.  </P> <P> "I had the adrenaline going, but it was a weird day," said Swan, 25. "I don't  know what I was thinking."  </P> <P> His uncertainty was all the Dodgers needed to win their second straight game  from the National League West leaders.  </P> <P> The Dodgers moved within 11 1/2 games of first place. Athough they are still  tied with Cincinnati for fourth, this is closer than they've been since July  14.  </P> <P> "I don't like our chances, but I think there's still a chance," said winning  pitcher Orel Hershiser, noting there are still nine games remaining between the  Dodgers and Giants.  </P> <P> "Maybe if we can take two out of three from them in two more series, and then  sweep another one, we could get back in it. But then you never know what  Houston and San Diego are going to do."  </P> <P> Hershiser was coming off a bout with the flu that caused him to miss  Wednesday's game. Interestingly, the last time he missed a day with the flu,  July 17, he pitched a four-hitter against Chicago the next night.  </P> <P> Against the Giants, he scattered seven hits over seven innings.  </P> <P> After the first inning, during which Mitchell's homer followed singles by Ken  Oberkfell and Will Clark, Hershiser retired 17 of his final 21 batters. He  improved his record to 13-8, and he is on a second-half roll. In six starts  since the All-Star break, Hershiser has gone 5-1 with a 2.25 earned-run  average.  </P> <P> The losing pitcher was Swan. He had started the season at double-A Shreveport  before being recalled to Phoenix, where he went 3-3 with a 2.49 ERA. He was  hurried to the big leagues Thursday because of disabling injuries to starters  Rick Reuschel and Atlee Hammaker.  </P> <P> He didn't allow a hit in the first two innings. But he gave up his first major  league single to Gonzalez leading off the third. Then he got his first taste of  major league trouble.  </P> <P> One out after Gonzalez's hit, Hershiser successfully bunted him to second base.  But Gonzalez, perhaps the fastest Dodger, was not content with just second. He  crossed the bag and headed for an uncovered third base without breaking stride.  </P> <P> Flustered second baseman Oberkfell threw the ball to an equally flustered  shortstop Jose Uribe, who was trying to beat Gonzalez to the bag. The race  didn't matter when Oberkfell threw the ball into left field. Gonzalez scored  easily.  </P> <P> Such speed is uncommon around these parts, considering that the Dodgers entered  the night ranked 10th in the league in stolen bases and 11th in triples.  </P> <P> "I wanted to pick it up, to get people going," Gonzalez said. "Sometimes the  other team sleeps, you never know. I see nobody on third and look at the guy  covering second and I think, I can beat him to third."  </P> <P> Murray also showed some of that speed in the fourth inning, stealing his third  base of the year. However, Murray has been most overwhelming with his hitting  lately. He has eight hits in his last 23 at-bats (.348) with three homers and  11 RBIs, putting him among league leaders with 64 RBIS.  </P> <P> Thurday's win was nailed down, as usual, by Jay Howell, who gained his second  save in two nights and 22nd save of the season with two scoreless innings. He  has allowed one run in his last 26 1/3 innings and overall has yielded just  five runs in 57 1/3 innings for an 0.78 ERA.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Kal Daniels missed his second straight start in left field and will undergo a  testing today on his right knee, which was surgically repaired in May. Losing  Daniels would be a big blow to the Dodgers, as he has hit in nine of 11 games  since joining the team from Cincinnati, going 13 for 38 (.342) with two homers  and eight RBIs. . . . San Francisco starter Atlee Hammaker, who was carried  from the field on a stretcher Wednesday after spraining his knee on a slide at  second base, will undergo arthroscopic surgery this weekend. He will miss at  least four weeks.  </P> <P> San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos visited Dodger Stadium Thursday night to research  ideas for a new downtown stadium, which he formally proposed last week to  replace Candlestick Park. "We have talked about a 30-year stadium lease, and  some people think that 30 years is the life expectancy of a stadium, but look  at this place," Agnos said of Dodger Stadium. "This place is 28 years old and  it's so nice, you can eat off the aisles. The Giants wanted me to see this  place so I could speak with authority and passion about what a baseball stadium  should be like." Agnos said that his idea for a stadium, which will be brought  to a public vote in November, includes a right-field fence bordering San  Francisco Bay. Home runs could land in the water. "I told Will Clark we would  change his nickname to 'Will the Spill,' " Agnos said.  </P> <P> Tom Lasorda, reflecting on his 2,000th game as the Dodgers' manager Wednesday,  said: "I could hardly believe it when somebody mentioned it to me," Lasorda  said. "To be around that long, I could not have done it without a good boss.  Thank God for the O'Malleys."  </P></p>

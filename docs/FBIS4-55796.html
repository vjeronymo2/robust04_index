			<p>BFN     [Text] A short time ago the Council of Ministers Press  Center disseminated the view of Prime Minister Lyuben Berov on  the debates in the National Assembly and the tasks facing  parliament during the next few days.    The prime minister of the Republic of Bulgaria declared once  again that the government has invested and continues to invest  much effort in maintaining a parliamentary majority that will  support the cabinet, without any change to its formula of a  cabinet of experts entrusted with addressing the most important  national tasks: combating inflation, fighting crime, settling  the foreign debt, and other priority tasks.    However, with great regret, Prime Minister Berov noted that  changes have evidently occurred in the positions held by the  parliamentary groups, which until now have supported the  cabinet. The prime minister intends to attempt once again to  achieve a unification of the parliamentary groups that are now  in opposition to one another, so as to conclude the most  important tasks on which work has begun, which any Bulgarian  Government is bound to complete without fail. If the prime  minister fails to achieve this before 25 May, he will consider  that his mission of preserving political equilibrium in the  country has been exhausted. He is firmly convinced that unless  this is achieved, Bulgaria is on the road to early parliamentary  elections.</p>

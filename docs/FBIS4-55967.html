			<p>BFN     [Text] Zvornik, May 24 (TANJUG) -- Tensions are rising  between the Bosnian Croats and Moslems, who dispute over  territories in many parts of Bosnia, said sources close to the  top-level officials of the Bosnian Serb army (VRS). The sources  specify that tensions are most intense in central Bosnia, in the  regions of Mostar, Gornji Vakuf, Prozor, Vitez and Vares.  Moslems and Croats have obstructed the transport of  humanitarian aid, banned refugees to return, and made many other  similar actions.    The Bosnian Moslems and Croats continued fierce fighting  during the last year for the territories with mixed population  in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina until they abruptly  reconciled in March. The Serb side has learned about more  frequent Moslem-Croat armed incidents, which threaten with  conflagration of war. Material destruction of facilities,  including religious buildings, continues on both sides.    It is pointed out that, despite preparations of both  leaderships to solemnly inaugurate a new Moslem federation on  May 30, agreed under strong U.S. pressure, both people and local  authorities of the two sides are becoming convinced that it is  impossible to live in a new community. Both Moslems and Croats  secretly pile up food, fuel and ammunition reserves.    In such a situation, the U.N. peacekeeping forces do their  best to prevent atrocities and large-scale clashes from  spreading and intensifying which could annihilate the Washington  accord on a Moslem-Croat federation, the VRS sources say. The  sources point out thtat inter-Moslem clashes continue in the  autonomous province of western Bosnia (APZB), in the far west of  the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is  estimated that these clashes may escalate. The APZB was  proclaimed by advocates of a peaceful settlement in Bosnia.    It was pointed out that units loyal to the Moslem government  in Sarajevo have massively displaced population from the  outlying sections towards the APZB. This fact is more than an  obvious sign that forces loyal to the Moslem leadership in  Sarajevo will launch a large-scale attack against the defenders  of the APZB, the VRS military sources explain.</p>

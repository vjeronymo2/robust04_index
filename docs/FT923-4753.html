			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Discount rate cut rumours lead Nikkei to 4.5% gain RUMOURS of a discount rate cut prompted a rally in the futures market, and the Nikkei average surged 4.5 per cent on arbitrage-linked buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 798.77 higher at 18,386.49, having drifted down in the morning session to a low for the day of 17,396.43 on position adjustment by dealers. A sharp rise in futures prices on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange prompted arbitrage-linked buying and the index rose as high as 18,461.66 in the afternoon. Volume increased to 500m shares from 417m. Buying by dealers and investment trusts led the activity, while most domestic institutions remained on the sidelines. Rises led declines by 727 to 276, with 120 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 47.74 to 1,396.79, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.85 to 1,131.06. Speculation that the Bank of Japan would cut the official discount rate resurfaced. Activity was also spurred by unconfirmed rumours that public pension funds would start investing in the stock market next week, and that trading margins for futures trading would be reduced. Traders said the response to such positive rumours reflected the underlying bullishness. 'Share prices are managing to disregard downward earnings revisions by companies and gloomier forecasts for the economy,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, rose Y20 to Y390. Dealers and individuals traded the issue on reports that an affiliate had developed a new ceramic engine. Other automakers were firm, too, with Honda Motor up Y60 to Y1,300 and Mazda Motor gaining Y32 to Y470. Mazda said it would cut executives' bonus payments and that it was considering a large-scale restructuring programme. Ricoh, the office equipment maker, climbed Y60 to Y707. Investors were encouraged by prospects of an early recovery in earnings. Banks were strong on active buying. Industrial Bank of Japan forged ahead Y230 to Y2,770 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y200 to Y1,920. Nomura Securities was also actively traded, adding Y120 at Y1,640 on hopes of an earnings recovery due to the recent market upturn. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 441.34 to 19,846.23 in volume of 15.3m shares. Rohm, the semiconductor equipment maker, appreciated Y110 to Y2,000. Investors have been encouraged by its restructuring efforts. Roundup THE REGION was not immediately susceptible to Tokyo's improving mood. HONG KONG had one of its quietest days in weeks, turnover dropping from HKDollars 2.66bn to HKDollars 2.01bn as the Hang Seng index lost 11.99 to 5,722.46. HSBC led the actives list and shed 50 cents to HKDollars 55.50 on news of a warrants issue by Nan Fung, helping to push the finance sub-index down 34.45, or 0.7 per cent, to 5,195.87. AUSTRALIA came off the day's lows on a good showing by transport group Brambles. The All Ordinaries index ended 2.2 off at 1,526.3 in turnover of ADollars 253m. Although Brambles' net profits fell 6.2 per cent to ADollars 180.2m, this was at the high end of expectations. Brambles rose 72 cents to ADollars 15.50. Another highlight was Santos, up 11 cents at ADollars 2.58 after announcing an ADollars 2.70 a share bid for gas producer Sagasco, valuing it at ADollars 560m. Sagasco was flat at ADollars 2.75. TAIWAN finished lower in volatile trading after heavy profit-taking emerged in the late morning. The weighted index ended 45.12, or 1.2 per cent, down at 3,888.49 and turnover rose to TDollars 28.6bn from TDollars 24.4bn. SEOUL inched higher as late-afternoon institutional buying pulled the market off the day's lows. The index gained 1.20 at 563.94 in turnover of Won446.1bn, after Won462.5bn. BANGKOK saw afternoon profit-taking and the SET index closed just 1.00 up at 763.42, although turnover grew from Bt8.89bn to Bt9.69bn. Thai Airways, which rose Bt5 to Bt58 on Wednesday, opened at Bt60 and climbed to Bt63 before coming off to finish at Bt58.50. KUALA LUMPUR did respond to Tokyo, the KLSE index rising 4.79 to 577.71 as its finance index added 41.15 at 2,258.70 on institutional support for the sector leader, Malayan Banking, and other established banking stocks. BOMBAY reversed an early decline to close with the BSE index 38.96 ahead at 3,079.53 on rumours that the government would soon restrict forward deals in dollars, indicating that full convertibility of the rupee was imminent.</p>

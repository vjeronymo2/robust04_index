			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / MMC warns retailers about misleading CD 'hit' lists The UK music industry was yesterday cleared of overcharging for compact discs, but retailers were told to explain that the charts in their windows often listed hits they wanted to sell rather than those already sold. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, in a long-awaited report on the music industry, said the way some retailers compiled their music charts was misleading. The commission found that several retailers, including market leader WH Smith and its Our Price subsidiary, based their charts on predicted rather than actual sales. The commission added: 'We were also concerned to learn that WH Smith had in the past charged record companies for inclusion in the chart.' It said it was 'unacceptable to display a chart which might well have the effect of misleading consumers'. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday that he had asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, to seek assurances from retailers that they would specify at the point of display how their charts had been compiled. The misleading charts were the only sour note for the music industry in a report which otherwise acquitted it of overcharging for CDs, an accusation levelled persistently by the Consumers' Association and by the House of Commons national heritage committee. The national heritage committee last year called for a cut of at least Pounds 2 in the dealer price of CDs. It said the music industry had given no adequate explanation of why CDs cost less in the US than in the UK. The Commission said, however, that the price of CDs was determined by what consumers were prepared to pay. It said that industrialised countries other than the US generally had higher CD prices than the UK. The Commission said the CD price differences between the US and the UK largely resulted from different tax arrangements. Sales taxes in the US were lower than the UK's 17.5 per cent value added tax rate. Full price popular CDs were on average only seven to 9 per cent more expensive in the UK than the US. The Consumers' Association called the report 'astonishingly complacent'. Mr Stephen Locke, the association's policy director, said: 'The toothless watchdog that is the MMC has come up with yet another weak and muddle-headed report . . .The losers are consumers.'

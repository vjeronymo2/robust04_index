			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Pakistan enters uncertain period - Equities following the government's dismissal Pakistani stocks have entered one of their most uncertain periods due to concern over the country's political and economic future after last week's fall of Mr Nawaz Sharif's 29-month long government. Although the Karachi stock exchange yesterday inched ahead, reversing earlier expectations of a steep fall, that in itself has not ended speculation that the market will become increasingly bearish during the next three to five months. The KSE-100 index closed yesterday at 1,098, but still remains some 147 points below the start of the year. That fall reflects both the newly emerging pressures on the market and a downward trend which has continued for more than a year. The market took its biggest drop in a single day this year on April 19, when the KSE index lost some 3 per cent, after President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Under his administration economic reforms and fiscal incentives for businesses were initiated. The reforms in turn were widely believed to hold the key to greater confidence in the market which, for the first time, saw the entry of an increasing number of local and foreign investors. Mr Farooq Leghari, the new finance minister, assured business leaders in Karachi this week that the reforms would not be reversed and that there would be further economic liberalisation. However, many observers say they will only accept such assurances from the new government that will be appointed after elections scheduled for July 14, rather than the present interim administration. The present government's efforts to restore political stability have suffered a setback, due to signs of an internal split. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, is at odds with President Khan and Mr Balakh Sher Mazari, the prime minister, over the future of Pakistan's four provincial assemblies. Ms Bhutto is demanding the dissolution of the provincial legislatures after last week's dissolution of the national assembly. But both Mr Khan and Mr Mazari are opposing her. Some observers fear that the split could lead to Ms Bhutto's colleagues withdrawing from the interim government. Among those to leave could be Mr Leghari, the finance minister, who is among her closest supporters. Regarding the economy the most pressing concern is that of a worsening budgetary deficit this year which is expected to be in excess of Rs100bn (Dollars 3.8bn), compared with an earlier target of Rs65bn (Dollars 2.5bn). In addition, a recession in the textile sector, especially in spinning, has caused additional uncertainty over textile shares, which make up almost one-third of the 643 companies registered on the stock exchange. Mr Arif Habib, president of the KSE, agrees that there is an uncertain climate, which would only go away once a new government was elected. 'When a government changes, investors have apprehensions about its future policies,' he comments. But Mr Nasir Ali Shah Bukhari, a leading broker, while accepting the bearish trends, expects some selected companies to remain good buys. He recommends companies which present good opportunities for medium to long-term growth, where new investments at present are expected to yield good profits when the market recovers.</p>

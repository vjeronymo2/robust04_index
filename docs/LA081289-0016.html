			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY'S FIGHT FOR POLITICAL SURVIVAL  </P> <P> As an elected official, particularly one who serves on no private boards of  directors nor as a paid consultant to any firm, I read The Times' articles  (Aug. 6) on Mayor Bradley with more than passing interest.  </P> <P> But I should point out that The Times' list of city-provided benefits, which  included the use of a rent-free municipal mansion in Hancock Park, omitted the  "possessory" tax paid directly by the mayor.  </P> <P> Since the 1850s, California has had a law that requires someone benefiting from  the use of public property while not actually owning it to pay a possessory  tax, which is assessed by my office.  </P> <P> Last year, the mayor was sent, and paid, a $1,077.44 possessory interest bill  in lieu of a property tax. We have about 10,000 possessory assessments in  effect throughout the county.  </P> <P> JOHN J. LYNCH  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Assessor  </P></p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Explanation of what will do the trick Sir, Two sound bites still echo from Labour's debate on the economy. First, shadow chancellor Gordon Brown's commitment to 'use every possible measure' to achieve full employment. And, second, GMB general union leader John Edmonds's obvious point that the 'minimum wage is meaningless without full employment'. Clearly, Brown must tell the electorate whether he thinks investing in skills and increasing the capacity of the economy are sufficient measures to achieve full employment without pay inflation. If he does, then presumably he thinks the UK's increasingly flexible labour market will curb pay inflation (as the economy moves towards full employment), an inheritance which he must credit the present government for. However, if he does not think that a combination of investing in skills, boosting industrial capacity and highly flexible labour markets will do the trick, perhaps he might explain the 'measure' which will.

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> "A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story" was a realistic and disturbing story  of spousal abuse. Dale Midkiff and Nancy McKeon were riveting in their  portrayals of abuser and victim. Such productions are few in number yet  valuable and substantial in their impact on public awareness. Midkiff and  McKeon are to be lauded for their contribution.  </P> <P> Jeannette R. Nemon, Woodland Hills  </P></p>

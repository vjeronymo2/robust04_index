			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAMUEL'S SINGLE IN 10TH GIVES DODGERS VICTORY  </P> <P> The Dodgers clinched second place in style Tuesday night before 22,883 at  Dodger Stadium, while the San Diego Padres added another lousy night to a  chilling season.  </P> <P> It took 10 innings, but the Dodgers defeated the Padres, 8-7, after a wild  comeback in the eighth and a game-winning rally in the 10th. The Padres remain  tied for fourth with Houston.  </P> <P> The Dodgers needed just four batters in the 10th inning against Craig Lefferts  (7-5). Mike Sharperson led off with a single to right, Eddie Murray came next  with another single to right and Hubie Brooks was intentionally walked to load  the bases. Juan Samuel followed with a single to center, scoring Sharperson  with the winning run.  </P> <P> It all looked so easy against a pitcher with whom the Dodgers have had loads of  trouble. Lifetime against the Dodgers, Lefferts was 9-0 with five saves and a  2.04 earned-run average. But on this night, the Dodgers weren't to be  restrained by the usual.  </P> <P> Trailing by four, 6-2, with two out and none on in the bottom of the eighth,  the Dodgers suddenly came to life. They scored five runs on a walk, four  singles and an error to take the lead.  </P> <P> The shenanigans started when Padre starter Dennis Rasmussen walked Jose  Gonzalez, and then wild pitched him to second. Mike Sharperson followed with a  single to center, allowing Gonzalez to score to bring the Dodgers to within  6-3. Rasmussen went to a full-count on the next batter, Eddie Murray, before  Murray lined a single to left, sending Sharperson to third and Padre Manager  Greg Riddoch to the mound. Exit Rasmussen; enter Lefferts.  </P> <P> No matter. Hubie Brooks lined Lefferts' first pitch into right field, allowing  Sharperson to score and Murray to take third. Juan Samuel followed with a  grounder to second, but Joey Cora bobbled it and then threw it away. Murray  scored, Brooks went to third and Samuel made it to second.  </P> <P> Up stepped Mickey Hatcher, pinch-hitting for reliever Jim Gott. He laced a  single into right, scoring both Brooks and Samuel. Lefferts then struck out  Offerman, but it was too late. Dodgers, 7-6.  </P> <P> So what happens? Jay Howell, who replaced Gott, got two quick outs on the  Padres -- and then the Padres staged a two-out rally of their own to tie the  game.  </P> <P> Jack Clark -- who was eligible because he decided to appeal a one-game  suspensiion earlier in the day -- Joe Carter and Mike Pagliarulo singled  consecutively, and, presto, it was 7-7.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> First baseman Jack Clark decided to appeal his one-game suspension. He was not  in the starting line-up Tuesday -- the day he was to serve the suspension --  but he was available to pinch-hit. National League President Bill White  suspended Clark for one game Monday because of an incident in San Francisco  last Wednesday during which Clark was ejected and subsequently picked up and  threw first base. White will likely rule on the appeal during the off-season.  If the suspension is upheld, it will take place next season. . . . The Padres  have lost another player for the season. Pitcher Greg Harris left the team --  with Manager Greg Riddoch's permission -- before Monday's game to be with his  family in North Carolina after the death of his grandfather.  </P></p>

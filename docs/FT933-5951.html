			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Japanese coalition split on priorities DIVISIONS appeared yesterday in Japan's coalition government, as Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, was told by a coalition partner not to be distracted by economic and foreign policy at the expense of political reform. Mr Kazuo Aichi, director of policy for the Japan Renewal party (JRP), said the government had promised to complete a reform of the electoral system by the end of this year, and Mr Hosokawa must devote his energies to this cause. 'The cabinet was formed to introduce political reforms. I don't think we have the time to deal with other issues,' said Mr Aichi. His answer reflects the difference in emphasis between Mr Hosokawa and the JRP, formed by defectors from the Liberal Democratic party, who see the present coalition as having a mandate only to introduce electoral changes. Some JRP officials say the coalition is temporary and oppose the ambitions of Mr Hosokawa to deregulate the economy, confront Japan's war history, and discuss a fine-tuning of US relations. The joint leader of the JRP, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former backroom operator at the LDP, made clear that he does not expect the coalition to have a long life by proposing that his party work towards the creation of a two-party system. 'This (the coalition) is not the final form. The establishment of the coalition was one step toward breaking up collusive politics, in which politicians lie and yet manage to get away with skirting responsibility,' Mr Ozawa said. However, Mr Ozawa said the coalition should attempt to end the practice of permitting bureaucrats to answer questions in parliament on behalf of cabinet ministers, who are often not well enough prepared to discuss their portfolio. Meanwhile, an independent MP, Mr Shoji Shinma, was indicted yesterday for misrepresenting details of his education during an election campaign for the Upper House.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 7 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Police sources  report that approximately 60,000 Dominicans protested today in  Cotuy, 140 km northeast of Santo Domingo, against the fraud  allegedly perpetrated in the 16 May general elections.    Several civic organizations in Cotuy called residents to a  general work stoppage -- the first of several protest actions  planned by the Dominican opposition and in which more than 50  percent of the population participated.    According to reports, public transportation was scarce and  only a few stores conducted normal operations during the strike.  Nevertheless, no serious incidents were reported.    Reports of serious irregularities during the elections have  delayed the proclamation of a new president.    Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential candidate of the  opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party, today threatened to  call a general strike if current President Joaquin Balaguer is  proclaimed the winner.    Pena Gomez declared: "The illegal proclamation of Balaguer  would unleash all kinds of protests, including a general strike.  It would not be necessary, however, to resort to violence.  Peaceful resistance would suffice." He added, "We will  paralyze entire cities and provinces."    Pena Gomez has repeatedly claimed that the Central Electoral  Board permitted "a colossal and blatant fraud" in the May  elections in the Dominican Republic.</p>

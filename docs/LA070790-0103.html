			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Jose Sulaiman, president of the World Boxing Council, testified in New York  that promoter Don King never asked him to overturn the outcome of Buster  Douglas' heavyweight title victory over Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> Asked by King's attorney, Alan Unger, if the promoter had asked for a rematch,  Sulaiman said: "I think he did.  </P> <P> I heard him during the time of the press conference. But I'm not sure."  </P> <P> Sulaiman said he personally favored an immediate rematch, but the WBC Executive  Council has ruled that Douglas should first make a mandatory defense against  Evander Holyfield.  </P> <P> Sulaiman testified on the fourth day of King's breach-of-contract suit against  Douglas and his manager, John Johnson. King also is suing the Mirage Hotel and  Casino for allegedly inducing Johnson to sign a contract with the Mirage to  fight Holyfield.  </P> <P> Douglas, Johnson and the Mirage have sued King for breach of contract in  federal court in Nevada, but that suit has been stayed pending the outcome of  the New York trial.  </P></p>

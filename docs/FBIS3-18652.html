However, he takes the view that as long as  the EU's fisheries policy remains unchanged, Iceland should  remain firm on its decision to stay outside the EU.    The political reactions in Iceland to the membership  agreements are characterized in part by fears of growing  isolation, but several politicians are also stressing that  Iceland as a small island nation with an 80-percent dependency  on fishing can best satisfy its special interests through  bilateral agreements. Foreign Minister Hannibalsson wants thus  to strengthen Iceland's position in relation to the EEA  [European Economic Area] and the Common Market through a free  trade agreement with the United States.    Bjorn Bjarnason, chairman of the Althing Foreign Affairs  Committee, said that the enlargement of the EU will not lead to  immediate changes to Iceland's foreign policy.    "The EEA agreement fully meets Iceland's need for access to  the European market. On the other hand, Iceland will not of  course have the same potential to influence the decisionmaking  processes in the EU as the other EFTA countries. The Icelanders  will therefore be obliged to revise their attitude to possible  future EU membership the next time the doors are opened, but  this will not happen for some years," Bjarnason said.</p>

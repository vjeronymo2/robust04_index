			<p>BFN     [Text] At its Thursday's session the Russian Government  decided to organize control over the implementation of the  package of economic decrees signed by President Yeltsin recently.    Addressing the session, First Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets  stressed that real life in Russia "overtakes the processes of  law-making," and that the "package of presidential economic  decrees" is designed to "resolve problems that piled up largely  in the area of finances and material production skillfully and  gradually."    According to Soskovets, the "essence and the content" of  Boris Yeltsin's decrees connected with reforming state-owned  enterprises, taxation policy, quotas and other issues "pursue  only one goal -- to put the country's economy in order."    "Many provisions in the package of the president's decrees  conflict with the present legislation, and some of them give  rise to amazement," countered the chairman of Russia's Central  Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko. He called for convening a special  government session to analyse and discuss the decrees.    However Gerashchenko's call failed to find support, and  participants in the government session approved the draft  resolution which contains a system of concrete measures designed  to monitor the implementation of presidential decrees.</p>

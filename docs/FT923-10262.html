			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danish farmers stand to lose Pounds 430m from drought THE TWO-month drought that hit Denmark from mid-May onwards will cost farmers DKr4.7bn (Pounds 430m) in lost income from the sale of grain, peas and oilseed rape, the National Plant Breeding Centre said yesterday. This means that reduced returns from these crops alone will cut farmers' income from the sale of arable crops by almost 40 per cent. The harvest from spring-sewn rape will be cut by 65 per cent, spring barley, oats and peas by 40-45 per cent and winter barley and wheat by a quarter, according to the centre. The impact of the drought varies substantially from region to region, but the average income loss will be about 35 per cent, it estimated. Denmark exported 2.7m tonnes of grain, worth just over DKr3bn, in 1991, but in the current harvest year it will be necessary to import grain. This will cut into the country's trade and current balance of payments surpluses, but both are currently substantial. The surplus on merchandise trade in 1991 was DKr22bn and the current account surplus was DKr14bn.</p>

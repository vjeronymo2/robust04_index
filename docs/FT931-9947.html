			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / French right plans state sell-offs: Two opposition parties unveil manifesto for March elections TAX reforms and state spending cuts, and an estimated FFr50bn (Pounds 6.25bn) worth of privatisations over three years are promised in an election manifesto presented jointly yesterday by France's two centre-right opposition parties. Greeted as 'empty, vague and worrying' by the ruling Socialists, the programme is less sweeping than that of the previous right-wing government in 1986-1988 and reflects the opposition's limited room for manoeuvre at a time of slow growth and monetary instability. 'Clarity, change and prudence,' were the key words, said Mr Francois Bayrou, UDF secretary general. The opposition alliance, fighting as UPF or Union for France, is set to win the elections, on March 21 and 28, by a record margin, with around two-thirds of the seats in the national assembly, according to recent polls. Yet the manifesto does little to reconcile splits between the pro-European UDF and the Gaullist RPR, half of whose national assembly deputies voted against the Maastricht treaty on European monetary and political union last year. On monetary policy, the future French government says it will present plans in the spring to make the Bank of France independent and do all that is needed to support the franc. It proposes a joint Franco-German monetary initiative 'so as not to lose the achievements of 13 years' co-operation in the EMS'. This is likely to antagonise the anti-Maastricht faction in the RPR. On privatisation, the UPF plans to sell all state-owned banks, insurers and industrial companies operating in competitive markets. An independent agency will set share prices and select stable shareholders for the privatisation candidates. A significant amount of shares will be reserved for private investors. State monopolies, like telecommunications, electricity and gas, and transport, will be opened to competition and their equity capital will be gradually opened to outside investors. The privatisation programme is far less ambitious than that of the last right-wing government, estimated by Mr Edouard Balladur, finance minister of the time, at FFr140bn; a reflection of the fact that today's stock market conditions are poorer. On the domestic economy, the manifesto promises a job creation drive, through a 'pact for jobs' between companies and regions to boost training and recruitment, to be rewarded by lower social security and other charges. In addition, tax breaks are on offer for small businesses. Taxes overall must come down, especially for the middle classes, one-man businesses and to help research and training, it says. It promises tax and other incentives - including a large public works programme - for construction and housing. On the government's finances, the UPF plans to reduce the budget deficit - officially estimated at FFr184bn last year - by FFr110bn over the next three years, according to Mr Alain Juppe, the RPR's secretary general. Of this, FFr30bn to FFr40bn would come from spending cuts, FFr15bn from the impact of growth on tax revenue, and the rest from privatisations.</p>

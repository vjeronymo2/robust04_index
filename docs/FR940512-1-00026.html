			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah proposes to add new language to its judicial review of rules and orders provisions at UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;30 by adding new language to require that (1) judicial review of adjudicative proceedings is governed by Title 63, Chapter 46b, of UAPA and provisions of Chapter 10 consistent with UAPA and (2) judicial review of the Board's rulemaking procedures and rules adopted under Chapter 10 is governed by Title 63, Chapter 46a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act. Utah also proposes to revise recodified subsection (3) to require that an appeal from the Board's order will be directly to the Utah Supreme Court and to revise recodified subsection (4) to require that an action or appeal involving the Board's order will be determined as expeditiously as feasible by the Utah Supreme Court in accordance with subsection 78&hyph;2&hyph;2(3)(e)(iv). Finally, Utah proposes to delete existing subsection (3) pertaining to review of the adjudication of the district court and add new language at subsection (5) to specify that, if the Board fails to perform any act or duty that is not discretionary, the aggrieved person may bring an action in the appropriate district court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes to repeal UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;4, ``Mined land reclamation provisions applied,'' Utah Code Annotated 1953, as enacted by Chapter 145, Laws of Utah 1979. Utah also proposes to repeal UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;31, ``Chapter's procedures supersede Title 63, Chapter 46b,'' Utah Code Annotated 1953, as enacted by Chapter 161, Laws of Utah 1987. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes to add new language requiring that UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;11(5) and UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;17(2)(t)(ii) are repealed effective September 30, 2004. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes the following revisions to its plan provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes to revise UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;25 pertaining to lands and water eligible for reclamation by deleting, as a priority for the expenditure of AMLR funds, existing subsection (2)(d), which pertains to research and demonstration projects relating to the development of surface mining reclamation and water quality control program methods and techniques, and adding new requirements for eligible lands and water to include lands and water left in an inadequate reclamation status and which meet the criteria of subsection (4) (a) or (b). Utah proposes to allow AMLR funds to be used for reclamation or drainage abatement at sites (1) where operations occurred during the period beginning August 4, 1977, and ending before January 21, 1981, and where funds pursuant to a loan or other form of financial guarantee or from any other source are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site and (2) where operations occurred during the period beginning on August 4,1977, and ending on or before November 5, 1990, and where the surety of the mining operator became insolvent during that period, and as of November 5,1990, funds immediately available from proceedings relating to the insolvency, or from any financial guarantee or other source, are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site. Utah proposes to require that, in determining which sites to reclaim, priority be given to those sites in the immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have an adverse economic impact upon a local community. Finally, Utah proposes to provide that (1) surface coal mining operations on lands eligible for remining do not affect eligibility for reclamation and restoration after the release of the bond or deposit for the operation, (2) when the bond or deposit for a coal surface mining operation on lands eligible for remining is forfeited and the amount of the bond or deposit is not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement, AMLR funds may be used for reclamation, and (3) regardless of the provisions above that pertain to operations on lands eligible for remining, the Director of the Division can expend monies from the abandoned mine reclamation trust fund for any emergency requiring immediate reclamation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes to revise UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28, recovery of reclamation costs and liens against reclaimed land, by adding new language at subsection (1)(a)(ii) to require that the sale price for land reclaimed using reclamation funds that is sold to a State or local government for public purposes, may not be less than the actual cost of purchase of the property by the State plus the costs of reclamation. At subsection (2)(a), Utah proposes that a lien shall not be placed against reclaimed land where the surface owner owned the land prior to May 2, 1977, and neither consented to nor participated in nor exercised control over the mining operation that necessitated the reclamation work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Comment Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h) and 884.15(a), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program and plan approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15 and 884.14. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Utah program and plan. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

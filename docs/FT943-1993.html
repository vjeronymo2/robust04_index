			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: London coffee futures up again, but below highs - Market Report London COFFEE futures ended firmer yesterday but below almost nine-year highs hit during the day on talk of dry weather in Indonesia and underlying concern over lack of rain in Brazil, dealers said. The November position at the London Commodity Exchange closed Dollars 15 higher at Dollars 4,055. The day's peak of Dollars 4,130 was the highest second position price since January 10, 1986, when Dollars 4,194 was reached. 'Sporadic reports have been emerging of damage to the (Brazilian) trees,' said the GNI trade house. 'However, because of the dry spell it seems as if most trees are late developing flowers, and that they will be better placed to withstand dry weather for a few more weeks.' The overnight rally in GOLD was maintained as investment funds bought the metal in New York, triggering stop-loss buying and pushing London's afternoon fixing to an 8 1/2 -month high of Dollars 393.90 a troy ounce. Jumps in North American gold stocks started the rally late on Monday, most noticeably on the Philadelphia gold index, which jumped about 5 per cent, and in Toronto, where the gold stock sector increased in value by 1.55 per cent. At the London Metal Exchange ALUMINIUM prices resumed their uptrend following the announcement of a big fall in exchange warehouse stocks. Despite disappointment at International Primary Aluminium Institute provisional figures indicating a rise in production in August the three months price closed at Dollars 1,616.50 a tonne, up Dollars 14 on the day.  --------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  --------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium         -13,675  to  2,369,375 Aluminium alloy       -20  to     25,740 Copper               -775  to    368,050 Lead                 -375  to    368,000 Nickel               -210  to    142,068 Zinc               -1,375  to  1,233,975 Tin                  -140  to     32,265  --------------------------------------- Compiled from Reuters</p>

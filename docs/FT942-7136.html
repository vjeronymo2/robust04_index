			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (6): Cruel contrasts - Social affairs Brazil is a country of cruel social contrasts: from the Manhattan-style skyscrapers of Sao Paulo's financial district to the poverty of parts of the north-east, which can rival sub-Saharan Africa. While the country is one of the world's largest agricultural exporters, many millions of people are thought to go hungry. While developing a first world banking system to cope with the country's chronic inflation, more than half the population earns too little to open an account. 'Capitalism in Brazil only works for 20 per cent of the population, the rest live on the margins,' says Mr Herbert de Souza, a sociologist and the driving force behind a successful anti-hunger campaign. The 'Citizen's Action' campaign led by Mr de Souza won the support of millions of Brazilians, from managing directors to shop assistants, in providing basic foodstuffs to the extremely poor. Now, he wants to broaden the campaign, which is administered by local volunteer committees, to fight for jobs, health, education and land reform. It is a tough challenge. Brazil has one of the most unequal wealth distributions in the world - the poorest fifth of the population receive about 2 per cent of the income. Brazil has not even experienced the limited land reforms of countries such as Mexico. The plight of the rural poor has led to massive urbanisation since the 1950s and the springing up of 'favela' shanty towns around cities. Taquaril is a favela on the eastern outskirts of Belo Horizonte, a city of 2m in the south-eastern state of Minas Gerais. Taquaril was originally built by the local council to house 1,800 families in 1987. That number has now more than doubled following unofficial occupation of nearby land by desperate newcomers. Some of the homes are built of cardboard and tarpaulin and perch precariously on geologically unsafe hillsides. Many lack electricity and most are without proper sanitation. Before a regular bus service was introduced, residents who worked in the city centre often faced a four-hour walk home. Youngsters ended up sleeping in the centre and drifting into crime, says Mr Walter Gomes de Sanson, leader of a recently-created community association. Another resident, Mr Paulo Roberto Martins, arrived in Taquaril with his family six years ago because, he says, he could not survive on the agricultural wages paid in the Gov Valadares area, 450km north-east of Belo Horizonte. He now works as a concierge, earning about Dollars 100 a month. 'I'm lucky I have a job,' he says. Shanty town residents are among the most extreme signs of Brazil's marginalised population; a huge underclass with little access to proper health care, education or other public services. They are victims of a state that tries to do too much and ends up doing too little, according to Dr Antonio Carlos Gomes da Silva, superintendent of Sao Paulo's Hospital das Clinicas, the largest hospital in Latin America with nearly 2,000 beds. Mr da Silva criticises the 1988 constitution, drawn up after more than two decades of military governments. The constitution places heavy responsibilities on the federal government for provision of services but does not say where the resources will come from. Mr da Silva, along with many business leaders, believes Brazil's low tax base should be widened and the tax system simplified. He also wants measures taken to reduce fraud in the health service as well as productivity contracts with employees. Funding problems for public health are made worse by a complicated system, involving transfers of revenues from the federal government to the states and municipalities and by a shortage of hospital beds in some regions. This means the government must pay private hospitals to treat public sector patients, creating rich territory for overcharging and corruption. Analysts say the underfunding of the public health service is a critical problem and government spending per capita fell from Dollars 80 in 1989 to Dollars 44 in 1992, according to the Ministry of Health. In public education, funding is also a problem and the sector is, like health, dominated by low salaries and frequent strikes. However, Brazil has made large progress in providing basic education in recent decades. In 1950, about a third of seven- to 14-year-olds had access to public education. By 1990, that had risen to 88 per cent. However, the problem has been that many pupils do not complete primary education and, as with all Brazilian social indicators, regional differences are extremely marked. For example, in Alagoas state in the north-east, the illiteracy rate is 45 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the wealthy south eastern state of Rio Grande do Sul. Mr Jose Goldemberg, an academic and former education minister, notes that the state spends an average Dollars 300 a pupil in basic education, compared to several thousand dollars per student in public universities. 'In every country the elite takes care of its own,' he says. Brazil's fragmented political system means that no single party can control Congress and that strong economic interests, ranging from landowners to government-owned companies, have entrenched positions in Congress and can block reforms. But Mr de Souza, while admitting he is often dismayed by the antics of politicians, believes that there has been a new awareness of the country's problems, as shown by the reaction to the anti-hunger campaign. 'The elite has not yet noticed this change but it exists, and is being expressed through non-governmental organisations, grass roots groups and progressive local councils,' he says.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Broadcastle returns to the black Broadcastle, the USM-quoted company which provides leasing, hire purchase and deposit taking facilities to the financial services sector, achieved a turnround from pre-tax losses of Pounds 96,000 to profits of Pounds 155,000 in the half year to June 30. Losses for the full 1991 year totalled Pounds 400,000. However, the results are not directly comparable, Mr JF Hampson, the chairman, said, because of the closure of the recruitment division. Turnover halved to Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 2.68m). Earnings per share emerged at 0.48p against losses of 0.38p.</p>

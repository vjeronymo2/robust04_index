			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by own commentator: "(3) On Strengthening </F> Propagandistic and Ideological Work Under the New  Circumstances--Efforts To Shape and Bring Up a New Generation"]    [Text] China is in the process of entering a new historical  era. Strengthening ideological work, nurturing and raising a new  generation, fighting for the realization of the socialist  modernization projects, these are arduous, but also glorious and  important tasks to be accomplished at the propaganda and  ideology front.    Since last year, we have seen some exemplary personalities  emerge in Henan Province, such as Zhang Huanli [1728 3883 4409],  Xu Honggang [1776 3163 0474], and Yao Cihui [1202 2945 2585].  Their shining achievements of unselfishness, their energetic  pursuit of progress, and their ideological brilliance in  arduously pioneering new undertakings reflect the main theme in  the spirit of our time. In their unselfish contributions toward  the prosperity of the country, in their efforts to restore and  support an atmosphere of morality, in risking their lives for  the just cause, they are the backbone of our nation and models  for human conduct. All the people of China's central plain are  proud of them. Emergency of such personalities is inseparably  linked to their being nurtured by the party and nourished by the  people. Essentially, this is indeed the strategy of "grasping  with both hands [simultaneous pursuit of two tactics]" that has  been unswervingly implemented by the party committees at all  levels throughout Henan Province since the 14th CPC National  Congress, as it is also the rich fruit, brought to fruition in  intensified ideological-political work. It also tells us that  ideological-political work in the new historical era is still a  mighty force. As long as it is conducted in all earnest, it will  certainly bring good results.    Adhering to the party's basic line, building up a strong,  modern socialist country, translating into reality the guiding  ideology set forth by the provincial party committee, namely of  "uniting in vigorous advance, bringing prosperity to Henan  Province," and realizing its strategic objective of "one high,  one low," entails as the one most pressing problem the need to  raise talents in the next generation. The more exemplary  personalities, such as Zhang Huanli, Xu Honggang, and Yao Cihui,  will emerge, the more cohesive will our society be, and the  better shall we be able to inspire a larger number of people to  unselfishly contribute to our cause. Strengthening ideological  work and nurturing and shaping the new socialist generation, is  an urgent demand that evolves from the general tasks of the  party in the new era, as it is also a project of vital  importance for generations to come. Whoever truly hopes for the  accomplishment of the four modernization projects must devote  all his energy to the nurturing of talents in the next  generation. Whoever is sincerely concerned about the fate of  state and nation, must double his or her efforts in  ideological-political work, to ensure and promote the healthy  upbringing of the new generation.    Of foremost importance in intensified ideological work is  instilling a lofty spirit in people. The lofty spirit mentioned  here is the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, as  Comrade Mao Zedong had advocated long ago. It is the spirit of  "having ideals, a moral conscience, culture, and discipline," as  repeatedly emphasized by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. It is also the  64-word pioneering spirit in Comrade Jiang Zemin's summing up of  the new era. It manifests the excellent work style of the  communist person, as it also is indeed the traditional morality  of the Chinese nation, passed on through generations. It is  coalescence of valuable experiences gathered by our party in the  protracted struggle of the past, as it has also fresh  characteristics of our new era. It is a powerful spiritual  pillar in the construction of socialism with Chinese  characeristics. One fundamental task of ideological work is to  show itself capable of applying this kind of a spirit in the  shaping of the new generation, in spurring them on to exert  themselves and fight for the basic interests of the Chinese  nation, and to make unselfish contributions.    In strengthening ideological work, attention must be paid to  its goal-oriented nature. In the last few years, there has been  some relaxation in ideological work, and some curtailing of such  work, in some places and agencies. Money worship, hedonism, and  extreme subjectivism have grown up and spread, and have  seriously polluted the people's mentality. To cope with this  situation it is necessary to launch ideological-moral education  among the masses, especially among the youths, an education in  which patriotism, collectivism, and socialism are core content,  to launch an education of arduous struggle and of building up  the country through hard work and thrift, an education of  professional ethics, of social morality, and education in the  fundamentals of the national condition, also education in the  rule of law. In all these areas, particular emphasis should be  placed on the concepts of ideal and belief. Realizing the four  modernization projects is the common ideal and common belief of  all nationalities of the Chinese nation at the present stage.  Whether there exist this ideal and this belief, whether this  ideal and this belief have been unshakably established, is not  only decisive for the work and life attitude of the individual  concerned, but also for his capability of deciding between good  and evil. In his statement on the "four necessary qualities,"  Comrade Deng Xiaoping places ideal at the top. It is absolutely  necessary for us to guide the people, especially our youths,  toward the formation of correct ideals, beliefs, world outlook,  outlook on life, and value concepts, and to have them oppose and  reject the intrusion of every kind of decadent and degenerate  ideology.    Most important task in the strengthening of ideological work  is the education of our youths. Focal point in nurturing the new  socialist person, whether viewed in its immediate aspect or in  its more remote impact, is the education of our youths. We must  pay attention to the particular characteristics of youth,  differentiate between different targets, and adopt diverse  methods. We must be apt at opening up channels, pay attention to  the development of democracy, respect the human individual,  understand the human individual, show concern for and provide  encouragement for the human individual. We must adopt a method  of attracting widest participation by the masses, a method of  having the masses themselves teach themselves, the method of  discussions in complete equality, the method of criticism and  self-criticism. We must educate and help our youths toward  gaining a lofty spirit, so that they may become reliable  successors in the cause of socialist modernization.    Strengthening ideological work is a matter for the entire  party to be concerned with. It is not to be merely undertaken at  the propaganda and ideological front, but is to be undertaken by  the party committees at all levels and by the basic party  organizations in enterprises and industrial units, in the  villages, schools, and neighborhoods. The various administrative  agencies, as well as labor unions, All-China Women's Federation,  and the Communist Youth League also bear heavy responsibility in  this respect. All discipline and law enforcement agencies are  certainly also not excluded here. We all must jointly shoulder  the heavy historical task and exert ourselves in the struggle  effort of nurturing the next and every succeeding generation of  socialist new persons who shall possess ideals, morality,  culture, and discipline.</p>

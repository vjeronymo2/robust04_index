			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Olivetti falls 2.6 per cent as it passes 1990 dividend BOURSES had a sensitive look about them yesterday, reacting both to company news, and to speculation about impending results or rights issues, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN saw particular weakness in Olivetti ahead of the announcement of its 1990 results after the market's official close. The Comit index fell 3.95 to 589.22 in thin volume before today's holiday. Olivetti dropped L101 or 2.6 per cent to L3,769 on strong fears that the 1990 dividend might be halved or worse, omitted. After the market closed the computer company reported a 70 per cent drop in net profit and passed the dividend. Dealers said that although Milan would be closed today, the shares could come under severe selling pressure in London since Olivetti has a listing on Seaq International. Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, Cir, dropped L25 to L2,635. Generali lost another L400 to L37,500. Three state-controlled banks said they had bought Generali shares recently. PARIS was enlivened by a busy oil sector and resisted poor March trade data. The CAC-40 index ended 0.20 higher at 1,782.03 but volume was thin at FFr1.45bn. Oil shares were boosted by sparkling first quarter earnings reports from US oil companies on Tuesday. Total, which has considerable refining capacity in the US, surged to 12-month high of FFr766 before easing to end FFr28 or 3.9 per cent higher at FFr756 on heavy volume of 251,800 shares. Dealers spoke of genuine buying interest, although they added that there was also talk of an imminent rights issue. Elf rose FFr6.60 to FFr343 with 152,000 shares traded. Among the second-liners, L'Oreal rose FFr16 to FFr565 with 87,420 shares traded while Synthelabo jumped FFr58 or 7.34 per cent to FFr848, the bigrenewed speculation that L'Oreal was about to sell its stake in it. FRANKFURT ended firmer, but off its highs with the DAX index 6.68 higher at 1603.73 after a rise of 2.16 to 678.92 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume moved up from DM6bn to DM6.1bn but financials, carmakers and energy stocks were flat, leaving chemicals, a few retailers and some steels and engineers to give the market its modest lift. Ms Barbara Schumacher, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, thought that the market was just ticking over. Like other professionals, she has seen the DAX attack the 1,600 to 1,620 level a number of times this year, only to fall back. Many foreign institutions, she said, have been underweight in Germany for some months and seem to be happy in that position. That means no big sellers to test, and perhaps prove market improvements in real volume. Profit-taking took IG Farben down DM1.10 to DM27.90, after its DM3.20 rise on Tuesday on east German property compensation prospects. It was thought that the gains in steels and engineering, with Hoesch up DM7 to DM274, Thyssen DM5 to DM227.50 and Klockner-Werke DM4 to DM155, might reflect rotation of compensation speculation out of chemicals and carmakers, and into the heavy end of the industrial economy. ZURICH featured a SFr240 rise to SFr5,190 gain for Sulzer after the engineering company said that it planned to open its share register to foreigners. However volume in Sulzer remained limited; a 20 per cent stake in the company is owned by the troubled Omni Holdings, and 10 per cent by Omni's former chairman, Mr Werner Rey. Sulzer also said that profits could drop in 1991. After a rumour of a rights issue for CS Holding, the parent of Credit Suisse, took its shares down SFr70 to SFr2,110, the Credit Suisse index closed 0.9 higher at 555.7. AMSTERDAM had a volatile session, starting off on a strong note then drifting lower only to recover in the afternoon on the back of a respectable opening on Wall Street and surprisingly strong results from Akzo. The CBS Tendency index closed up 0.1 at 95.5. Akzo closed Fl 5.20 better at Fl 117.30 with 138,523 shares traded after reporting higher than expected first quarter earnings earnings per share of Fl 4.33 compared with Fl 4.54 in the same period last year. Market forecasts had ranged from Fl 3.00 to Fl 3.30. Dealers also spoke of a large buyer in the stock. MADRID saw heavy trading in Hidrola, the utility, with around 2m traded. The price closed Pta14 higher at Pta591 on the prospect that it will merge with Iberduero. Iberduero finished Pta3 lower at Pta722. The general index closed off 0.18 at 281.32 in low volume of Pta10.8bn. OSLO continued to slide in thin volume, the all-share index falling 6.40 to 466.13 in volume of NKr186m.</p>

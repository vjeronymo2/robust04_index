			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Few takers for Europa rights issue EUROPA MINERALS, the UK mining and finance house, has received acceptances for only 15.9 per cent of the 85.1m new ordinary shares on offer in its 9-for-4 rights issue. The 71.5m shares not subscribed for will be taken up by the sub-underwriters at the issue price of 5p each. Existing Europa shareholders acting as sub-underwriters will take up some 30 per cent of the offer. The Pounds 3.97m rights issue was launched at the end of May after a boardroom upheaval which led to Europa's three non-executive directors being replaced by two executive directors of Austmin, a small Australian mining company which is Europa's biggest shareholder. On taking up its rights Austmin's stake in Europa was expected to increase from 14.5 per cent to between 18 and 20 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] We received by fax the following communique from  the Constitutional Court:    Today the plenary meeting of the Constitutional Court  discussed and pronounced on the constitutionality of the  following laws:    Law on the Organization and Functioning of the Romanian  Radio  Broadcasting Company and the Romanian Television Company:  Noting that the provisions of Article 52, Paragraph 2 of the  law run counter to the constitutional regime of control exerted  by Parliament on the public administration -- since they ignore  the preparatory nature of the activity carried out by the  parliamentary commissions, in their capacity as working bodies  of the chambers to which they belong -- the Constitutional Court  declared these provisions as unconstitutional.    Law on the Agricultural Income Tax: The Constitutional Court  noted that the dispositions of Article 22 of the law, which are  to become valid as of 1994, are unconstitutional, since they  violate the constitutional principle of the retroactive nature  of the law. Consequently, it was decided that, within the  procedure of reexamining the law, one should correlate the  deadlines envisaged by Article 5 and Article 9 of the law with  the actual date of the law's validation, in case Parliament  decides that the law should be implemented this year. Regarding  the uncultivated fields referred to in Article 2, Paragraph 2 of  the law, the text was declared constitutional only to the extent  that it does not apply to uncultivable fields. The stipulations  of Article 1, Article 8, Paragraph 1, and Article 16 of the same  law were declared constitutional.    Law on War Veterans and Certain Rights of War Invalids and  Widows: In view of the provisions of Article 16 Paragraph 1 of  the Constitution regarding the equal rights of citizens, the  Court declared Article 2, Letter B -- dealing with the  requirement that the claimant should not have fought against the  Romanian Army -- as unconstitutional, since the recruiting and  mobilization of the individuals mentioned by the text of the law  were compulsorily done in the Romanian territories temporarily  occupied during the 1940-1945 period. By virtue of the same  principle of all the country's citizens being equal before the  law, the Constitutional Court declared Article 2, Letters A and  C as well as Article 7, Letter B, Thesis 1 -- which define the  quality as war veteran -- as unconstitutional.    In the same session, the Constitutional Court put the final  touches to the examination of the constitutionality of the rules  of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate and pointed out the  provisions that run counter to the Constitution. After the  Court's decisions are edited, they will be published in  MONITORUL OFICIAL, Part 1.</p>

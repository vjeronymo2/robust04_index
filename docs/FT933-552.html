			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (15): How Donald got trumped  -Richard Lambert feels a twinge of sympathy for an '80s icon / Economics/Industry LOST TYCOON: THE MANY LIVES OF DONALD J. TRUMP By Harry Hurt III Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99 447 pages DONALD J. Trump may never have existed. Rather than a flesh and blood figure, he was perhaps the creation of a marketing genius who managed to introduce a brand name to a class of products - real estate, casinos - that had never been branded before. The result, for a while, was a triumph. As Fortune magazine once wrote of The Donald: 'That name indisputably adds value.' It went on: 'There is undeniably a Trump mystique. Some people love him, others despise him, but everybody talks about him. He has become a cult hero for many people around the world who seem to regard this flamboyant billionaire as the most heartening example of the American dream come true since Ross Perot.' The brand was built on a unique blend of money and chutzpah. Take the yacht, for instance. The Trump Princess, 282ft long, featured among other things a helipad, a 16-seat main dining room with a gurgling waterfall, chamois ceilings and onyx shower stalls. The hotels were classy too, if you liked pink marble. There were just two problems with this approach, but they were big ones. The first was that the Trump name was subject to the law of diminishing returns. It was one thing to be associated with a glossy new tower block on Fifth Avenue, the home of kings and movie stars. But a fleet of clapped-out Boeing 727s running the shuttle service between New York and Washington was another matter. The second big problem was that The Donald's generous life-style depended on an endless river of cash, and that in turn rested with those nice folks at Citibank and the Chase Manhattan. When things started to get sticky for them in the late 1980s, the Trump brand rapidly lost its allure. If The Donald wasn't a zillionaire, he was nothing. Lost Tycoon is one of those biographies that is in perfect harmony with its subject: tacky, and a little overweight. Its author's previous bestseller was called Texas Rich, and there is no denying that this latest oeuvre is strongly flavoured with soap. Adjectives spray around like machine gun fire: 'A short, sharp tongued, hard drinking Jewish gaming industry gadfly in his late fifties, Glasgow, whose birth name was Jerry Segal, came from a moderately wealthy family whose money he had invested in a variety of ill-fated ventures in the concrete industry.' And so on. The narrative is divided into three parts - 'The Crash', 'The Art of the Spiel' and, simple but to the point, 'Best Sex Ever Had'. It's rich with recreated dialogue and startling insights, such as the detailed account of an event which, according to The Donald, never happened: the removal of his surplus fat by a plastic surgery technique known as liposuction. 'The procedure. which takes a little more than two hours, is similar to coring Swiss cheese.' By the closing chapters, the reader begins to feel a strange and unsettling sensation: sympathy for The Donald. Can he really be that dreadful? And could someone with the intellectual, emotional, moral and personal shortcomings described here really have succeeded in building an empire - even one as fragile as the Trump Organisation? One of the few really intriguing moments, in my UK edition at least, comes in a footnote which bears the heavy imprint of the lawyers, and which for no apparent reason ends in mid sentence: 'As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness which he normally' . . . and then nothing. The editors seem overcome with emotion at this point, since the next few pages are splattered with errors. Trump was a great brand name for New York in the late 1980s. For the austere 1990s, though, we need something different. Instead of a plump American, better to go for a lean, hard Hispanic. A warrior figure, leading a small but ruthless band of mercenaries who are ready to sell their swords to the highest bidder. You could call him something like Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. But the marketing men had better hurry. This brand name might have an even shorter shelf life than The Donald's.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / International Company News: French insurance group returns FFr241m profit GARANTIE Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires (GMF), the French insurance group, produced a net profit of FFr241m (Dollars 45.6m) last year. This was after making a FFr29m provision for a tax levied by the French government on the insurers for the care of victims of HIV, the virus which causes the AIDS disease. GMF is comprised of a group of mutuelles - state-controlled companies that provide financial services, including insurance and banking, for public sector employees. The GMF group also has a controlling stake in FNAC, the largest record retailer in France. FNAC is now locked in a battle with Virgin, the British retailing group, in the French music market. Mr Jean-Louis Petriat, the flamboyant businessman who chairs both GMF and FNAC, told the annual meeting at Strasbourg this weekend that GMF had increased its turnover in 1991 by 3.2 per cent to FFr6.4bn and that the number of policy holders had risen by the same percentage to 2.92m.</p>

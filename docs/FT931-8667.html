			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Inflation 'may breach government target' INFLATION may rise above the government's target of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent by the end of this year, an independent think tank said yesterday. The forecast, in the latest quarterly report from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, comes a day after the Bank of England warned that interest rate cuts could threaten the government's inflationary goals. According to the report the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest payments - the measurement taken by the government for underlying inflation  -will be 4.6 per cent higher in the last quarter of this year than in the same period last year. The figure for the final quarter of 1994 is 4.7 per cent. That is considerably higher than the government's goal for underlying inflation of less than 2 per cent by the end of this parliament. The index including mortgage interest payments will be 5.1 per cent higher in the last quarter of 1994 than in the same period this year. The report's economic growth projections are more optimistic than the government's most recent forecast of 1 per cent for this year. The institute says the economy will grow by 2 per cent this year. The report predicts that unemployment will continue to rise and peak at 3.2m in the first quarter of next year. The institute, which is headed by Mr Andrew Britton, one of the 'seven wise men' on the Treasury's recently formed advisory panel, recommends that the chancellor should present a 'neutral' Budget in March. Although tax increases might be necessary in December, the report says, they should be avoided next month. It adds: 'If the economy develops as our central forecasts predict, then we must expect to be recommending increases in interest rates by this time next year.' As a result of devaluation, the report predicts that average import prices will be 12 per cent higher this year than in 1992, representing a key inflationary pressure. Sterling is expected to sink further against the dollar in the short term, although the report also predicts a slight rise against European currencies next year. The report's forecasts for the public sector borrowing requirement are similar to the those of the government: borrowing is expected to reach Pounds 37.8bn in 1992-93, rising to Pounds 43.4bn in 1993-94. Concern is also expressed about the way responsibility for combating inflation is divided between the government and the Bank of England.

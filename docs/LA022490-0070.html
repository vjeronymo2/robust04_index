			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A QUICK HALT TO THE SPRAYING IS UNLIKELY;  </P> <P> LAW: CITIES WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT MALATHION IS DANGEROUS AND, EXPERTS SAY,  THERE'S NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SWAY A JUDGE.  </P> <P> Experts in environmental law say Los Angeles and other Southern California  cities stand little chance of winning a quick halt in court to the state's  aerial spraying of malathion, aimed at killing the Mediterranean fruit fly.  </P> <P> They say the cities would have to prove the spraying is dangerous. So far, they  have been able to point only to studies that suggest it might be.  </P> <P> This weaker position is probably not enough to persuade a judge to overrule  Gov. George Deukmejian, the experts said.  </P> <P> Deukmejian has declared, in effect, that minimal health risks are worth taking  to combat the Medfly, whose presence, he contends, constitutes an emergency  threat to the state's agriculture industry.  </P> <P> When the governor declares an emergency, judges tend to scramble out of his  way, much like motorists making room for an ambulance. Unless it can be shown  that the governor turned on his "siren" irresponsibly, judges probably will not  block him.  </P> <P> "I doubt very much that a judge would intervene," said UCLA law professor Henry  W. McGee Jr., unless there is "some very powerful proof" that spraying makes  people sick.  </P> <P> Although the state has repeatedly used helicopters to spray small sections of  Los Angeles County, the only comparable large-scale spraying of an urban area  occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1981 and 1982.  </P> <P> Legal challenges to that spraying got nowhere.  </P> <P> In the current fight, seven cities, including Los Angeles, have taken the state  to court. It is unclear, however, how determined some of them are.  </P> <P> Last month, the city councils of three Orange County cities -- Huntington  Beach, Garden Grove and Westminster -- gave their lawyers 36 hours to prepare a  lawsuit asking judges to immediately stop the spraying. One Medfly expert said  the lawyers were in such a hurry that they turned down his offer of  information, saying they had no time to absorb it.  </P> <P> Predictably, a Superior Court judge in Sacramento rejected these cities' bids  out of hand. The councils have not authorized further legal actions, one of the  lawyers said. A similar effort by the city of Pomona in Superior Court also was  dismissed, although officials there say they anticipate the council will  authorize additional attempts.  </P> <P> Rather than ask for immediate intervention, the cities of Los Angeles, Glendale  and Burbank decided to bide their time when they filed suit this week.  </P> <P> Keith W. Pritsker, a Los Angeles deputy city attorney who played a key role in  drafting these cities' suits, said he recognized there was almost no chance  that a Superior Court judge would intervene at the drop of a hat. Therefore,  Pritsker said, the cities did not ask him to.  </P> <P> Instead, they said in a complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court, they would ask  for an injunction later -- presumably in several weeks -- after they had built  a better case.  </P> <P> City lawyers said they would use the additional time and court procedures to  compel the state to turn over the entire documentary record of why officials  decided to spray malathion and why they believe the spraying is safe.  </P> <P> In essence, the cities hope to show that the governor's emergency declaration  was a sham concocted to keep agricultural interests happy and avoid the  requirements of state environmental laws. The laws require a fair-minded impact  study, with public participation, whenever an action such as spraying may  significantly affect the environment.  </P> <P> They also hope the documents will show that the governor and state agricultural  officials did not consider less-risky alternatives to aerial spraying such as  stripping trees of fruit in affected areas and introducing a parasite known to  feed on the fruit fly's larvae.  </P> <P> The cities have a substantial ally in the Natural Resources Defense Council, a  national, nonprofit environmental group that filed its own suit along with more  than a dozen state legislators.  </P> <P> While the cities' interest may be short-term -- stopping the spraying to  protect the health of its residents -- the Natural Resources group is seeking  long-range reform of pest control practices statewide.  </P> <P> The state says it was not required to do an environmental impact report on the  aerial spraying because the California Environmental Quality Act specifically  allows impact studies to be skipped in emergencies.  </P> <P> But the cities argue that state agricultural officials brought the disputed  emergency on themselves by failing to plan alternative methods for combating  the Medfly infestations that have been detected in California periodically  since 1975.  </P> <P> As Pritsker said: "Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency  on our part."  </P> <P> Both the cities and the Natural Resources Defense Council are demanding that an  environmental impact assessment be drafted.  </P> <P> But, in a back-and-forth argument that seems likely to intensify, Deputy Atty.  Gen. Charles Getz said state agricultural officials have already completed the  "functional equivalent" of an environmental impact report.  </P> <P> The adequacy of this so-called "functional equivalent" is likely to be the key  issue in court, experts said.  </P> <P> In the only suit that succeeded in stopping aerial spraying of a pesticide in  California, Northern California environmentalists and organic farmers won an  injunction in 1985 to stop the state from spraying the pesticide Imidan against  an infestation of apple maggot fruit flies. The state had planned to spray  Imidan statewide for up to seven years but did not carry out an environmental  impact assessment or, the courts found, an equivalent study.  </P> <P> After a court-ordered halt to that spraying, the Legislature enacted a statute  to make it easier for state agricultural officials to claim they had done an  equivalent study.  </P> <P> The new law provided that any time the state approved a pesticide for regular  agricultural use, it was the "functional equivalent" of an environmental impact  report. The cities hope to show, with the state's own documents, that this  registration procedure is inadequate to be considered the equivalent of an  environmental impact report, regardless of the legislation.  </P> <P> Environmentalists said they also hope to show that the state manipulated data  for political reasons by overplaying the Medfly's potential economic cost to  farmers and underplaying health risks to city dwellers.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the state have said farmers face $200-million-a-year losses if the  Medfly infestation is not stopped.  </P> <P> Mary D. Nichols, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council,  said the state's claim that it needs aerial spraying to "eradicate" the Medfly  is misleading and wasteful. The Medfly appears to be indigenous to California,  she said, and probably cannot be eradicated. Probably, it can only be  controlled.  </P> <P> "Since we are talking (about an attempt to control a long-term problem), we  have the time and the necessity to sit down and look at the full range of  options," she said.  </P> <P> Calling the detection of the Medfly an emergency, she said, "becomes an excuse  for not evaluating alternatives" such as using the "mini-wasp," a parasite that  feeds on the larvae of the Medfly, that could be introduced into the state  along with sterile Medflies in a program that might take a year or so to  develop.  </P> <P> The distinction between controlling and eradicating the Medfly is also  significant because it determines who pays for a program that is expected to  cost $30 million by June, Nichols said.  </P> <P> Emergency eradication programs -- at $20,000 per helicopter flight -- are  financed by general tax dollars. By law, long-term management and control  programs are financed by agricultural interests, she said.  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: B4.  </P></p>

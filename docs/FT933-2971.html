			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Universities warned on snub to public schools MR JOHN PATTEN, education secretary, yesterday threatened to close down university teacher training departments which refused to co-operate with independent schools. This follows last week's announcement that the government will create a new agency to control teacher training. Oxford University's education department does not work with independent schools and a Headmasters' Conference official described relations with the department as 'appalling'. Mr Arthur Hearnden, Independent Schools Joint Council general secretary, said it was well-known that Oxford University's education department shunned partnerships with independent schools. Oxford said no local independent schools had applied to it. Speaking at the Headmasters' Conference annual meeting in Oxford, Mr Patten said: 'Complaints have come about two or three universities which have refused to have anything to do with what they call public schools.' He said he would not hesitate to withdraw government recognition from courses 'where institutions refused to co-operate with independent schools seeking to set up teacher training partnerships with state schools.' Mr Pattern also announced that from next year, independent schools could apply for government funds to offer teacher training of their own. He said state schools operating a pilot teacher training scheme this year received Pounds 4,000 for each of the 2,250 trainees involved. Mr Patten also voiced his support for the tough public sector pay policy of the Chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. The National Union of Teachers called for a pay rise of 8 per cent, plus Pounds 1,000 per teacher, saying it was necessary to maintain recruitment. Mr Patten said that such a pay increase would mean the loss of 80,000 jobs. The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education has called off a strike planned for 21 September over new contracts of employment, pending negotiations with the Colleges' Employers' Forum. Natfhe said it would continue to take local action against colleges which introduce new contracts that worsen lecturers' conditions. Students in higher education accumulate average debts of Pounds 614 for each year of studies, according to a survey in the new edition of Push, a guide to universities produced in association with Lloyds Bank.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Harrisons &amp; Crosfield The theory of conglomerates is that if one part of the group is suffering, growth elsewhere will ease the pain. Yesterday's trading statement from Harrisons &amp; Crosfield is a reminder that the argument cuts both ways. While its interests in chemicals and building materials are starting to recover, the commodity exposure to pigs is now acting as a drag. A surfeit of Polish pigs is the immediate cause of a price swing which will knock Pounds 6m off profits this year. Unlike the US, Europe does not boast a liquid futures market in pig meat. Profits cannot easily be protected from sudden price movements. Harrisons' palm oil and rubber can be sold forward to lock into good prices, but that only offers temporary respite should the market turn sour. Perhaps Harrisons should therefore decide whether, despite its origins, it wants to be in commodities at all. Since Harrisons' pigs are reared in the UK, lower profits will aggravate the problem of surplus advance corporation tax. An enhanced scrip dividend would reduce ACT and help repair the damage to the balance sheet caused by the recent run of uncovered dividends. With this year's earnings likely to be below the level of 1989, though, Harrisons does not have a strong argument for raising additional equity. While a yield well above the market average offers some protection, yesterday's 5 per cent fall in the shares suggests investors are looking for something more.</p>

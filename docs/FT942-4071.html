			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / International Company News: Share placement by MIM Holdings MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals and mining group, yesterday announced a ADollars 416.8m (USDollars 306m) placement of new shares - the first time in six years that the company has raised new capital via an equity issue. The shares being placed represent just under 10 per cent of MIM's issued share capital. The issue price was pitched at ADollars 2.925, a discount of more than 9 per cent to Thursday night's closing price of ADollars 3.22. MIM shares fell six cents, to ADollars 3.16, on news of the placement. Mr Norm Fussell, MIM's managing director, said the funds would be used 'for general corporate purposes, including the growth of the group's copper business'. The company has two important projects due to come on stream in the mid to late 1990s: Ernest Henry, the rich copper-gold deposit in Australia, in which MIM has a 51 per cent interest, and the Bajo de la Alumbrera deposit in Argentina, in which MIM has a 50 per cent interest.</p>

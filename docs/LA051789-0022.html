			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANCASTER VOTES 3-1 TO KEEP ARBITRATION;  </P> <P> MOBILE-HOME RENT ORDINANCE UPHELD  </P> <P> Voters in Lancaster's special election Tuesday upheld the city's controls on  increases in mobile-home rents and rejected a heavily funded campaign by  mobile-home park owners to abolish all controls on property sales or rents.  </P> <P> Proposition B, backed by the City Council and tenants, which keeps the current  ordinance providing for arbitration of mobile-home rent disputes, had a clear  winning margin of 3,472, or 75.3% of the vote, to 1,135, or 24.7%, with all  votes counted.  </P> <P> A rival measure sponsored by mobile-home park owners, Proposition A, would have  prohibited city restrictions on sale or rental of property unless the  restrictions were approved by a vote of the citizens. That proposition went  down to defeat by a vote of 3,551, or 78.4% of the vote, to 974, or 21.6%.  </P> <P> The two propositions were the only items on the ballot for the special  election, which drew a turnout of about 4,698, only 12.3% of the city's 38,349  registered voters, officials said.  </P> <P> George Root, president of the Lancaster Alliance of Mobile Home Park Residents,  said: "I am extremely pleased. The folks in Lancaster didn't buy all the park  owners' bull. Their biggest problem was they tried to fool the voters."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lopsided Results  </P> <P> Peter Wanserske, president of the Friends of Lancaster owners group, blamed the  low voter turnout for the lopsided results. "If there was misinformation, it  was on both sides," he said.  </P> <P> The election culminated a yearlong battle pitting mobile-home owners against  mobile-home tenants and the City Council in Lancaster, which has about 4,500  mobile-home residents in 28 parks and a total population of 82,000.  </P> <P> The present city ordinance permits tenants to challenge proposed rent increases  and seek the services of an arbitrator through the city if negotiations fail.  The arbitrator's decisions are binding.  </P> <P> If both ballot initiatives had failed, that ordinance would have stood. If both  had won, Proposition A would have banned all future caps on rent while  Proposition B would have permitted continuing arbitration of mobile-home rent  disputes.  </P> <P> Mobile-home park owners spent more than $86,000, a city record, on campaigns  attacking Proposition B and promoting Proposition A. They said the arbitration  ordinance could be expanded to other types of property and serve as the first  step toward citywide rent control, which they said would drain the municipal  treasury and cause deterioration of neighborhoods and public services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tenants Spent $800  </P> <P> By contrast, tenants spent only $800 on their campaign. They argued that the  present ordinance provided a fair method of mediating rent disputes and was not  the beginning of generalized rent control. They had the support of city  officials, who accused the mobile-home park owners of deceitful campaigning and  scare tactics.  </P> <P> On Monday, City Atty. David McEwen filed a complaint with the Los Angeles  County district attorney's office that accused the two owner groups -- Friends  of Lancaster/Yes on A and Lancaster Citizens Committee/No on Proposition B --  of violating city law by failing to submit copies of their mass-mailing  campaign literature to the city.  </P></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Radio industry wins royalty fight THE COMMERCIAL radio industry has won a significant victory in a 15-year battle to reduce the cost of copyright charges for broadcasting recorded music. The Copyright Tribunal, after a six-week hearing last year, has decided to set a royalty rate for music stations of 5 per cent of annual net revenue, with reductions down to 2 per cent for smaller radio stations. Phonographic Performance, which represents the main record companies, had proposed a range of 5.5 per cent to 20 per cent. During the hearing Phonographic Performance suggested dropping the maximum to 15 per cent. Mr Jimmy Gordon, managing director of the Radio Clyde group and chairman of the copyright committee of the Association of Independent Radio Companies, said: 'This is not so much a victory as the avoidance of a catastrophe for the radio industry.' He said the Phonographic Performance proposals would have meant payments rising from a total of about Pounds 5m to Pounds 7m a year, with the closure of some stations. He added that the Copyright Tribunal ruling would mean royalties would be about Pounds 4.1m a year. Mr Gordon added that commercial radio stations would still be paying more for music copyright than any other broadcasters in the world. Phonographic Performance said yesterday it would not comment until it had had a chance to consult its members on the tribunal's decision. The Radio Authority yesterday awarded the first of five regional commercial radio licences to Bristol-based Galaxy Radio. The licence covers the Severn Estuary area. Galaxy will have to give up the Bristol licence before taking on the new regional licence.</p>

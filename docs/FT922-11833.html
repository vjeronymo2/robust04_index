			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Duke quits US race for president MR David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, yesterday abandoned his quest for the Republican party's presidential nomination this year, writes Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Washington. Mr Duke's campaign has effectively been moribund since the Super Tuesday primaries early in March, when his appeal to white southerners produced only a minimal response. He complained yesterday he had been kept off the ballot in many states. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Paul Tsongas, still second to Mr Bill Clinton in accumulating Democratic party delegates, suffered a previously unrevealed recurrence of cancer in 1987. Mr Tsongas had made much of his recovery from the disease during his campaign.</p>

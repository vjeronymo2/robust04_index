			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Big brother mentality"] </F>   [Text] Beijing must give up its big brotherism and cease  to intervene in Taiwan's efforts to develop foreign relations if  it wants to see a steady normalization of relations between the  two sides. Unfortunately, there is no sign of Beijing changing  that policy. Even recently, Beijing tried all means it could to  block an eight-day unofficial visit by President Li Teng-hui to  three Southeast Asian countries, though to no avail.    Mainland China's repeated warnings and protests did not  bully  the Philippines and Indonesia, the first two nations of Li's  three- country tour, into refusing to receive him. Both  Philippine President Fidel Ramos and Indonesian President  Suharto held talks with Li over economic and other bilateral  issues.    It is still not known whether Thai Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai will meet Li today when the president leaves Thailand,  the last leg of his Southeast Asian trip, and flies back to  Taiwan. But Chuan has earlier refuted Beijing's protests by  defending Bangkok's right to allow President Li to visit  Thailand.    Mainland China's persistent intervention in Taiwan's efforts  to promote relations with foreign countries is unreasonable, as  it takes no consideration at all of the island's needs for  expanding such ties.    Taiwan, as an island economy with few natural resources and  limited domestic market, cannot afford to isolate itself from  the rest of the world without international economic and  political relations.    Taiwan must go to the world to look for more trade and  investment opportunities abroad for its companies. And it must  promote technological, scientific and cultural exchanges with  other nations to enhance economic and social development.    Also, with increasing income and more leisure time, local  citizens in growing numbers want to go abroad to spend their  vacations, thereby to gain a firsthand chance to understand  other nations and their people.    Yet to administer all these exchanges with foreign nations  and to better protect its businessmen's and travelers' interests  abroad, it is necessary for Taiwan to establish relations and  high-level contacts with other governments.    Beijing's stubborn attempts to block Taiwan from developing  closer contacts with foreign nations also demonstrates its  ignorance of the realities of present-day world relations.    Taiwan, given its growing economic and financial powers,  offers a lot-of business opportunities. Foreign governments  would not be willing to pass up such opportunities by submitting  to Beijing's unjustifiable demands and refusing to have ties  with Taiwan.    A most vivid illustration of this is the reception the three  South-east Asian governments have extended to President Li  during his eight-day tour, in spite of the repeated protests  from Beijing.    The leaders in Beijing may contend that their intervention  to  isolate Taiwan internationally is necessary to help prevent this  island from becoming independent from China. It is wrong. Such  intervention will only provoke resentment among local citizens,  impede improvement of bilateral relations and prolong the  division of the two sides.    In the interest of reunification, as pointed out recently by  Premier Lien Chan, Beijing must abandon its big brother  mentality and cease to treat Taiwan like the big fish swallowing  the small one.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Lines drawn for mobile warfare: Andrew Adonis on growing rivalry in the phone market Until now, competition in the UK cellular phone industry has done little to contain excessive profits. If Mercury One-2-One, the new network launched yesterday, continues as it has started with its offer of free calls, the industry's licence to print money may be cancelled. But it is fantasy to think that, as a result, the mobile phone will compete head-on with the fixed-line phone in the immediate future. Yet Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, declared BT was the 'real target' when he unveiled One-2-One. He said anyone would be 'mad' to use a BT fixed phone in preference to a One-2-One cellular phone for local calls in the evening and at week-ends. Mad, up to a point. Local calls on the One-2-One network will be free at weekends and after 7pm on weekdays. The offer only applies if you live in the London area. One-2-One is expanding rapidly, but it will be another two-and-a-half years before it has national coverage. However, One-2-One is 'free' only after you have bought a handset for at least Pounds 250 and paid a monthly fee of Pounds 14.69. Fixed-line phones sell for a tenth of the price, and BT's monthly line rental is Pounds 7.65. Furthermore, to make a One-2-One local call on the personal consumer tariff at 6pm rather than 7pm, you pay through the nose. It costs you Pounds 2.94, against 15p on BT. True, that is BT's off-peak rate, but go back to 3pm and the BT price rises only to 40p. For national calls you will also pay a hefty premium on One-2-One, before or after 7pm. Most private consumers, then, would be mad to see One-2-One or any other mobile service as an economic replacement for a fixed phone. Lord Young's free local calls are nevertheless more than a gimmick. For the first time, the marketing of mobile phones is being pitched at the domestic consumer, not just the business user. In the process, One-2-One is bringing extra competition to an industry desperately in need of more. Mercury One-2-One is in fierce competition with the two existing mobile operators, Vodafone and Cellnet, not with BT's national network. As the mobile phones enter the consumer market, they will be an extra, not a replacement for a fixed line phone. Indeed, as a fixed-line operator, Mercury is trumpeting the virtues of the cable companies, which are creaming private consumers from BT in urban areas on the basis of still lower fixed-line call tariffs. Until now, neither Vodafone nor Cellnet have seriously attempted to market their wares to private individuals. They have not needed to. With operating profits at nearly half of sales, it has been enough for them to assemble the growing number of business customers who regard a mobile phone as essential. Low-user tariffs, introduced by Cellnet and Vodafone last year, gave reduced subscriptions in return for even higher call charges, but they were of appeal mainly to a different segment of the business market. Vodafone's low-user tariff accounts for only 106,000 of its 926,000 customers. Three things are needed for a large consumer cellular market: networks which can handle high volumes, and affordable entry charges and call tariffs. The first condition is now fulfilled. One-2-One is just one of several high-capacity digital networks coming into service. Vodafone launched its EuroDigital network earlier this month; next month it unveils a MetroDigital service aimed mainly at the local market. Cellnet launches a digital network next year. It is only a matter of time before high digital handset prices - the main barrier to consumer entry - start to tumble. Handsets for the old analogue networks are already as low as Pounds 70. Manufacturers suggest it will take two-to-three years to get digital handset prices down from Pounds 250-Pounds 400 to under Pounds 100. That leaves call tariffs, which Mercury has started to axe. In anticipation of One-2-One, earlier this summer Vodafone announced tariffs for its new MetroDigital network which were lower than any it had set before. Cellnet sharply cut prices in London last week. Expect further reductions soon. Meanwhile, BT is a not a completely idle onlooker. It has a majority stake in Cellnet. And it can ill afford to be semi-detached from the cellular industry if, a few years hence, One-2-One's prices make mobile phones a real competitor to the fixed-line.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Mandatory puzzle for Trimoco TRIMOCO, the motor dealer on the receiving end of a Pounds 25.9m cash offer from Hartwell, has a semantic problem. In its offer document, posted on Tuesday, Hartwell which is ultimately owned by the private Saudi Arabian Jameel Group, described its offer as mandatory. But some Trimoco shareholders have understood this to mean that they must accept it. Trimoco wrote to its shareholders yesterday saying: 'This is not the case.' Just to emphasise the point it put the phrase in capital letters. Hartwell's offer arose when it swapped its holding of Trimoco convertible loan stock into ordinary shares. Adding these to its existing holding of 29.8 per cent of Trimoco's ordinary shares gave it a 39.4 per cent stake. Under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, Hartwell was then required to make an offer. It is, in Takeover Code parlance, a 'mandatory offer'. However, the compulsion is on the offeror not the offeree. The Takeover Panel does not feel that this is confusing. The bid is of 17 1/2 p a share in cash, the market price at the time Hartwell converted its shares. Trimoco's share price yesterday was unchanged at 20p. Observers find it difficult to say if Hartwell's offer is serious. Companies making Rule 9 offers often hope that they will not be accepted. Hartwell's offer document is low key, lacking the usual exhortations to accept. Trimoco is taking it seriously, if only because Hartwell has such a large stake.</p>

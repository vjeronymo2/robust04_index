This  will take place in Heemstede, where phosphates will be removed  from the water using a combination of biological  dephosphatization and a granular reactor. The equipment will  cost 7 million guilders to install.    The Heemstede Water Purification Plant (AWZI) is a  demonstration model. Should the test unit meet expectations,  then the Hoogheem council is considering building more of these  dephosphatization plants. "That depends on the experience we  build up in Heemstede over the coming year," says P. Knaapen,  head of Rijnland's purification technique department in Leiden.  "We are checking whether it meets expectations with regard to  phosphate purification. And we are also taking account of  aspects like control, maintenance and the definitive size." The  Heemstede unit is based on a scale model which Rijnland has  tested since 1990 in three water purification plants. This  mini-plant can be transported in a container. In  Zuid-Kennemerland it is the first time that the purification  method will be used at real size.  <H5>  Algae Growth </H5>   When phosphates enter water, they cause an increase in the  number of nutrients in the water (eutrophication). This in turn  causes a massive growth in algae, so that the amount of oxygen  in the water declines. The main sources of phosphates in water  are households (kitchen waste and feces) and agriculture  (fertilizers). The contribution caused by washing powders is  declining because many manufacturers have switched to  phosphate-free products.    The AWZI in Heemstede already had a biological purification  process. However, the equipment to remove the phosphate from  the mass of bacteria -- the purification sediment -- is a new  element. Its main advantage is that it does not increase the  quantity of purification sediment. When oxygen is added, the  micro-organisms absorb the phosphates. Rijnland continually  separates off part of the sediment and adds acetic acid. While  the bacteria absorb the acid as nutrients, they give off the  phosphate again. This leads to water which is rich in  phosphates and sediment which contains virtually none.    The next step is separating sediment and water. The Hoogheem  council has chosen a centrifuge to do this. After the  separation process, the sediment returns to its own purification  process to once again absorb phosphates. At this stage the  effluent contains virtually no phosphates. On the other hand  the phosphate-rich water from the centrifuge must undergo two  more processing stages.    The first processing stage is the addition of sulfuric acid  to the water. This removes the carbonate from the water. This  is necessary because this substance can block the following  phase of the process, the granular reactor. The granular  reactor was developed by the DHV engineering company in  Amersfoort and enjoys an international reputation.  <H5>  Large Granules </H5>   Once the water has been pumped into the granular reactor,  limewater is added to the centrifuge effluent. A deposit of  calcium phosphate then forms from the limemilk and phosphate.  The water goes from the bottom to the top of the reactor  several times. The granular reactor contains grafting sand.  The calcium phosphate attaches itself to the grafting sand and  forms phosphate granules. The result is obvious: The granules  become bigger and eventually drop to the bottom due to their  weight. Here they are removed. The purified water is returned  to the oxygenation tank.    The AWZI in Heemstede is one of 45 water purification plants  in Rijnland. The aim of the plant is to help the Hoogheem  council in the fight against phosphate. Rijnland calculates  that in 1995 it will have to process some 900 tonnes of  phosphates. This figure is based on the assumption that there  are no increases in phosphate use.</p>

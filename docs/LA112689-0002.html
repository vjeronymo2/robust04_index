			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLORENCE IN FULL FLOWER;  </P> <P> THE ART OF FLORENCE BY GLENN ANDRES, JOHN M. HUNISAK AND A. RICHARD TURNER;  PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY BY TAKASHI OKAMURA (ABBEVILLE PRESS: $385; 2 VOLS., 1,311  PP.)  </P> <P> The Art of Florence" is an extraordinarily handsome book, full of superb color  plates taken especially for this publication, printed on fine, heavy paper,  well bound and boxed. However, this is emphatically not a book intended to be  seen only. "The Art of Florence" has a major text of impeccable and  up-to-the-minute scholarship and, happily enough, it is written with great  clarity and a minimum use of technical terminology. The text is not only full  of information, but a joy to read. Its analyses of the various works of art are  full of insights and comparisons that make it clear why Florence was in the  forefront of the Renaissance. For anyone who loves Florence, Renaissance art  and architecture, or fine book making, this work is worth every penny of its  somewhat formidable price.  </P> <P> The way the book is set up is particularly interesting and valuable. It is  divided into sections historically, usually about a generation in length,  opening in each case with a lucid account of the history of Florence for that  period, stressing the political, social and economic events that play a major  role in the patronage of art in that period. This is followed in each case by  separate accounts of the architecture, sculpture and painting done in that  period. It is a system that allows one to follow very clearly not only the way  in which the arts are related to the history but also the ways in which they  influence each other in a given period. In the cases of long-lived artists,  their works may appear in two sections, a division that helps us to understand  their development and stylistic changes. Since Florence was fairly small by our  standards, with a population of under 100,000 through most of the period  covered, the interplay between the arts and the constant awareness of exactly  what was being done were particularly intense.  </P> <P> This is a fresh approach. So many books deal with only one of the arts or only  one artist that it is easy to lose sight of this rich and exciting interplay  and particularly to lose sight of how all of it is constantly influenced by the  events of the time.  </P> <P> For anyone interested in cultural and intellectual history this book is a must.  It gives an extraordinary immediacy to the particular climate in Florence that  made it the artistic leader for all of Europe. Though three authors are  involved, writing on their individual specialties, the tone of the book is  remarkably uniform, arguing that they worked closely together and share similar  points of view.  </P> <P> The book restricts itself to dealing only with artists who are Florentine, or  in a few cases who lived for some years in Florence, and only to those works by  them that are now in Florence, so the concentration is always on the city and  what can be seen there. There are, of course, references to other works, but  they are minimal. For example, Michelangelo as a painter is discussed in terms  of the Doni Madonna, the only painting by him in Florence. His work in the  Sistine Chapel is mentioned, but only just. What is surprising and fascinating  is how fully most of the artists can be discussed within those restrictions.  </P> <P> The period covered extends from the 13th Century to the beginning of the 17th,  the period in which Florence is at its peak artistically and politically. The  last monument it discusses is, fittingly enough, the massive, oppressively and  richly gloomy Burial Chapel of the Medici Grand Dukes, begun at the beginning  of the 17th Century and only completed in the 19th. Florence did not, of  course, die with the Medici; but its days of unique creativity did, at least in  the arts covered in this work. Within that long period, all of the major  artists and architects are discussed in full detail with one rather odd  exception: Piero di Cosimo is never mentioned at all, though there are enough  works by that strange and rather enigmatic painter still in Florence to make it  possible to have included him. Still, if that is the only oversight, the flaw  is a small one in a book that covers so much so brilliantly.  </P> <P> There is a particular nicety in the production of the book that deserves  special mention. The stunning color plates are gathered in groups scattered  through the two volumes; but small black-and-white pictures of the works being  analyzed appear in the margins of the text where they are discussed. The reader  can follow very precisely what is being said and can then turn to the color  plate for a fuller view, a system that is a boon and a delight to the reader.  </P> <P> Works such as the painted interior of the dome of the cathedral of Florence  were specially lit to be photographed for this work, which allows one to see  what is there in a way you will never manage on the spot.  </P> <P> I think it is only fair to add that the two volumes are among the heaviest I  can think of. This is not a book to be read happily in bed, or even trying to  hold on your lap. It has to be put on a desk or a very sturdy table in order to  be read. A small robot to carry it around, say a cousin of R2D2, would have  been a useful and happy addition to the package deal.  </P></p>

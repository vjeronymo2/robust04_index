[Klaus] When the news first appeared that President Clinton  would be visiting Prague after the Brussels NATO summit ends, no  one doubted--and the opposite did not even cross anyone's  mind--that he would use the visit to Prague to meet with the  representatives of the governments of all four countries of  Central and Eastern Europe--that is, the Czech Republic, Poland,  Hungary, and the Slovak Republic. It was never even considered  that we would be the only ones to talk with him. On the other  hand, collective talks have not been considered, either. His  stopover is simply used for a parallel meeting with four  delegations.    [Krejci] What will be, for the Czech side, the main topic of  this meeting?    [Klaus] The meeting with President Clinton is certainly the  most important point for us because it is a very important  signal for the entire world that President Clinton has chosen  Prague in particular for this meeting between the NATO summit  and his visit to Moscow. The official talks will be relatively  brief and the matter of external security will be of greater  importance because the visit will follow the NATO session.  [passage omitted]</p>

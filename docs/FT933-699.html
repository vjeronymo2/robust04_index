			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): New small firms minister Britain has a new small firms minister following a minor reshuffle triggered by the resignation of the government chief whip. Lord Strathclyde, formerly a junior minister at the Department of the Environment, this week changes places with Baroness Denton, small firms minister for the past 17 months. Lord Strathclyde, who is 33, began his parliamentary career as a government whip in 1988 and has since had spells as junior minister in the Department of Employment and Scottish Office as well as environment. Before embarking on a political career he worked as an insurance broker. Small firms organisations said they were puzzled by the decision to swap ministers. Opinions about Baroness Denton were divided but she was highly regarded for her practical approach to small business problems and her willingness to address issues such as the banks' treatment of small firms. Unusually for a small firms minister she had a business background. Lobbyists have grown used to a rapid turnover of small business ministers. Lord Strathclyde is the 14th since a small business division was created within the Department of Trade and Industry in November 1971. Nicholas Ridley was the first minister with responsibility for this area but David Trippier, who held the title from 1983 to 1987, did most to popularise the role. Ideally the minister would be in the Commons rather than the Lords and would not have to divide his time between small business issues and consumer affairs, small firms groups said.</p>

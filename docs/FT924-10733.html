			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Arts: Ballet Teatro Espanol - Dance The programme which introduces Rafael Aguilar's Ballet Teatro Espanol to us begins well. Aguilar's gloss on The House of Bernarda Alba is austerely set: six black-costumed women (Dragon-Mama and her five daughters) placed in a shadowy setting, with a crucifix and three skeletal doorways. The action, no less severe, stresses the mother's dominant presence (Manuela Aguilar like a particularly tough wardress) which governs every step made by the daughters. Gregorian chant alternates with guitar and voice, as the chatter of feet and constrained gestures establish the social barriers that hem this household in. The women, with some subtlety, expose their tensions and unhappiness. Only Eva Morena as the rebel daughter is allowed an extended and frankly stated solo as exploration of her sexual frustration - to which Miss Morena give a bold physical edge. The piece is pungent, well danced. What, then, to make of the succeeding Bolero, where Mr Aguilar uses Ravel's detestable exercise in orchestration as a basis for something to excite a coach-party on the Costa del Cheapo? It is a down-market version of Bejart's exercise in erotic kitsch - something to set the mind reeling - performed by a disgruntled chorus attendant upon the central figure of Victor Muro. Mr Muro is bare-chested, gets very heated emotionally and physically, and is given to pelvic thrusts which suggest that he has a Crown Derby tea-service lodged somewhere about his person. Were the whole thing not so awful, and so inept, it might be funny. Ideally it should be re-staged with Julian Clary as the soloist: he would know what to do with this rancid paella. The programme, which I saw on Tuesday, ends with the statutory outburst of Flamenco gaiety. All very predictable in its flaring temperaments - manic depression must be a career among the gypsy tribes - it boasts two fine guitarists (Juan Soto; Paco Arriaga) and a lovely girl, whom I cannot alas identify, her shawl-draped body rising in ravishing curves from the froth of her ruffled train in a mysterious Peteneras. But the real, rough, burn-the-throat flamenco draught is poured by the singer Rosario Ortiz, keening with a force to shatter glass, and stamping and strutting with a raw bravado that could shatter the stage. Uncompromising and uncompromised stuff, and tremendous. Ballet Teatro Espanol is at Sadler's Wells until October 31.</p>

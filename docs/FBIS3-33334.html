			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 22  February.    The board of directors of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH)  decided yesterday to cut the required legal reserve by two  points from 36 to 34 percent for commercial banks and from 17 to  15 percent for savings and loans associations. The legal  reserve has remained at 36 percent since September 1993, when it  was cut from 42 percent. The 42-percent rate was set in July  1993 as part of an economic measure to slow the rise of the  lempira. In announcing the new legal reserve, BCH Vice  President Daniel Figueroa indicated that the objective was to  send a positive message to all productive sectors and thus  create a suitable equilibrium between the banking system's  active and passive interest rates. The BCH vice president also  said that in the medium term banks will increase their  short-term interest rates either by increasing their savings  rates or by cutting loan rates.

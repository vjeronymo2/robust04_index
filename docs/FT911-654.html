			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / BAA seeks review of airport charges BAA, the airports operator, is seeking a new five-year pricing formula for aircraft landing and parking fees. It wants a formula that will enable it to recoup revenue losses from the abolition of European Community duty-free sales in 1992 and from additional airport security costs. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is conducting its first five-yearly review since BAA's privatisation of the company's three airports in the south-east of England Like other privatised industries regulated by government bodies, BAA is worried that the recent Ofgas decision to impose a tough five-year pricing formula on British Gas could set a precedent. Ofgas has limited annual British Gas price rises to 5 percentage points below the inflation rate. It is expected the MMC review, which will recommend a new five-year pricing formula for BAA from next April, will be completed at the end of June with the report published in August. The Civil Aviation Authority, which regulates BAA's airport activities, is expected to decide on the new pricing formula in October. Under the current formula BAA can increase its annual landing and parking fees by up to 1 percentage point below the rate of inflation. These fees make up about 40 per cent of the annual income of BAA's three south-east England airports. BAA can also recoup 75 per cent of additional security costs incurred because of government regulations introduced in 1989-90. The company says it takes two years to recover these additional costs which amount to Pounds 14m a year. BAA's overall security and safety costs are approaching Pounds 100m a year. BAA is particularly worried by the EC's proposal to abolish duty-free sales in the single European market, which the company believes would result in an annual revenue loss of Pounds 50m. Duty-free sales have traditionally cross-subsidised other airport charges. The company is also concerned by the implications of the EC's plans to abolish frontier barriers within the community after 1992. It says this would lead to heavy costs to adapt airport immigration and customs areas. BAA argues that any new pricing formula must also take into account the company's 15-year investment programme to increase and improve airport capacity in the south-east. Observer, Page 14</p>

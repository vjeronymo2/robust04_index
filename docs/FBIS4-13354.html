			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Yemeni Foreign Minister </F> Returns Socialist Party Diplomats to Sanaa"]    [Excerpt] London, Sanaa, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Yemeni  Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has reshuffled staff  in Yemeni embassies abroad. The reshuffle affects in particular  diplomats who come from southern Yemen and those who have close  links with the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], one of the two  parties to the Yemeni political crisis. The other party to the  crisis is the General People's Congress [GPC].    The most notable feature of this reshuffle is the return of  diplomats "who do not enjoy Sanaa's trust" to Yemen.    A source close to the YSP rejected this reshuffle, pointing  out that a number of embassies have not received their expenses  for many months, in order to force YSP diplomats to return. The  source warned that, if these embassies do not receive their  allowances, Aden will allocate to them allowances that guarantee  the continuation of their work, lest Yemeni diplomacy become a  partisan tool in the hands of the GPC.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Yemeni embassies run by a  southerner occupying the ambassador post usually has at least  one northerner on whom Sanaa relies in running most affairs and  contacts, while the head of the diplomatic mission remains just  a symbol.    A well-informed source has said that the recent diplomatic  reshuffle is a reaction to the crisis caused by Muhammad Sharaf,  Yemeni charge d'affaires in Warsaw, who provoked a big clamor  when he revealed a secret arms deal which the Economic Military  Establishment had concluded with Poland for the northern  military command. He refused to issue entry visas for Polish  arms companies' officials to enable them to visit Sanaa and  complete the negotiations concerning the deal.    It is worth mentioning that the Yemeni Foreign Ministry  granted some Polish officials visas upon their arrival at Sanaa  airport. Upon his arrival in Warsaw last Sunday, Fu'ad Sawwaf  Sivjik [as transliterated], sales director of the Polish company  Cenzin, said that he had signed a contract worth tens of  millions of dollars to supply the Yemeni Defense Ministry with  arms, ammunition, and equipment.

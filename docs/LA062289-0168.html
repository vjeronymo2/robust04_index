			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOING HANDS IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR RACE;  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH GAMBLER;  </P> <P> A FORMER IBM OFFICIAL WELCOMES THE CHALLENGE OF RUNNING A RISKY CHIP VENTURE.  </P> <P> Sanford L. Kane worked in finance jobs for most of his 27 years at IBM, but he  says he's always enjoyed getting his hands dirty on the shop floor. That might  be just the right combination for the venture he has been named to run, U.S.  Memories Inc., which will have to combine manufacturing excellence with tight  cost controls to prosper in the fiercely competitive computer memory chip  market.  </P> <P> "I didn't sit in my office and read reports. I got out onto the site," Kane  said of a stint as controller of an IBM plant in Fishkill, N.Y. "The longer you  spend in a place like that, the more you appreciate the genius" of the work  force.  </P> <P> A rotund man with a forceful public presence, Kane makes no bones about the  fact that U.S. Memories, while a risky venture, represents a major personal  opportunity for him. But he also emphasizes his belief that it is important for  the industry and the country.  </P> <P> "I decided this was important, that it was a challenge, that it was interesting  and that it was a risk worth taking," he said, referring to his decision to  resign as vice president of IBM's general technology division and become  president and chief executive of U.S. Memories.  </P> <P> In an indirect way, Kane also had another motive: to plunge into something that  would help him forget the 1986 murder of his 16-year-old son, Eric. The  notorious incident, in which his son was stabbed to death in an Arizona motel  room by the son of well-known author John Wideman, has left him bitter about  the American justice system and committed to the victims' rights movement.  </P> <P> His normally confident voice nearly cracked as he discussed the tragedy. "It's  been very difficult, but we have each other," he said in reference to his wife,  Louise, who is chairwoman of the New York State victims' rights league. "She  nearly always travels with me now because neither one of us wants to be alone.  And we need to be active; otherwise we'd be basket cases." In a notable  departure from standard practice, Kane introduced his wife during the U.S.  Memories news conference.  </P> <P> Kane is clearly prepared to devote a lot of energy to U.S. Memories. And his  skills as a negotiator and conciliator, which may prove vital in making a  company with multiple owners a success, have been well-tested. He served  several years as IBM's ambassador to the chip industry and was a key player in  bringing the Sematech research consortium and U.S. Memories to fruition.  </P> <P> To succeed, Kane will need the same "good sense for both business and  technology and how they are related" that he attributes to Erich Bloch, head of  the National Science Foundation. Bloch was Kane's boss at Fishkill, and Kane  described him in admiring tones as "a very dedicated guy" who had a rare  understanding of the way high-tech industries work.  </P> <P> Kane is also clearly inspired by the potential for U.S. Memories.  </P> <P> "Watching this develop over the years has been an incredible experience," he  said of the budding industry cooperation. "In the early meetings, there was an  incredible amount of distrust among the companies. But now they're really doing  it."  </P> <P> And for the latest and most important phase of that cooperation, it will be  Sandy Kane leading the way.  </P> <P> MEMORIES, MEMORIES  </P> <P> DRAMs, short for dynamic random access memories, are the heart of a computer's  memory system. Pronounced DEE-rams, they allow computers and such electronic  devices as fax machines to store bits of data for quick retrieval; some can  manipulate information. DRAMs make up a computer's main memory bank and are  typically used to store software programs and operating instructions.  </P> <P> In 1980, 11 U.S. companies produced DRAMs: AMD, AMI, Fairchild, Intel, ITT,  Micron, Mostek, Motorola, National, TI and Zilog. Now only three U.S. firms  manufacture and market them: Texas Instruments, Micron Technology and Motorola.  DRAM growth will be fueled by advanced electronics and new applications; one  forecaster estimates that DRAM capacity in printers, PCs, personal copiers, fax  machines, intelligent workstations and TVs will show the most dramatic growth.  </P> <P> DRAM MARKET SHARE  </P> <P> North American companies' share of the DRAM market has plummeted over the past  decade. 1989 figures are estimates.  </P> <P> Source: Dataquest  </P></p>

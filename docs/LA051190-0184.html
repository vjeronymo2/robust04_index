			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIND GAMES;  </P> <P> HOW PERSONALITY, SPORTS MATCH UP  </P> <P> Are certain personalities attracted to specific sports?  </P> <P> Yes, says James Gavin, a professor of applied social science at Concordia  University in Montreal. Our personalities affect our choice of sports, our  willingness to participate in a sport and how we perform in the sport. Which  may explain why you're gagging on your weekly regimen of running, aerobics or  yoga.  </P> <P> "There are certain emotional qualities reinforced by the choice of exercise,  and within that exercise," Gavin says. "It's hard to get people to adhere to an  activity that doesn't feel right to them."  </P> <P> Define your measure of sociability, spontaneity, discipline, aggressiveness,  competitiveness, mental and risk-taking abilities, and you'll have a better  understanding of your sport of choice.  </P> <P> Gavin, who has written "Body Moves: The Psychology of Exercise," says that any  physical activity can be analyzed in three dimensions he refers to as the  psychological, physical and body movement domains. Our psychological  preferences are bolstered by our body type and preference for certain kinds of  movement.  </P> <P> On Gavin's scale, swimming ranks very high in requiring discipline, and low on  spontaneity, sociability and mental focus. In other words, once you get  yourself into the water, you can glide solo on autopilot.  </P> <P> In contrast, "Basketball demands you pay attention; you have to be riveted in  the moment," Gavin points out. "The activity by definition draws certain things  from you."  </P> <P> Like swimming, running demands discipline, but it's also low on spontaneity,  risk-taking and mental focus.  </P> <P> Walking may be the ultimate sport for meeting physical fitness needs over a  broad range of personalities. It can be played either way for spontaneity and  sociability. It requires little in the way of competitiveness, mental focus,  risk-taking or aggressiveness, and it offers plenty of opportunity for  spontaneity and sociability; in other words, walking is tailor-made for the  individual seeking exercise without commitment.  </P> <P> Gavin's psychological parameters may give you some clues as to why you're not  enjoying your fitness program, and what you can do about it. But while  psychological and physical factors may determine what sport you'll enjoy most,  there are other considerations. Time, convenience and cost also enter the  picture, Gavin points out.  </P> <P> Scientific research seems to show that a person will be motivated to exercise  if he or she picks an activity that appeals to him. A study of Harvard  graduates by a Dartmouth Medical School researcher indicated personality was an  important factor in determining if an individual would stick with a fitness  program.  </P> <P> In the March, 1989, issue of Psychology Today, Gavin presented a chart showing  how various sports and fitness activities rank according to seven parameters.  Gavin refers to these parameters as Psychosocial Activity Dimensions.  </P> <P> Gavin provided a work sheet that allowed us to rank ourselves from very high to  very low in each dimension. Then we can compare our preferences to his  evaluation of specific fitness activities. (In evaluating the activity, Gavin  assumed the individual participates regularly in the sport or activity).  </P> <P> The psychosocial activity dimensions include:  </P> <P> * Sociability: Do you most enjoy being alone or having people around?  </P> <P> * Spontaneity: Are you a quick decision-maker or do you prefer detailed  planning?  </P> <P> * Discipline: Do you prefer to stick it out once you start something? Or do you  abandon activities that require continued effort?  </P> <P> * Aggressiveness: Do you try to control events?  </P> <P> * Competitiveness: Do you enjoy competitive situations or shy aware from them?  </P> <P> * Mental focus: Are you able to concentrate on one thing when you want or have  to?  </P> <P> * Risk-taking: Do you enjoy taking risks or do you prefer tried-and-true  approaches?  </P> <P> Answering such questions gives us a clearer idea of how well our sport suits  us, and why certain sports won't satisfy us.  </P> <P> Part of the problem in determining an individual's sports personality is that  people may play the same sport in different ways. An individual's behavior  pattern in sports may be either participatory or competitive, according to Dick  Lister, a clinical psychologist and sports psychologist in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "The participatory golfer may be on the course as much to enjoy its aesthetic  qualities, the trees and the lakes, as he is to put the ball in the hole,"  Lister explains. "The competitive golfer may see the lake because his ball is  in it."  </P> <P> The participatory and competitive categories are roughly equivalent to the Type  A and Type B behavior patterns with which we're familiar. In their book, "Type  A Behavior and Your Heart," Drs. Meyer Friedman and Ray H. Rosenman define the  Type A behavior pattern as an "action-emotion complex" in anyone "aggressively  involved in a chronic, incessant struggle to achieve more and more in less and  less time."  </P> <P> There's also an environmental element to Type A behavior, the physicians say;  an individual may behave in a hard-driving fashion only in certain situations,  for example, at work, or on the racquetball court.  </P> <P> An individual with a Type A personality who is trying to relieve some of the  stress his behavior creates, may want to choose a sport that doesn't lend  itself easily to competition, Gavin says. What the Type A character may need is  a dose of playtime -- going out to walk streets he has never traveled before or  maybe going fishing.  </P> <P> "While (their favorite sport) may benefit them cardiovascularly, it may not be  the best psychologically, because it reinforces qualities they already have an  abundance of," Gavin says. "The Type A personality will go into a sport with  real aggression. From health to performance to super performance in a very  short time. If a Type A takes on a Type B activity, it quickly becomes a  performance contest."  </P> <P> But while the participatory athlete may be more relaxed than the competitive  athlete, both may be benefiting from their approach to exercise. The  competitive athlete doesn't have to consider taking the participatory approach  unless he's doing damage to himself, Lister says. Competitive jocks are usually  having a good time improving their performances. It's when the obsession with  improvement actually leads to declining performance that things get weird.  </P> <P> Researchers believe different personalities prefer different movements.  </P> <P> "Type A movements are typically quick and linear, a sudden changeability as  opposed to a flow," Gavin says. "The movement would be more in tune with  racquet games or running than with yoga or t'ai chi. A Type A individual will  gravitate toward those types of movements. There's a quantitative, performance  emphasis."  </P> <P> The Type B personality has a different attitude toward movement. "More likely  you'd find them doing activities with more enjoyment to them, and with more  movement flow," Gavin says. "Type B's may be runners, but they won't be likely  to enter races with the same emphasis. (And) they might be more varied in the  routes they take."  </P> <P> While sports can be played in either a participatory or competitive fashion,  some require more concentration than others even in the participatory mode. If  you want to escape the pressures of your own personality, choose your sport  wisely. After all, it's all in fun.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT'S YOUR SPORT PERSONALITY?  </P> <P> Matching your personality with your sport of choice will increase the  likelihood that you'll stick with it, says Dr. James Gavin, a professor of  applied social science at Concordia University in Montreal and author of "Body  Moves: The Psychology of Exercise."  </P> <P> Bodybuilders are characterized by Gavin as people who are persistent despite  the obstacles. They don't like to change plans and they try to control  situations by being forceful. Downhill skiers, on the other hand, are very  social people who love spur-of-the-moment decisions. Sticking with things is  difficult for them but they love a challenge and taking risks.

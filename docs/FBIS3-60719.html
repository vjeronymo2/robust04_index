Ukraine does not sell arms to either the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia, the South African Republic, or Iraq.  With regard to selling certain types of arms to Iran, Ukraine  is pursuing its own economic interests and observes security  principles. Borys Tarasyuk underlined that Ukraine had never  sold sea-launched guided missiles to Iran. According to the  Ukrainian diplomat, taking advantage of the imperfection of the  system of control exercised by the Coordinating Committee for  Multilateral Exports Controls, middlemen manage to ship arms,  products, and technologies to the states under ban.</p>

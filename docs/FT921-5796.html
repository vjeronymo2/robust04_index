			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Tougher security measures following IRA attacks TOUGHER security measures are in prospect following the weekend IRA bomb attacks in London. British Transport Police are studying the feasibility of video surveillance of London's main railway stations. Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, yesterday supported calls for addresses of general-election candidates not to be published on ballot papers. He said he had had clear advice that terrorists should be denied easy access to information of that sort. The move would mean an emergency bill to alter electoral law. Labour said it would co-operate if the security forces advised that the measure was necessary. The Liberal Democrats said voters were entitled to know where candidates lived and opposed what they said would look like a 'panic response'.</p>

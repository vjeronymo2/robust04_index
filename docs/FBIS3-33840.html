These tents have been  sent by the World Food Program with the cooperation of Pakistan  for distribution among the Afghan war affectees.    Reports from Afghanistan speak of fresh fierce fighting  between the rival warring factions in (Chehalstun) and Gazergah  area of Kabul. The AFGHAN ISLAMIC PRESS reported from Kabul  that the antigovernment forces used heavy shelling and rocket  fire against government strongholds in southern parts of the  city. The television mountain also came under heavy fire. In  retaliation, the air force of the state Defense Ministry bombed  the Dostam militia positions in Bala Hesar and (Tappa Maranjan).  Afghan sources told Radio Pakistan's Peshawar representative  that this is for the first time in the month-long war that the  fighting has spread south of Kabul.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Book Review: The war before the world changed THE GULF CONFLICT 1990-91: Diplomacy and War in the New WorldOrder By Lawrence Freedman and Efraim Karsh Faber and Faber, Pounds 20, 504 pages There are times, two years on, when the Iraqi invasion and allied liberation of Kuwait can seem an age ago, resonating with such fallen and dimly remembered names as Gorbachev, Thatcher, Baker and Shamir. This week, as the prime mover again flaunts his defiance in Kuwait, and his prime antagonist punishes him one more time before departing the US presidency, is not such a time. Yet, however events unfold in the coming days, it is clear that January 1993 will not be a rerun of January 1991. This is not just because Saddam Hussein is a much weakened figure, his military a shadow of its former self; nor because the allies this time have fuzzy objectives and are relying purely on air power rather than a massive ground offensive. It is because the world itself has changed since the last Gulf war. This timely and well-judged book helps to remind us how. The authors - one the professor of war studies at King's College, London; the other a leading Israeli authority on Middle Eastern affairs  - have produced something approaching a definitive chronicle of the 1990-91 crisis, stretching from the prelude to Saddam's invasion to his defeat by the US-led coalition. Just as important, they have attempted to place the conflict in a proper historical context. The attempt can only be provisional, but the snapshot they provide of the world is thoughtful and thought-provoking - not least in relation to George Bush and his much-belaboured New World Order. Of all the cliches spawned by the Gulf war, that was perhaps the most tedious. It was also, as Bush later realised, all too open to misunderstanding. As Freedman and Karsh make clear, the international effort to eject Iraq from Kuwait was probably unrepeatable. Far from marking the dawn of a new era when, in Bush's words, 'diverse nations are drawn together in common cause, to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind', it was an essentially transitional moment. The coalition assembled against Iraq depended on a singular set of circumstances: Gorbachev's desperate need for western support as his domestic power base crumbled; China's desire to ingratiate itself after the Tiananmen Square massacre; Arab awareness that there was only one superpower. It came together because Iraq's offence was a textbook case of aggression that simply could not pass unchallenged, and held together because the US set itself the relatively straightforward goal of reversing that aggression. Between those two bald facts, Freedman and Karsh's narrative has a smooth inexorability which perhaps does not fully reflect the widespread public alarm and uncertainty at the time. But the judgments underlying it are sound, and carry lessons relevant today: that Saddam invaded Kuwait largely because of his desperate political and economic predicament at home after the war with Iran; that economic sanctions alone would never have dislodged him; and that, despite the frenetic western activity in the run-up to the UN's deadline of January 16 1991, diplomacy never had a chance of yielding him concessions sufficient to warrant withdrawal. The authors are right, too, in squashing many of the myths that have grown up about the war in the intervening two years: the idea, for example, that there was some kind of eleventh-hour failure by the allies in ceasing fire when they did. Western rhetoric about targeting Saddam or removing him from power was all for domestic consumption; the wider coalition could never have supported such ideas as formal war aims. That does not mean that mistakes were not made. Indeed, in one sense the conflict arose from one big mistake by western countries: their abject failure to understand the nature of the Iraqi regime. They supported it during the war with Iran, appeased it once that conflict was over, then failed to warn Saddam clearly of the consequences of his actions during the build-up to the invasion of Kuwait. 'Saddam Hussein,' as Freedman and Karsh put it, 'was always an unlikely moderate.' The fact that Arab governments also wilfully misinterpreted his motives is only a partial excuse. But the biggest failure, and the one for which the price is still being paid, came after the western onslaught had ceased, when Saddam's people rose up against him and saw the outside powers who had encouraged them to do so hurriedly retreating over the horizon. By his own lights, it was understandable that Bush had no desire to let US forces become embroiled in Iraq's internal affairs. Though he had difficulty explaining as much, the war had after all been fought to preserve an international order in which established state borders are inviolate, ethnic or religious divisions are treated as secondary, and repressive governments are allowed to get on with it so long as they do not bother the neighbours. With the end of the cold war and the eruption of ancient ethnic problems, however, it looks as if that order is crumbling. Perceptions of the world are shifting in a way that makes the simplicity of Bush's line in the sand seem old-fashioned. The western powers trying to police no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq are learning that Saddam's repression of the Kurds and the Shias, like the Serbs' ethnic cleansing, is itself a potential threat to regional peace that cannot in the long run be ignored. If the Gulf war was a 'defining moment', that reality is what it began to define.</p>

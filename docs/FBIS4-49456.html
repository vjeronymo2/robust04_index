			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On the morning of 29 April, the provincial  party committee and government held a meeting on coal  production. Provincial party Secretary Li Changchun; Vice  Governor Fan Qinchen, member of the provincial party committee  standing committee; and Vice Governor Yu Jiahua; as well as  responsible comrades of the relevant departments directly under  provincial authorities; worked together to make an in-depth  analysis of the difficulties facing coal industry, and ways to  overcome these difficulties and to turn the corner.    Li Changchun pointed out that the basic solution to coal  industry lies in emancipating our minds, changing our ideass,  deepening the reform, and establishing the socialist market  economy system as early as possible. Coal was one of the  industries that followed the planned economy system rigidly. It  also is one of those industries facing great difficulties in its  transition to the socialist market economy system. Therefore,  it is necessary for us to emancipate our minds as early as  possible, change our ideas, and study well the theory of the  socialist market economy by combining theory with practice to  accelerate the pace of reform. [passage omitted including  indistinct portion]    Li Changchun stressed: At present, we must do well the work  of stabilizing enterprises that face difficulties. Enterprise  party organizations at all levels must truly play their key  role, and communist party members must play their vanguard and  exemplary role to unite with and guide workers and staff members  to deepen reforms, and overcome difficulties. They must pay  attention to solving practical problems for the masses. They  must show consideration for workers and staff members who have  difficulties. Some workers and staff members may have  complaints about certain problems; for the moment, however,  these problems cannot be solved under the present conditions.  We must talk to them patiently so as to bring them around.    Li Changchun urged relevant quarters to show concern for and  support the coal industry. Local governments at all levels must  bring diversified operations of coal industry into their plans,  and actively support them. Li Changchun hoped that the coal  industry, after exerting its efforts for several years, would  succeed in putting an end to the passive state of affairs, take  on a benign cycle, and become an important new force for  invigorating Henan.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading TALK OF an opinion poll indicating a late swing in favour of the Conservative party ahead of today's UK general election sent stock index futures sharply forward, writes Joel Kibazo. A four-point decline to 2,400 in the June contract on the FT-SE, shortly after the market's opening, was halted as independent traders turned buyers on talk of a change in fortunes for the Tories. That fall, to 2,400, proved to be the low of the day, for June continued to advance for almost the rest of the session, buoyed by strong performances in the gilts and sterling markets and ignoring the weakness on Wall Street. A notable feature came in the closing minutes of the session, when a well-known independent trader bought 150 contracts as June stood at a high premium to cash. The filling of that order sent June into retreat to finish at 2,438, up 10 from the previous day and some 23 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Trading in the FT-SE options accounted for a large part of the day's total LTOM turnover of 35,410; there were 18,656 FT-SE lots dealt, up from Tuesday's 12,028. BTR was the busiest stock option, having 1,255 contracts transacted.</p>

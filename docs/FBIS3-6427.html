On this occasion, the prince kromkhun welcomed the  delegation  and talked about the elections in Cambodia two years ago, which  were successful because of the correct implementation of the  Paris agreement, particularly under the leadership of His  Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk. It was also due to the  participation of the Cambodian people nationwide.    Answering his guests' questions on the Khmer Rouge and  investment in Cambodia, the prince kromkhun said that the Khmer  Rouge issue is of no importance to the Royal Government as long  as this group refuses to abide by the national reconciliation  principles.

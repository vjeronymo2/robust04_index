			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Serbs as Ethnic Hostages"] </F>   [Text] Zvornik (TANJUG) -- Vojislav Djurkovic, operations  representative of the state committee of the republic of Srpska  (RS) for the exchange of civilians, yesterday stated for TANJUG  that the situation of Serbs in Tuzla and its vicinity is  extremely critical. He points out that "the Muslim authorities  treat the Serbs in the Tuzla region as ethnic hostages,  subjecting them to the most brutal terror and pogroms."  Djurkovic notes that, "as of now, we have officially requested  that 16,500 Serbs, individually named, be permitted to move to  RS territory, but that has not been made possible."    Djurkovic also notes that "great quantities of humanitarian  aid are reaching Tuzla exclusively through the RS. However, the  quantities reaching the Serbian population in Tuzla and its  vicinity are only symbolic, intended only to prevent mass  starvation among them. Even the Serbian humanitarian association  `Dobrotvor' is under the total control of the Muslim military,  who take for themselves whatever they consider to be of better  quality. All this has been going on for months, but the  representatives of international humanitarian organizations in  Tuzla pay no attention to the frightful scenes of mass suffering  of the Serbian people."    According to Djurkovic, "Izet Hadzic, chairmen of the Tuzla  region, is directly responsible for most of the hardship,  pogroms, and persecution of Serbs." "The training center for  Islamic terrorists in Tojsici near Tuzla is also under his  leadership," maintains Djurkovic, noting that "the majority of  instructors in this center are mojahedin from various Islamic  countries, and many of them used to be criminals and terrorists  in Europe. The Serbian side has evidence about the activities of  Fadil Prcic, who has his own jail for Serbs and his private  Muslim police. He, together with his assistant, Sherija  Zajmovic, who is in charge of private jails for Serbs in Tuzla,  has personally ordered and participated in the elimination of  many Serbian families." In Djurkovic's opinion, it is becoming  increasingly clear that the Serbs will have to determine the  fate of their compatriots in the Tuzla region in response to the  general mood of the people of Semberija, Majevica, and Posavina.  He notes that Dr. Radovan Karadzic, president of RS, has  recently also called attention to this necessity.</p>

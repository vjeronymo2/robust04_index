			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: European Colour expands to Pounds 521,000 EUROPEAN Colour, the Stockport-based chemical colour manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits almost doubled at Pounds 521,000 for the six months to September 30, against Pounds 265,000. Sales advanced 11 per cent from Pounds 6.98m to Pounds 7.75m with a 23 per cent rise in Europe. Earnings per share were 1.16p (0.59p) and the interim dividend is being raised to 0.35p (0.275p). Mr Henry Finchett, chairman, said the improving profit trend, which had started to emerge at the interim stage last year, had continued. Sales growth was the result of its product development programme. Profit growth had been helped by further improvements in production efficiencies. On prospects, Mr Finchett said demand had declined, particularly in Europe over the last six months, but the company had been able to make up for that by increasing the number of European customers.</p>

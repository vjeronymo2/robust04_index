			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Arts: New look for the merry month of May - Television Early May is scarcely a time when you expect television to be screening lots of new material, yet every day in the past week has brought at least one new series (not another batch of some grizzled old sitcom, tagged 'NEW]' in the programme magazines like an ancient detergent, but genuinely fresh series) and some nights have provided several. WEDNESDAY. Fans of the funniest game show on television, Whose Line Is It Anyway, will have looked forward to Josie since we were promised Josie Lawrence was being 'let loose on her own comedy series'. WLIIA? has established a whole string of new(ish) comedians as very special people: those who can think fast enough on their feet to be really funny while improvising. Few have the gift to achieve this consistently, but Josie Lawrence was one. Astute readers of the runes may have guessed what was in store when La Lawrence began complaining in the hype interviews preceding Episode 1 that people would keep asking whether her shows were to be like Tracey Ullman's or Emma Thompson's and they jolly well weren't going to be like either so shuttup or I'll scweam and scweam till I'm thick, I can you know. Unhappily the first show looked as though it had been modelled precisely half and half on Ullman and Thompson (neither of whom managed in their shows to approach the unvaryingly high standard of Victoria Wood or even the occasional brilliance of French and Saunders). Lawrence's impression of Kylie Minogue was not so good that one could forget Kylie is currently a back number and her sister is the one in the limelight. For the rest it was all too clear that a flair for improvisation is no guarantee of talent in other areas. Channel 4 is following that with a series showing excerpts from Manhattan Cable, the New York service which combines cable technology and the freedom of expression required under the American constitution to provide the most astonishing public access channel on earth. Anyone who has sat in New York and watched it for more than a couple of nights knows that the Bible thumping grows boring only slightly sooner than the explicit sex. (Why are they all so desperately sleazy?) Yet sliced up into miniature portions for these British compilations it all looks fascinatingly zany rather than tediously insane. Easily the best of the new Wednesday series is BBC2's Water Wars which began with a programme that proved comprehensively how important this subject is, and how much more so it may rapidly become. The winning by American Indians of water rights on their land, the competition between cities and farmers for water, the broking of water rights and water itself, were all conveyed with abnormal clarity by a combination of good pictures and a good script (though the large proportion of the population with hearing that is impaired, however slightly, will have hated the parts where music interfered with speech). THURSDAY. Birdscape on Channel 4 is described as 'a new series in which wildlife artist and naturalist Bruce Pearson travels around Britain to paint its birdlife'. The surprise in Episode 1 was that we saw so little of the painting, though perhaps you could see why: the fens, with those huge pale blue northern winter skies, the navy blue water beneath, and the vivid yellow sedge and reed between, decorated with thousands of geese, swans and duck, looked so magnificent that it would have been somewhat absurd to turn away to look at paintings. FRIDAY. Those who missed the opening episode of ITV's sitcom Second Thoughts can decide for themselves whether to begin with Episode 2. James Bolam is a divorce with no children but a Sloane Ranger ex wife. He is hoping to marry Lynda Bellingham who seems to have no husband but two teenage children. The opening exchange (in bed) was: 'I'm usually in Sainsbury's about now' - 'Well think of me as this week's special offer'. The writers were so proud of a later line given to Bellingham, 'Could we have four sundaes with crushed nuts' accompanied by a look clearly threatening Bolam's manhood, that they used it twice. SATURDAY. Tracey Ullman came to the fore 10 years ago in a BBC showcase series called Three Of A Kind. The men in that programme were David Copperfield and Lenny Henry. Now BBC1 has launched You Gotta Be Jokin' (titles have deteriorated in a decade) featuring five young comedians: Maddi Cryer, Annette Law, George Marshall, Billy Pearce and Shane Richie. Presumably the hope is that, once again, most of them will go rocketin' to stardom, though if it is passe to do impressions of Kylie Minogue what can you say about an impression of Millie singing 'My Boy Lollipop'? That reached its highest point in the British charts, number two, 27 years ago last month. The funniest item in this opening programme was Annette Law's impression of Penelope Keith performing a medley of rap numbers in her Margo persona. It will be a surprise if more than one from this group makes it into the big time. Each of them, however, is funnier than the whole of The Wolvis Family put together . . . at least, I think so. This BBC2 series is the sort of thing that sounds wonderful at 'offers meetings' (where BBC department heads consider offers for new programmes) since it is so simple: the members of a family sit on chairs in a bare studio and undergo group therapy led by a sickeningly trendy and somewhat dense therapist, the sort who wags his fingers in the air like a Hampstead hostess to denote 'quotes'. There was a small improvement towards the end of the first episode, so the series may bear more watching. SUNDAY. Six one-hour programmes on mankind's development and use of maps sounds like a splendid idea: an under explored topic, yet an unusually visual one, and lots of scope for modern technology (what fun to mix through from, say, a mediaeval impression of Europe to the real shape of the land as photographed from a satellite; why ever didn't they do it?) Unhappily in ITV's The Shape Of The World the idea has been spoiled by a poor script, an intrusive commentary, and a lack of the sort of narrative drive which is so well exemplified by Water Wars. The script is littered with cliche: what do you call an old map kept by an old man who brings it out once a year? A time honoured possession. What does the sun do in hot weather? It beats down. How does it beat down? Remorselessly. And so on. Where commentary is concerned they have made the oldest mistake in the documentary book and had it read by an actor with an idiosyncratic voice. Patrick Stewart is fine in Hamlet or Star Trek but the minute you hide his face and ask him to communicate via voice alone he does what so many actors do and goes over the top. He is by turns arch, plummy and portentous but always noticeable - which is the last thing you want. MONDAY. In Watching The Detectives Channel 4 seems determined to convince us not only that the television image of the work done by such people as Holmes, Morse and Poirot is utterly unrealistic, but that the lives of real detectives are narcoleptically boring. The opening episode established this in the first 10 minutes and spent the next 50 challenging us to stay awake as the camera watched the wet streets of Manchester from a car which was following a stolen kitchen cabinet that we were never allowed to see. As a dramatic climax our Manchester sleuth switched to following (still in his car) a wife who was going to meet either her boyfriend or a business colleague - but we were never allowed to see her either. TUESDAY. Big Break on BBC1 is one of those game shows that you start watching through barely parted fingers because the host, comedian Jim Davidson, is from the 'Goodness me what a prat we have here' school, made so familiar by Bruce Forsyth. Then, when he asks one of the contestants 'Is a Concorde or a 737 the fastest passsenger plane?' and she replies 'Yes' you take his point, and remove your fingers. This is the 914th variation on 'Beat The Clock' to appear since Sunday Night At The London Palladium was axed, though this time the game is always snooker. Why don't they simply revive 'Beat The Clock'?</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Nigerian military faces protests NIGERIA'S pro-democracy campaign groups have called a three-day stoppage to back Mr Moshood Abiola's claim to be the next president and to oppose the military regime's plan to hand over to an unelected interim government on Friday, writes Paul Adams in Lagos. The two previous civilian protests organised by the Campaign for Democracy in recent weeks halted normal business life in the commercial capital, Lagos, and other parts of the Yoruba-speaking south-west, the stronghold of Mr Abiola, but failed to make an impact in the east or north of Nigeria. Although the CD lacks a national network, it has done more than any other organisation to voice dissatisfaction with President Ibrahim Babangida's eight-year-old regime, which has four times postponed its promised transition to democracy. The protest is aimed at building up pressure on the government to step down before Friday, when the Nigeria Labour Congress has threatened a national strike. Nigeria partially lifted the domestic oil price subsidy from midnight by introducing a premium grade of petrol worth N7 (20p) a litre. A state broadcast last night said ordinary grade will still sell at N0.7 a litre but industry says it will soon be unavailable. Higher fuel prices could wipe out the budget deficit and revive the downstream oil industry, but in April the military government judged the price rise a threat to the transition to democracy, which has now been abandoned. Mr Mike McCurry, US State Department spokesman, threatened yesterday to cut off more aid to Nigeria unless President Babangida keeps his promise to turn over power by the end of the month.</p>

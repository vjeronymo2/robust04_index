			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendment to &sect;110.3(a)(6)_Spot Applications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reduced requirements for recording information for spot applications were intended to provide private certified applicators with an incentive to record small spot applications on noxious weeds or similar type applications, without recording each location, due to the usually small amount of pesticide associated with a spot treatment. Concerns were raised that the spot application record provision does not require a specific location for each spot application, which could be important information for the purpose of providing first aid or medical treatment. USDA has reviewed the spot application provision and agrees that, in some instances, the location of spot applications could be valuable information when needed to determine if a pesticide exposure could have occurred in a field or area. Therefore, we are proposing to delete &sect;110.3(a)(6). Under the proposed regulations, spot applications would be required to be recorded in the same manner as are other applications of federally restricted use pesticides. This would provide field or area locations which could be utilized to help determine if an individual could have been exposed to a federally restricted use pesticide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendment to &sect;110.3(b)_Time for Making an Official Record <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USDA has reevaluated the 30 day time period allowed certified applicators to make an official record after concerns were expressed regarding the accuracy of the records for both collecting information for a pesticide use data base and for medical treatment if application information was not required to be recorded for 30 days. USDA recognizes the importance of compiling accurate pesticide use data and believes that data recorded in a shorter time period would be more accurate. USDA also reexamined existing State requirements for making official records of pesticide applications for private and commercial certified applicators. We found that many State regulations require applicators to have records available ``upon request'' which, in some situations, could be interpreted to be immediately after an application. Therefore, to assure more accurate information for both medical treatment and accuracy of collected data on pesticide use, USDA proposes to change the time period from 30 days to 7 days. USDA considers the proposed 7 day requirement adequate to allow the private certified applicator time to make an accurate official record without causing an undue hardship in peak production periods. This proposed requirement also is less stringent than similar existing State requirements for recordkeeping in many States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, concerns were raised regarding the certified applicator's responsibility to provide federally restricted use pesticide information concerning a specific application prior to the time to make an official record for purposes of providing medical treatment. USDA interprets the current regulations to require certified applicators to provide the record information for purposes of providing medical treatment or first aid, in accordance with the provisions of &sect;110.5(a), whether or not the time to make an official written record has elapsed. Nonetheless, in order to make this clear, we propose to add explicit language to this effect. The proposed amendment would read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The information required in this section shall be recorded within seven (7) days following the pesticide application. However, whether or not the written record has been completed, the certified applicator shall provide the information to be recorded in accordance with the provisions of &sect;110.5(a) of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendments to &sect;110.5(a)_Availability of Records to Facilitate Medical Treatment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Questions also have been raised concerning the availability of records to facilitate medical treatment. Concern was expressed that the current regulations could hinder access to record information if a strict interpretation was applied to the need for the licensed health care professional to personally make the record information request. USDA never intended to prevent an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health care professional from requesting record information. We are aware that, in some instances, the attending licensed health care professional may rely on a person acting under his/her direction to make the contacts necessary to obtain the pesticide record information. However, the regulations also presume the request for pesticide record information is supported by indications of pesticide exposure and the need for medical treatment or first aid. For example, the attending licensed health care professional, such as a registered nurse, may determine that the pesticide record information will be necessary to treat the patient, and instruct someone under his/her direction, to obtain the record information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

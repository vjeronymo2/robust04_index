			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / People: John Young enters SIB scrum from SFA For an organisation to pick a new chief executive in the midst of a strategic review that could lead to its complete overhaul might seem a strange piece of timing. Yet that is just what the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's chief investment watchdog, has done. The job has gone to John Young, the heavy-smoking former England rugby international who runs the Securities and Futures Authority, one of the self-regulatory organisations presided over by the SIB. Young has the distinction of being the only SRO boss to have kept his organisation free of investment scandal since the new regime created by the Financial Services Act came into being in 1988. What sort of an SIB will he preside over, once the full-scale review of its activities by chairman Andrew Large is completed this spring? Unsurprisingly, Young himself has in the past advocated a slim-line SIB, leaving room for the SROs to spread their wings. The alternative is a strong, centralised agency modelled more on the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 'Somewhere in the middle of the range, rather than at either extreme,' was Young's prediction yesterday for the outcome of the Large review - though he claimed not to be privy to his future chairman's exact plans. The appointment, which takes effect in April, could signal a change in style at the SIB. A former stockbroker, Young was deputy senior partner of Simon &amp; Coates - bought out and eventually closed down by Chase Manhattan Bank - before moving to the Stock Exchange in 1982 as director of policy and planning. As a former practitioner, he will preside over an SIB whose senior staff was largely drawn from Whitehall. Young will take over from Roy Croft, chief executive since the SIB was created in 1985 and before that he was for long a civil servant at the Department of Trade and Industry. The 56-year-old Croft said yesterday that he had decided 18 months ago that he had spent long enough at the SIB, but had agreed to stay on when it became clear that former chairman Sir David Walker would soon be leaving.</p>

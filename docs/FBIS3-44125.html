			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The unarmed opposition political parties have  accused the Mozambican Government and the Mozambique National  Resistance, Renamo, of having blatantly violated the letter and  the spirit of Article 15 of the Electoral Law by appointing  avowed Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, Party and Renamo  members to the National Elections Commission.    Article 15 of the Electoral Law states that the National  Elections Commission will be made up of people whose  professional and personal attributes will guarantee a balanced  approach, objectivity, and independence in relation to all  political parties.    The Radio Mozambique news desk has received a communique  saying that, by appointing professed Frelimo and Renamo members  to the National Elections Commission, the two former warring  sides have created a precedent that may result in future  violations of the Electoral Law. That document also says that  such behavior creates the possibility and conditions for  disagreements that could have unforeseeable consequences because  it will hinder consensus within the National Elections  Commission.    The unarmed opposition political parties further note that  the government and Renamo are only worried about defending their  parties' interests, thereby ensuring that there will not be  honesty in the upcoming electoral process.    The communique issued by the unarmed opposition political  parties also says that Renamo has shown unprecedented  opportunism and a lack of democratic spirit by grabbing the 13  seats in the Central Electoral Administration Technical  Secretariat which had been reserved for all opposition parties.  According to the unarmed opposition, by resorting to such  behavior Renamo has tried to show that it heads the opposition,  while making it clear that its much vaunted interest in  democracy amounts to no more than a farce.    The unarmed opposition has also called on the Mozambican  Government and Renamo to reconsider their stands and to abide by  the Electoral Law.    The unarmed opposition political parties met in Maputo  yesterday to assess what they describe as the impact of  partisanship in the National Elections Commission and to discuss  the composition of the Elections Administration Technical  Secretariat, STAE.</p>

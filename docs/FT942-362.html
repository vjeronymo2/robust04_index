			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Panther Resources to join market Mr Andrew Perloff is making another attempt to gain full control of Etonbrook Properties and merge it with his Panther Securities. The move was revealed at the same time as the announcement that Panther, a property investment group, was coming to the market in a placing of 1.96m shares at 90p to raise a net Pounds 1.39m. Every five shares will have one warrant attached. Panther will be acquiring Mr Perloff's 30.7 per cent holding in Etonbrook for shares, taking its holding to 54.04 per cent of the ordinary shares, but only 42.33 per cent of the voting capital. It is intended to make an offer for the outstanding shares on the basis of five Panther shares plus one warrant for every five Etonbrook. Etonbrook's shares were unchanged at 106p yesterday. Mr Perloff said the moves were intended to tidy up the situation giving shareholders in Etonbrook the opportunity to be part of a larger company which could pay dividends immediately. He added that when he made the cash offer last year many people had not accepted because they wanted to stay with the new board, made up of Panther directors. The new offer would allow them to do so. Following the flotation and acquisition, Panther will have pro-forma net assets of Pounds 17m or 97p per share. The placing values the company at Pounds 15.8m. Mr Perloff and Mr Malcolm Bloch will hold a beneficial interest in 29.9 per cent, while Portnard, which is controlled by three trusts the beneficiaries of which include Mr Perloff and Mr Bloch, will hold 44.1 per cent. Over the period from the end of 1979 to the end of 1993 net assets have improved from Pounds 202,000 to Pounds 13.9m or 96p per share. It has a portfolio of 62 commercial properties of which 80 per cent are in the retail sector and 69 per cent in London and the south-east of England. Shares are expected to begin trading in late July.</p>

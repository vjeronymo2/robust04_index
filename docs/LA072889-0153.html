			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH LIFE: A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> TOUGH TIMES FOR TEENS;  </P> <P> AUTHOR'S SEMINARS HELP PARENTS IN COPING WITH STRESSES OF THE '80S  </P> <P> "It's never been harder to be a teen-ager or the parent of a teen-ager than it  is in the 1980s."  </P> <P> With this statement, Peter Buntman began his recent seminar, "Parent's Survival  Course," at the Yorba Linda Public Library.  </P> <P> In the spacious community room sat anxious and eager parents of teen-agers.  Some were seeking answers on how to handle their trouble-making children, while  others were there simply because they cared enough to be.  </P> <P> This free seminar was one of 81 that Buntman puts on during the year throughout  Los Angeles and Orange counties in affiliation with the Community Educational  Program sponsored by College Hospitals of Cerritos and Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Buntman is a co-author of a self-help book entitled "How to Live With Your  Teen-Ager -- A Survivor's Handbook for Parents" and is a licensed clinical  social worker who has been counseling teen-agers and their parents for 20  years.  </P> <P> During his seminar, Buntman insisted that being a teen-ager in today's society  is more difficult than it used to be because of the prevalence of drugs, peer  pressure concerning sex and the increasing number of single working parents.  </P> <P> He gave examples of typical adolescent behavior, saying it is quite common for  a teen-ager to not want to be with his parents, "to have this incredible  ability to be completely selfish and to have a need to rebel."  </P> <P> The teen-ager's effort to rebel is the most important behavior for a parent to  understand, according to Buntman, who grouped rebellious behavior into unsafe  and safe categories.  </P> <P> Unsafe rebellion, he said, manifests itself in such activities as cutting  school, not working to ability in school, involvement with drugs, sexual  activity, any criminal involvement and not listening to parents.  </P> <P> "Safely rebelling includes being messy and dirty, wearing your hair the way  your parents don't like, wearing clothes your parents don't like or listening  to music your parents don't like," Buntman said.  </P> <P> He gave an example of a safe rebellion from his own experience, remembering  when his daughter went through a phase of painted acrylic nails that went from  red to green to yellow to black. "She knew I hated the black ones," he said.  </P> <P> Buntman stressed the importance of knowing the difference between the two types  of rebellion. "What I see happen so often is that parents come down so hard on  the safe ways to rebel, they literally force their kids into unsafe rebellion."  </P> <P> To handle the resulting problems, Buntman advises: "Parents need to be firm,  strict, set limits and hold to their limits."  </P> <P> As punishment for going beyond these limits, Buntman recommends parents start  by taking away privileges -- access to a car or the phone -- for a period of  time. If this doesn't work, grounding should be the next step, he said.  </P> <P> And should grounding not persuade the teen-ager to cease and desist, Buntman  suggested taking the door off its hinges. Yes, the teen-ager's bedroom door.  And if all else fails, then everything in the teen-ager's room should be taken  out, except such necessities as the bed, a couple of changes of clothes and  books, he said.  </P> <P> But where do you store the furniture and personal belongings? Anywhere, Buntman  said -- the garage, the attic, the neighbor's garage . . . . "You will be  amazed at how helpful neighbors you hardly know can be," he said. "If they have  teen-aged children, too, they will sympathize with you."  </P> <P> Buntman said there are five skills that parents need in order to have a better  relationship with their teen-aged children:  </P> <P> First is building their adolescent's self-esteem. Research conducted at the  Center for Family Life Enrichment Inc., where Buntman works, showed that  parents, on the average, give their teen-ager one half of one compliment per  week.  </P> <P> "Give your kid one compliment every day," Buntman advises. "If you do just  this, you will be doing 14 times better than the national average."  </P> <P> The next skill is called "attentive listening." Parents need to listen to their  teen-agers without being judgmental or critical because by being those things,  they are putting their child down, Buntman said.  </P> <P> Third, instead of getting angry and resorting to name-calling, the parent  should use the "I" message.  </P> <P> The formula is simple: "I" plus "how you feel" plus "describing the situation  without using the word 'you.' " An example: "I get angry when people say  they'll do something and then they don't." This, Bunting says, is an  alternative to: "You are so stupid -- how many times must I tell you to clean  your room? If I told you once, I've told you a hundred times!"  </P> <P> The final two skills, Buntman said, are often referred to as "T&amp;T." The  national average for time -- the first "T" -- spent talking alone between  parent and teen-ager is seven minutes per week. The second "T" stands for  touch.  </P> <P> "Spend seven minutes a day talking to each of your kids," Buntman advised, "and  in some way, touch your kids every day."  </P> <P> Buntman also warned parents about teen-age suicide.  </P> <P> "You always will see some kind of a warning sign," he said. These signs range  from a noticeable change in eating or sleeping habits; withdrawal from friends,  family and regular activities; violent rebellious behavior and radical  personality changes to the more obvious, such as running away or putting  affairs in order by giving away personal belongings.  </P> <P> There may also be verbal warnings, such as "life isn't worth living," "I'd be  better off dead" or "I can't go on anymore."  </P> <P> Another possible sign may be when a teen-ager is depressed for a very long  time, possibly several months or even years, and then suddenly becomes  cheerful. "He may have made a decision to check out on us," Buntman warned.  </P> <P> "There are many things in life for which you get a second chance," he said. "If  the kid is on drugs, he can quit. If the kid drops out of school, he can go  back. But if the kid kills himself, that's it. There's no second chance."  </P> <P> "Any time you see a (warning) sign in any kid, immediately rush him to a  therapist to see how serious it is. Suicide is a major problem for teen-agers.  To a therapist who does nothing but work with teen-agers all day, this is  scary."  </P></p>

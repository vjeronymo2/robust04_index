			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Voytovich, Belarusian ambassador </F> extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lithuania, by Algimantas  Brazaitis in Vilnius; date not given: "Tied Scores Are Most  Important for Diplomats" -- questions published in boldface;  first paragraph is TIESA introduction]    [Excerpts] Yevgeniy Voytovich, former chief of the  "Belarusfilm" studio and the Belarusian State Cinematographic  Committee of many years, and the current ambassador to  Lithuania, gave an interview for TIESA. He spoke with reporter  Algimantas Brazaitis, former chairman of the Lithuanian  Cinematographic Committee.    [Brazaitis] Welcome to Lithuania. We, the former colleagues,  used to meet in Vilnius quite often. However, I would call this  meeting the first one due to your different position -- you are  the first Belarusian envoy to independent Lithuania. [passage  omitted]    [Voytovich] I am convinced that we will preserve the  tradition of friendship. The first indicator was the cultural  agreement between Belarus and Lithuania as independent states,  which I had the honor to sign with Dainius Trinkunas, your  minister of culture and education.    [Brazaitis]This agreement was really the first sign of  spring. However, after changing your position from the  Belarusian minister of culture to that of the first Belarusian  envoy to Lithuania, you will have to develop most diverse  relations. How do you imagine this mission and the future of  Lithuanian-Belarusian interstate relations?    [Voytovich] Any civilized state, and I believe  unconditionally that Lithuania and Belarus are such countries,  gives priority to its relations with the closest neighbors.  This is particularly vital to our nations with long-standing  friendship and similar fates. Due to their position in the  center of Europe and a peculiar buffer role between the East and  the West, they have experienced many crucial ordeals. [passage  omitted]    Having achieved independence, our nations are creating  democratic European states. In this case, the goals of Belarus  and Lithuania coincide. We have mutual interest from the  geopolitical and economic viewpoint. Our state has no access to  the sea, while the shortest road to a Baltic port runs across  your country. Your most direct transit routes to Ukraine,  Russia, and other Eastern states run through Belarus. Those  countries have a vast economic potential and boundless markets.    There are several other factors promoting cooperation and  providing chances for mutual benefit of our nations.    While presenting my credentials to His Excellency Lithuanian  President Algirdas Brazauskas, I stated: I believe that my key  and strategic goal and spiritual vocation as a Belarusian envoy  to the Republic of Lithuania is to do everything possible in  developing and strengthening our constant political and economic  relations. I am ready to keep my word.    [Brazaitis]Your persistence deserves respect. I know  your friendly attitude toward Lithuania which you demonstrate in  resolving the problems of cultural cooperation. However, some  politicians caused a commotion when you called Vilnius the  capital of Belarus in the Belarusian paper ZVYAZDA.    [Voytovich] While giving an interview for this paper, I  spoke  about historical, cultural, and spiritual relations between our  nations. I really stated that Vilnius was also the capital of  the Belarusians in the past. Our nations lived in the same  state and had one capital -- Vilnius -- during the times of the  Grand Dutchy of Lithuania.    I am convinced that history unites rather than divides us.  There was not the slightest hint in this phrase that I claimed  your beloved capital. Other interpretations of my words are  incorrect. I even stressed in the same interview that "all  issues must be resolved following the provision of the Helsinki  Final Act on the inviolability of borders in post-war Europe.  In my new office, I will place emphasis on mentality and a  peaceful attitude -- the traits typical of both nations. At the  same time, I will execute the conceptual policy of my parliament  and the government." This is exactly what was said and written.    [Brazaitis]Could you tell us a few words about  Adutiskis? This issue is still being discussed in the  Lithuanian and Belarusian press and politicians' offices.    [Voytovich] A problem does exist. However, I would request  reporters not to dramatize this situation. Emotions and strong  words are only an obstacle. A bilateral commission is working  on the delineation of the border, and it has already  accomplished much. The positions of the two parties have  differed even in 40 cases. However, following the principles of  parity in international relations and of the established use of  land, we have found a solution. I hope that by working in this  manner, the commission will find a solution for the Adutiskis  railway station acceptable to both parties.    [Brazaitis]Mr. Ambassador, while representing the  interests of the state, one must bear in mind the political  forces and consider relations between the ruling group and the  opposition in one's country. What could you tell TIESA readers  about such most prominent political leaders as V. Kebich, S.  Shushkevich, and Z. Poznyak?    [Voytovich] [passage omitted] I assess all the persons you  have listed as normal statesmen and politicians. I am convinced  that there can be no civilized state without an opposition.  Certainly, I wish the latter were less emotional and angry and  more objective, and had more arguments.    The upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections will  show the weight and recognition of political forces among the  population.    [Brazaitis]Yevgeniy Konstantinovich, our readers would  like to learn more about you.    [Voytovich] I was born in a village near Minsk. I graduated  from a technical school and an institute. I also finished  postgraduate studies. I am a master of economics.    My work record is rather vivid -- from a metal worker to a  minister and an envoy. I wish I had been a teacher.  Pedagogical experience would be very useful now.    I am fond of theater, music, and art. I also read fiction,  but I prefer historical novels. I play chess. What about a  game? I promise a tied score.    [Brazaitis]Thank you. I understand that tied scores are the  most valuable victories for diplomats.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Taiwan share row raises worries on Belfast plant The British government yester-day launched an urgent inquiry into a Taipei stock market controversy involving subsidiaries of Hualon, a Taiwanese group which is due to receive Pounds 61m of aid for a contentious textiles plant project in Belfast. The affair, which sent Taipei share prices plunging for the second consecutive day yesterday, broke as Taiwanese authorities detained senior executives of Hualon for questioning and suspended trading by two of the group's brokerage houses after a series of payment defaults. This is the second stock market controversy in two years linked to Mr Oung Ta-Ming, one of Taiwan's wealthiest businessmen, who effectively heads Hualon but occupies no formal position in the group. In 1992 a Taiwan court sentenced Mr Oung to 3 1/2 years in prison for breach of trust, though the conviction was later overturned on appeal. Northern Ireland's Department of Economic Development said it was seeking urgently to establish exactly what had happened in the Taipei market. The inquiry is being handled by officials from the department and the industrial development board, which has an office in Taipei. Brokers in Taipei said yesterday's 4.2 per cent fall in the stock market occurred when retail investors learned underground financiers had abruptly withdrawn funds advanced to speculators, triggering defaults. The Taiwan Securities and Exchange Commission said the defaults so far involved 18 local brokerage houses and amounted to TDollars 6.6bn, but that the final total could turn out to be higher. The commission said TDollars 2.7bn (Pounds 65.10m) of the defaults involved companies linked to Hualon and it ordered Hung Fu Securities and Yung Feng Securities to suspend trading. Mr Day Linin, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the Taiwan stock exchange would use a TDollars 9bn stabilisation fund, established after a similar affair two years ago, to cover share payment defaults. Four associates of Mr Oung were detained at Chiang Kai-Shek International airport early yesterday as they went to board a flight to Hong Kong. Though Mr Oung, as a member of Taiwan's parliament, is effectively immune from prosecution, his and Hualon's involvement in the incident threaten further to embarrass the Northern Ireland Office. The office has already been criticised for backing the Pounds 157m Belfast textiles plant. European textile manufacturers are challenging in the European Court the European Commission's decision earlier this year to approve aid for the plant.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Sharp downturn in Gan result GAN, the French state-controlled insurance group which is a candidate for privatisation under France's new conservative government, suffered a sharp fall in net profits to FFr402m last year from FFr2.32bn (Dollars 420m) in 1991. Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman, said Gan's performance this year would 'depend on economic conditions'. Despite the group's poor performance, he said its main objective in 1993 was to prepare for privatisation. Gan, like the other big French insurers, was badly affected last year by the intensely-competitive state of the insurance market, particularly the damage sector. Union des Assurances de Paris and Assurances Generales de France, the other two state-controlled insurers, have already announced steep falls in profits for 1992. However, Gan has been more vulnerable to the economic squeeze than its competitors, chiefly because of its exposure to the depressed property sector. This posed a dual problem last year because of the shortfall in profits on asset sales and the need to make heavy provisions on its property interests. Insurance sales rose from FFr39.7bn to FFr43.7bn in 1992 but profits from insurance fell from FFr1.5bn to FFr200m. Worst hit was damage insurance, which made a loss of FFr1.1bn against a FFr501m profit, due to an increase in claims, particularly in fraudulent ones.</p>

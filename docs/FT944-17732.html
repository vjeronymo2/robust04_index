			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries retreat continues in wake of order data The US Treasury market retreated further yesterday after fresh signs that the economy is growing too fast. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 5/8 at 94 15/16 , with the yield rising to 7.938 per cent. On the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 19/32 , to yield 6.704 per cent. Bonds showed little early movement as traders awaited the government's figures on August factory orders. Although the market had been jittery, the report was not expected to be much of an obstacle. However, bonds tumbled on the news of a 4.4 per cent gain, after a 2.0 per cent drop the previous month. Economists were expecting a smaller increase of about 3.5 per cent. Traders were particularly disturbed by a surprising 2.5 per cent jump in orders of non-durable goods, an area of slow growth in recent months. It was another in a series of reports indicating that the Fed had not done enough yet to slow down the economy. The data seemed to assure that the central bank would increase short-term interest rates for the sixth time in the current cycle of tightenings. Against this backdrop, the fresh declines in bonds put the market in a precarious position. With Friday's critical employment report fast approaching, the yield on the long bond was hovering just under the 8.00 per cent level, an important psychological barrier which might contain any fall in bond prices on stronger-than-expected jobs data. The consensus of analysts was that non-farm payrolls had grown by about 250,000 workers last month. But in view of the string of negative surprises in recent weeks, traders were braced for the worst. Many were speculating that the big jump in payrolls could motivate the Fed to lift rates immediately. European government bonds opened on a weaker note after US bonds had fallen overnight and tumbled further in the afternoon when Treasuries slid to new lows on stronger than expected economic data. The eruption of renewed political turmoil in Italy, pre-election jitters in Germany and sharp declines in many equity markets further depressed bonds. Italian bonds nosedived on fears that an investigation into one of the Italian prime minister's television holdings may implicate Silvio Berlusconi himself. In late trading the December BTP future on Liffe stood at 97.48, down 1.54 point, after hitting a low of 96.90. Bond market participants now worry that the flare-up of political tensions will complicate the passage of the 1995 budget in parliament by the end of the year. 'Given that the budget was already not received very enthusiastically by the market, this worsens the prospects,' said Mr Jose Luis Alzola, an economist at Salomon Brothers. Although he said that yesterday's sell-off could be followed by a technical correction, he added, 'I am sceptical that the spread over bunds can approach, let alone breach, 400 basis points.' The gap widened to 452 basis points yesterday. UK gilts remained surprisingly calm in the face of tumbling markets, outperforming most of their European counterparts and shrugging off a sharp fall in the FT-SE 100 index. The December long gilt futures contract in Liffe eased by  1/4 to 99 1/32 , and the 10-year yield gap over German bunds narrowed to 133 basis points. According to Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, gilts have 'perked up' since the recent base rate rise, helped in large part by the strength of sterling. German bunds shed about  1/2 point in sympathy with the drop in US Treasuries. The December bund future on Liffe was down 0.46 point at 87.88 late trading.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VETERAN BROADCASTER HERMAN DEPARTS KFWB  </P> <P> Veteran Los Angeles broadcaster Cleve Herman, who has been with KFWB-AM (980)  as a sports and news reporter since 1952, has left the station, the  fast-talking radio man said Friday.  </P> <P> While Ken Beck, the all-news station's news director, described the departure  as retirement, Herman said that he "would not describe it as retiring, but  regrouping or retooling myself for what 1990s news is going to be. We (he and  station management) had grave professional and philosophical differences about  the news and reporting that has caused us to have an amicable parting."  </P> <P> Herman, 72, was last heard on the station last Sunday.  </P> <P> Herman worked at KFWB for 37 years, reaching back to a time when the station  was No. 1 in the local market with a mix of Top 40 music and news reports, and  he said he had intended to work well into his 80s.  </P> <P> He plans now to work on a novel about the radio business and he said he is open  to other broadcasting opportunities.  </P> <P> Herman worked at both the Los Angeles Express and the old Daily News before  moving to broadcasting in 1952.

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Drop kick for the punt Ireland accepted on Saturday that virtue goes unrewarded in the ERM. On fundamental criteria like budget deficit and inflation, it did not deserve the humiliation of devaluation against the D-Mark. That the exchange markets thought otherwise is a reflection of two factors with increasing bearing on attitudes to the system as a whole. By sticking with its previous exchange rate, Ireland was storing up huge problems for itself in terms of unemployment and deflation; its industry had also become hopelessly uncompetitive compared with that of the UK which has left the shackles of the ERM behind. The temptation for other ERM countries to gain competitive edge through devaluation is all the greater as the economic outlook in Europe deteriorates. With hindsight, it would have been more sensible to negotiate a general realignment last autumn. That would have allowed the D-Mark to appreciate and kept the other ERM currencies in better relationship to each other. Instead, the vain determination of finance ministers to stay the course has not only given speculators easy profits. It has also undermined the credibility of a system that had previously served Europe well. In so far as France stood in the way of a general realignment, it must share the blame for what has happened since. The chances are that the franc will come under renewed attack. With the support of the Bundesbank, the marauders may once again be repelled. But that would not be a victory for the system as a whole. It would look instead as though an express route to monetary union had opened up for the favoured few, regardless of policy proclamation to the contrary. The problems of those on the periphery remain exemplified by Ireland. Its devaluations looks adequate now, but the advantage will quickly erode if the UK really is set on a policy of slashing interest rates and allowing sterling to fall. Ireland could then discover that it would have been better to leave the system altogether.</p>

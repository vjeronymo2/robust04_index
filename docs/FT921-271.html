			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: EC partners keep one eye on presidency - View from: Brussels BRUSSELS is watching the UK election campaign very closely, though its attention has been more focused on the French regional polls because of what they might portend for an early return of Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, to Paris. Britain's European Community partners harbour a mix of hope and fear about the outcome on April 9 - with the mix differing in each of the 11 countries. Perhaps their common trepidation about Labour coming to power is simply the concern about a relatively unknown and totally untried government taking over the presidency of the EC council of ministers. When the UK takes the presidency on July 1 it will confront a difficult agenda, with future financing of the EC almost certainly still to settle and the question of how and when to take in new members to resolve. But all Britain's European partners, and the EC institutions, are agreed on one thing. A Labour victory would untangle the knot into which Mr John Major, the prime minister, tied the EC by refusing to go along with social policy at Maastricht. Labour has said it would immediately subscribe to the Maastricht treaty protocol which seeks to extend social policy regulation further and faster by the use of majority voting. Quite how a Labour government would make Britain's change of heart legally effective, at this late stage, is not clear. The Maastricht treaty, with all its protocols and annexes, has been signed. Some governments - notably Denmark which is busy distributing copies around the country in advance of its June 2 referendum on Maastricht - have already put the treaty to their parliaments. A brief inter-governmental conference on social policy would probably have to follow a Labour victory. With the three main UK parties broadly in favour of Maastricht, it is clear that European political and monetary union does not ride on the outcome of the British election, as it may do in the Danish referendum or in the eventual Bundestag debate. But the Commission has, for some months now, been pulling its punches in order not to stir up 'Euro-aggro' in Britain. It has, for instance: Delayed, until after April 9, its report on the system whereby Britain has had a two-thirds rebate on its contribution to the EC. This is likely to be as controversial as the other aspects of the Commission's requested funding for 1993-97, which have now all been published. Germany, a far bigger net contributor than the UK, gets no rebate itself and has signalled it no longer wants to contribute to the UK rebate. Delayed until April a report which will make clear its view that Britain is under a legal obligation from the Single European Act to abolish frontier checks on people, as well as goods, crossing intra-EC borders. The UK government contends that the 'free movement' provisions of the act apply only to EC citizens, and that it has the right to check the documents of non-EC travellers. Agreed to a UK request to postpone a March 11 hearing at the European Court of Justice on the Commission's complaint that the UK is infringing EC law on the purity of bathing water on certain Lancashire beaches. Britain's partners are well aware that a Labour victory might change the balance of Community argument on several issues. On the move to economic and monetary union, Labour has argued for more attention to be paid to real convergence (growth, employment and regional development) between states, as well as the nominal convergence (on debt, inflation and interest rates) prescribed in the Maastricht treaty. Labour has, for instance, said it would use the presidency to convene a special 'jobs' summit between EC finance and employment ministers. A Labour victory would mean that Sir Leon Brittan, the senior Tory-nominated UK Commissioner, could only stay on in Brussels if the Conservatives agreed, in a more junior post than the powerful competition portfolio he presently holds. The likelihood of his departure, and the fact that no other European government is likely to appoint so free-market a liberal, would tilt the Commission view crucially on industrial policy.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Peace, goodwill and profits in Santa theme parks: Hugh Carnegy on how four Nordic countries have put the Christmas story to work for them If you believe everything you hear in the Nordic countries, four Santa Clauses will be heading for your chimney stack tonight. Christmas may only come once a year but in the north the legend of Father Christmas is a year-round business that begs a rather sensitive question about where Santa really comes from. In four countries - Greenland, Finland, Norway and Sweden - you can visit Santa centres where you can meet the 'real' Santa Claus in his 'real' northern fastness, tour his workshop and, of course, spend lots of money on souvenirs, in restaurants and on such suitable activities as taking a sleigh ride. Everyone involved in Nordic Santa operations is a little coy about the inherent paradox in the proposition that there are four of the benevolent, bearded old men. Destroying the myth of a single Santa might upset an awful lot of children - not to mention damage a good business. 'We don't like to encourage rivalry between us,' says Mr Mauri Hakulinen, marketing director of Finland's Santa centre near Rovaniemi in the Arctic Circle. 'It doesn't serve the children who want to fulfil their dreams. If people want to go to Norway or Sweden and are satisfied, then that's fine by us.' A colleague from another of the region's Santa parks puts it rather more succinctly. 'Nobody can own Santa - but everybody can profit from him.' The competition may be discreet, but it has become real enough as the ambitions of the Santa centre operators have grown over the past decade. The least successful, with just 15,000 visitors a year - probably because of its inaccessibility - has been Greenland's Yuletide park, recently relaunched with a hefty government subsidy after going bust. In Rovaniemi, the Santa attractions are part of a larger Arctic Circle Centre set up in 1985 as a focus of tourism in Finnish Lappland. It brings almost 500,000 visitors a year to its range of 30 shops, restaurants and other attractions. Annual turnover is around FM30m (Pounds 4m) a year but one of the ironies of the Santa business is that peak season is in the summer - winter is too dark and cold to attract many foreigners. Rovaniemi has a reputation as the most overtly commercial of the Nordic Santa parks. Since it opened, travel agents have chartered a Concorde every Christmas to bring in families from the UK, often for a one-day visit. But Santa World (Tomteland in Swedish) near Mora in central Sweden has also developed into a busy theme park since it was established in 1984, attracting 150,000 visitors a year and achieving turnover of SKr35m (Pounds 3m). Mr Peter Wahlberg, the main owner, reports cheerfully that Santa World is 'very profitable', although he declines to give a figure. Apart from Santa's home and workshop - the latter housed in what is claimed to be Europe's biggest log cabin - the park offers everything from elf shows in the forest to skiing and, in summer, Santa's golf course, Santa's swimming pool and Santa's campground. Yulhuset (Christmas House), operated by Willy and Eva Johansan in Droebak, just south of the Norwegian capital of Oslo, is a less extensive centre but still claims 250,000 visitors a year, including many from Japan, where Scandinavian Santas apparently have a strong appeal. The irony of the whole Nordic Santa business is that the legend of a benevolent Santa Claus conflicts with the original Scandinavian folk myth of a magical Christmas-time visitor. The Norwegian 'Nisse' and Swedish 'Tomte' were evil figures who had to be appeased with gifts from each family. 'The real Scandinavian Santa was a nasty, ugly little elf who caused trouble all year round, letting the cattle out of the barn and other things like that,' explains Mr Wahlberg. 'You had to leave out sweet rice porridge and other offerings for him at Christmas-time so he would leave you in peace.' At some point over the past 100 years, however, this legend got confused with the Americanised version of a jolly fellow in fur-trimmed red costume who handed out presents to the world's children. This in turn was an adaption of a Dutch wintertime tradition of Sinterklaas (St Nicholas) leaving gifts to children in a shoe on the night of December 6. The original St Nicholas was a 4th century archbishop who lived in Lycia, part of what is now southern Turkey. Every Nordic Santa centre is aware of these uncomfortable details. But business is business. 'To claim that Santa is here is a big responsibility,' says Mr Hakulinen in Rovaniemi. 'But it is a well known fact that Santa Claus travels with reindeer and up here in Lappland it is full of reindeer.'</p>

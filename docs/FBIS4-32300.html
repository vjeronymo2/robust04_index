			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by SME--is, so: "Credit Assistance for the Slovak </F> Republic by the World Bank Is Supposed To Amount to $700  Million"]    [Text] Bratislava (SME--is, so)--The loan from the  World Bank (WB) to restructure the enterprise and finance sector  (EFSAL) is dependent upon obtaining a standby loan from the  International Monetary Fund (IMF). These days, the government is  negotiating with the IMF regarding the standby loan, and the  preliminary agreement regarding the granting of the loan (letter  of intent) should be signed by the end of this week. This was  mentioned yesterday at a short briefing at the time of the  consultation of economic ministers by B. Schmoegnerova, deputy  prime minister.    The negotiations were participated in also by a mission from  the World Bank, under the leadership of Vice President M. Bruno,  which is paying a working visit to Slovakia. As noted by E.  Zirnansky, press secretary of the Ministry of Finance, the loan  will be made up of several draws, and its total value will be  approximately $100-120 million. According to him, the World Bank  is considering increasing the overall volume of credits for the  Slovak Republic to approximately $700 million in the next two to  four years. As noted by Schmoegnerova, sector loans are being  worked out to help complete housing construction projects within  the framework of the KBV [Complex Housing Construction], to  restructure the labor market, and rebuild forestry. P. Koncos,  minister of agriculture, added that the loan to improve and  renew the forests is expected to make a contribution toward  preventing unprocessed logs from being exported from Slovakia  and should assist in having the maximum amount of timber  processed in the lumber and furniture industry in Slovakia. The  loan for completion of complex housing construction (KBV) is  supposed to be made available by the World Bank to the Slovak  Republic this year. "Experts from the World Bank and the  Ministry of Transportation, Communications, and Public Works  (MDSVP) have already visited 30-34 localities where the use of  loan funds is being contemplated. This will be a question of  municipal housing; the conditions for granting the loan are  technical in nature," the deputy prime minister said in response  to a question by SME.    After a year of using subsidies in a program to reduce the  consumption of fuels and energy in apartment buildings and  apartments, the Ministry of Economics is submitting  modifications for this program to the government. "This year,  subsidies should continue to be used also for interest-free  loans for periods of three years. The budget includes 100  million Slovak korunas [Sk] for projects designed to improve  heat and insulation characteristics, the regulation of  heat-generating facilities, the reconstruction of thermal  resources, the installation of measuring and regulating  equipment, and the reduction of consumption of electric energy.  These projects, which could cost as much as Sk3 million, will be  gathered by the MDSVP and our ministry until the end of July,"  said A. Oparty, state secretary of the Ministry of Economics.  Conditions for announcing projects will be published by the  government once they are approved. Another of the points  discussed by the economic ministers was also the proposal to  amend the law on consumer taxes. The government will discuss  this proposal today.</p>

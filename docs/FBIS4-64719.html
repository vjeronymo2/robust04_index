			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos  commented on an Albanian television report that said that the  issue of Tsamidhes [Muslims living in Greece who went to Albania  after World War II] was discussed at the recent meeting between  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Albanian Foreign Minister  Alfred Serreqi in Zurich. Venizelos said the statements are  inaccurate. Venizelos added that even if the Albanian side had  raised such an issue, Greece would not have agreed to discuss  it. [passage omitted]</p>

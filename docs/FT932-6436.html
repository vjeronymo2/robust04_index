			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / People: Marshall begins to reshape British Airways board Sir Colin Marshall, who took over as chairman of British Airways in February, has started to reshape his board of directors by appointing a couple of fellow Midland Bank directors to his own board. Baroness O'Cathain, 55, managing director of London's Barbican Centre, (pictured left) becomes the first woman on the BA board. She is joined by Charles Mackay, 53, chief executive of Inchcape (pictured right). The appointments are the first to be made since the furore caused by Virgin Atlantic's allegations that BA was conducting a 'dirty tricks' against it. The Virgin Atlantic row precipitated the early retirement of Lord King, Sir Colin's predecessor, and there had been concern in some quarters of the City that the BA board had not been as effective as it might have been in monitoring the actions of BA's executives. Several of the non-executives are friends of Lord King and there was a feeling that the board needed to be strengthened by the appointment of some more independent outsiders. The appointment of two new non-executive directors will go some way towards meeting these concerns and will mean that non-executives will be in a majority on the BA board. Detta O'Cathain is a successful business woman, who also sits on the boards of Tesco and Sears. Charles Mackay is well respected in the City and has strong connections in the Far East. Baroness O'Cathain said yesterday that the airline business had always been in her blood. She started her career as an accounts clerk with Aer Lingus and her husband, William Bishop, used to work for the Irish airline. She announced yesterday that she had resigned from the board of Midland Bank where she had been a director for 9 years.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and retailing group reporting on Tuesday, is expected to show a rise of some 24 per cent in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 290m - but by a more modest 7 per cent if exceptionals and restructuring costs are excluded. The pace of progress at the trading level is likely to be even slower. The results will include the first contribution from its UK brewing joint venture with Carlsberg launched early this year into a fiercely competitive and still declining UK beer market. The pub trade recovery remains patchy. PowerGen, the electricity generator, is expected to announce half year profits of between Pounds 105m and Pounds 110m on Wednesday, against interims last year of Pounds 95m. City attention will focus on dividends. Following the company's announcement of a change in cover policy, analysts expect dividends to rise by at least 15 per cent annually in the next few years. But with the industry regulator considering whether to refer PowerGen and National Power to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, there is pressure on the company to be conservative. Scottish Power, the vertically integrated electricity company will announce half year figures on Thursday with analysts expecting about Pounds 107m-Pounds 118m, against Pounds 95m this time last year, and a dividend of 4.09p-4.12p (3.72p). Interim results from Northern Foods due on Tuesday are expected to have a downbeat tone although pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from Pounds 68.4m to around Pounds 72m for the half to end-September. Although still chirpy at the annual meeting, the company has encountered worsening trading conditions since the second quarter.</p>

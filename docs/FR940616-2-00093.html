This plan covers a 65,020 acre area in eastern Kern County which is important habitat for the federally listed threatened desert tortoise. This plan was necessitated by the requirements of the Endangered Species Act (EPA) to protect a threatened species in an area subject to conflicting uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The plan has 88 major management decisions which put restrictions on all uses in the area for the purpose of protecting the native desert tortoise population, its habitat and the area's ecosystem. These plan use restrictions include restricting off-highway vehicle (OHV) use to a maximum of 129 miles of designated vehicular routes, restricting overnight camping to designated campsites, prohibiting all competitive OHV events and restricting use of firearms except for the lawful taking of upland game birds within an area identified for such use. The existing West Rand ACEC area will be expanded by 13,120 acres and changed from a Moderate to a Limited Multiple-Use Class under the California Desert Plan. A total of 32,590 acres of the plan area will be withdrawn from mineral entry. The plan designates 44,800 acres as category 1 desert tortoise habitat. USFWS consultations will be required pursuant to section 7 of the ESA when processing any new project proposals allowed under the plan which could impact the desert tortoise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This plan covers all public lands in the Rand Mountains-Fremont Valley Management Area which is generally bounded by the community of Randsburg, CA and U.S. Highway 395 on the east, the Garlock and Randsburg-Red Rock Roads on the north, the western edge of Koehn Dry Lake and the Desert Tortoise Natural Area on the west, and private lands encompassed by the incorporated city limites of California City, CA on the south. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ORDER:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Notice is hereby given that effective July 18, 1994, the following use restrictions will be in effect on public lands in the Rand Mountains-Fremont Valley Management Area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. No person may use, drive or otherwise operate a motorized vehicle except on those designated routes of travel that are identified by open route signs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. No person may discharge a firearm at any time except shotguns and then only from September 1 through January 31st for the lawful taking of upland game birds in the upland and mountains portion of the area as identified in the plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Camping is prohibited except in the eastern portion of the management area at sites identified in the plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exemptions to this order include any otherwise authorized activity or as approved by the California Desert District Manager or the Ridgecrest Area Manager. Maps identifying the plan area, plan use restrictions, and the network of designated vehicular routes of travel are available from the Ridgecrest Resource Area office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authority for these plan restrictions is found in 43 CFR 8364.1. Violation of these restrictions is punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or 12 months in jail. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this plan and use restrictions is to provide increased protection for the desert tortoise populations and its habitat in an important part of its range. The desert tortoise was listed as a threatened species under the ESA in 1989 and is afforded increased protection under terms of the Act and this plan. During the interim while this plan was developed, the Bureau initiated a 14 month temporary closure for the plan area and then reopened the area on November 22, 1990 to restricted use pending approval of the final plan. Since November 22, 1990, Bureau personnel along with a large group of California Off-Road Vehicle Association volunteers have worked to implement the plan decisions on an interim basis as approved through a consultation with the USFWS and January 23, 1991  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> notice. This interim FR notice will expire upon publication of this FR notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A formal section 7 consultation on this plan was conducted with the USFWS and a non-jeopardy biological opinion was issued on March 10, 1993. This opinion provided additional terms and Conditions which were incorporated into the plan. The opinion determined that this plan would result in management actions that would greatly reduce the existing magnitude of adverse impacts to the desert tortoise and its habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A 10 member volunteer Technical Review Team (TRT) was instrumental in the development of this plan. Team members represented all primary interest groups, the CDFG and California City. They met regularly for three years to evaluate available data and made management recommendations for the plan. The TRT is continuing to assist in reviewing procedures for implementing the plan decisions and evaluating the plan effectiveness in protecting the plan areas desert tortoise populations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The decision is effective July 18, 1994.

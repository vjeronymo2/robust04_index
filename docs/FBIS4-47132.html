			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Doctor of Economic Sciences Aleksandr </F> Yakovlevich Livshits, professor, director of a group of experts  under the RF President, by Anatoliy Pokrovskiy; place and date  not given: "Economy Cannot Be Built on Illusions"]    [Text] The editorial department introduced this  column "A View From the Kremlin" in order to familiarize our  readers at first hand, as people say, with different points of  view of diverse events in Russia's troubled life. One can agree  or disagree with the arguments expressed here. However, in order  to argue with someone with good reasoning, one must first listen  to him attentively.    The person with whom we are talking today is Doctor of  Economic Sciences Aleksandr Yakovlevich Livshits, professor,  director of a group of experts under the RF President. He  graduated from the Institute of the National Economy imeni G.V.  Plekhanov in the specialized field of economic cybernetics and  worked at Moscow State Technological University. He defended his  candidate dissertation in the department headed by academician  L. Abalkin. He is the author of the first textbook in market  economy in Russia.    [Pokrovskiy] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, recently,  representatives  of various parties and scientific schools and trends have  published such a large number of economic theories, guesses, and  forecasts that it looks as if so-called simple folk, business  people, and foreign investors simply have lost their orientation  in the ways of Russia's development. However, not long ago the  RF President issued a whole package of edicts of an economic  nature. Does this mean that, as physicists say, islands of  stability, on the basis of which we can move toward an upsurge  in Russia's economy, have finally been discovered?    [Livshits] I am one of the people who think that we have  more  than enough programs, if not other things. At least one of them  should be fulfilled, instead of inventing new theoretical  dreams. I will say right away that the government has a specific  program and there is also the president's message. This is quite  sufficient for the beginning of purposeful work.    I have a very firm impression that, with the exception of  very extremist positions--for example, the state is weak, one  cannot rely on it, it will lead us to the wrong place, let  everything proceed by itself--there is a general understanding  of what should be done. Please note: The president's message is  devoted to the strengthening of the state. This is its main  point.    And so, what is to be done? The idea is as follows: To  maintain the saturation of the consumer market to the maximum  possible degree at tolerable prices. Not to permit sharp jumps  here, at the same time, shifting the center of gravity of  reforms to production reform. Of what can we boast here?  People's economic psychology, including that of boards of  directors, has changed noticeably. Enterprise managers now think  about demand, although some people, in the old way, try only to  extract money from the budget. But a breakthrough did occur.  There is voucher privatization and there are a number of other  changes.    However, production reform is a long and difficult matter  and  we must deal with it step-by-step. In particular, let us examine  the problem of prices. Here my personal point of view does not  coincide in everything with my friends' opinion. During these  years we have learned the ability to affect inflation rates, if  nothing else. In principle, if the task of reducing inflation  rates to 2 or 3 percent in 2 months is set, the government knows  how to do this technically. However, Russia's industry and  Russia's economy will not withstand the methods, by means of  which it is possible to bring down inflation so sharply.    Yes, all of us want prices of goods not to rise, but this  can  be achieved only at too high a price. Therefore, I have taken  the liberty of saying that there is a dangerously high  inflation, but there is also a dangerously low inflation, which  will immediately affect production development.    [Pokrovskiy] Very likely, this threatens to cause not only a  decline in production, but also a rise in unemployment.    [Livshits] Yes, it is also necessary to significantly limit  state expenditures. Yet many enterprises now live and work at  their expense. If these expenditures are cut down completely,  enterprises will not withstand this. For now such is our life,  whether we like this or not. Therefore, the whole subtle point  is to maintain the forecast moderate inflation and to direct all  efforts toward production reform. One of the president's key  edicts is devoted to reform of state enterprises. I assume that  it will be followed by some other edicts. However, their meaning  is one--to establish the rights of the state as an owner in a  sector where state enterprises operate. In other words, to  restore the manageability of enterprises belonging to the state  itself. After all, it is obvious that such an enterprise belongs  not to the director alone. It is common and cannot serve the  interests of one person or groups of people.    [Pokrovskiy] Please excuse me, but then what is to be done  with conversion into joint stock companies and privatization?    [Livshits] There is no contradiction here, because it is  only  a matter of "public" enterprises. The edict states this  precisely: A decision on the establishment of a public plant can  be made only with regard to an industrial or an agricultural  federal state enterprise, the privatization of which is  prohibited by the state program. And so, there can be no  questions with the private sector.    I will even say more. I think that some time will pass and  the word "nationalization" will cease to be abusive. There is no  contradiction here and I am by no means an admirer of the  planning system. I am simply for a flexible, pragmatic approach  to economic development without any "taboos." In normal  economies there is both privatization and temporary  nationalization with subsequent reprivatization. The point is  that in economic policy there is nothing absolutely harmful or  absolutely useful. These qualities are determined only by  expediency and extent. If during some period privatization is  advantageous and useful for Russia, it should be carried out to  the extent to which it is useful. If, however, nationalization  is needed, this, too, should be done without thinking about some  ideological lack of coordination. Such an approach to this  matter dominates in the world with benefit for production.    I repeat: Everything in moderation. When one nationalizes  everything and makes a single state machine, we all know that  this ends sadly. However, it by no means follows from this that  "nationalization" should be eliminated from the dictionary of  the Russian language.    [Pokrovskiy] Then the meaning of the president's latest  edicts is that all forms of ownership must be used?    [Livshits] It is more utilitarian and concrete. They have  double meaning. First: To begin production reform. Second:  Strengthening of financial discipline and introduction of order  in payments and taxes. In this connection I want to say: There  is nothing exotic in them. Now we have already received the  first information on the reaction to them.    What is especially interesting here? No one accepts this  fully, but no one fully rejects this either. This is good. Our  president should be the president of all Russia--not communist,  or democratic, or monarchic, or some other Russia. He would be  able to find the common things that unite the maximum number of  Russians.    Now we often hear from some people: Yes, this is correct,  but  I talked about this a year ago. From others: Yes, this is  correct, but we talked about this 2 years ago. They finally have  begun to act. And this is good, because this means: There is  nothing extravagant, which no one expects, in the edicts. If  this were vice versa--"we need this like snow on the head"--this  would be harmful. And if they talked about this earlier, this  means that the problem is urgent.    And another thing. Well, who does not want to introduce  order  in finances and to establish discipline in calculations?  However, is it really normal that an enterprise is almost  sinking and withholding workers' wages, at the same time, having  currency funds in its account? Therefore, under certain  conditions one of the president's edicts introduces an  obligatory exchange of currency for rubles: Pay into the budget,  pay wages.    However, why does the president in his edict have to force  the owner to spend his funds on these purposes? This is strictly  a phenomenon of the transitional period. Can you imagine such a  thing in England? There, if an owner does not have pounds  sterling, he calmly converts dollars and settles his account. It  does not even occur to him to hold back payments.    I will explain: The president did not begin with edicts.  There were negotiations, there was a message, and there was a  memorandum on the most acute problem--nonpayments. It came to  the government and to the State Duma. The government reacted  quickly. An answer came from the State Duma: We approve  everything. Well, what of that? For 1 and 1/2 months we waited  for the Duma, from the approval, to turn to the necessary  amendments to the law, which would make it possible to weaken  the acuteness of nonpayments. In brief, there is no  confrontation, but there is also no action.    I would say the following: When the president has to  undertake such decisions, these are forced steps. After all, in  principle, the economy should be regulated by statutes and by  economic law. Of course, if clear-cut decisions had been adopted  promptly, in accordance with the demands of life, these edicts  would not have been needed.    [Pokrovskiy] However, who should adopt such decisions?    [Livshits] Of course, the Duma. The Duma, who else? It  adopts  laws. However, production cannot wait. We received data on 22  days in May... The decline continues. How much can one wait?  Therefore, it was very hard for me to receive the news from the  Duma. I will tell you as the representative of PRAVDA that  communists in the Duma came out against these edicts as  anticonstitutional. However, did communists not propose that  order and discipline be introduced? And if someone tries to do  this, what is bad about this?    [Pokrovskiy] However, every party in its policy proceeds  from  its own principles, from its own programs...    [Livshits] To this I will answer that the time has come to  free ourselves from some customary illusions. The first of  them--the idea of the beneficial nature of constant prices.  However, weather changes and over the years even a wife changes.  Why should prices be constant? After all, the stiffness of  prices fetters the market mechanism. The second--the need for a  full loading of enterprise capacities. To many it seems that,  previously, we worked in three shifts and now we have changed  over to one--this is a disaster! I assure you that this is a  normal situation. In all countries with a market economy there  is even a specific index for the government--the level of  loading of a production apparatus. For example, in the United  States a loading of 75 to 80 percent is considered normal. A  loading of 20 to 25 percent represents a frozen capacity in case  of changes in demand. If there is a package of orders, it is put  into operation. An economy, the capacities of which constantly  operate 100 percent, is just as unnatural and unpleasant for  life as a country in which there is always summer.    The main problem lies in reliably controlling the optimum  degree of loading: Does the decline proceed in an uncontrolled  manner? This is the problem for the government.    Finally, the third illusion, to part with which, probably,  is  most difficult. This is the illusion of full employment. It  comes from 70 years of our life, when we believed that we got  rid of unemployment--this ulcer of capitalism. However, the work  place is not granted by God or by the state. It is a blessing  that must be earned.    We will be fair. Under socialism there were also tens and  sometimes even hundreds of thousands of people, who were  dismissed, for example, from the Krasnyy Proletariy Plant and  did not yet come to the Plant imeni Ordzhonikidze. Who were  they? At that moment, the unemployed.    Such unemployment is not dangerous. The true danger lies not  in the number of the unemployed, but in the length of  unemployment for every given person. If he cannot find a new  place for 1, 2, or 4 months, this is already a true human  tragedy. And so, two things--lengthy unemployment and focal  unemployment, mainly at our famous plant cities--cannot be  allowed. These are the true and difficult problems on the  employment market.    Whoever may say this to me, whatever they may frighten me  with, I do not believe in mass unemployment in Russia. However,  the threat of lengthy focal, regional unemployment is a real  threat. The government understands this, but concrete measures  are also needed; for example, for Ivanovo Oblast, where these  phenomena are already very tangible. It is necessary to monitor  and to prevent this danger in other regions as well. Here the  state program should be put into effect automatically. As soon  as unemployment is above the average level somewhere, it is  necessary to put into effect incentives for the creation of work  places.    Yes, we must part with the illusion of a complete  elimination  of unemployment, as difficult as this may be. And again I would  like to turn to the position of the Communist Party. Those that  are familiar with Lenin's works remember his work, which begins  with the words: "The approaching disaster..." And so, often  communists rightly talk a great deal about approaching  disasters. But it seems that they forget the second half of  Lenin's title: "...And How To Fight Against It."    I carefully read the constructive part of the communists'  program. What is there? To ensure a normal standard of living...  However, show me within these walls at least one person who  would not want the same. But how to do this and from what  resources? How to stimulate private owners and to establish a  nonstate pension fund if the state does not have enough money  for this and so forth? There are no answers to these questions.    At the same time, I want to say that the pendulum of  political life in Russia moves, even if slowly, to the left,  toward social-democracy. This is a known process. It is visible  in many countries of the former socialist camp. This is a normal  process. However, I am afraid: Did it not begin in our country  rather too early? We do not yet have enough normal  social-democracy, the one that could continue reforms if the  voter gives it his votes. But in order to achieve social  justice, it is necessary to accumulate what can be divided  later. This cannot be done with our weak economy.    Let us observe, using Western Europe as an example, what  happens when socialists come to power in a country. Everything  begins with partial nationalization and measures to reduce  unemployment, but very often ends with considerable inflation.  Then conservatives come to power and begin to lower inflation,  but unemployment rises again and again comes the time of  socialists. Such an alternation is fully normal.    [Pokrovskiy] The need to strengthen the state and its  regulating role is constantly seen in your remarks. Do I  understand you correctly?    [Livshits] Yes, correctly.    [Pokrovskiy] Then what prevents this? Mass psychology, or  the  lack of a legislative base?    [Livshits] Most probably, the latter. I simply must say this  to your readers. The tradition to hurl abuse at power has long  existed in Russia--on the sly, so that someone does not make a  report to the authorities anonymously or openly as now. However,  please note: Russia does not strive to go anywhere, for example,  to the "Karbovanets zone." But some try to get into the ruble  zone and sometimes simply want to join us, which, in my view,  would be dangerous. However, this is a separate topic. The point  is that, if you come to near abroad with rubles, the ratio is as  though you come with dollars. Here is the latest report from  Ukraine: Auctions of rubles have been stopped, because the  demand for them is 10-fold bigger than supply.    I say this not because everything is remarkable here. But  scattering ashes on one's head is also going overboard. Russia  was and remains a great power. And now, when such an attitude  toward the ruble exists, it is by no means the last.    [Pokrovskiy] Nevertheless, dollars are leaving the country.  Are people afraid to invest them?    [Livshits] They are. But we must analyze for what reasons.  Let us assume that a firm engages in import operations. It needs  currency to purchase goods abroad! Many such examples can be  cited, but this does not mean at all that I fully want to  justify the currency "flight." A lot of money is leaving the  country legally and illegally. How to stop this? To close the  border, or to take some other forceful measures? However, this  is not the way out. There is one way out--to give motivation for  the investment of currency in the country.    Today I have talked with bankers from a very rich bank. They  say: Preparations are being made to let foreign banks into our  country, but we are known to be weaker. How is that? I ask: You  do not want this? We do not. Very good. However, all commercial  people should realize: There must be an equal exchange. For  example, we will not let foreign banks in here. But in return  you put the vast amount of money that you made in trade and  received on credit in investments. What else do you need? There  is money, the political situation in the country is more or less  stable, there are no fights for power, prices have already been  rising moderately for 4 months, the situation can be predicted,  there are vacant capacities, and plants do not have to be built  from the foundation. What prevents you from investing funds in  production? Yes, they answer, we have already begun to do this  little by little.    Yes, investments in production have begun now. Even 1 year  ago it made no sense to talk about this--money would have been  spent for nothing, inflation would have eaten it up. Now the  situation is different. The totality of factors, which I  mentioned to you, is favorable for investments. One would like  to see a decision, perhaps of the Duma, perhaps of the  president--this is not the chief thing--on measures to stimulate  investments.    However, the state does not have enough funds for  investments. Moreover, even state investments, as is well known,  are not very effective. But, in general, the locomotive stands  on tracks, rails need not be laid, they exist. The locomotive  must be stoked and then it will move by itself.    [Pokrovskiy] It seems that you and I have approached the  favorite question of journalists: How do you evaluate our  prospects?    [Livshits] I have already said that no more than 1 year and,  perhaps, even less than this remains before the initial stages  of an economic upsurge--in the absence of a political  confrontation and with a clear course on the part of the  government. It should work very actively now. However, all of us  must have a more careful attitude toward the government. Vast  efforts are required of it and it must be helped in this.    It is primarily a matter of production restructuring and  reorganization. This is production reform. The government  adopted a very important decree on the procedure for the  realization of bankruptcy and so forth. It is not that they want  to dismiss people, but simply the economy will not withstand the  production ballast. Other decisions were also adopted. However,  it is not only a matter of them. They must be realized. We began  our talk by saying that new programs are not needed, but there  is a need for a real implementation of adopted decisions. Now we  have again returned to this.    The lack of a thought-out structural policy and of a system  of priorities is one of our main sore points. We will strive to  see to it that all the necessary priorities are included in the  1995 budget. It is well known that the budget is the face of  power. All the rest are words. Things begin when money is given.  <H5>  Comments by Igor Lenskiy, Editor of the Issue </H5>   The published interview is very unexpected for our  newspaper.  It is a question of the author's frank attempt to substantiate  the capitalization of society and reforms, with which each of us  is familiar from his own experience. Not by chance did Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn, in his first interview upon arrival in Russia,  call them "brainless." Yuriy Polyakov, a writer from another  generation, who has distinctly established himself in the  literature of the last decade, who is not a historian, but  rather an investigator of the contemporary way of life, noted  recently: "Now everyone admits that reforms did not turn out  and, if they did, only badly..." The reader will add here his  own attitude. And so, according to life there is a breakdown in  our country, while according to Professor Livshits there is  total order.    During the first reading of the interview a number of  contradictions are conspicuous.    1. "Everyone tries to get into the ruble zone, but Russia  does not strive to go anywhere." This key argument has been  constantly used for a long time by ultrareformers, beginning  with Ye. Gaydar and B. Fedorov, to prove the correctness of the  course of reforms. However, everything is simpler. Did a land as  great as Russia form part of the former Union? Do such vast  reserves of raw materials and minerals and such a powerful  industry exist anywhere? Today we are only burning what God (and  socialism) gave us, generating an inertia effect for the first  fruits of reforms.    2. Professor A. Livshits asks: "Why should prices be  constant? After all, the weather changes and over the years even  a wife changes." Seemingly, everything is right, everything is  logical. However, why out of all the phenomena accompanying  shock therapy only an increase in prices is justificatory and  explainable? And what about real income and the standard of  living? Are they supposed to be rooted to the spot? Or should  they also move, but in the opposite direction?    3. Professor Livshits' aphorism "the work place is a  blessing  that must be earned." No reasons are given for this thought--it  is put forward as a fact, as an axiom. But let us ponder: In  order to earn, it is necessary to work! Why suddenly people must  contest the natural, primordial right to work (which, as is well  known, created man), shoving each others with elbows?    4. "Did communists not propose that order and discipline be  introduced?" asks A. Livshits, outraged at the position of the  Duma fraction of the RF Communist Party, which considered the  president's six recent edicts anticonstitutional. However,  nowhere, not in a single program document of the Communist  Party, is legislative norm creation in a nonparliamentary manner  allowed.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   During the first quarter the decline in industrial  production  in Russia made up 25 percent. This is what should not be  forgotten when discussing the course of reforms.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Talbott sees need for strong Israel Mr Strobe Talbott, nominated to be deputy secretary of state, yesterday told Congress that his belief in a close US-Israeli relationship was 'unshake-able', as was his conviction that a strong Israel was in the best US national interest. His comments, added to his formal testimony to the Senate foreign relations committee, were designed to address recent criticism that he might harbour reservations about the extent of the US commitment to Israel. Speaking with care, Mr Talbott added that he fully supported all the policies of an administration which had achieved much in facilitating the Middle East peace process. Although Democratic senators on the committee gave him a warm welcome, Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina and longtime scourge of the State Department, said he had 'profound concerns' about Mr Talbott's qualifications for the job. 'We don't need another policy wonk sitting in an ivory tower,' he tartly observed. Specifically Mr Helms questioned Mr Talbott's recent record as ambassador-at-large dealing with former Soviet republics. He quoted recent remarks by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, who speculated that the disintegration of the Soviet empire might be reversible, and Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former Russian finance minister, who had accused Mr Talbott's 'rosy optimism' of undermining Russian reformers. In his prepared remarks, Mr Talbott conceded that the US engagement with the former Soviet states had been 'exhilarating but vexing'. But he said the US could not remain a spectator, its involvement had 'already made a difference,' and it was important to 'take the long view.' He predicted that Nato would evolve towards 'maximum inclusiveness' should Russia remain unthreatening, but that its membership and security guarantees could be expanded faster to meet any new menace.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Cost-saving option could cause wide power cut Up to a third of England and Wales could be hit by a single power cut under an option being considered by the electricity industry to relax transmission security standards and save Pounds 30m a year. While National Grid, which operates the transmission system, stresses in a confidential document that the probability of such a failure is extremely low, there is growing concern in the sector about the effects of taking up the idea. Under existing standards a power cut involving anything more than an area of a city is thought virtually impossible. Executives fear the public reaction to a power cut covering large areas of the country would be extremely unfavourable, even if the occurrence was rare. The sector already faces presentational difficulties in explaining its profitability and the pay rises of top personnel since privatisation. National Grid drew up the option after Offer, the industry regulator, requested a review of transmission security standards. It appears in National Grid's interim report which has been distributed within the industry and to leading customers. The final document is to due to be sent to Offer in March. National Grid says it neither supports nor opposes the option, and that a possibility is a gradual 'partial approach' implementation over several years. It notes in the report, however, that several regional power distributors and users say they do not wish to see a reduction in the reliability of supplies from the grid without very significant cuts in cost. Although Pounds 30m appears a large saving, distributing it throughout the English customer base would result in a saving of less than Pounds 1 a customer a year. Some regional distributors doubt that the savings would reach Pounds 30m. This is because National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, would lose out financially if the option was introduced. The regional distributors fear the generators could make good their losses by raising their prices. Offer ordered the grid report 15 months ago because it was concerned that the transmission system was protected against the consequences of faults regardless of whether or how often they occurred. The high standards often mean that an area is supplied from two routes even when one would be enough provided it works normally, which is usually the case. National Grid's report concludes that it would be possible to reformulate security standards using cost-benefit techniques and probability. This could enable capital investment to be cut by 10 per cent. In addition, operation security could be relaxed by operating many parts of the system to single circuit rather than double circuit in fair weather conditions which are experienced 80 per cent of the time. Although this could result in savings of Pounds 30m in 1994-95, the report says 'there is a risk of widespread loss of supply (up to a third of the total system) for certain double-circuit faults. 'However, the probability of such trips in fair weather is very low.' The existing grid system is 99.999 per cent reliable. The 'cost benefits' option would double grid unreliability, but the report says this would have a less dramatic effect on customers since blackouts are more frequently caused by other problems. 'A doubling of grid unreliability represents only a 1 per cent increase in the unreliability an average customer currently experiences. Additional interruptions would be expected at a rate of about once every 10 years for the whole system. (Up to every three years if all weather forecasts are wrong.) 'For each individual end customer, the rate of additional interruptions should be much lower because not all interruptions will affect everyone.'</p>

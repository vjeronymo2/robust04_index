			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> L. Extensions; Requirement to Grant Upon Good Cause; and Grant or Denial to be in Writing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous comments were received on the 1988 proposed rule's provisions on the extension of time for tenants to submit immigration documents. (See section VII.F of this preamble concerning reasonable opportunity to submit documents of eligible status by both applicants and tenants.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that while the 1988 proposed rule permitted a tenant under certain circumstances to obtain an extension of time for the submission of immigration documents, the 1988 rule failed to consider the financial burden this requirement imposes upon HAs. In order to implement this provision, the commenter claimed that housing authorities would have to develop systems to record extensions, and to monitor tenant compliance, and the rule should provide reimbursement for these expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While HUD agrees that recording tenant extensions and monitoring compliance may impose a certain financial cost to responsible entities, HUD believes that this cost will be minimal. Again, HUD believes that most tenants will have eligible status, and tenants who are eligible for assistance will not need to request an extension of time to submit immigration documents, but will have the documents readily available. As discussed under section VII.F of this preamble, the 1994 proposed rule provides that an extension be granted to applicants and tenants upon good cause shown.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter argued that in the 1988 proposed rule HUD unfairly required a responsible entity to document in writing the decision to grant an extension, but failed to impose a similar requirement on the decision to deny an extension. The commenter claimed that the same standards that apply to the decision to grant an extension should also apply to the denial of an extension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 proposed rule provides for the granting or denial of an extension to be in writing, and if the extension is denied, to state the reasons for the denial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> M. Preservation of Mixed Families and Other Families <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Proration of Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preservation of families provision in the 1994 proposed rule includes proration of assistance, as discussed earlier in this preamble. Proration of assistance is available to a mixed family (a family with members with eligible citizenship/immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status), other than a family receiving continued assistance or other than a family for which termination of assistance is temporarily deferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Continued Assistance and Deferral of Termination of Assistance_Generally <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1436a(c)(1) (42 U.S.C. 1436a(c)(1)) provides that if assistance is to be terminated to a family that was receiving assistance when the 1987 Act was enacted, after a final finding of ineligibility, special relief may be provided under certain circumstances: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he public housing agency or other local governmental entity involved (in the case of public housing or assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937) or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (in the case of any other financial assistance) may, in its discretion, take one of the following actions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Permit the continued provision of financial assistance, if necessary to avoid the division of a family in which the head of household or spouse is a citizen of the United States, a national of the United States, or an alien resident of the United States described in [section 1436a(a)(1)&hyph;(6)]. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``family'' means a head of household, any spouse, any parents of the head of household, any parents of the spouse, and any children of the head of household or spouse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Defer the termination of financial assistance, if necessary to permit the orderly transition of the individual and any family members involved to other affordable housing. Any deferral under this subparagraph shall be for a 6-month period and may be renewed by the public housing agency or other entity involved for an aggregate period of 3 years. At the beginning of each deferral period, the public housing agency or other entity involved shall inform the individual and the family members of their ineligibility for financial assistance and offer them other assistance in finding other affordable housing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to continued assistance, these provisions require a project owner (including a mortgagee) to consider permitting a family to continue to receive assistance in either of two situations. If the head of household or spouse is a citizen or national, or has eligible immigration status, and continued assistance is necessary to avoid division of the family, the assistance is to be continued indefinitely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  HILL STREET SECTION OPEN THIS WEEK  </P> <P> The Times reported incorrectly Tuesday that a stretch of Hill Street in  downtown Los Angeles, closed two weeks ago to shore up a Metro Rail tunnel,  would not reopen until next week.  </P> <P> In fact, the road was reopened to traffic on Monday, according to Greg Davy, a  spokesman for the Southern California Rapid Transit District.  </P> <P> The segment was shut after construction engineers found unexpected stress on  the struts that support a 1,000-foot section of Hill Street above the tunnel  between Temple and 1st streets. Several horizontal steel struts were added to  the 80-foot-deep tunnel.  </P></p>

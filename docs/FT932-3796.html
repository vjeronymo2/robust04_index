			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Ukraine to keep nuclear arms for up to two years UKRAINE will temporarily retain nuclear missiles on its territory, possibly for up to two years, Mr Ivan Pliushch, chairman of the Ukrainian parliament and a member of the ruling troika, said yesterday. Mr Pliushch said that escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia were the principal reason for Kiev's hesitation to surrender its nuclear weapons. He said relations between the two Slav neighbours had become particularly strained recently, and accused the Russian government of making overt territorial claims on Crimea and of initiating an 'economic blockade' by cutting off oil supplies to Ukraine two days ago. Mr Pliushch said that parliament would ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1) before the summer recess. The treaty covers 130 Russian-made SS-19 inter-continental ballistic missiles stationed on Ukrainian territory. But he said the legislature was unlikely to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty soon. A split decision such as this would leave Ukraine in possession of 46 Ukrainian-made SS-24 ICBMs. Mr Pliushch's comments contradict Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's repeated assurances this week to senior US and German leaders that the Ukrainian government remains committed to rapid ratification of both Start 1 and non-proliferation. But it is the legislature that will decide. Mr Pliushch hinted that Ukrainian scientists were working to develop negative technical control - or blocking power over the 46 Ukrainian-made missiles. 'In terms of these 46 missiles, to develop a negative trigger is a question of one or two years,' Mr Pliushch said. 'Who knows, maybe this mechanism already exists.' According to US and Russian specialists negative control over the missiles is a short step from positive operational control - a technology which would make Ukraine a true nuclear power. US and Russian experts have recently voiced concerns that Ukraine has launched a secret programme to obtain direct control of some of the nuclear missiles on its territory. The growing strength of the pro-nuclear lobby in the Ukrainian parliament comes at a time when the fledgling nation is facing a double political threat: mounting tensions with Russia and an increasingly volatile domestic political climate.</p>

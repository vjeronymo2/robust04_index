			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was nominated by a mass public  meeting as Moscow's at-large candidate in the March 26 election for the new  Congress of People's Deputies. The meeting was organized by the Memorial  Society, an unofficial group dedicated to the victims of the late dictator  Josef Stalin. Sakharov, 67, was chosen last week as a candidate for the Oktybr  district of Moscow. The second nomination makes him a candidate for the entire  city, and in that contest, Sakharov is expected to run against Politburo member  Vitaly I. Vorotnikov. The new congress, part of the reform effort in the Soviet  Union, will choose more than 400 of its members to form a more active Supreme  Soviet (Parliament).  </P></p>

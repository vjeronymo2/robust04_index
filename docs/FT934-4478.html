			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Volvo The theory behind the recent surge in Volvo's shares has been that opposition to the Renault merger reduced the immediate risk of earnings dilution. Combining a recovering Volvo with a recession-bound Renault was never particularly attractive in the short term. Now the opposition has won the day, the market must move on to assess the long-term strategic lacuna. With its limited model range and small home market, Volvo badly needs a partner. But even operational collaboration with a jilted Renault will not be easy. Alternatives may remain elusive while Renault still owns 10 per cent. If Volvo needs fresh capital, meanwhile, even its most chauvinistic shareholders should think carefully before stumping up any cash.</p>

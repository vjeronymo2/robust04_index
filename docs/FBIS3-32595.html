			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero for the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told Indians  from Los Altos de Chiapas he will fulfill all his pledges and  continue to work to achieve harmony. Approximately 100 members  of the Indian Council of Chiapas came to the official residence  in Los Pinos this afternoon to discuss with the president their  needs for potable water, high schools, health centers, and  better administration of justice. They came to Mexico City in  an Air Force plane, arriving at the presidential house in tour  buses. The group was led by Governor Javier Lopez Moreno.    The meeting was private. It extended beyond the allotted  time. Later President Salinas personally explained the reason  for his delay to the workers, electricians who waited in another  room at Los Pinos.    [Begin Salinas recording] I come from a meeting where I  heard, talked, and adopted decisions with Indian municipal  presidents from 13 municipalites in Chiapas State. I heard  their proposals with due attention and respect. I learned about  their decision to work for peace, harmony, and justice. They  want two things above all: they want harmony to prevail in their  communities, region, and their great and beloved Chiapas State,  and they want pledges fulfilled. This was my reply: For Chiapas  and for Mexico, we will work for harmony, and we will fulfill  pledges. [applause] [end recording]    The Indians were from nine ethnic groups -- Chamulas,  Tzotziles, Choles, Lacandones, and others -- in Los Altos de  Chiapas. They said they were happy about their meeting with  President Salinas but they warned that if authorities fail to  fulfill all their pledges they will come back and report this to  the president of the republic. They also said that they share  the reasons for the Zapatists' struggle but not the way in which  they have done it, meaning with weapons.    Asked if they will continue to vote for the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI] in future elections, Pascual Gustavo  Rodriguez, municipal president of Mitontic, said they have yet  to decide for whom they vote in the next general elections. It  is appropriate to mention the question was asked because voting  in this region has always favored the PRI.</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Is the worst over? FEW in the markets now believe that there will be a narrowing of the short-term interest rate differential between Germany and the US until the fourth quarter, writes James Blitz. That was the fundamental lesson of last week. The discount rate rise, though symbolic, is a sign that German short term rates will stay high for the remainder of 1992. At the same time, indicators like last week's fall in June housing starts by 3.2 per cent make it even less likely that there will be a rise in US rates. The yawning rate differential makes the cost of holding dollars too great and may push the currency down to its all time low of DM1.4430 soon. The main debate now is whether the Bundesbank needs to tighten policy even further by raising the Lombard rate. Mr Paul Chertkow of UBS believes the worst is over and that, by the time the Bundesbank next meets, it will have good figures on money supply and inflation. He also believes that weak indicators on German production and growth will force the Bundesbank to ease policy in the fourth quarter. Mr Neil MacKinnon of Yamaichi International thinks a Lombard rate rise is still possible. While the next set of inflation figures, for July, should bring the annualised rate down to 3.5 per cent, he thinks that the Bundesbank will continue to fret about the inflationary phenomena to come. These include the projected rise in VAT from 14 per cent to 15 per cent, increased petrol taxes, and what could be another difficult wage round. The figure for June M3 money supply, which should appear on Friday, will be the first indication of who is winning this debate.</p>

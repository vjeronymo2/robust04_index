			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: THE HOLIDAY SEASON MAY NOT BE THE BEST TIME OF YEAR TO  GO IT ALONE  </P> <P> QUESTION: I have had my home on the market for sale about 6 weeks. I have  advertised it every day and hold open houses each Saturday and Sunday. The  market for home sales is slow in our town, but I know my home is priced  reasonably because I am asking less than a similar home is listed for in the  next block.  </P> <P> I estimate that 25 prospective buyers and 10 real estate brokers have inspected  my house so far, but I have not received any offers. What should I do to get my  home sold quickly?  </P> <P> ANSWER: You missed most of the fall selling season for homes. Now we are  entering the slowest time of ear for home sales, between Thanksgiving and New  Year's. Even the best real estate agents have difficulty selling homes during  this time of year, when few people want to move.  </P> <P> If you are a regular reader of this column, then you know I do not advocate  selling your home alone without a professional real estate agent. The risk is  too high that you will make a costly mistake. Not being able to obtain a  purchase offer from one of those 25 prospects has already cost you extra  mortgage, property tax and maintenance expenses. Perhaps your home is  overpriced or it has other drawbacks that prospective buyers don't like.  </P> <P> You only have one home to sell, but the local realty agents can show buyers  hundreds of homes for sale through the local multiple-listing service. I  suggest you bite the bullet and list your home for sale with your town's best  real estate agent.  </P> <P> Ask your friends, neighbors and business associates for recommendations.  Interview at least three agents who sell homes in your neighborhood.  </P> <P> But before listing your home with an agent, ask each agent for a list of their  most recent home sales with the names and phones of the sellers. Then call  those people to inquire if they were in any way unhappy with their agent and if  they would list their home with the same agent again. You will soon know which  agent should get your listing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keep Buyers Out of House Until Sale Closes  </P> <P> Q: I sold my home to a nice young couple. They are getting an FHA mortgage and  it is taking forever. Since they moved here from out of town and are staying in  a motel, they want to move into my house before the mortgage papers are ready.  Do you think I should allow them to do so?  </P> <P> A: No. The big problem with allowing home buyers to occupy the residence before  the sale is recorded is the buyers will surely discover some little defect  which will hold up the closing of the sale.  </P> <P> Another difficulty is you must keep up the insurance while the buyer occupies  your home. If a loss results, there can be problems. I do not recommend you let  your buyer move into the home before the sale is recorded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quitclaim Deed Means Nothing Without Title  </P> <P> Q: My husband and I obtained title to our home from his mother. We are buying  the house from her. What concerns us is we have only a quitclaim deed. Should  we obtain a warranty of some sort?  </P> <P> A: A quitclaim deed means the grantor conveys whatever title she owned in the  property. It can be the conveyance of a full fee simple absolute title. Or it  can be delivery of no title at all if the grantor didn't own the property.  </P> <P> For example, I can give you a quitclaim deed to the Empire State Building, but  it conveys no title rights because I don't own the Empire State Building.  </P> <P> But a quitclaim deed is perfectly safe if you also obtain an owner's title  insurance policy. If you did not buy such a policy at the time you obtained the  quitclaim deed, I suggest you buy an owner's title policy now. It will protect  you against many unexpected title risks which even the world's greatest title  searcher cannot discover, such as forged signatures in the chain of title.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lease Option Protected by Rights of Occupants  </P> <P> Q: Following your advice we negotiated a terrific lease option. The home seller  is giving us a 100% rent credit toward our down payment. However, he does not  want us to record our purchase option.  </P> <P> It occurred to me that the seller, a rather slippery character, might try to  sell our home again. We definitely plan to exercise our purchase option. Do you  think we have a big problem?  </P> <P> A: No. The buyer of any property takes title subject to the rights of the  occupants. Since you have a valid lease option agreement, you need not be  concerned. Please consult a local real estate attorney for more details.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Thoughts on Realtor's Sale Tactics  </P> <P> Q: We bought our home about five months ago and are very happy with it.  However, I have been wondering if the real estate agent did anything wrong. We  met her at a Sunday open house. As she showed us through the home, we said it  was nice but the price seemed too high for us. Then she told us that in her  opinion her listing was overpriced.  </P> <P> When I asked what price the seller would take, she said she didn't know, but  she would be willing to present our offer about $20,000 below the asking price.  We knew that would be a bargain, so we agreed to make such an offer. The seller  accepted our offer that evening. Two things concern me. One is whether the  listing agent encouraged us to make a low-ball offer. The second is the  seller's acceptance of our first offer with no negotiation. Do you think we  were set up?  </P> <P> A: No. The real estate agent probably knew her listing was overpriced. However,  the agent often has no choice but to accept an overpriced listing or not take  the listing at all. When I was selling real estate as an agent, I often took  overpriced listings with the understanding the seller would reduce the asking  price if no purchase offers materialized.  </P> <P> As for the agent's encouraging you to make an offer $20,000 below the asking  price, there is nothing wrong with that. Perhaps the agent knew the seller  might accept such an offer. Of course, it would be unethical for her to tell  you the seller would accept such an offer.  </P> <P> I see nothing wrong with the listing agent's sales tactics. She was using good  salesmanship to get you to make an offer. The final decision was the seller's,  not the agent's.  </P> <P> The only thing I would be concerned about is that your first offer was  accepted. I know how bad that feels because that means the seller might have  sold for a lower price if you had offered less. But be happy with your bargain  and forget about how you stole that home from the poor unsuspecting seller.  </P> <P> </P> <P> House Values Fluctuate With Local Economy  </P> <P> Q: I have been trying to figure out why houses don't depreciate in value as  they grow older and parts wear out, just as cars depreciate as they get older.  </P> <P> A: Physically, homes depreciate due to wear, tear and obsolescence. But a  sound, well-located home usually maintains its value or appreciates in market  value if the local economy is sound and jobs are being created to keep people  moving into the area.  </P> <P> However, if jobs decline and people move away from the vicinity, then home  prices stagnate or decline. It is usually outside economic forces which cause  homes to lose value, not their physical condition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Illness No Ground for Extention of Roll-Over  </P> <P> Q: Shortly after we sold our home I became too ill to look for the replacement  home that would defer our profit tax. I contacted the IRS and my congressman,  but have been unable to find out how to get a six-month extension of the time I  need to buy a replacement home. How can I do this?  </P> <P> A: Sorry, but Internal Revenue Code 1034 has no provision for granting any  extension of the 24-month time limit for buying a replacement home of equal or  greater cost, so you can defer the profit tax on the sale of your old home. For  further details, please consult your attorney.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Former Tenant Seeks Recovery of Deposit  </P> <P> Q: I rented an apartment on a month-to-month tenancy. After several months I  decided to move out. I had a $250 security deposit. I left the apartment  spotless. But the landlord kept my deposit because she says it is her policy to  repaint apartments after each tenant moves out. My apartment doesn't need  repainting, since I don't smoke and none of my friends do either. How can I get  my $250 back?  </P> <P> A: Your first step is to make a written demand on your landlord for refund of  your security deposit within 15 days. If you don't receive your money, small  claims court or housing court is the place to sue for your deposit refund.  </P> <P> Letters and comments to Robert J.

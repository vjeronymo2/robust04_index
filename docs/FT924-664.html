			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Names opting for individual legal action A GROWING NUMBER of Lloyd's Names faced with heavy losses are opting to pursue legal action against their agents on an individual basis rather than as part of action groups. In the past two days, solicitors DJ Freeman have issued and served writs on behalf of 27 Names - individuals whose assets support Lloyd's underwriting. Mr David Tiplady of DJ Freeman, said the writs had been delivered personally to members' agents. More than 100 Names were likely to follow suit over the next few weeks. So far, virtually all of the several thousand Names pursuing legal action have done so as part of action groups. But some Names have become impatient about delays in legal actions which they fear might reduce their chances of obtaining compensation. 'It's part of the dash for cash,' said Mr Tiplady, added that many Names feared that insurance funds available to settle legal disputes could be exhausted before all their cases are heard. The 27 Names who served writs this week are alleging negligence by the members' agents which channelled them on to high-risk syndicates. The majority of actions involve the Poland and Gooda &amp; Partners agencies, which figure separately in the bigger actions. In a separate development, another solicitor, Mr Guy Sutton of Norton Rose, has warned Names that time might be running out if they wish to sue their managing agents with the hope of winning adequate compensation. From December 31 1992, managing agents (which administer Lloyd's syndicates) will be no longer required to buy errors and omissions insurance, which meets the cost of legal awards against them. 'Potential claims must be notified to insurers before the end of the year for a Name to be certain that a managing agent will insured against such claims,' Mr Sutton said. He added: 'In only a few days, the door may have closed, leaving a Name effectively barred in future because his claim against his managing agent is uninsured.' Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, the chairman of the Gooda Walker Action group, which represents about 2,000 Names, has resigned with effect from February 28. He will remain a member of the group's committee.</p>

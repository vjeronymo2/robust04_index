			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Since the time that the idea of planning took hold  among the nation's officials (in the year 1316 [21 March 1937-20  March 1938]) and government and private sector activity began to  occur within the framework of organized planning, the government  has always had the greatest share in economic activity. On this  basis, one can compare the nation's economy to a government  economy.    One of the main differences between a government economy and  a free economy is that in a government economy price increases  are made by the government, while in a free economy the  fluctuations of supply and demand determine price changes. It is  for this reason, and perhaps others, that most economists  believe that government involvement in an economy will have a  positive result when the government's share in all production is  more than 75 percent or less than 30 percent. Between 30 percent  and 75 percent, the government's share in total production is  not that desirable.    Last week the Council of Ministers was unable to pass Note  25, and in reality the Majles opposed price increases for some  government goods, and the people were very happy with this  Majles measure. However, every day we see that the prices of  goods and services are increasing without the Majles taking the  government to task for it. As examples, one can mention the  increased prices for Vahed Company bus tickets, meat, chicken,  milk, residential rentals and hundreds of other items. However,  because some of these things are not marketed directly by the  government, there is no need for the Majles to approve increases  in their prices.    On the other hand the Economic Council, which was once  called  the Price Setting Council, considers the setting the prices of  goods and services to be one of its responsibilities, because in  Iran's government economy leaving prices all at once to market  supply and demand is impossible. This may be due to the fact  that one of the basic bottlenecks in Iran's economy is the  marketing of goods.    When supply cannot respond to increased demand, in a free  economy the result is definitely an increase in price.  Unfortunately, however, the current situation in the nation's  economy is neither fish nor fowl. The government does not have  the least involvement in price fluctuations and on the other  hand some of the things the government does cause price  increases.    For example, the increase in the price of Vahed bus tickets  led to increases in other transportation fares. Of course, since  the government has decided to leave it to the market to set  prices and to refrain from unnecessary intervention, the public  was forced to accept price increases in transportation services.  Unfortunately, however, the planners of such an economy (neither  government nor private) did not take all the aspects into  account. They must not [as published] keep the following points  in mind at all times:    1. If the economy is to turn a greater role over to the  private sector, then the problem of supply in the economy must  first be solved. Otherwise, the pricing mechanism will not be  efficient.    2. An economy and people who have gotten used to government  pricing over a period of many years cannot support the lack of  government involvement, especially in the domestic commercial  sector. Moreover, if the government exercises effective control  over prices and distribution procedures, it will be more  beneficial to society and the government. It must be said that  government pricing is not at all in conflict with the policies  of privatization.    3. Again, because of limited supply, proposed price  increases  for government goods will have no effect other than to cause a  series of price increases for other goods.    In short, under current circumstances, neither the  government  nor the private sector is able to manage Iran's economy. Before  some kind of damage is done to the various sectors, the  respected Council of Ministers must go into action before  certain conditions reduce its involvement, while at the same  time, as it sets the prices for government goods and services it  must also keep in mind the effects this will have on other goods.</p>

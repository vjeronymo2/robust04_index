			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI/Zeneca advance A fresh surge of buying interest in ICI shares on Wall Street overnight set the tone for the newly-demerged group, with most of the buying in the stock said to have reflected switching business by international broking houses. Dealers said it was significant that ICI and its former bioscience arm, Zeneca, had made progress, while the big international pharmaceutical stocks, such as Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome had given up significant ground. ICI shares were among the FT-SE 100 index's best performers in London on Tuesday, when they spurted from an opening 608p to close at 636p. Yesterday, they took another substantial leap forward, opening sharply higher at 658p and quickly moving ahead to touch 674p before settling a further 37 1/2 up at 673 1/2 p. Both classes of Zeneca stock moved ahead, shrugging off the sluggish opening performance on Tuesday. Zeneca ordinary shares battled gamely and closed 4 higher at 634p, after 637p, albeit after only moderate turnover of 2.9m shares, well below Tuesday's debut turnover of 10m. The new shares settled 3 higher at 37p, after 39p, on 4m traded. The US Securities and Exchange Commission's move to grant special exemption to marketmaking firms involved in the underwriting of the Zeneca rights issue, allowing them to purchase Zeneca shares in a 'passive' role if the market price goes below a 10 per cent discount to the rights price in the final five days of the offer, was another positive for the market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Yuriy Alekseyevich Bondazhevskiy, </F> internal troops unit commander, by unidentified correspondent;  place and date not given; from the "Kamchatka News" program]    [Text] The new recruits for the special motorized units of  the internal troops were sworn in on 23 January. The soldiers  will begin independent patrols on the streets of the oblast  center from the middle of February. Our correspondent is  discussing the manpower acquisition problems with the unit  commander, Yuriy Bondazhevskiy.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Yuriy Alekseyevich, I  know that the personnel situation is quite strained at the  moment; what is the situation in your unit? How is the  recruiting progressing? In recent times, there has been no one  left to serve.    [Bondazhevskiy] That is a fact; 1993 has been a difficult  year in respect of personnel and in fact we have only been at 50  percent strength. Currently, the situation is significantly  better and the units are 96 percent manned. The situation with  contract manpower acquisition is a bit more complicated.  However, there are a number of objective reasons for this, the  first of which is housing conditions.    Despite the internal troops manpower acquisition principle  that they are to be from outside the territory and are to serve  for three or four years, it has become fashionable to serve in  the area where one lives, which is a gross breach of the statute  on internal troops. If we take the 1992-93 figures, practically  90 percent of the unit was comprised of local servicemen. At  present, 56 percent of the young recruits from the 1993 fall  call up come from the Petropavlovsk city and Kamchatka Oblast  Voyenkomats [Military Commissariat].    We see a solution to this situation in the following: carry  out an exchange of personnel with other similar units located in  the Far East. That is, the basic task, namely, guarding public  order suffers because the majority of local servicemen are  serving in local units. Use of local manpower leaves its mark,  which is evident if we compare 1992 with 1991. Despite the  number of personnel remaining the same there was a change in  their quality, due to local content -- service effectiveness and  quality of service declined substantially.    [Correspondent] The presence of militiamen on duty on the  streets is not noticeable at present, yet you say that units are  96 percent up to strength.    [Bondazhevskiy] Yes, the fall-intake recruits are undergoing  their basic training course. It is almost completed and in the  course of the next two or three days they will be doing their  examinations. Subsequently, they will be allocated to units  where they will begin their independent duties. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Man In The News: Iron hand in a regulator's glove - Sir James McKinnon Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, will be smouldering over his gas-fired barbecue in Eastbourne this weekend at the ignominy of being forced to cut domestic gas prices. Sir James McKinnon, who as head of the Office of Gas Supply, the industry regulator, is Mr Evans' adversary in the gas price wars, can relish another victory for the consumer. For Sir James, forcing British Gas to cut its prices marks the latest triumph in a struggle to shake the company out of the complacency stemming from its long-held position as monopoly supplier to the UK's 17.8m household customers. Sir James's soft Glaswegian burr and his polite manner conceal a gladiatorial spirit which British Gas has repeatedly misjudged in the stormy six-year relationship following the company's privatisation in 1986. But the latest row, which erupted two weeks ago when Sir James called for a price cut on an early-morning radio programme, has pushed relations between regulator and supplier to a nadir. Many industry observers question whether the company and Ofgas will be able to hold a constructive dialogue again. The fact that Sir James has emerged as the victor from his disputes with the company and that Mr Evans has complained many times to the government about his interference, have cast Sir James in the role of the consumer's champion. It is a role he relishes. There is little doubt of his delight in being in the public eye or of his skill in conducting his debates with British Gas through the columns of the newspapers. But as Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers' Council, puts it: 'Each side is developing something approaching contempt for the other, and if relationships cannot be re-established, that is not in the long-term interests of consumers.' Mr Powe points to the need for co-operation between the watchdog and the utility as part of initiatives such as the energy trust launched last week whereby British Gas is offering money to help low-income households. The 'creative tension', which is the way Sir James has often described his relationship with British Gas, has fast degenerated into warfare and an atmosphere of extreme distrust between the two. Sir James complains that British Gas will not debate change in its marketplace or pricing with him but is put on the defensive when he goes ahead and imposes measures such as the new pricing formula for household supplies. He accuses the company of not being pro-active enough. British Gas, steeped in a culture of government bureaucracy - a legacy from its life as a nationalised monopoly - where decisions are arrived at behind closed doors, has failed to adjust to the new regulatory environment. The company often criticises Sir James for being reluctant to sit round a table with its top executives. One of its chief complaints about Sir James's recent demand for a price cut was that he would not hold a meeting to talk about it. The company's antipathy towards Sir James is not diminished by his willingness to exploit to the full the powers conferred on him by the Gas Act, which privatised British Gas in 1986. He has managed to get many regulatory steps such as the introduction of the new pricing formula and the overhaul of the industrial gas market accepted by British Gas only under threat of a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which could prove more punitive. The relationship was not initially envisaged as being quite so combative. When Sir Peter Walker found the then Mr McKinnon for the regulator's job, he was hoping to appease Sir Denis Rooke, chairman of British Gas at privatisation and outspoken advocate of a monopoly gas supplier. Sir James was cast as a retired accountant who would be glad of a cosy sinecure. Sir James, a lorry driver's son, had been with the Imperial Group for nearly 20 years - eight of those as finance director. He left the company when Hanson took it over in 1986, having staunchly resisted the hostile bid. Close associates of Sir James say he believed he did not get the recognition due to him at the Imperial Group and, far from being a spent force, he was looking for a new challenge. The seeds of his relationship with British Gas were sown in his early days in office. On taking up the post he said: 'It would be a mistake to think that we will be confronting the British Gas Corporation in any sense. Our job is to ensure that it carries out what it is supposed to do.' But very quickly he ran into the formidable personality of Sir Denis, who refused to refer to Sir James by name, calling him, even to his own staff, the director-general. Sir James's initial attempts to elicit information from British Gas relevant to his regulatory role were met with blank refusals and later reluctance and obscurantism. He soon realised he would have to be tougher or fail to make a mark altogether. Sir James's job was not made any easier by the manner in which British Gas was privatised - in retrospect, many in the industry believe the company should have been broken into competing regional companies as in the electricity industry. Sir James deserves credit for working towards competition while saddled with what remains essentially a monopoly structure. A staunch believer in competition and free markets, he must receive the plaudits for pushing for a better deal for consumers in spite of his publicity-conscious methods. Mr Peter Nicol, industry analyst at SG Warburg, the securities house, says: 'He has probably taken British Gas to an entirely different place in 1992 than was envisaged in 1986.' But Mr Powe at the Gas Consumers Council believes that it is now time to start offering some olive branches and toning down the public acrimony between Sir James and British Gas before the disputes destroy British Gas's credibility altogether. But both sides have dug in their heels and without a change at the top of either body, the relationship is likely to remain sour.</p>

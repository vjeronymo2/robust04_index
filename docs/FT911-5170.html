			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Markets The sight of sterling yesterday bumping up against the DM3.00 level had its worrying aspects. However strong sterling may be, the UK money markets have decided that further base rate cuts are ruled out for the time being by domestic inflationary pressures. This makes for a combination of high interest rates and strong currency which begins to look familiar. For the UK corporate sector, it is just the regime designed under the ERM to squeeze inflation out of the system the hard way. What makes this situation perverse is the route by which it has been arrived at. Sterling's strength is merely an illusion caused by D-Mark weakness. Since the turn of the year, the D-Mark has fallen by over 10 per cent against both the dollar and the yen. Against sterling, it has fallen only 4 per cent. As Mr Tietmeyer of the Bundesbank remarked yesterday, German domestic conditions make a strong D-Mark and high German interest rates independently desirable. However much further the D-Mark has to fall in the short run, that logic will doubtless prevail eventually. What price the UK corporate sector then? There is a counter-argument which points to the unusually high level of capital investment by UK companies in the late 1980s and the scope this might give for productivity improvement in the early 1990s. UK business investment as a proportion of GDP peaked at 17 per cent in 1989, compared with only 12 per cent in 1985. Conceivably, this might allow UK productivity to improve just as German productivity is weakening under the strain of unification. If so, nominal wage settlements in the UK might be able to continue at a relatively high level without leading to overvaluation of sterling. The snag is that this suggests UK industry managing its affairs better than its German rivals for the first time in living memory. With the UK equity market poised just below its all-time high, it might be unwise to take that on trust.</p>

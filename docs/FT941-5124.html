			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Intrum Justitia falls 13% to Pounds 13.9m - Adverse currency movements and problems in Swiss office behind the decline Intrum Justitia, Europe's largest debt collection group, yesterday announced a fall in profits for 1993 because of the impact of currency declines on Nordic profits, and problems in its Swiss office. Pre-tax profits fell by 13 per cent to Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 16m) on turnover of Pounds 83.6m, down from Pounds 88.9m. The fall in Nordic currencies reduced operating profit by Pounds 1.2m, and the company said that in constant currency terms, pre-tax profit increased by 6 per cent during the year. Mr Bo Goranson, chief executive and the company's largest shareholder, said Intrum Justitia was aiming to increase the number of cases handled by 20 per cent during 1994, from the year-end level of 2.82m. These cases had a gross value of Pounds 1.4bn. The company said it would expand through organic growth rather than by acquisition. Mr Goranson described Europe as a 'virgin market' for debt collection, offering significant potential for existing and new offices. Operating profits fell by 21 per cent to Pounds 14.2m despite stable operating expenses. However, the net interest charge fell to Pounds 910,000 (Pounds 1.73m) because of lower interest rates and cash generation, which reduced gearing from 72 per cent to 43.5 per cent. Intrum Justitia performed strongly in the early stages of the recession, when companies are forced to improve cash management. But as economies have contracted, growth in new business and the collection success rate have slowed. The company was adversely affected by management problems in its Swiss operation, which resulted in a Pounds 2m drop in operating profit in 1993. These have been resolved. Mr Goranson said Intrum Justitia had increased market share in most of its markets. The UK, which accounts for about one-third of profit, France and Germany all performed strongly, and further growth is expected in the current year. Earnings per share rose marginally to 9.3p (9.2p) and the directors have recommended a final dividend of 2.2p, lifting the total pay-out to 3.3p, a 10 per cent increase. COMMENT Intrum Justitia has been viewed with some suspicion by investors, due to the slightly dark reputation of the debt collection industry. Its latest results provide little cheer, but the future holds more promise. Profits should rise to about Pounds 17m in 1994, boosted by a turnround in Switzerland. This puts the shares on a prospective p/e of 10.7. Impending government initiatives on late payment should help broaden demand for debt collection services in the immature European market. Lord Hollick's MAI owns 19 per cent, and has for some time been rumoured to be keen to increase its stake. The current share price reflects little of this, and offers significant potential upside in the longer term.</p>

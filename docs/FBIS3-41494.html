			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed Article: ``Flight Reaction Indicates </F> Impurities--Berlin Testing Procedure Uses Ciliates for Detecting  Toxicologic Substances'']    [Text] Ciliates can detect and avoid toxic substances. This  behavior called chemotaxis can be used for the detection of  toxic substances in contaminated water. Based on this  observation, scientists at the Free University of Berlin  (Institut fuer Biochemie, AG Oekotoxikologie, E hrenbergstr.  26-28, 14195 Berlin) developed a testing system for toxic  compounds dissolved in water. Preliminary studies showed that  the system containing the ciliate tetrahymena thermophilia is  versatile and sensitive.    As the scientists in Berlin report, the toxic substances  cause typical flight and evasive actions. The extent of the  reaction depends on the substance concentration. Tetrahymenia is  suitable as a testing organism because it is an intermediate  step between bacteria and higher organisms both biologically and  ecologically. It plays an important role in the food chains in  water. The biochemistry and physiology of the organism has been  studied thoroughly.    The ciliate is used in three different test formats in  Berlin. The testing apparatus basically consists of an outer  chamber, into which an internal chamber consisting of 18  measuring tubes is inserted. The measuring tubes are connected  with the outer chamber by fine channels.    In the initial test phase, the organisms are in the outer  chamber. The test sample is in the measuring tubes. If they  contain toxic substances, the ciliates avoid the tubes,  otherwise they spread to both chambers. The measured value is  the number of organisms which entered the tubes.    Anot her test measures how the growth of tetrahymena is  inhibited when agents are added. However, this test is  considerably less sensitive than the chemosensory test. The  change in the membrane potential due to water contamination can  be studied using fluorescent compounds; the sensitivity of this  test is supposed to be similar to that of the chemosensory  process.    In studies with chemical substances which were selected  randomly from the ``European Inventory of Existing Chemicals''  the test had a broad range and high sensitivity. However, the  method is not suitable for continuous monitoring of the water  quality.</p>

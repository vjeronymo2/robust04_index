			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: Jerry Hadley, Jennifer Larmore - Song recitals in London Jerry Hadley's recital attracted a surprisingly small audience to the Purcell Room on Wednesday. London's regular canary-fanciers were generally conspicuous by their absence. The first night of Pelleas across the river may have accounted for some of them, though that opera is unpromising territory for canaries; otherwise the lack of response to what is by any standards one of the most refreshingly direct and attractive tenor voices of the present generation was hard to explain. The biography in the programme categorised Jerry Hadley as 'highly regarded as a cross-over artist', and his choice of programme seemed designed to emphasise this versatility. Mainstream 19th-century repertory (Schumann's Dichterliebe, Liszt's Petrach Sonnets) began the programme, folk-song arrangements and modern American settings ended it. The latter came over as more convincing, for although Hadley occasionally alighted upon a rapt, concentrated tone for some of the Lieder - the last of the Petrach settings, 'I vidi in terra angelici costumi' in particular was wonderfully sustained and controlled vocally  - the approach seemed too generalised and extrovert, too full-throated, to probe beneath the surface of the songs for further expressive layers. Cheryll Drake, Hadley's wife, was his accompanist; she was rather plain and unprepossessing in the art songs, more supportive in the vernacular numbers. Britten's arrangements had been originally promised for the folk songs, but most of this selection had been titivated in a heavy-handed way by Luigi Zaninelli, whose unfailing trick seemed to be a canon between the piano and vocal line in the last verse of every song. Hadley, though, delivered them all ('The Water is Wide', 'Black is the Color', 'Shenandoah', 'Sweet Betsy') with unaffected good humour, and also made excellent cases for Rochberg's 'Rise Up, My Love' (strikingly Tippett-like in its figuration - what a good job Hadley would make of The Heart's Assurance]), a John Duke setting of e e cummings, and John Alden Carpenter's 'Serenade'. Far from losing their subtlety and poise such settings positively thrive on the larger-than-life qualities that seem to be his mainstays as a recitalist. ***** Jennifer Larmore, another American singer currently riding high in international opera-house esteem, managed to fill the Wigmore Hall for Sunday's recital - her first in London. Miss Larmore's mezzo-soprano is an instrument of extraordinary beauty, at once full and agile, graceful in slow music and brilliantly fleet in fast, its rich tints evenly spread across a compass of more than two octaves; and since she is also fair of face and figure, the promise of the occasion seemed immense. In truth, it was a good deal less than completely realised. The programme - ridiculously short measure, as is now the rule - played to the singer's particular strengths: a group of Handel arias to show off the splendour of her fast flourishes, French arias (by Massenet) and songs (by Gounod and Faure) to remind us of her refined sensibility in that field (she is based in France, and was a redeeming feature of the otherwise wretched Covent Garden Huguenots), and Spanish songs and Rossini to provide a vivacious close. And yet the impression far too much of the time was of a finely schooled singer expertly going through her paces, not an artist stirred to urgent communication with an audience. Words were mouthed, not delivered. Phrases were touched in, not shaped. When it came to the closing account of 'Una voce poco fa', the sudden increase in appetite, in a sense of 'go', underlined what we had been missing earlier. (Miss Larmore has just finished a run of Covent Garden Barbers.) It was odd to encounter John Constable, normally a pianist of unflappable aplomb, on such peccable form.</p>

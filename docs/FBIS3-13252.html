			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Israel has been informed that Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev intends to arrive here on 12 March. When  he arrives Foreign Minister Kozyrev will hear Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' reservations  about Russia's latest initiatives with regard to the peace  process. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports:    [Begin recording] [Raz] Israel's political leadership would  gladly forgo Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's unexpected  visit. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres  have both officially rejected the initiative, proposed one week  ago by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov, to reconvene an  international conference or send a Russian official on a shuttle  mission to the Middle East. That is why they were surprised by  this afternoon's report.    [Rabin] I heard about it on the radio. The deputy foreign  minister also made this proposal. We have no intention of  holding a second Madrid conference. We have no intention of  permitting any international presence beyond what was agreed  upon in the Declaration of Principles -- and I am clearly  referring to a nonmilitary international presence in the Gaza  Strip and Jericho after agreement is reached with the  Palestinians on the Gaza-Jericho First proposal, and following  or during the implementation of the agreement.    [Raz] Prime Minister Rabin expressed concern about the very  future of the political process in light of Russia's desire to  become more involved without prior coordination with the United  States.    [Rabin] I prefer that things continue the way they have been  handled up till now. I hope this step will not complicate the  chances of renewing the peace negotiations both with the  Palestinians and with the relevant Arab states. At any rate, we  will graciously receive any visitor here but at the same time  unequivocally explain our position.    [Raz] Israel's position will also be expressed by Foreign  Minister Peres, who is annoyed by the Russian attempt to  reconvene the Madrid conference.    [Peres] I do not understand why. First of all, we have to  implement what has already been agreed upon. The Middle East  cannot constantly be inundated with declarations. It is time to  take actual steps.    [Raz] So this proposal is unacceptable to Israel?    [Peres] We said that it does not strike us as particurlarly  constructive.    [Raz] When he arrives on Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister  Kozyrev will be apprised of the Israeli leadership's  reservations and doubts with regard to his proposal. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: A marriage proposed for tax reasons? - A look at the rationale behind GKN's hostile Pounds 496m offer for Westland GKN lets the television news justify its proposed marriage of helicopter and armoured vehicle production. From Bosnia to Somalia, the recurring image of light tanks escorting the sick and wounded to waiting aircraft, or helicopter gunships assisting ground forces, pays testament to the natural alliance of the two sectors. That, at least, is the stated rationale of the engineering and industrial services group which is courting Westland, Britain's only helicopter manufacturer. Westland's institutional shareholders and a growing number of City analysts, however, have not been appeased by claims that the changing post-cold war environment has created a ready market for manufacturers of rapid response military vehicles. 'We cannot see any synergy between GKN and Westland,' one leading institutional shareholder said yesterday. GKN's real motive, they suggest, is not the determination to exploit sales potential in the world's 40 areas of conflict. Instead, the Pounds 496m bid for Westland camouflages a deal engineered by the group's tax advisers, not its military strategists. Combining Westland's lucrative spares and overhaul business with GKN's existing defence and engineering operations would enable GKN to increase the proportion of UK sales to 40 per cent of turnover. In turn, the Yeovil-based group's pre-tax profits - up 22 per cent to Pounds 30.5m in the 12 months to October 1 last year - would enable GKN to recover a mountain of pent-up advance corporation tax. The prospect of recoverable ACT was arguably the most significant factor in persuading the engineering group to increase its stake in Westland and make a full bid rather than sell out to other potential suitors such as British Aero-space. In 1992, GKN wrote off Pounds 132.6m in recoverable ACT and made another sizeable provision last year. And, as Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman, admitted this week, releasing those funds 'should impact favourably on the group's overall corporation tax rate.' Although Westland is expected to contribute only about Pounds 300m to GKN's total sales of Pounds 2.5bn, the promise of a 5 percentage reduction in the overall tax ratio proved an arresting proposition. 'The reason for doing this deal is purely financial,' according to one engineering analyst. 'The idea of a defence synergy between armoured vehicles and helicopters is a bit far fetched.' That view was echoed by a leading defence industry analyst, who added: 'It's all about the tax angle. It changes GKN's risk profile, but I'm not sure they realise the diffi-culties of the aerospace ind-ustry.' GKN, meanwhile, has difficulties of its own. Its recent performance has been hampered by increasingly tough trading conditions, particularly in automotive components which account for 58 per cent of sales. Weak demand from the European car industry pinned pre-tax profits at Pounds 60m (Pounds 60.9m) in the first half of 1993, and prospects for the full year have been hit by heavy redundancy and restructuring costs. Those charges are expected to result in 1993 pre-tax profits falling by more than 20 per cent to Pounds 97m. Against that background, and GKN's commitment to dispose of peripheral activities, the potential contribution of an enlarged defence division is by no means assured. Westland brings with it a Pounds 1.45bn order backlog, but it has only one firm order for its flagship, the EH101 helicopter, developed jointly with Agusta of Italy. The civilian market for such aircraft is small and shrinking, and defence analysts question whether the EH101, costing at least Pounds 30m each, will prove an economic option as military spending comes under increasing pressure. GKN was only persuaded last summer that there was still life in its defence business when Kuwait ordered 200 Warrior armed vehicles. Up to then, it had been considering disposing of the defence arm. Had it done so, it would have presaged the strategy later followed by BAe, which came to the conclusion that defence, aerospace and automotive engineering do not sit happily together. Yet Sir David Lees has changed his mind and now believes that Westland and an export-driven armoured vehicle division can push group turnover beyond Pounds 3bn. However, overseas sales, the main driving force behind the potential success of a reinvigorated defence business, could be undermined by a rumbling dispute with Arab governments which GKN would inherit with Westland. Last year the helicopter manufacturer was awarded Pounds 385m damages against the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation over the 1980 decision by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to abandon a helicopter order. Trying to tease that money out of potential Middle East customers is a risky prospect for GKN if it is relying on the Kuwaiti order for Warriors to lead to greater things. Nevertheless, the group is committed to winning outright control of Westland and is in a strong position to do so having secured United Technologies' 18.7 per cent stake. With 47 per cent of the company already in its pocket, GKN thinks it can convince the institutions that the company's best interests lie in a diversified group with a track record of forging joint ventures and overseas collaborations. Such ventures could offset potential difficulties with Arab customers. But with speculation that Sir David Lees wants Westland mainly to improve his own group's tax profile, the institutions will seek an improved offer before sell-ing. As one institution said yesterday: 'He will have to do better if he wants to see GKN helicopters and armoured vehicles working in concert.'</p>

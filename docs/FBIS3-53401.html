In  Cairo, the Arab League confirmed that it intends to send an  envoy to Yemen as part of its efforts to contain the  deteriorating situation there.    In Amman, the source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Jordan will  not refrain from continuing its mediation efforts between the  Yemeni leaders despite the failure of the Jordanian efforts to  promote a reconciliation so far.    He added that consultations are under way between al-Sharif  Zayd Bin-Shakir, Jordanian chief of the Royal Court, and members  of the Yemeni leadership to make arrangements for a visit King  Husayn of Jordan intends to make early next month to Sanaa and  Aden to eliminate existing differences between the Yemeni  president and his deputy and to bridge their views to ensure  survival of the unity of the two parts of Yemen.    He stressed that the Jordanian leadership was saddened by  the  failure of the efforts to bring about a reconciliation meeting  between the Yemeni president and his deputy in Ta'izz last  Sunday. He confirmed that Bin-Shakir's visit to Sanaa and Aden  on Monday was made in the context of the Jordanian mediation,  sponsored by King Husayn, for the reconciliation of the  officials of the two parts of Yemen.    During that visit, the source said, Bin-Shakir met with  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and conveyed to him a message  from King Husayn expressing Jordan's willingness to provide  every possible assistance requested by the Yemeni leaders to  ensure continuation of Yemeni unity. The meeting was attended  by Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid  Abu-Shawarib and Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah.  Bin-Shakir also visited Aden and met with Vice President 'Ali  Salim al-Bid in the presence of a number of Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] leaders in south Yemen.    The source added that the meeting between Bin-Shakir and  al-Bid dealt with ways of easing the tension between the Yemeni  leaders and then working for a reconciliation meeting between  the Yemeni president and vice president, but al-Bid has so far  not given a full answer as to whether or not he would attend a  reconciliation meeting with Salih in the presence of King Husayn  in an area halfway between Sanaa and Aden early next month.    The same Jordanian source denied reports of the dispatch of  Jordanian forces to Yemen, describing them as inaccurate. He  said that the Yemeni leadership had asked the Jordanian Army  General Command to help it in providing expertise and advice  regarding a plan the Yemeni leadership intends to implement with  the aim of reorganizing the Yemeni Army units. He said that, on  Monday's visit to Yemen, the Jordanian chief of the Royal Court  was accompanied by Staff Major General 'Id Kamil al-Rawdan,  Jordanian Army assistant chief of staff for operations and  training. He added that during the visit Maj. Gen. al-Rawdan  met with senior Yemeni Army officers and discussed with them the  possibility of the Jordanian Army command contributing to the  preparation and implementation of future plans for the  reorganization of the Yemeni Army, and it was agreed to send a  limited number of Jordanian officers to participate in the  preparation of a new plan for that purpose.    In conclusion and in reply to a question, the Jordanian  source said that Jordan is primarily interested in the  continuation of security and stability in fraternal Yemen and in  finding a solution to the current Yemeni crisis through dialogue  and positive understanding between the Yemeni leaders.    In Cairo, informed sources at the Arab League Secretariat  have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Arab League is holding  consultations with the Arab states on the situation in Yemen,  prevention of its partition, and preservation of its people's  unity. They added that the Arab League secretary general has  sent messages on this matter to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in the context of the  endeavors to contain events there.    They also said that the Arab League is considering several  options regarding the situation in Yemen with a view to putting  an end to conflict and to the disputes between Salih and al-Bid,  the two leaders in power. The Arab League had issued a  statement expressing concern about the deteriorating situation  in fraternal Yemen.</p>

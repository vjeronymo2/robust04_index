			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Arts: The age of masked balls and hedonism - William Packer delights in 'The Glory of Venice' at the Royal Academy Did young people take their pleasure when the sea was warm in May/ Balls and masks begun at midnight, burning ever to mid-day . . .? Browning's ironical lament was written when the snuffing out of The Most Serene Republic by Napoleon was still, if only just, a living memory, and Venice herself at her lowest ebb under the Austrian heel. To look back to the 18th century, the period of this exhibition, was then indeed to look back to a golden age, albeit the impalpable gold of a setting sun. The Glory of Venice? In turning to the second and last extraordinary creative flourish in the history of that constantly remarkable city, the Royal Academy completes a double begun 11 years ago with The Genius of Venice, which was that of her artists of the 16th century, from Bellini to Titian and Veronese. By the time of the birth of Gianbattista Tiepolo in 1696, a full century on from the death of Tintoretto, the days of Venice as one of Europe's great powers had long gone, yet her social authority and creative energies, at least, were undiminished. Here she was at the turn of that last great century with churches and palazzi still to build, and the world to entertain. With such artists as Sebastiano Ricci and Piazzetta at hand, and Francesco Guardi, Canaletto and his nephew, Bellotto, and Canova and the younger Tiepolo, Domenico, all to come, here surely was a team that only the century of Titian itself could outplay. Above all, there was the great Tiepolo, Gianbattista, bestriding his times as Titian bestrode his. Given such evident accomplishment - and there are moments when the pyrotechnical magnificence of it all, whether of the regattas and festivals of Carlevaris and Canaletto, the castles of Bellotto or the soaring compositions of Tiepolo, quite takes the breath away - what then had changed? For here we have the sacred and the profane in subject-matter, just as we had with Titian and Veronese, and certainly, with Tiepolo and Piazzetta, two of the last great exponents of the great religious machine. Yet suddenly how worldly it has become. But, you might say, was there not a certain splendid worldliness in Veronese, for example? Yes, indeed: but that quality now, in the 18th century, seems to take on more openly hedonistic an aspect, flippant at times and even cynical. And what is cynicism but a kind of civilised despair. How flightily Sebastiano Ricci's angel kicks its heels at its visitation of St Peter. With what wicked a toss of the head Piazzetta's angel flirts with its assorted saints - none of these artists stands any of that nonsense of the sexlessness of angels. How well-seen and physical in the modelling, how womanly, is Tiepolo's Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, and how easily he slips into the franker if still discreet eroticism of the delicious Armida with Rinaldo in her garden. 'Was a lady such a lady, cheeks so round and lips so red,/ On her neck the small face buoyant, like a bell-flower on its bed,/ O'er the breast's superb abundance where a man might base his head.' And if we can take our eyes off what is going on, we find the painted surface no less physical, folds and foliage alike handled with a bravura freedom and sophistication that are unsurpassable. And of course life itself goes on, to be celebrated as much in the mundane commerce of the city as in its festivals. With Carlevaris it is the state procession on the Grand Canal: Canaletto gives us both the fun of the Regatta and the teeming wharves of the Bacino: Guardi takes us into the masked gaming halls of the Ridotto. We follow Longhi through the incidental social round and go al fresco with Domenico Tiepolo to one of the most humorously delightful parties in the show, with his masked dancers prancing so neatly, footing it featly. It is one of the many strengths of the exhibition that artists hitherto under-played, such as Domenico Tiepolo, Carlevaris and Longhi, even Bellotto and Piazzetta, now come into their own. The three Bellotto paintings, of Verona, Dresden and the castle at Konigstein, are spectacular together, and suddenly prefigure the northern realist schools of the next century, and the work of such artists as Kobke and Eckersberg. The drawings of heads by Piazzetta, too, of young men and women flirting together, is a revelation, and it is the greatest pity that more was not made of the drawings of Longhi, here represented by but two indifferent examples. It is altogether a magnificent show, and 'Glory' is indeed the right word for it, if only we are worldly and uncensorious enough to accept that essential, insistent worldliness. 'And what of Venice and her people, merely born to bloom and drop,/ Here on earth they bore their fruitage, mirth and folly were the crop: / What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had to stop.' Did she, la Serenissima, foresee that end? Perhaps: but she also knew, for the moment, that it had not stopped yet. It is that last great, sad, wonderful interval that we now celebrate with her again.

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALHAMBRA POLICE FATALLY SHOOT DRIVER WHO LUNGED AT OFFICER  </P> <P> Alhambra police shot and killed an apparently unarmed man Thursday morning when  he bolted from his car after a traffic stop and then charged a pursuing officer  in a dark stairway, authorities said.  </P> <P> The man, in his 20s, was not identified. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the  scene of the shooting, which occurred on a quiet block of apartment houses near  the corner of Valley Boulevard and 4th Street.  </P> <P> An officer stopped the man at the intersection about 4 a.m. after he observed  him driving slowly in a maroon Honda Civic with no headlights on, said  sheriff's deputies, who were asked to assist in the investigation.  </P> <P> During the stop, the driver was acting "suspiciously" and giving conflicting  information about who owned the car, sheriff's spokesman Gabe Ramirez said.  </P> <P> The officer then called for a second patrol car, but the man ran off on 4th  Street, "reaching toward his waistband as he ran," Ramirez said.  </P> <P> The officers ran after him and were searching the area around an apartment  building "when he suddenly appeared from a darkened stairway and charged" one  of the policemen, Ramirez said.  </P> <P> The officer fired once with his service revolver, striking the man in the  chest. Neither of the officers was injured, and no weapons were found on the  man or in the area, Ramirez said.  </P></p>

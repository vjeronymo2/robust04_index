			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Tougher line on media urged The Labour leadership came under pressure from delegates to make a firmer commitment to break up media monopolies and introduce regulation guaranteeing the freedom of a pluralistic press. Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow heritage secretary, said while cross-media ownership was a fact of life, a future Labour government would 'regulate both nationally and regionally to prevent media monopolies and protect the future of public service broadcasting'. A succession of speakers in the debate urged the leadership to go further and draw up a 'clearer policy on media ownership'. Ms Maggie Lee, from North Norfolk, said: 'If democracy means anything to Labour it must mean an informed democracy. We need to spell out where the party stands on this issue. We need proper newspaper regulation in an attempt to break up the monopolies.' The concentration of media ownership in Italy was cited by some delegates as an example of what could happen in the UK if the present situation was left unchanged. There were also calls to prevent 'media barons' such as Mr Rupert Murdoch using profits from television interests to help cut the price of newspapers 'to put others out of business'. Bectu, the broadcasting union, said there was a need to preserve and promote European public-service broadcasting in the face of competition from weakly-regulated private-sector satellite television channels. Ms Mowlam said the parliamentary Labour party would continue to campaign against moves to further deregulate the media industry. Delegates overwhelmingly backed a call to reconfirm the party's commitment to public-service broadcasting and to prevent any future moves to deregulate the industry.</p>

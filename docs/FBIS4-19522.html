			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christine Domforth: "Key Rates Decrease, But Not </F> Lending Interest Rates"]    [Excerpts] Vienna -- The Austrian National Bank (OeNB) cut  the key rates yesterday. The discount rate was decreased from 5  to 4.75 percent and the Lombard rate from 6 to 5.75 percent.  The Gomex rate, which is important for the money-procurement  costs of the banks, was decreased from 5.5 to 5.4 percent. The  new rates are valid as of today, Friday. The first round of  interest cuts in 1994 was implemented in mid-February. [passage  omitted]    In an interview with DIE PRESSE, OeNB President Maria  Schaumayer justified the move using the "harmonization of the  European interest rate structure" argument. It was also taken  in anticipation of a decreasing inflation tendency. Austria's  key rates continue to be lower than the German rates, which,  according to Schaumayer, is a "sign of strength" and a  confirmation of Austria's line. She hopes that, as a result of  the decreased rate of price increases in Germany, Austria will  again import stability from there in the near future. [passage  omitted]</p>

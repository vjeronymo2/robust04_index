			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPPORT FOR GAY STAGE  </P> <P> In Ray Loynd's Jan. 7 article "Where Does Gay Theatre Go From Here?" he point  out that gay males and lesbians have a poor record supporting each other's  productions.  </P> <P> As executive producer of San Diego's most recent entry, a new musical comedy,  "O'Mary's," I can vouch for that claim.  </P> <P> Although we made the fatal mistake of relying too heavily on ticket sales from  this market segment, we were frankly appalled at how few gay men and women  showed any interest at our gay-themed upbeat messages for the '90s.  </P> <P> Not only did they not buy tickets, but they failed to show even after a  concerted effort to host their attendance!  </P> <P> "O'Mary's" has sold to and been attended by primarily heterosexual mainstream  theatergoers -- lots of seniors!  </P> <P> MARLIN SHIPLEY  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

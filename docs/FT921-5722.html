			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): The boardroom beckons - What makes a director different from a mere manager? They are a mixed bunch: 19 men and one woman crowded into the Institute of Director's fourth-floor London training room for a two-day course on The Role of the Company Director. They have come to learn what makes becoming a director different from being merely a manager. 'You can be a senior executive of ICI, responsible for millions of pounds, but you don't have the same responsibilities in law as the director of a small company,' says John Jackson, the IOD's programme manager. One participant has been a director for the past year of a family-owned Midlands car dealership. Another has been invited to become a director in two months time, while a third has insisted on attending the course as part of his redundancy package. He is still looking for new employment. The cultures of the companies from which they come are varied. One family-owned group holds its board meetings over Sunday lunch. Some hold regular monthly or quarterly meetings, but one participant, the director of a foreign-owned company, has attended just one board meeting in nine months and that was only because the directors involved came together 'by accident'. Their reasons for joining the course are equally diverse. One, a director for the past nine months, says he wants to avoid repeating the mistakes he feels he has already made while a second, yet to join the board, wants 'to know what I am in for'. Another, a member of a third-generation family company, faces competition from several siblings and wants to improve his chances of winning a board seat. The passing of recent legislation has made the job of being a company director a much more serious undertaking than in the past. The Insolvency Act and the Company Directors' Disqualification Act have exposed even non-executive directors to considerable financial penalties and the possibility of disqualification for up to 15 years for negligence, let alone fraud, if they are found guilty of trading while insolvent. It is for this reason that Henry Short, an experienced businessman and 'boardroom consultant' devotes so much time to what he calls 'legal and general' issues. The whole of the second day of the course is given over to an explanation of the law relating to directors. Yet, for all the focus that recent legal changes have put on the role of the director, the law is a poor guide to directors on how they should go about their task. The Companies Act for example sets down minimum standards but provides little practical help in establishing best practice, Short explains. A company need hold only one directors' meeting a year though this is clearly inadequate for the running of any business. The Memorandum and Articles of Association which companies are required to have are also of little guidance. Most UK companies define their area of operations very broadly in order not to exclude themselves from future opportunities. Few directors read beyond the paragraphs relating to the dismissal of directors, Short comments dryly. Nor is the law much help when it comes to defining a director. John Watkinson, a solicitor who provides the legal input for the course, falls back on a handy aphorism provided by Sir George Jessel, a 19th century judge. 'It does not much matter what you call them so long as you understand what their true position is, which is that they are merely commercial men managing a trading concern for the benefit of themselves and all other shareholders in it.' Most managers are flattered and excited if they are asked to become a director but the recent legislation has made it more important than ever that they check what they are letting themselves in for, says Short. 'You can't present the chairman with a list of questions before agreeing to accept but you might say: 'I am flattered but it is a serious matter. Can I discuss some matters before I give a final decision?'' he suggests. The board is unlikely to show you the minutes of previous board meetings before you become a director but you should be able to see an up-to-date set of accounts. One of the most common failings of newly-appointed directors is their inability to rise to the broader responsibilities which come with the job, says Short. 'It won't do to be a promoted manager, continuing the job you were doing before.' In management meetings, a manager should be ready to speak on his specialist area - finance, production or marketing - but in a board meeting, a director should be informed and able to express a view on any subject on the agenda. Directors must also be able to take a more strategic overview of their company while leaving the day-to-day running of the company to the managing director. Being a director means 'knowing where you are today; deciding where you are going tomorrow and considering who or what might stop you from getting there', says Short. The focus of the activities of a company's directors is the board meeting, the style of which can determine the effectiveness of the directors' contribution. Short recalls one company where the chairman dominated proceedings, talking constantly and dictating his remarks into a tape recorder. Meetings were held in the board room with participants seated in comfortable leather armchairs. The company secretary, clearly aware that he filled no useful role, spent the meeting doodling while the two young managing directors sat smoking large cigars. 'I advised them to at least sit round a table,' says Short. One year later they did sit round a table and the meeting was conducted in a more businesslike way, but old habits died hard and the chairman still dictated his comments into a Dictaphone while the company secretary doodled abstractedly. 'So many board meetings are below par,' says Short. 'Companies should formalise things. They should not hold meetings over lunch.' The legislation setting tough penalties for directors has given an added urgency to the need for careful records to be kept of board meetings. 'It's no good saying: 'I told them we were heading for trouble,'' says Short. 'You must have your comments minuted. These cases come up two, three or four years after the event by which time no-one can remember who said what. The minute book is your evidence to explain your case if an insolvency practitioner is trying to establish what went wrong.' The second day of the course, devoted entirely to the legal aspects of being a company director, provides a rapid, though still demanding, circuit of the masses of legislation governing companies, their directors, employees and contracts. 'You have added responsibilities above those of a manager,' says Watkinson, before going on to detail the myriad instances in which directors might fall foul of the law. An early investment in legal advice can save a very large sum at a later date, he notes. At the end of the two days the 20 'merely commercial men (and women)' have been given new insights into what their role entails. They are just a handful of the 3,000 directors who will take one of the IOD's courses this year. But, with between 350,000 and 500,000 company directors in the UK, raising the level of directors' competence is a mammoth task.

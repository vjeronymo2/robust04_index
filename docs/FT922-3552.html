			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / EC central banks to press ahead with monetary plans: Debate on policy is calling into question UK institutions such as discount houses EUROPE'S central banks intend to press ahead with a controversial attempt to draw up a common European monetary policy despite the setback to plans for economic and monetary union dealt by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty. According to senior European monetary officials, the issue, which already has exposed big differences between the British, German and French central banks, is potentially more contentious than the disputed location of the proposed European central bank (ECB) itself. The shape of a future European monetary policy and the way it is put into practice could have a significant influence on European financial markets, including London. The debate is calling into question specifically British institutions such as the discount houses, which channel liquidity from the Bank of England to the UK banking system, and raising the possibility that Britain may have to adopt continental-style monetary instruments such as minimum reserve requirements. Any final decision on a European monetary policy will also influence the structure and organisation of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), that under the Maastricht plan is due to be established in the third and final stage of Emu. Three models for operating a European monetary policy have emerged from talks in the EC's committee of central bank governors and among senior officials in the committee's monetary policy sub-committee and a special 'economic unit' attached to the committee's secretariat. Most contentious is a decentralised system, proposed by the French central bank, where the operation of monetary policy would be kept as far as possible among the existing national central banks, which will coexist with the proposed ECB as part of the ESCB. The French claim this principle best conforms with the principle of subsidiarity, which calls for decisions to be taken at the lowest possible government level. There is a Bundesbank-type variant, in which monetary operations such as repurchase agreements could be arranged through national central banks in much the same way that the state central banks in Germany are at present used to assemble and process bids for central bank funds in Germany. A centralised system in which the monetary operations would be concentrated in one location has also been under discussion. This system would be analogous to the Bank of England's method of providing funds and setting interest rates through institutions such as the discount houses. However, it appears that the Bank has not been actively pushing this idea as a model for Europe, because it realises that it would be impossible to transfer UK-type institutions to the continent. Instead, it has supported ideas for a decentralised system which would allow the UK to keep some of its monetary institutions. Some of the tension underlying these issues came to the surface last last month in a speech given by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president. He rejected the centralised, British-style model as being inconsistent with subsidiarity. However, he did not spell out a more deep-seated German concern that the French ideas could lead to national central banks setting slightly different interest rates from those established by the ECB. This, the Germans fear, would create competitive distortions and upset the principle that monetary policy should be the same throughout a future economic and monetary union with the primary goal of combatting inflation. Many other difficult questions have to be resolved. A dispute between the Bundesbank and Bank of England is possible over whether the future ECB could force banks to deposit non-interest bearing minimum reserves with it to help it control EC monetary policy. Another open question is whether the ECB should set a broad money target for the eventual monetary union. The Maastricht summit gave the job of preparing the single monetary policy to a new European Monetary Institute, which is due to begin operating at the beginning of 1994. However, the central bankers have decided that the issues are so complex that they need to be tackled before that date.</p>

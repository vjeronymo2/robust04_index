			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHY ARTS COUNCILS MUST ATTRACT ETHNIC MEMBERS;  </P> <P> MINORITIES: THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL, WHICH CONTROLS GRANT MONEY, CRITICIZES  AS INADEQUATE THE NUMBER OF MINORITIES ON CULTURAL BOARDS OF DIRECTORS.  </P> <P> It's a sensitive subject. People admit nervousness when asked to talk about it.  "It strikes terror in my heart," one woman said.  </P> <P> But arts organizations in California, indeed, nationwide, have been talking  about it a lot more lately. It has to do with the color of one's skin, with  numbers and ratios.  </P> <P> The subject is the number of racial minorities who serve as board members for  the large museums, orchestras, theater troupes, dance companies and other major  arts organizations. The catalytic agent here is the California Arts Council,  whose job it is to distribute $13.5 million in arts subsidies statewide this  year.  </P> <P> The number of minorities on some boards has been too low for too long, charges  the council, which this year slashed its grant to Costa Mesa's South Coast  Repertory by 23% from 1988 -- despite top praise for artistic and managerial  strength -- in part because of weak "ethnic diversity" on the theater's board  and staff.  </P> <P> A lack of diversity on arts boards, entities that set the tone for institutions  and shape programming in conjunction with paid staff, is a national problem,  many experts say.  </P> <P> "Continued and increasing efforts to include minorities on the staff, on the  boards and in the audiences of the nation's cultural life have met with only  very limited success," wrote Robert Garfias, an anthropology professor at UC  Irvine, in a report to the National Endowment for the Arts on cultural  diversity and the arts.  </P> <P> "The problem is that many organizations feel the need to have minorities on  their boards in order to comply," said Garfias, who serves on the National  Council on the Arts. "But the reason (to seek diversity) is not simply to  comply, but to hear what these people have to say."  </P> <P> During a California Arts Council meeting in August, just before the vote that  reduced SCR's grant, council member Consuelo Santos Killins issued the  strongest statement on the topic ever made by a council official.  </P> <P> "This is the last time I'm going to vote to fund applications for large-budget  organizations unless board of directors' makeup starts to change radically,"  Killins said.  </P> <P> Three minorities serve on SCR's 48-member board, according to data used by the  council to determine 1989-90 organizational grants to 34 groups with budgets of  $1 million or more. The data may have changed slightly since sent to the  council by these groups last year, but overall, boards statewide still aren't  much more integrated than SCR's, and sometimes they are much less.  </P> <P> SCR vigorously protested its decreased grant of $81,950. But the council stood  firm, noting that the situation on some boards has not improved at all over  several years, even though all 34 big-budget groups have been told repeatedly  to make their boards better reflect California's multi-ethnic population.  </P> <P> Among other organizations' board compositions: One minority sits on the Los  Angeles Philharmonic's 35-member board; the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary  Art's 26-member board includes one member of a racial minority; three sit on  the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco's 27-member board.  </P> <P> This year, a council panel that evaluates grant applications sent word to all  but two of these groups that, in the panel's view, need to better integrate  their boards.  </P> <P> Locally, Newport Harbor Art Museum, which added five minority board members  this past year, did not receive the panel's comment. But the evaluation on  Costa Mesa-based Opera Pacific, like SCR and Santa Ana-based Pacific Symphony,  read: "Their board needs further diversification."  </P> <P> The county's single largest arts organization, the Orange County Performing  Arts Center, is privately funded and, therefore, subject to none of the  California Arts Council's scrutiny as to its board makeup. The Center has one  minority person on its 52-member board.  </P> <P> For the record, Center President Thomas R. Kendrick says that fund-raising  ability, not ethnic diversity, is the chief concern of the Center's board in  aligning new members. As an institution that presents arts from "Anglo/European  traditions . . . clearly you are going to more easily find people (from that  group) to give to that than (people) from specific ethnic cultures," Kendrick  said.  </P> <P> According to CAC grant procedure, board diversity is a vital element of  community outreach activities, such as free concerts for low-income  schoolchildren, that bring arts to the under-served.  </P> <P> For smaller arts organizations with budgets of up to $1 million, outreach is  suggested, but not mandatory. But for the state's largest institutions, which  annually win the heftiest grants and serve the largest audiences, it is a  prerequisite for a grant.  </P> <P> Why is outreach -- and specifically board diversity -- a council concern?  </P> <P> Because as a tax-supported state agency, "it is our legislative mandate to  serve all the people of California," said Killins, of San Jose. "The board is a  legal policy-making body in the arts so it has to be participated in by all  constituents, not just one segment.  </P> <P> "People say we have to have (minorities on boards) because of the state's  demographics," Killins said. "Demographics are important, but the main reason  for it is we have to have all constituencies in on the decision-making and in  on the hard work and responsibility."  </P> <P> The CAC sets no quotas for evaluating ethnic diversity on boards. And, to help  determine grant size, it scrutinizes board makeup not by itself, but as one  aspect of an organization's total outreach picture.  </P> <P> Still, "we have not seen the kind of progress we would hope for," said CAC  Executive Director Robert H. Reid.  </P> <P> Board diversity "is not something one does overnight," said Gerald Yoshitomi, a  council member from Los Angeles. "But over four or five years, people have gone  through four or five board nominations, and in some cases, obviously not made  many changes.  </P> <P> "Then you see the strides made by an institution like Newport Harbor Art  Museum, which is in the same community as South Coast Repertory. That says if  it's possible for Newport, it should be possible for other folks in the area."  </P> <P> In Orange County, there are 12 minority persons (or 7.4%) among 161 board  members on four large-budget arts organizations that receive state subsidies,  according to the council. It defines minorities as African Americans, American  Indians, Chicano/Latinos and Asian/Pacific Islanders.  </P> <P> But even that low figure is slightly inflated by the fact that some individuals  may serve on more than one board. Cal State Fullerton President Jewel Plummer  Cobb, for instance, sits on the boards of Newport Harbor Art Museum and Pacific  Symphony.  </P> <P> By comparison, minorities make up 26.7% of Orange County's population,  according to the National Planning Data Corp., which estimates that number will  rise to 29.8% by 1994.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the state, 101 (or 7.8%) of 1,293 arts board members are from  minorities. Statewide, minorities make up about 38.4% of the population.  </P> <P> Locally, officials at the major state-funded arts organizations say they've  made progress in board diversity and stress that they intend to go further.  </P> <P> In addition, all these groups have outreach activities. They range from SCR's  Hispanic Playwrights Project, which helps young Latino writers produce their  works in mainstream resident theaters, to Opera Pacific's children's  presentations about the dangers of drug abuse, to Pacific Symphony's free  concerts given in the county's Latino community, a program guided in part by an  eight-member Latino advisory committee.  </P> <P> Still, the big question looms: Why do Anglos continue to hold the vast majority  of seats on arts groups' boards?  </P> <P> Many Orange County arts officials say that board members are selected first and  foremost for an abiding interest in the art form, not for ethnicity or other  secondary concerns, and that finding such leaders takes time.  </P> <P> "Ethnicity is an important criterion we have in seeking leadership," said David  Emmes, producing artistic director of Tony-winning South Coast Repertory.  </P> <P> But, Emmes stressed, probably the most important criterion is that prospective  board members "are capable of providing the kind of community leadership we  need and have demonstrated their interest in supporting professional resident  theater." Accordingly, "we will move forward to meet (the council's requests  for diversity) when we can and in conjunction with being responsible to the  needs of this theater."  </P> <P> Pacific Symphony board President Randy Johnson said a general lack of interest  in Western classical music makes finding minorities for his orchestra's board  especially challenging. Two minority persons sit on Pacific Symphony's  42-member board.  </P> <P> Asserting that only 2% of the total population regularly attends classical  music concerts, Johnson said that figure is even less encouraging among  minority populations. "There are many people, particularly among minorities,  who do not have a cultural tradition of listening to classical music," said  Johnson.  </P> <P> "I suppose if someone told me to find (several minority board members) between  now and Jan. 1, I'm sure we could probably do that," he said. "But the most  crucial thing is finding someone interested in the symphony."  </P> <P> David DiChiera, general manager of Opera Pacific, echoed the notion.  </P> <P> Now starting its fourth season, "Opera Pacific is a very young organization,"  DiChiera said. "What we've been doing in these first years is simply to find  people who want to support the opera company and who are interested in its  growth, rather than focusing on who they are or what they represent."  </P> <P> But Ruth Ding, a founding board member of the troupe and leading supporter of  local Asian cultural groups, had another idea about why she is one of only two  minority persons among 38 Opera Pacific board members:  </P> <P> Opera Pacific requires board members to make personal donations, though not all  organizations do. Ding said that most minorities are not wealthy enough to meet  those demands.  </P> <P> Ding said that last year she gave Opera Pacific $2,000 and hopes to give the  same amount this year. But "minorities often don't have the means to give that  much. If my husband did not have the money," she said, "I could not sit on the  board. You have to donate a certain amount each year."  </P> <P> Council member Killins rejects the defense she hears from arts groups that they  can't find minorities because minorities aren't wealthy enough. Personal  contribution is not what it's all about, she said.  </P> <P> "I know some minorities that aren't wealthy but that are able to move and raise  a great deal of money. And when you think of the economic clout of Hispanics in  California, you're missing the boat."  </P> <P> Indeed, Ding said last year she raised $60,000 for Opera Pacific and hopes to  raise $100,000 this year.  </P> <P> But one man who is a major fund-raiser for local Latino political, cultural and  community causes, who is also an Orange County minority board member, disagreed  with Killins. Insisting on anonymity, he said that in the Latino community,  raising money for the arts is most difficult of all.  </P> <P> "It's a question of priorities. We do have Hispanics with affluence and  discretionary income in Orange County, but there are so many needs or perceived  needs in the Hispanic community. It is very easy to raise $5,000 for academic  scholarships or amnesty, but (getting) $5,000 for the arts is very difficult.  </P> <P> "Arts groups need to make some adjustments. I don't mean lower their standards,  but they should understand that Hispanics don't have access to large amounts of  money they can bring to an organization." But, he added, they can serve on  boards in other important ways.  </P> <P> Council Director Reid agreed -- in part. "The assumption that only Caucasians  can raise money is fallacious," he said. But he does not believe, contrary to  what he is told by grant applicants, that money -- giving it or raising it --  is the "basic" duty of a board member.  </P> <P> "Boards function as more than just entities to raise money," he said. "Their  responsibilities also include guiding institutions artistically, providing the  leadership that hires the professional staff."  </P> <P> No officials at major local arts groups questioned whether it is fair for the  council to ask for greater board diversity in Orange County, where the  percentage of minorities is lower than it is statewide.  </P> <P> SCR's Emmes, however, said that "it might be easier to find leadership" within  the black community if there were more blacks in Orange County. (Blacks  represent 1.2% of the county's population.)  </P> <P> But state-funded groups have an obligation to make their boards reflect "what  the state looks like, whether a community does or does not have a particular  percentage of an ethnic population," Reid said. "Certainly Orange County is  looking for tourists to come to its cultural institutions."  </P> <P> One black arts figure said that officials at county arts organizations aren't  working hard enough to add blacks to their boards.  </P> <P> "If they are reaching out to get them, I don't know about it," said Adleane  Hunter, executive director of the Black Actors Theater, the county's only black  theater troupe. She has never been asked to join a local board, nor been asked  to recommend anyone for such a position, she said.  </P> <P> While the issue of board diversity continues to concern arts officials  nationwide, local leaders offer some solutions.  </P> <P> "I think the arts organizations should make it known to the Hispanic community  that they are in good faith seeking memberships on their board," said Rodolfo  Montejano, a Pacific Symphony board member.  </P> <P> "At least 500 to 1,000 Latinos in Orange County" with interests in the arts and  time to serve can be contacted through such Santa Ana-based organizations as  the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,  the Santiago Club and the Relampago del Cielo dance troupe, Montejano said.  </P> <P> Council member Killins said she is working with the council on a manual "that  will teach people how to do develop outreach." The booklet will include  information on how organizations seeking to diversify their boards can find  qualified minorities.  </P> <P> Minority advisory panels, such as Pacific Symphony's Hispanic committee, are a  good way to develop ties with minority communities and find board members, said  Tere Romo, council organizational grants program manager.  </P> <P> But the long-term solution -- to board diversity and an overall cultural  diversity -- essentially boils down to more diverse arts programming, Romo  said.  </P> <P> Given the state's changing demographics, the product performed on stage or  displayed in galleries must be expanded beyond "Western European" art forms in  order for arts groups to thrive, "or even to sell tickets," she said.  </P> <P> "If arts groups hold onto a very narrow viewpoint of culture, they are not  going to build audiences or find board members who want to commit all that time  or money to promote something that has nothing to do with them."  </P> <P> Some institutions have made progress in this regard, but some still take a  missionary approach and far too few regularly integrate arts from other  cultures into their programs and, critically, collaborate with ethnic groups to  present works with them, Romo said.  </P> <P> "The council would like to see that major institutions create bridges to ethnic  communities so that it's a two-way street, so that culture is going both ways."  </P> <P> </P> <P> NEXT STEP  </P> <P> "Developing Multicultural Boards: Experiences and Opportunities," a panel on  how to develop executive and advisory boards of art institutions "that  adequately reflect the cultural make-up of the community," will be held 7:30 to  9:30 p.m. Monday at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center,  Sumitomo room, 244 S. San Pedro St., downtown Los Angeles. Speakers are Jerry  Allen, executive director, the Yerba Buena Center, San Francisco; Hansonia  Caldwell, dean of fine arts and humanities, Cal State Dominguez Hills, and  Willow Young, independent arts and culture consultant.

Reservations  required: (213) 874-1625.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The California Arts Council has criticized arts organizations statewide for  inadequate representation of ethnic minorities on their boards of directors.  The issue is affecting arts groups to the extent that the council has cut back  on the amount of grants to some organizations that otherwise have been highly  praised, including South Coast Repertory.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOARD COMPOSITION OF ORANGE COUNTY ARTS ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVING 1989-90  CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL GRANTS  </P> <P> MAJOR ORGANIZATIONS  </P> <P> SOUTH COAST REPERTORY:  </P> <P> ANGLOS: 45  </P> <P> MINORITIES: 3 (1 Asian/Pacific Islander, 2 Chicano/Latino)  </P> <P> OPERA PACIFIC:  </P> <P> ANGLOS: 36  </P> <P> MINORITIES: 2 (2 Asian/Pacific Islander)  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY:  </P> <P> ANGLOS: 40  </P> <P> MINORITIES: 2 (1 African American, 1 Chicano/Latino)  </P> <P> NEWPORT HARBOR ART MUSEUM:  </P> <P> ANGLOS: 28  </P> <P> MINORITIES: 5 (1 African American, 1 American Indian, 2 Asian/Pacific Islander,  1 Chicano/Latino)  </P> <P> THE PRIVATE SECTOR  </P> <P> O.C.

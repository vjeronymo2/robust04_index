			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Pedro Otero from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Excerpt] A few days ago, U.S. President William Clinton  called for a summit meeting of American chiefs of state in  Miami, Florida. He excluded Cuba from that invitation  considering that Cuba does not meet the democratic requirements  Washington has set for the rest of the area countries. So there  will be a meeting without Cuba, the rebel member of the  community.    Curiously, the call for a summit ignores the OAS, which  because of its nature and purposes should be the one to promote  such a summit, and ignoring them calls attention to a certain  degree of speed and improvisation.    It has been said that the meeting will be on democracy,  cooperation, and economy. In my opinion, this is an effort aimed  at intruding in Iberio-American summit meetings or, at least,  reducing the possibility of these summits working for unity and  regional cooperation.    There is no doubt the Miami meeting has untrustworthy  objectives. The United States tried to get invited to the first  summit meeting of Ibero-American presidents in Guadalajara,  Mexico, in 1991. It did not achieve its objective but it  maintained its desire to be kept officially informed of what was  discussed there. I do not know if it tried to do the same at the  other summits, in Spain and Brazil. The White House has  diminished the importance of what the Ibero-American chiefs of  state said. What is clear is that the current call is aimed at  reducing the significance of this movement, which will hold its  fourth summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June.    Once again Washington is marshalling its ability to try to  divide our people with plans and projects that have nothing to  do with our regional problems. We have been fooled for decades  with dreams about development and well-being. Now, on the  threshold of the 21st century, we are being told the same  stories we were told last century to try and keep us separated.  U.S. economic and military power has always obstructed Latin  America's fair aspirations for unity.    At the Guadalajara summit, President Fidel Castro expressed  caution about the so-far useless efforts to become an  economically powerful and politically united community in spite  of our huge resources and talent.

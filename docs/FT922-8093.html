			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Du Pont may sell unit DU PONT, the leading US chemicals company which last month agreed to buy the nylon business of Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK, yesterday said it may try to sell its electrical connector division. The business, which employs 3,200 people and has annual revenues of more than Dollars 400m, is to be hived off as a wholly owned subsidiary so that shares can be offered to the public. Du Pont indicated that the decision to sell shares would be made later in the year. The connector business itself is described by the company as 'moderately profitable'. In a separate development, Du Pont said it would cut 275 jobs in its computer division to reduce costs as the latest step in its plan to slash costs by Dollars 1bn by the end of the year.</p>

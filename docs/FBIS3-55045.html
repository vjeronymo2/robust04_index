			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitry Voskoboinikov, Igor </F> Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoi and others; from the "Diplomatic  Panorama" feature]    [Text] The forecast about personnel changes in Russia's  Foreign Ministry, published by INTERFAX on New Year's eve, has  been completely realized. On December 30, Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin endorsed the appointment of three deputy foreign  ministers.    Russia's former ambassador to Spain, Igor Ivanov, has been  appointed to the post of first deputy foreign minister. The  other deputy foreign ministers are Albert Chernyshov,  ex-ambassador to Turkey, and Aleksandr Panov, ex-ambassador to  the Republic of Korea. Panov has been replaced by former deputy  foreign minister Georgiy Kunadze.    According to INTERFAX sources, Chernyshov and Panov will be  in charge of Asian affairs (Panov - Japan and Asian and Pacific  Region, and Chernyshov - the Middle East).    The letter of resignation handed to President Yeltsin by  former first deputy foreign minister Anatoliy Adamishin  following his election to the State Duma as a representative of  the Yavlinskiy- Boldyrev-Lukin bloc makes it unclear what Ivanov  will do, said a high-ranking Russian diplomat.    He said that according to initial plans, Kozyrev was to have  two first deputies - Adamishin and Ivanov, the latter to be in  charge of Europe. Now that Adamishin has decided to quit the  Foreign Ministry, Ivanov's responsibilities are likely to be  enlarged, he said.    In his opinion, the vacancy will be filled soon.    "Practice shows that the minister must have two first  deputies," he added.    He found it difficult to say who exactly will become one of  Kozyrev's first deputies. "The situation will become clear next  week, when Kozyrev will resume his work following a brief  leave," he said.    He also noted that the personnel changes should not be  perceived as an alarm signal. "It is normal practice, allowing  diplomats to develop," said the Russian diplomat.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S TIME TO BAN GILL NETS  </P> <P> About a year and a half ago, the Legislature, responding to the mounting deaths  of sea mammals and marine birds caught in the narrowly woven plastic gill nets  used by commercial fishermen, banned the use of the deadly nets along the  Central California coast. They had already been banned in Northern California  waters.  </P> <P> It is now time to extend that ban and eliminate gill-net fishing along the  entire California coastline.  </P> <P> A bill (AB 1) introduced by Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) would do that  by creating a Marine Resource Protection Zone from the shoreline 3 miles out to  sea in an area running from Point Arguello above Santa Barbara down coast to  the Mexican Border. It would also include some waters around the Channel  Islands.  </P> <P> The measure, scheduled for a hearing Tuesday before the Assembly's Water, Parks  and Wildlife Committee, should be passed by the Legislature and signed into law  by the governor.  </P> <P> The problems caused by the use of gill nets by commercial fishermen is no  different off the Orange County coastline than it is anywhere else along the  western United States and Canada, where similar bans are now in force  protecting sea life.  </P> <P> Several months ago, scores of sea lions, some badly mutilated from their  horrible ordeal of struggling to free themselves from the deadly nets, washed  ashore on the Orange County shoreline between Seal Beach and Huntington Beach.  Three more dead sea lions turned up at Sunset Beach last Wednesday. That raises  the toll to more than 70 this year in that short stretch of county coastline.  </P> <P> The state reports that in the 1986-87 fishing year, more than 6,500 sea lions,  harbor seals and porpoises were killed in the nets that also pose a deadly  hazard to whales, dolphins and fish that are caught and die needlessly because  more than 70% of what the nets trap and kill are of no use to the commercial  fishermen.  </P> <P> Allen's bill is a fair one that will save valuable marine life from unnecessary  and painful death and provide commercial fishermen with capital investment to  purchase alternate fishing gear that is less destructive to the ocean's  environment and life chain. The money will come from the sale of a $3 stamp to  saltwater fishermen.  </P> <P> Economically and environmentally, AB 1 makes good sense. The state policy has  been a conservative one that dealt with gill-net bans case by case and area by  area whenever specific sea mammal and bird species were threatened.  </P> <P> It is time that sea life and the sportfishing industry in Southern California  were given the same protection from gill nets that the Legislature has provided  for the rest of the California coastline.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington is campaigning for foreign military  intervention in Haiti. The U.S. Government has proposed --  without success -- that Latin American and Caribbean countries  participate in a multinational force designed to invade Haiti  and oust the military from power, according to a report in the  Mexican newspaper EXCELSIOR, which claims that it holds  diplomatic documents proving its statement. The newspaper says  the U.S. State Department is sounding out the willingness in  Latin America and the Caribbean to participate in an armed  operation against the military regime in place in Haiti since  1991.    The article, signed by Jose Manuel Neva, EXCELSIOR  Washington  correspondent, points out that the government of President Bill  Clinton has failed in its attempts to convince countries to use  force, except for the Governments of Argentina, Uruguay, and the  English-speaking Caribbean countries that support the U.S.  initiative. The article points out that on 12 May, acting  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott gathered the Latin American  and Caribbean diplomatic corps accredited to the White House and  the OAS to sound out their participation in an invasion force.  Quoting reliable sources, Neva says this is one of the three  options being considered by the Clinton administration for a way  out of the Haitian crisis. The other is the formation of a force  of Haitian refugees, and the third -- which is the least  feasible -- is a U.S. unilateral intervention.    Private consultations also took place on the same topic  [words indistinct] other allies within the United Nations,  especially in the configuration and specific mandate of an  intervention force. Besides Secretary of State Talbott, Under  Secretary of State for American Affairs Alexander Watson, new  Clinton representative for Haiti (William Grey), and U.S.  Permanent Representative to the OAS Harriett Babbitt. [sentence  as heard] The conclave points out that the invasion of Haiti is  an option under active consideration and may be seen by the  White House as the last means Bill Clinton can use to resolve  the Haitian crisis.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Comments by Suren Zolyan, deputy to the VS RA [Republic of </F> Armenia Supreme Soviet], as reported by M. Grigoryan: "Rumors  About Azerbaijan's Arms Have Proved to Be Understated"]    [Text] Reports that Azerbaijan has been supplied  intensively with weapons and combat equipment by various  countries have been filtering into the press lately. In  particular, it reached the point this September that the MID RA  [Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs] issued a statement  concerning the tanks given to Azerbaijan by Ukraine. We have  asked Suren Zolyan, deputy to the Republic of Armenia Supreme  Soviet, to comment on new facts which became known a day or two  ago.    Not long ago the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs  officially confirmed the press reports that Ukraine had shipped  a large consignment of tanks to this country. This official  letter from the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also  confirmed indirectly by the fact that the maximum level of arms  for the Azerbaijan army permitted under international agreements  has been substantially exceeded, inasmuch as the amount of  equipment and number of artillery systems provided by Russia was  indicated in another letter. These documents were disseminated  by the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs within the  framework of the agreement in effect--the so-called OVSE  [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe], which provides first of  all for the maximum levels of weapons according to individual  types of combat equipment for each member country of the SBSYe  [CSCE: Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe], and  secondly, the system for notification and information about the  presence of their forces. First I will read out these official  documents.    In letter No. 174 of 3 November 1993, the Azerbaijan  Ministry  of Foreign Affairs "has the honor to inform the joint  consultative group for the OVSE that the Republic of Azerbaijan  received 50 T-55 battle tanks from Ukraine on 27 September  1993." Moreover, inasmuch as the OVSE had information on the  weapons which Russia transferred to Azerbaijan, the following is  indicated in letter No. 175 of 6 November 1993, "In July and  August 1992, the Russian Federation transferred, and the  Republic of Azerbaijan accepted under its jurisdiction, the  following number of weapons and equipment restricted by the  agreement: 286 battle tanks, 842 armored combat vehicles, 346  artillery systems, 53 combat aircraft, and eight attack  helicopters." The same letter states further: "In May 1993 (that  is, this year--editor), the Republic of Azerbaijan received 105  armored combat vehicles and 42 artillery systems from the  Russian Federation."    Three comments need to be made about these letters. First of  all, this exceeds the maximum level of weapons stipulated by the  agreements. Secondly, a number of resolutions by international  organs, the CSCE and the UN Security Council in particular, have  been violated. And thirdly, this information is inaccurate (why  is stated below).    I want to cite the maximum levels of weapons stipulated by  the Budapest Agreement for the USSR as a whole, which were  divided among the former union republics proportionately after  its collapse. Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia were granted an  equal number of maximum levels. I emphasize "maximum level,"  inasmuch as this number may actually be much lower, as in the  case of Armenia, for example.    Thus the Republic of Azerbaijan could have no more than 220  battle tanks. But in fact, it received 286 in 1992 and 105 in  May this year from Russia, plus 50 from Ukraine in September. It  could have no more than 220 armored combat vehicles. Practically  four times as many were received: 842 were transferred in July  and August. Further. It could have no more than 285 artillery  systems. Let us count them: 346 shipped in July and August, that  is, 1.5 times as many, plus 42 in May this year. Once again,  this is substantially in excess of authorized levels. To be more  precise, this agreement and protocol were signed in Tashkent on  15 May 1992.    So there has been a significant violation of the OVSE  agreement by three countries participating in the agreement:  Azerbaijan, Russia, and Ukraine.    Why do I think the data provided by Azerbaijan are  inaccurate? Take note of this: they begin the count in July and  August 1992. We know that beginning in December 1991, a vast  number of weapons located in Azerbaijan were seized at random  and that a large quantity of weapons were also transferred to  this country in May and June 1992. But all this is not being  pointed out. So these data are not authentic. Moreover, the  weapons Azerbaijan received from neighboring states through  other channels were not mentioned, either.    It should also be stressed that the KSDL [Committee of  Senior  Officials] of the CSCE adopted the first decision on Karabakh on  28 February 1992, in which it stated that arms should not be  delivered to the conflicting sides in the region. This was  repeatedly confirmed in other documents of the CSCE, so it is  obvious that the agreement has been violated since July and  August last year as well. As far as Ukraine is concerned, it is  violating the UN Security Council decisions, where there is a  corresponding paragraph prohibiting arms deliveries to the  region of the conflict (No. 822 and subsequent resolutions) in  addition to this.    It is interesting that Russia transferred weapons to the  Republic of Azerbaijan in May this year, when the anti-Elchibey  revolt of S. Guseynov began. This fact was not mentioned,  although it is obvious that it definitely contributed to  destabilization of the situation and continuation of the  conflict. The vast number of weapons--and I think the official  figures should be doubled--contributed to escalation of the  hostilities, of course. In particular, the weapons transferred  in May 1992 led directly to the seizure of Mardakert and  Shaumyan rayons, which brought the armed conflict to a  completely new level.    The events of this year are a logical continuation of those  military operations which began as the result of the vast supply  of arms provided to Azerbaijan. It seems to me that the  competent organizations should draw their conclusions and  evaluate these facts. They graphically demonstrate what  Azerbaijan is counting on and who is contributing to the  conflict, incidentally.</p>

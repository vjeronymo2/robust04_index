In a handwritten communique  circulating in Djibouti since yesterday, this official, Ahmed  Ougoureh Kifle, announced the dissolution of the political  bureau led by Ahmed Dini Ahmed and the formation of a 13-member  new "executive council" in which he is the leader and commander  in chief of the resistance.    The text of the communique accuses the former leadership of  making "unforgivable mistakes that resulted in cases of  disappointment and in a situation unbearable for all." It  blames the former political bureau for "its negative policy and  inability to bring the various situations under control." This,  according to Kifle, has caused "a state of anarchy and  no-progress, which has paralyzed the FRUD for two years now."    The new executive council, which mostly comprises "famous  commanders" of the early hours of their struggle and which  apparently wants to get rid of the front's hardliners, "pledges  to end the no-peace no-war situation." It contemplates to  evolve new struggling strategies, while being open to a possible  dialogue with the government in power," the text adds.    Kifle does not also rule out moves likely to lead to direct  contacts between the fighting sides with the view of ending the  crisis that Djibouti is going through. The main FRUD officials  did not react to this communique today.</p>

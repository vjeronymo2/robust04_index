			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / IoD urges end to 'enterprise deficit' Britain is suffering from an 'enterprise deficit' according to the Institute of Directors, which called yesterday for a rethink of the role of companies and directors in the economy. In a consultation document published yesterday the IoD argues that, in the debate on corporate governance, too much emphasis has been placed on the integrity of directors while the question of how best to promote enterprise has been neglected. Lord Young, IoD president and chairman of Cable and Wireless, said the Cadbury report on corporate governance had limited itself to the behaviour of directors whereas it was more important to 'get the wealth aspect first'. 'Enterprise without integrity is the motto of the Mafia. Integrity without enterprise is the principle of nationalised industries. What we need is a combination of both.' The report argues that the enterprise deficit - the absence of innovation, investment and risk-taking by companies - is partly responsible for the poor international standing of Britain's economy. 'Future improvement in British economic performance requires more new UK companies to be established and more existing companies to grow,' the report says. It adds that this is needed to balance the dominance of large quoted companies in the economy. As the government increasingly loosens the contraints on business, the onus rests with directors to ensure that they are running their companies in a competent and professional manner, the document says. It questions whether boards of directors are capable of supplying enterprise on the scale the economy requires. It argues for a role for non-executive directors that is more dynamic than the controlling role spelled out in the Cadbury report. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IoD, said the IoD rejected the idea that non-executives were watchdogs. 'They should be round the table bringing new skills. You get the watchdog role for free. What you want them for is what they can contribute.' The document lays down four main functions for boards of directors. These are: to set the strategic direction of the company, to make sure that strategy is being implemented, to monitor executive management and to provide information. It argues that all directors should take part in all these tasks. In setting directors' pay, the report states there should be no pay-offs for failure, and that objectivity and openness are essential in determining what compensation executives deserve. The paper is part of an IoD initiative to associate itself more closely with the needs of directors, as well as with its better known function as a lobbying body. Earlier this week, the IoD published a draft set of standards covering the composition and behaviour of boards. Enterprise with Integrity. IoD, 116 Pall Mall, London SW1T 5ED. Free.

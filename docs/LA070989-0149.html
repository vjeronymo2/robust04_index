			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh predicted that the Supreme Court will eventually  take action that will "have the effect" of overturning the landmark Roe vs.  Wade decision legalizing abortion. In an interview with CNN's "Evans &amp;  Novak," Thornburgh said the high court's decision last week to uphold a  Missouri law restricting abortions "was consistent with the goals that we (in  the Bush Administration) seek of returning the regulation of abortions to the  state." The Supreme Court ruling did not overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade  decision or allow states to forbid abortion but did allow them to restrict it.  "I think eventually they will take action that will have the effect of  overruling (Roe vs. Wade)," Thornburgh said.  </P></p>

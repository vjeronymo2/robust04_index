			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Optimism meets caution at rail talks Intensive negotiations to try to resolve the intractable railway signal workers' dispute continued in the early hours of this morning at the conciliation service Acas in an attempt to avert a fifth one-day strike planned for tomorrow. At the resumption of the talks, which were broken off 10 days ago, Railtrack's chief negotiator Mr David Armstrong was optimistic over prospects for a settlement. In recent days the government-owned company has refined its productivity package for the signal workers in response to their particular grievances. But Mr Vernon Hince, the RMT transport union's chief negotiator, was much more cautious when he arrived for talks yesterday afternoon, insisting that the union had not yet entered serious negotiations with Railtrack. The union continues to insist that signal workers must receive an interim pay award for past productivity achievements before talks can begin on the restructuring of wages and work practices. Railtrack has proposed a three-part package involving an immediate 6 per cent unconsolidated rise in basic pay rates, a Pounds 200 lump sum for every worker, and a restructuring to be negotiated by the end of September with pay rises for the entire deal of between 13 per cent and 26 per cent. A further one-day strike has been called for a week tomorrow, and the RMT has threatened two days of action in the week beginning July 24.</p>

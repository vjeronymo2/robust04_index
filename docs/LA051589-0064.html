			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAILURE OF S&amp;L TURNS SPOTLIGHT ON DESERT DEAL;  </P> <P> TRIAL SET TUESDAY FOR 2 ACCUSED OF DRAINING ASSETS  </P> <P> John L. Molinaro had never set foot inside a financial institution except as a  customer until the day he and a partner bought Ramona Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana resident had no college degree, and his only business experience  was as a carpet salesman. "I had no experience at all . . . in connection with  the running and directing of a savings and loan association," Molinaro  acknowledged in a court deposition years later.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Molinaro and real estate developer Donald P. Mangano won swift  approval from regulatory agencies in April, 1984, for their $4-million purchase  of Orange-based Ramona and its $55 million in assets.  </P> <P> The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has alleged in a lawsuit that once  Molinaro and Mangano were in charge, they began a scheme to systematically  drain the institution of its assets.  </P> <P> The Federal Home Loan Bank Board -- of which the FSLIC is an arm -- concluded  in a report that the tiny thrift's 57-year tradition of writing single-family  mortgages ended almost overnight and that Molinaro and Mangano began investing  depositor funds into a slew of real estate investments.  </P> <P> Ramona collapsed in September, 1986, requiring a subsequent $65.5-million  federal bailout of depositors. Nine months later, Molinaro allegedly was  planning to leave the country after depositing millions of dollars in former  Ramona funds in Caribbean banks, according to court papers and regulators.  </P> <P> "Ramona was operated essentially as a petty cash fund and personal piggy bank,"  said Del Fassett, supervisory agent with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San  Francisco, which regulates savings and loans in its region.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Molinaro, 48, and Mangano, 52, are scheduled to start trial in U.S.  District Court in Los Angeles on more than 30 criminal charges, including bank  fraud and conspiracy, stemming from a Palm Springs real estate deal that  represents a small portion of the activities covered by the civil action.  Government officials say it is the first prosecution of owners of a Southern  California S&amp;L since the national thrift debacle began to unfold in the  early 1980s.  </P> <P> Both men have pleaded innocent. If convicted, Molinaro -- sole owner and  operator of Ramona at the time of its collapse -- faces a maximum prison  sentence of 165 years and $8.3 million in fines; Mangano could receive a  155-year sentence and $7.8 million in fines.  </P> <P> Numerous government officials say Ramona's transformation from a traditional  mom-and-pop thrift into a scandal shows how the S&amp;L industry was plundered  after its deregulation in 1982. The case also demonstrates how difficult it is  years later for prosecutors to press criminal charges against the individuals  accused of mismanaging and defrauding institutions across the country.  </P> <P> "Ramona is a good living example of what went wrong with the S&amp;L industry  and why it went wrong, " Fassett said.  </P> <P> Three years after Molinaro bought half of Ramona, he was arrested in a San  Francisco passport office.  </P> <P> Suspicious that a middle-aged man by the name of John Anthony Cook had  presented a birth certificate that looked brand new, the U.S. passport agency  called the FBI on July 22, 1987.  </P> <P> The man was arrested on suspicion of passport fraud. The FBI searched him.  Subsequent investigation disclosed that John Anthony Cook had died in 1957 and  that the suspect was in fact Molinaro.  </P> <P> The FBI reported that a bag he was carrying contained numerous business cards  from the Cayman Islands, bank records and travel brochures on Eastern Europe  and China. Further inspections of his car and bank holdings uncovered a gun,  $278,000 in cash, at least $100,000 in gold and diamonds, and death  certificates -- all obtained on the same day -- for four different people. The  FBI also found a notebook containing a handwritten list of at least 60 personal  reminders, such as this entry: "consider bouncing $ on-shore, then off-shore  again."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan to Flee Charged  </P> <P> The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. charges in a civil suit that  Molinaro was planning to flee to the Cayman Islands in order to avoid  litigation. Nine months earlier, FSLIC had shut down Ramona.  </P> <P> "Mr. Molinaro was not fleeing the country," said Gerald V. Scotti, his  attorney. "If you think you are going to be incriminated criminally, you don't  stick around nine months." Molinaro recently finished serving a prison sentence  for passport fraud.  </P> <P> So far, FSLIC has recovered $3 million from accounts Molinaro set up in the  Caribbean after the agency convinced a federal court judge that the money  belonged to Ramona.  </P> <P> Molinaro has argued that the accounts contained his personal savings, money he  earned during his 18 years in the carpet business.  </P> <P> "He had made deposits in the Cayman Islands with money he had legitimately  owned long before he had ever heard of Ramona Savings &amp; Loan," Scotti said.  "These (funds) were earned separately and independently." Molinaro told  investigators at the time of his arrest that the overseas accounts were set up  as trust funds for his children.  </P> <P> FSLIC alleges in its lawsuit that part of the proceeds were from a $2-million  dividend Molinaro had illegally obtained from Ramona. Molinaro has denied that  he knowingly took the dividend in violation of banking rules. Scotti said  Molinaro actually lost money on Ramona and has accused federal regulators of  using "Gestapo-like tactics" in seizing his assets.  </P> <P> Near the time Ramona was closed, FSLIC tried to serve a temporary restraining  order that would have frozen Molinaro's assets. Four investigators tried to  find him at eight different addresses in California, conducted a two-day  stakeout of a San Jose home he owned and called dozens of hotels, according to  court papers.  </P> <P> Molinaro has denied charges that he was avoiding authorities. He said he was  living at his $1.5-million home in Santa Ana. "I was living there, but I was  moving about a bit," he said in a deposition. He acknowledged in a deposition  that he had stayed in several Orange County hotels, but he said "that was for  the purpose of meeting ladies every now and then" and not to duck the court  order.  </P> <P> The FSLIC lawsuit, filed four days after the thrift's collapse, seeks more than  $65 million in damages to cover the money the agency is spending to restore  order among Ramona's former accounts even though the S&amp;L no longer exists.  </P> <P> Despite FSLIC's claims that Molinaro and Mangano began pilfering Ramona almost  as soon as they set foot inside, the U.S. attorney's criminal prosecution is  limited in scope and mostly centers on a single Palm Springs real estate deal  that regulators say contributed to Ramona's demise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attorney Predicts Vindication  </P> <P> To prove criminal intent in white-collar crime cases involving S&amp;Ls, the  Justice Department must reconstruct a paper trail of transactions to document  the fraud. Because S&amp;L fraud is fairly sophisticated, prosecutors narrow  their sights on particular schemes that are more easily documented and  understood.  </P> <P> "When we bring a criminal case, we want to focus on those charges we can easily  prove and those charges we can present to a jury in such a way that the jury  can understand the fraud," said Terree A. Bowers, chief of the major fraud  section for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Scotti said his client will be vindicated. Molinaro has argued that any  violations of banking laws at Ramona were a result of his inexperience, not  part of a criminal plan to defraud the institution.  </P> <P> "I am convinced and confident that the evidence will show there was no criminal  intent," Scotti said.  </P> <P> Michael E. White, Mangano's attorney, declined to discuss specifics of the  case.  </P> <P> The alleged Palm Springs scheme is said to have begun shortly after Molinaro  and Mangano, who were neighbors and friends, acquired Ramona. Taking advantage  of new laws that allowed state-chartered S&amp;Ls to invest 100% of their  assets in real estate, the thrift invested heavily in land development deals.  </P> <P> It paid nearly $3 million for a tract of vacant land in Palm Springs and signed  a construction contract with Mangano &amp; Sons, an Orange company owned by  Donald Mangano. The project was a 180-unit luxury condominium complex.  </P> <P> Cherokee Village was finished in mid-1985 after Ramona spent about $25 million  -- a fourth of its assets -- on the project. Mangano &amp; Sons realized a  $3.75-million profit, regulators said in the criminal indictment.  </P> <P> "RSL's investment in Cherokee Village proved to be a huge mistake," Assistant  U.S. Atty. Steven E. Zipperstein said in court records. "Because defendants set  the prices for the individual condominium units too high, and because the Palm  Springs condominium market was glutted, RSL was virtually unable to sell any  units."  </P> <P> Only seven of Cherokee Village's 180 units had ben sold by the summer of 1985.  Federal regulators had urged Ramona in March, 1985, to do something, so the  thrift converted Cherokee Village into a resort featuring eight swimming pools  and the Tracy Austin Tennis Center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Better As Hotel  </P> <P> Cherokee Village fared no better as a hotel. Mangano sold his 50% share in  Ramona to Molinaro in May, 1985, but continued to exert some influence over the  thrift, according to the indictment. Molinaro became chairman, chief executive  and sole owner.  </P> <P> The federal government's indictment against Molinaro and Mangano says the two  men decided to sell Ramona before it and Cherokee Village went belly up. So,  they allegedly transferred Cherokee Village to Mangano to hide the problem from  a potential buyer of Ramona. Once a buyer was found, they intended to transfer  Cherokee Village back to the S&amp;L unbeknown to the new owner, the indictment  says.  </P> <P> The indictment alleges that the deal worked this way:  </P> <P> Molinaro found three men willing to set up four dummy corporations. Ramona then  recorded a supposed sale of its Cherokee Village resort to three of those  corporations for a $30,000 paper profit per residential unit.  </P> <P> The men then transferred all of the stock in the three corporations to Mangano,  which made him the new owner of Cherokee Village. For their trouble, the three  men received a parcel of land in north Palm Springs, which was transferred from  Ramona to the fourth corporation.  </P> <P> Even though no money had changed hands, Ramona recorded a $4-million profit on  the deal. "This would placate the regulators, while simultaneously making RSL  appear healthier to a potential buyer," the indictment alleges.  </P> <P> Ramona found a buyer and allegedly agreed to loan him, through a third party,  the $7.2 million he needed to buy the thrift. Molinaro and Mangano then  transferred ownership of Cherokee Village back to Ramona, disguised as a land  acquisition of 23 acres in Palm Springs, according to the indictment. No  mention was made of Cherokee Village.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Molinaro had Ramona's board issue him a $2-million cash dividend  based on the $4-million profit the S&amp;L had recorded on the allegedly bogus  Cherokee sale, according to the civil suit and indictment.  </P> <P> Four months before Ramona was put into FSLIC receivership, the same buyer paid  Molinaro $6.3 million for the thrift but never assumed control because  regulators rejected the proposed change of ownership.  </P> <P> Ramona's records indicated that it had a net worth of $6.7 million, but  examiners say the thrift actually had a deficit of $19 million, meaning that  its liabilities exceeded its assets by that amount. "It was an outrageous  fraud," said William Davis, deputy commissioner of the State Department of  Savings and Loan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claim Sage Involved  </P> <P> Both Molinaro and Mangano deny any wrongdoing in connection with Cherokee  Village. For his part, Molinaro said he was relying on the validity of records  kept by accountants, including Michael Sage of Tustin. "I had no reason to  believe they did not present a true and accurate financial picture of Ramona  Savings &amp; Loan," Molinaro said in a deposition.  </P> <P> But authorities say Sage was involved in the alleged scheme. He currently is a  fugitive from a federal grand jury indictment alleging that he helped a friend  fraudulently apply for a $100,000 loan from Ramona.  </P> <P> The latest estimate of the cost of cleaning up the national S&amp;L debacle is  $157 billion. While Congress grapples with how to fund the bailout, it has  placed much of the blame on the new breed of S&amp;L operators who entered the  industry after deregulation.  </P> <P> But many of the S&amp;L owners, executives and borrowers now being held  accountable for the collapse of institutions blame the government for  encouraging new, riskier types of investments that contributed to their  downfall. "They have encouraged the policies they now decry," said Scotti.  </P> <P> Even regulators admit some responsibility for the disaster, conceding that  inexperienced executives such as Molinaro should never have been allowed to  operate thrifts.  </P> <P> "If you were an ordinary, normal person with no criminal record and had the  money, you could buy one," said Davis of the State Department of Savings and  Loan. "This was undoubtedly a mistake."  </P></p>

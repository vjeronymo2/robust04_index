On January 8, the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny  Ostrov (ZMOZO) convenes a meeting which is allegedly to  establish a province or an area with special status in southern  Slovakia populated mostly by the Hungarian minority. Pasztor has  reportedly initiated the meeting which will be held in Komarno,  the largest Hungarian-speaking city in Slovakia.    He tells the paper that the planned administrative set-up of  Slovakia, which, according to him, would be disadvantageous for  ethnic Hungarians, is considered the main problem. Another  problem is that the Slovak legislation provides the local  government few powers. It would be necessary to strengthen  their positions by delegating the decision-making to the local  government, not to government.    According to Pasztor, the campaign and attacks against the  ZMOZO meeting is, in fact, a maneuver to divert attention from  much more important problems of the Slovak society such as  disastrous state budget. "At any rate, there are gigantic  internal conflicts in the Slovak political life over who are the  better Slovaks. It is claimed that it is those who can best  defend the nation against enemies. For this, however, it is  necessary first to create the enemy," he stressed.    Pasztor also commented on the attempts by the local  activists  of Matica Slovenska (Slovak cultural organisation) to sack him.  About 2,000 citizens have already signed the petition, while  some 5,000 people are required for the mayor to be dismissed.    Citizens have a right to demand his dismissal, but the  current campaign is just an evidence of the political  shortsightedness of the organisers. "They believe that if I am  no more the mayor, there will be no problems. And that is an  error," claims Pasztor.</p>

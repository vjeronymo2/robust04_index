			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / International Company News: HSI launches H-share index Investors will be able to track the composite performance of H shares, the Hong Kong-listed China companies, from today with the launch of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index. The new index, like the long-standing Hang Seng Index, is compiled by HSI Services, the financial information provider and wholly-owned subsidiary of Hang Seng Bank, the colony's biggest domestic bank. It comprises all the H shares, of which there are now 10, weighted according to their market capitalisation. The number of H-share companies is expected to double by the end of next year. Mr Alexander Au, managing director and chief executive of Hang Seng Bank, said the creation of a more focused indicator of the overall performance of H shares was prompted by the growing international interest in these companies. The index was set at 1,000 on July 8, when the 10th H-share company, Luoyang Glass, was listed. The biggest mover on the index is Maanshan Iron and Steel, with a 30 per cent weighting, followed by Shanghai Petrochemical and Yizheng Chemical Fibre. HSI Services directors meet later this month to tackle a thornier issue: the replacements for Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic, both of which delist at the end of the year. Companies including Henderson Investment, the property investment company controlled by Mr Lee Shau-kee, Guoco Group the banking and property company, and First Pacific, whose interests span banking, property and telecommunications, are already jockeying for position. Being in the index is seen as both a prestigious move and one which can benefit the share price. Emerging Markets, Page 19</p>

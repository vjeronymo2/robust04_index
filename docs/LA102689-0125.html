			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WISCONSIN;  </P> <P> TRIBE REJECTS PACT TO CURTAIL FISHING  </P> <P> A crowd erupted in chants and shouts of jubilation in Lac du Flambeau after  members of the Chippewa tribe rejected a $35.6-million pact with the state to  curtail the Indians' off-reservation hunting and fishing. The pact would have  paid the tribe for not fishing for 10 years. Treaty rights, which courts have  ruled allow Indians to spearfish off their reservations, have caused  controversy and sparked some violence. The Chippewa may fish with spears and  out of season, which other fishermen cannot do.  </P></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Chief executive quits at Continental Airlines Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, said that Mr Robert Ferguson had resigned as chief executive and vice-chairman. The move comes as the airline is struggling to correct operational problems with its low-cost Continental Lite flights. The service, modelled on Southwest Airlines' successful route system, was launched last year by Mr Ferguson as part of a strategy to return Continental to profitability. The airline said it was making progress on improving reliability, but admitted that the service was still not breaking even. Mr Ferguson's departure was announced as Continental revealed a 9 per cent downturn in third-quarter operating income to Dollars 82.8m, from Dollars 91m in the 1993 quarter. Revenues were down 6 per cent at Dollars 1.5bn. Fare-cutting during the quarter was reflected in a 2.6 per cent decline in the average yield per passenger mile. However, net income more than doubled to Dollars 30.6m, or Dollars 1.03 a share, against Dollars 12.4m, or 53 cents a year earlier. But the improvement was mostly attributable to a Dollars 11.3m income tax provision taken in the 1993 period. Mr Gordon Bethune, the company's president, will assume overall direction of both strategic and day-to-day operations. Mr Ferguson, 45, will stay on as a director and consultant on overall strategic planning.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mohammed Gayur: "Has the Conscience of the Lone </F> World Power Awakened?"]    [Excerpts] The international situation has been changing so  rapidly and unexpectedly since September 1993 that we are dazed.  President Clinton surprised the diplomats by mentioning Kashmir  along with Somalia and Bosnia in his first address in the United  Nations General Assembly. The astonishment caused by this  announcement had not yet abated when Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant  secretary of state, announced that the United States did not  recognize the documents that Kashmir's Maharajah Hari Singh had  signed merging Kashmir to India. This was followed by Prime  Minister Narasimha Rao's congratulatory letter to Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto in which he had for the first time offered to  discuss all the aspects related to Kashmir. At that time, the  first impression was that the Indian Government was trying to  move the situation created by the siege of Hazratbal to its  advantage by offering to open negotiations. This could have been  one reason for this action. However, if we review the  developments during September and October 1993 and look at the  statements issued by the U.S. State Department showing that the  United States has been pressuring both India and Pakistan to  resolve this issue by talks, the whole situation becomes a bit  clearer. One reaction would be: God what is going on?    Until a few years ago, the United States was not willing to  hear anything about Kashmir. Whenever, the issue was brought up,  it was tabled by referring to the Shimla Agreement. Now it is so  interested that it is considering Kashmir as one of the three  major problem areas in the world and has put so much pressure to  resolve this issue that foreign secretaries of India and  Pakistan had to hold talks. Despite Madam Bhutto's direct  statement that it is useless to waste time on meaningless talks,  it is certain now that there will be additional rounds of talks  between India and Pakistan even when they are meaningless.    What is the reason for this effort to win our friendship?  Has  the freedom struggle of occupied Kashmir pulled at the U.S.  conscience? Their sacrifices definitely are enough to awaken any  sleeping conscience. The occupied Kashmir has been facing  devastation since January 1990 when the Kashmiris took up  weapons. According to international news agencies, at least  16,000 persons have lost their lives. Front doors of hundreds of  homes are knocked on at night and the young men there are  arrested. Their bodies are given to a nearly police station the  very next day. Many a virtuous young woman fall prey to gang  rape by the Indian soldiers. Many unblossomed young women were  trodden under the boots of Indian soldiers. These sacrifices  could wake up even the most ruthless of hearts. However, did the  conscience of the sole world superpower wake up because of these  sacrifices? We wish it was true. Unfortunately, the conscience  of a superpowers is controlled by its vested interests. What  U.S. interests are related to Kashmir? [passage ommitted on U.S.  relations with China]    This difference in stand on international affairs is the  main  reason for enmity between China and the United States. Thus, if  the United States manages to take the Kashmir valley and areas  north of it under the U.S. control, then it will have succeeded  in surrounding the newly liberated nations in Central Asia on  the one side and China on the other side. In the ring around  China, the Philippines in the east and South Korea are also U.S.  allies.    Some of our analysts do not agree that the United States  needs to put a ring around China and Central Asia. They believe  that space intelligence or intelligence through satellites has  made so much progress that the United States does not need  Peshawar to monitor any country. It was 30 or 40 years ago when  the United States needed Badber near Peshawar to set up a base  to monitor the Soviet Union. The Pakistani government had very  kindly given control of Badber to the United States from where  the U-2 planes were used to take off to photograph Soviet air  bases. Even Pakistan's president did not have the permission to  enter that base. It was this base from where Gary Power's U-2  had flown when it was shot down in Central Asia. Khrushchev,  then president of the Soviet Union, had drawn a red circle  around Peshawar at that time. The situation has changed now. The  camera mounted on satellites flying hundreds of miles in the  space can take picture of not only air bases but also of  bedrooms. Even the privacy of a closed room is not safe from  these now. Why should they need a monitoring station on earth in  this situation? This sounds logical, however, just like a rifle  is the basic weapon of a soldier in this age of guided missiles  and rockets, the importance of a land monitoring station has not  diminished. Especially, for putting psychological pressure on  the enemy.    What plan could the United States have to take control of  Kashmir? Before considering this, we have to review two other  incidents. [passage ommitted on Pressler Amendment]    Thus, the mention of Kashmir by the U.S. President in his  address to the UN General Assembly, Assistant Secretary Raphel's  challenging Kashmir's ever having joined India, the possibility  of ending the Pressler Amendment, and not including Pakistan in  the list of terrorist nations are all events which need to be  viewed as in a series rather than in isolation. The purpose of  these appears to be putting pressure on India and Pakistan to  "flatten them."    There are two problems. One is to open up Indian and  Pakistani nuclear installations for international inspection and  the other is creating such a solution of the Kashmir problem  that U.S. interests are served. If Kashmir remains in India, no  India government, despite its enmity with China, will allow the  building of U.S. bases. If Kashmir joins Pakistan, perhaps  because of its traditional loyalty, Pakistan may agree to the  United States demands. Even during the peak period of  Pakistan-China friendship, the PIA [Pakistan International  Airlines] planes were used for spying on China. It would be  impossible to convince India to give the Kashmir valley to  Pakistan. This approach would be very dangerous because of the  fundamentalist groups in occupied Kashmir. If Azad Kashmir with  some modifications is given to Pakistan, Jammu and Laddakh are  given to India, and areas lying north of Kashmir become  independent, the picture would be complete and this is what the  U.S. option appears to be.    The problem is that both India and Pakistan find it  difficult  to accept this. India calls Kashmir its integral part. Pakistan  has paved its way for connection with China through the northern  region. Therefore, it would not be easy to convince either of  them. However, if necessary, they should be forced to accept it.  Even a very brief war between the two countries could exhaust  their resources. Even after another Tashkent or Shimla pact, the  United States will be very careful about it. President Clinton  has received several jolts in his foreign policy implementation  during the first year of his presidency. He had to recall the  peace forces from Somalia. He has failed in imposing  restrictions on weapons for the Muslims in Bosnia even after  making several announcements to this effect. He has been  unsuccessful in making friends in South America. Therefore, it  is likely that he will think seriously before he takes another  step. It took 13 years after the Camp David Agreement to hold  conciliatory talks between Israel and the Palestinians. It  appears that he will not take any hasty action. However, Kashmir  is on the U.S. agenda, and it is the first time that it has been  included in it.  *</p>

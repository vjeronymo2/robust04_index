			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Flagship on the rocks: The EC's HDTV strategy is failing The European Community's strategy to develop advanced cinema-quality television has a new helmsman, its third in eight years. But Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner since 1989, may have taken control of Europe's high-definition television (HDTV) policy too late. Eight years after it was launched, the erstwhile flagship of EC industrial policy is still far from land. Even the shipbuilders themselves now fear that the current policy is holed below the waterline. Ten days ago, Philips, the Dutch electronics manufacturer, and one of the biggest investors in Europe's HDTV project, announced it had suspended plans to mass-produce television sets compatible with the EC's preferred HDTV transmission standard, HD-Mac. Senior Commission officials say Mr Bangemann, who only took responsibility for HDTV last month, may be forced to admit the failure of the original policy. Obituaries of EC HDTV policy would not be favourable. A recent report by National Economic Research Associates (Nera) of London and Brunel University describes the European strategy, in comparison with Japanese and US policies, as 'the most unfortunate in its timing and potentially the most costly to the region's taxpayers and consumers'. When the plan was launched in 1985, the Commission's aim was to corner a new and lucrative consumer electronics market with a combination of technical standards, investment and aggressive marketing. That approach backfired almost immediately. Advances in technology meant satellite broadcasters were able to circumvent the 1986 legislation and transmit programmes using standards which were not part of the EC-backed 'Mac' family of standards. Three years later, attempting to salvage the strategy, Mr Bangemann's predecessor, Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, sought to encourage broadcasters, manufacturers and satellite operators to work together on HDTV projects, with the incentive of EC funding for HDTV programme-making and transmission. Mr Pandolfi proposed an Ecu850m (Pounds 688m) five-year action plan which would support the development of wide-screen television as an intermediate step towards HDTV. Britain is blamed by its EC partners for torpedoing this strategy. At acrimonious meetings of EC telecommunications ministers late last year, the UK vetoed the plan, arguing the spending was not justified. In particular, Britain claims that the analogue standards on which the Community's strategy has been based could quickly be superseded by digital transmission technology. Digital signals are electrical (analogue) signals which have been converted into binary codes. Digital systems can process and distribute a greater volume of information more rapidly than analogue systems and, unlike analogue, can be used for terrestrial as well as satellite broadcasting. The strongest supporters of the action plan - France, the Netherlands and the Commission itself - were incensed by the British action. They accused the UK of reneging on commitments made at the Edinburgh summit of EC leaders in December. But, despite the pressure on the UK, Philips' decision suggests Europe may have been witnessing the death-throes of the HD-Mac strategy. Disappointed by the political confusion, Philips argues there is no point in producing HD-Mac sets if funding is not available for transmission on that system. Commission telecommunications officials, enthusiasts for the Mac strategy, tried to put a brave face on the decision last week, pointing out that Philips would complete its research into the system and would be ready to produce HD-Mac television sets if funding was cleared. But Philips and Thomson, its French counterpart, both fierce lobbyists of the Commission during the standards debate, have already changed their commercial strategy. Rather than wait for regulatory guidance on standards, they will concentrate on producing wide-screen television sets to lower definition standards. Mr Bangemann also appears to be reconciling himself to the demise of the HD-Mac plan. Last week, he hinted that, under his management, EC policy could have humbler ambitions concentrated on promotion of wide-screen technology. He said the EC should back the development of less bulky flat-screen sets and should encourage the production and conversion of programmes for broadcast on wide-screen television. Some of these elements could be included in a compromise that Denmark, current holder of the EC presidency, hopes could provide an agreement when EC telecommunications ministers next meet on May 10. There is still considerable doubt about whether Britain would back any funding plan, and French officials say it is likely that there will be another high-level dispute over the UK's intransigence. But even if a less ambitious short-term strategy is adopted, the demise of HD-Mac would leave the Community without a long-term HDTV policy. The US, which is expected to select an advanced digital television standard later this year, will gain a headstart of up to five years in the HDTV market. Industry analysts believe the EC and Japan, which also backed an analogue system, will eventually be forced to adopt the US standard. Such a development would not necessarily damage European industry - Philips and Thomson are also involved in one of the consortia bidding to produce the US standard - but it would be humiliating for the EC policymakers. Putting digital technology on the market would also take a long time. European manufacturers expected HD-Mac sets to be marketed from 1992, but the Nera/Brunel report forecasts that only 9 per cent of European households will have digital HDTV sets by 2004. In the meantime, the main consolation for EC politicians, manufacturers and broadcasters, would be that they and EC consumers had reaped some useful by-products from heavy investment in Mac technology. Wide-screen technology has advanced, and improvements in picture quality have been achieved, both of which would have taken much longer without Community backing. But the main victory for European industry - that it built a working HD-Mac system - appears Pyrrhic. 'It's a perfect system,' says Ms Angelique Hoogakker, a Philips spokeswoman. 'You'll find plenty of disagreement about implementation and standards, but no one will deny the quality of the system. It's only a shame that, now we have got the advantage in the market, we can't put it into practice.' One industry spokesman likens the original HDTV policy to Nasa's costly lunar programme in the 1960s. 'It was a difficult goal, with many technological spin-offs,' he says. The difference, of course, is that man did eventually walk on the moon.</p>

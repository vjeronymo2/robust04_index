			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Turks seek to extradite terrorist Turkey is to ask France to extradite Dursan Karatas, leader of the left-wing terrorist organisation Dev-Sol. Karatas escaped from an Istanbul prison five years ago while serving a life sentence. Since their emergence in 1978 Dev-Sol have claimed responsibility for numerous killings; victims include a former Turkish prime minister, as well as countless police officials. Karatas was arrested on Friday crossing the French border from Italy with false papers. Ankara said extradition documentation would be sent to Paris 'in the shortest period possible'. Western countries commonly refuse extradition requests from countries which impose the death penalty. The French may require a guarantee that Karatas will not be sentenced to death before they grant extradition.</p>

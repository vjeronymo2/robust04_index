			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tiphook turns to Wall Street as confidence recedes - The growing criticism which has been directed towards the transport rental company THE 9 per cent fall in Tiphook's share price which greeted the transport rental company's change of accounting policy was just the latest signal of discontent from investors. The wave of criticism following Wednesday's results focused on the confusing way in which the changes were presented and the growing debt burden on the recession-struck group. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit agency, downgraded its rating of the company from BBB-minus to BB, that is from an investment to a so-called speculative grade. Tiphook will from now on report in dollars and said its results would more closely reflect US accounting conventions because most of its turnover and financing was in dollars. The company blamed the accountancy changes for a total charge of Pounds 77.3m, which reduced pre-tax profits of Pounds 55.5m to losses of Pounds 21.8m for the year to April 30. However, analysts pointed out that most of the Pounds 77.3m provision would have reduced profits even under the previous convention, although the timing may have differed. The charges mainly related to the unwinding of currency hedging and interest swaps, plus the costs of replacing a Pounds 150m preference share issue with unsecured debt. Tiphook said it had 'decided to increase the level of conformity of the group's UK accounting practices with US standards', but was not completely adopting the US GAAP standard. Thus it will make no allowance for deferred tax, which in 1992 reduced profits reported under the US rules by Pounds 20.5m. Mr Robert Montague, executive chairman, said the group intended to remain domiciled in the UK and report under UK conventions, so it could not make allowance for deferred tax. The group has written off Pounds 227m of goodwill against reserves, but may change this treatment when the new UK accountancy standard is set. Under US rules, goodwill is capitalised and written off over 40 years. This has the effect of reducing profits, and in 1992 the group's US accounts showed a goodwill charge of Pounds 6.2m. The focus on accountancy tended to divert attention away from the impact of recession on Tiphook, which operates in 38 countries and has the world's second-largest fleet of containers - after Genstar - and Europe's largest fleet of trailers. Even before the charge of Pounds 77.3m, annual pre-tax profits were down from Pounds 86.4m to Pounds 55.5m on flat sales of Pounds 324m. Container utilisation fell from 88 to 86 per cent, although average rental rates fell by only 2 per cent. Mr Montague was cautious about the future as the world economic outlook remained uncertain, but also believed the worst was over. He said leasing businesses such as Tiphook were much better understood in the US, and the group has certainly become more popular on Wall Street. Since 1991 the proportion of the group's equity held as American Depositary Receipts has risen from 2 per cent to just over 50 per cent. About 65 per cent of the heavily geared group's Pounds 1bn borrowings are also in the US. The American enthusiasm has been useful, although it has not prevented Tiphook's share price being halved in less than two years. The proportion of UK shareholders has fallen over that period from from 60 per cent to below 30 per cent and now only one UK institutional investor - Scottish Amicable - retains a stake of more than 3 per cent. The patience of UK institutions has been strained by unexplained share price falls ahead of two recent company announcements - a profits warning in April and last week's notification of the proposed accountancy changes. Some investors, disappointed by the company's recent performance, have been pushing for the appointment of stronger non-executive directors and are suggesting the separation of Mr Montague's roles of chairman and chief executive. Tiphook has four non-executive directors on its nine-man board, including Sir Charles Powell, former private secretary to Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Mr Montague said there were no plans to change the board. The group has also been asked to change its remuneration policy for top directors. Some shareholders are concerned that last year's remuneration of Pounds 842,000 for Mr Montague and more than Pounds 500,000 for Mr Rodger Braidwood, finance director, was too high for a medium-sized company outside the FT-SE 100. Tiphook's most immediate pressing constraint is on the debt front. In the year to April, net borrowings rose from Pounds 858m to more than Pounds 1bn, with Pounds 108m of the increase reflecting exchange rate differences. Gearing increased from 300 to 470 per cent. The group has agreed more relaxed covenants on interest cover with its banks, but the group's articles of association forbid it from having gearing of more than 500 per cent. Tiphook believes debt will stabilise in the current year. But gearing could breach the 500 per cent limit if borrowings increase by only Pounds 58m - not much headroom for a company which last year had a net cash outflow of Pounds 50m. Some analysts believe Tiphook will soon seek new equity, and moving to reporting in dollars will certainly help any fundraising operation in the US. Wariness towards leasing companies is common in the City, given recent unhappy recent experiences with GPA, the Irish aircraft leasing business, and British &amp; Commonwealth's Atlantic Computer subsidiary. Faith in management is an essential condition for investing in any leasing company, given the difficulty outside observers have in understanding their complex finances. It is because confidence in Tiphook is now so scarce in London that the group is increasingly looking to Wall Street for support.</p>

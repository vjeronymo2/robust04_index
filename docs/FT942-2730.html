			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Dublin opening for Finex Europe Finex, the currency futures arm of the New York Cotton Exchange, today opens Finex Europe at the new Dublin Exchange Facility in the International Financial Services Centre. Finex Europe will trade Finex's existing US dollar index futures. In addition, both floors today start trading sterling/D-Mark, D-Mark/French franc, and dollar/D-Mark futures around the clock, in Dublin and New York. Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will act as marketmakers in Dublin, while Nationsbank will make a market from London. So far, Finex has sold 90 permits for trading and broking rights in Dublin for Dollars 10,000 each. Initially, there will be about 15 floor brokers and five 'locals' or independent traders in the pit in Dublin. According to Mr Peter Burton, director of product development at Finex, D-Mark/Swedish krona, D-Mark/lira and D-Mark/yen futures will be phased in over the next few weeks, and other products may be added later. '(Finex Europe) has a lot of potential,' according Ms Mary Fischer, a foreign exchange trader at Nationsbank CRT. 'The push is towards European hedge funds.' Finex's foreign exchange contracts in New York are mainly traded by US hedge fund and futures fund managers such as Mr Paul Tudor Jones, NYCE chairman, who will open trading in Dublin at 11.05am. However, some observers are sceptical about the amount of interest that will be drummed up in Europe, given the small number of speculative funds relative to the US market. They fear that the new floor will have to rely on existing US clients. However, because of the low set-up cost of the Dublin floor, the operation does not require heavy volume to make money. 'We have been trying to figure out a reasonable projection,' said Mr Burton. 'A thousand contracts a day is break-even, and we hope to achieve that within a few months.'</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / US Money and Credit: Jobs figures fail to indicate firm recovery ALL WEEK the US bond market waited for the July jobs numbers. After they arrived on Friday morning, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to just 7.39 per cent, the lowest since early January. The market's gloomy assessment of the economy's prospects came in sharp contrast to President Bush's rallying words from the White House. Where the president saw a nation 'poised for a strong recovery', bond traders saw employment numbers inflated by temporary summer jobs. And where the president saw growth - 'albeit anaemic' - the bond market saw only the inklings of any improvement. The question then remains: will the Federal Reserve step in with yet another interest rate cut, and if so, when. The jobs numbers looked acceptable at first glance. The unemployment rate edged down to 7.7 per cent last month from 7.8 per cent in June, and non-farm payrolls climbed by 198,000 jobs - the largest monthly rise in two years. As anticipated, payroll employment was lifted by 75,000, thanks to the federally funded summer jobs programme. The programme formed part of emergency legislation passed after the Los Angeles riots, and is designed to provide summer employment for economically disadvantaged people in their late teens and early twenties. So most pundits expect the 75,000 jobs which showed up in the July employment report to fall out of the September figures. That did leave a more genuine 123,000 increase in employment last month. However, closer inspection of the figures also showed that this was concentrated exclusively in the service sector. Any improvement is modest. As one analyst was quick to point out, the increase in private sector jobs during the past two months has numbered less than 30,000. That is not the sort of advance which suggests a firm recovery is under way. Accordingly, bond prices, which had been yo-yoing for most of the week, rose fairly sharply on Friday. The long bond gained almost  7/8 of a point, and the yield dropped from Thursday's 7.45 per cent. Whether such gloomy data prompts a new interest rate cut is a moot point. The corporate reporting season was presentable. Only certain problem sectors threw up bad numbers. Even General Motors last week announced reduced second-quarter losses, although it warned that the second half of 1992 would be tough. Given the distortions to the July jobs figures and the limited signs of progress, it seems unlikely that anything will happen in a hurry. 'We do not expect any major monetary policy changes to be implemented between now and year-end,' suggested Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street brokerage, in the wake of Friday's data. 'This will leave the discount rate and funds rate in December at 3 per cent and 3.25 per cent respectively.' With these considerations in mind, the market's main focus this week will be on inflation numbers and July retail sales figures. There seems little cause for concern on the first score: there is plainly no evidence of inflationary steam and the producer price index is expected to show a rise of about 0.1 per cent for the month, with the consumer price index gaining an equally modest 0.2 per cent. Retail sales during July are thought to have worsened, but largely due to car sales. With auto sales excluded, the market is anticipating a modest advance, in the order of 0.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / HK airport a 'robust business' THE Hong Kong government yesterday released figures showing that the colony's proposed airport will be a 'very robust business' from its opening in 1997, as discussions with China over the financing of the project are elevated to prime ministerial level. The airport's revenue is forecast to reach HKDollars 22.7bn (Pounds 1.6bn) by 2010 - enough to provide operating profits of HKDollars 10.4bn after recurrent capital expenditure and taxation, the government said. Officials said the release of further financial information coincided with a meeting between Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, and Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart, in Rio de Janeiro today. Mr Major is expected to raise with Li China's procrastination about airport financing. Hong Kong officials hope the two premiers can achieve a breakthrough where diplomatic channels have failed. Officials are concerned that China's failure to approve the financing for the new airport may cause its already tight construction schedule to slip. Li told Lord Wilson, the colony's retiring governor, earlier this week in Beijing that China supported the new airport project and was keen to see it built on time. However, discussions with the Chinese about the financing of the airport and related projects are now in their third month. A memorandum Britain and China signed last September specified talks should take only one month. Hong Kong officials need China's assent to the plans before they are put to the local legislature before it rises in late July.</p>

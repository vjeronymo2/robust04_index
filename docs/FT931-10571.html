			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Liechtenstein election VOTERS in Liechtenstein yesterday returned to power the two parties that have ruled the tiny principality for over 50 years, but for the first time handed two parliamentary seats to a left-wing environmental group, Reuter reports from Zurich. The centrist Fatherland Union (VU) won 11 seats, the right-wing Progressive Citizens Party (FBP) 12 seats and the Free List (FL) two seats in the 25-member parliament, the Swiss news agency said. The FBP will now head the coalition government and its candidate, Mr Markus Buechel, will replace the VU's Mr Hans Brunhart as head of government. The election was fought over constitutional issues and Liechtenstein's membership of the 18-state European Economic Area. All three parties favour membership but differ on how to deal with the influx of foreigners that participation will bring with it. Liechtenstein's 14,000 electorate voted for membership in December.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETAILERS' SALES UP MODESTLY IN OCTOBER  </P> <P> The nation's large retailers on Thursday reported modest to good October sales  with apparel stores doing better than general merchandise chains that depend  heavily on sales of expensive durable goods.  </P> <P> Karen Sack, a retail analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., summed up the  month this way: "It was OK. It wasn't a disaster, but it wasn't great."  </P> <P> Clothing retailers rang up better results than general merchandisers, such as  Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., that have a large proportion of their business  devoted to "big-ticket" durable items, ranging from refrigerators to sofas.  </P> <P> But even apparel stores suffered in some parts of the country where unusually  mild weather discouraged shopping for heavy clothes.  </P> <P> On a positive note, analysts said consumers probably postponed purchases of  winter things last month, which should help sales during the crucial Christmas  season.  </P> <P> The shift that has been taking place in consumer spending patterns -- toward  apparel and other soft lines such as linens and away from durable goods --  should continue into the peak holiday shopping season.  </P> <P> Walter Loeb, a retail analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., said consumers are  becoming more cautious spenders given the weakness in the economy, particularly  on the manufacturing side.  </P> <P> Retailers' results are watched closely for clues about consumer spending, which  accounts for about two-thirds of total U.S. economic output.  </P> <P> Loeb said sales of men's wear, furs and automobiles are among the categories  performing poorly. He said those categories are early indicators of the  national spending mood.  </P> <P> "I'm looking for a slowdown in consumer spending in the Christmas season," Loeb  said, noting that retail sales gains will be "meager."  </P> <P> Store owners might have to slash prices to entice reluctant consumers -- which  would be good news for shoppers hunting for bargains on gifts.  </P> <P> "I look for a very promotional Christmas," said Loeb.  </P> <P> In any case, sales gains in November and December likely will not look great  because the tallies will be compared to last year's robust sales.  </P> <P> Last month's results varied widely among the types of retailers, and for this  reason analysts said it was difficult to generalize.  </P> <P> Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said general  merchandise sales rose an average of 4.3% in October for stores open at least a  year, compared to September's 5.9% increase.  </P> <P> Sears, the largest U.S. retailer, said its sales edged up 0.7% in the four  weeks ended Oct. 28, but sales at Sears stores open at least a year, called  same-store or comparable-store sales, were flat.  </P> <P> Retailers and analysts regard same-store sales as a better measure of a  company's performance than tallies that include newly opened stores.  </P> <P> Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive of Sears Merchandise Group, said  revenue has been hurt by a decline in demand for durables and by the shift in  the company's pricing and merchandising strategy.  </P> <P> The shift to "everyday low prices" that began in March and the discontinuation  of major sales promotions, such as super Saturdays, has made comparisons  between sales this year and last year difficult, he said.  </P> <P> But he said at a meeting with financial analysts in New York that Sears is in  good shape for Christmas. Inventories are in line to meet expected demand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAJOR RETAILERS' SALES IN OCTOBER  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.54IN:1.67IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> In millions of dollars  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> % change  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sears  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,530  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +0.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> K mart  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,070  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +4.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Wal-Mart Stores  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,190  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +22.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> J.C.

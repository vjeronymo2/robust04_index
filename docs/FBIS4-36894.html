			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Secretariat of the General People's  Committee concluded today its 10th ordinary meeting for this  year.    Following its two-day meeting, the committee adopted a  number  of decisions on facing up to some negative phenomena which have  caused an increase in the prices of a number of commodities and  services, and to the causes of the pressures on the Libyan dinar  -- pressures brought about by certain unlawful practices --  which have led to a drop in the real value of the income of part  of the population.    The committee's Secretariat has asked the Central Bank of  Libya to study the matter and come up with a date to start  paying sums of money in hard currency to citizens to enable them  to face up to their difficulties, as well as to define what sums  of money should be paid in every deserving case.    The Secretariat has reiterated the need to the brother  secretary of the General People's Committee for economy and  trade and to the governor of the Central Bank of Libya to open  the credits necessary for the provision of the local market with  the required commodities, through the legally recognized  channels. [passage omitted]    The Secretariat has also asked the Central Bank of Libya to  consider an increase in the interest rate in order to encourage  savings with the banks. [passage omitted]</p>

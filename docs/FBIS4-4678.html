			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been disclosed that the Defense Agency [DA]  and the U.S. Department of Defense, which are promoting joint  development of a next-generation support fighter (FSX), agreed  that technology used to produce radio-wave absorbing material  belongs to Japanese companies, which are in charge of developing  the material. Seven companies, including TDK Corporation, are  buckling down to the task of developing the radio-wave absorbing  material to improve the aircraft's stealth nature. In the past,  the United States had maintained that it was entitled to use all  technologies related to FSX development free of charge except  for four items, including highly efficient radar. But, the DA  submitted an additional proposal to the United States calling  for recognition of Japanese companies' technological proprietary  rights for several pieces of equipment.    The radio-wave absorbing material will be applied on leading  edges of the FSX's main wings and intakes. The material, which  is the subject of the recent U.S. approval, was jointly  developed by seven companies -- including TDK, Mitsubishi Rayon  Company, and Nippon Carbon Company. This is the fifth item  approved as Japan's own technology; Mitsubishi Electric  Corporation's highly efficient radar, computer, and integrated  electronic warfare system and Japan Aviation Electronics  Industry's inertial navigation system were approved previously.    Following the previous approvals, the DA proposed at a  meeting of the FSX technological steering committee (TSC) held  in mid-March at Kelly Air Force Base (in Texas) claiming  proprietary rights for Shimazu Corporation's optical display,  Yokogawa Electric Corporation's multifunction liquid crystal  display, and other equipment. The United States is expected to  answer the proposal as early as this summer.    Agreeing to remodel Lockheed Corporation's F-16 jet fighter,  Japan and the United States started the joint development. The  United States insists that technologies related to the FSX  development are "derivative technologies" created during the  process of F-16 remodeling. According to a memorandum signed  between the two governments in 1988, the United States can use  derivative technologies free of charge. However, the DA and  Japanese defense industries, including Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries, are maintaining the stand that "nonderivative  technologies," which they independently developed, are also  included in the memorandum. The two countries are continuing  behind-the-scenes negotiations.    In principle, the United States will have to pay for the use  of such technologies if they are recognized as nonderivative  technologies. We can say that the recent U.S. recognition is an  "outcome of the negotiations." The radio wave absorbing  material is a product of a technology that can be widely applied  to nonmilitary goods production. Therefore, the companies  wanted to get their proprietary rights.    It is believed that dozens of items in the memorandum are  still not clarified as to whether they are "derivative or  nonderivative technologies." Japan will continue to seek U.S.  recognition of technologies Japan developed on its own. But,  there is a possibility that the U.S. Congress may oppose such an  attempt and the issue may become another source of Japan-U.S.  friction. However, it seems that Japan and the United States  will make mutual concessions since the FSX will make a maiden  flight in the summer of 1995 and also because it is expected  that a budget for its mass production will be earmarked starting  fiscal 1996.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Australian gas venture for MIM and Conoco Conoco Australia, part of the Houston-based Conoco energy group, is to partner Australia's MIM Holdings in the potential development of a coalbed methane gas project in central Queensland, writes Nikki Tait. The Conoco subsidiary will fund a ADollars 22m (USDollars 16.1m) exploration, research and trial production programme over the next two to three years, receiving a 50 per cent stake in the project in return. Coalbed methane gas accounts for a growing proportion of natural gas production in the US, and Conoco has experience as a large-scale producer in New Mexico and Virginia. In this case, any natural gas production would be used either for power generation or as a feedstock. Niugini Mining, the Papua New Guinea-based group which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain and which is a partner with RTZ of the UK in the controversial Lihir project, reported a 57 per cent fall in profits in the six months to end-June at 724,000 kina (USDollars 787,042). The decline was largely due to decreased gold production from the Red Dome mine in Queensland, as the company concentrated on treating low-grade stockpiled ore while the pit was deepened to allow access to higher-grade reserves.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Major rejects Dublin peace proposals The sharp differences between London and Dublin over the shape of any settlement for Northern Ireland broke into the open last night on the eve of today's Anglo-Irish summit. As Mr John Major gave a public pledge that any deal must be acceptable to the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland, it emerged that the British prime minister had rejected a peace plan tabled by Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart. The plan, sent to London last month, provided for the Dublin government to drop its constitutional claim to the north and to recognise that Irish unification could come only with the consent of a majority in Ulster. As a quid pro quo, the British side would have to agree to a document endorsing the value of eventual Irish unity and to early and simultaneous referendums in the republic and the north to provide a visible expression of 'self-determination'. Mr Reynolds wanted the plan to provide the basis of the communique after today's talks. The two leaders agreed to downgrade the status of the summit after acrimonious exchanges earlier in the week threatened at one stage to result in its cancellation. Dublin now refers to it as a 'working meeting' rather than a summit. It is understood that Mr Major was ready to accept a document framework that included explicit recognition of the legitimacy of the aspirations of Irish nationalists. But he rejected as unacceptable to moderate unionists the idea that Britain should tacitly support the goal of Irish unity by signing up to a statement proclaiming its 'value'. Mr Major also judged that the proposal for joint referendums on 'self-determination' would dilute his government's commitment to the Unionists' veto on constitutional change. Both sides were last night attempting to play down the rift. In London, it was suggested a short statement to be released after the talks would emphasise the two leaders' commitment to seek an agreement. Irish officials pointed out that by agreeing to a total of three working meetings during December there was still room for manoeuvre and hope for progress. Mr Major, anxious to reassure Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party after the disclosure of the government's clandestine contacts with Sinn Fein, told MPs: 'There is for us one fundamental point: Northern Ireland's status as part of the United Kingdom will not change without the freely expressed consent of the people of northern Ireland.' Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, in a thinly- veiled reference to Mr Reynolds' plan, also rejected the idea the government could recognise the goal as well as the aspiration of Irish unity.

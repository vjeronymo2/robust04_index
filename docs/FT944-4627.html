			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bank Tiara seeks to double share capital through issue Bank Tiara Asia, the rapidly-growing Indonesian bank, is launching a Rp200bn (Dollars 91.8m) share issue that will double its share capital. About one third of the issue will be placed internationally later this month under the leadership of Baring Brothers. The extra funds will give the bank a total capital ratio, under the Bank for International Settlements formula, of more than 30 per cent compared with 14.2 per cent at present. Mr Tojokro Hartono, director responsible for corporate planning, said the extra capital presented 'a tremendous opportunity' for growth in lending to the medium-sized corporate market, in which Bank Tiara specialises. With gross lending growth approaching 80 per cent, albeit from a small base, Bank Tiara has enjoyed a rising share of the total Indonesian loan market without sacrificing interest margins. These stand at a relatively high 6 per cent. The bank, which was founded in 1989, says it is careful to avoid excessive exposure to its principal shareholder, Ometraco, the trading and real estate group. Loans to Ometraco amount to less than 1.2 per cent of total lending and 5.4 per cent of shareholders' funds. Ometraco's stake in the bank will be reduced to about 44 per cent from about 66 per cent following the share issue. This should enhance the liquidity of the other outstanding shares, most of which are held by international investors. Mr Hartono said with its strategy of focusing on the middle market, the bank risked restricting growth in fee income, which is mainly generated by large corporations. Also, it had to be careful to ensure that it could attract sufficient deposits to fund its lending growth. A plan to establish a finance company in Hong Kong next year would help attract offshore deposits from Indonesian clients, and finance their trade with China. The bank also believed its ability to develop new products for depositors would be enhanced by a planned expansion into insurance.</p>

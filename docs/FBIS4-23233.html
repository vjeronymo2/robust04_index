			<p>BFN     [Text] President Charles Gankay Taylor, in a detailed  press statement this afternoon, is calling on the Liberian  Council of State to abide by the Cotonou Accord in its entirety  if the process of disarmament is to proceed unimpeded, leading  to a peaceful, democratic, free, and fair election. We have  Aaron Cally with the detailed story:    [Cally] The statement signed by President Taylor outlining  the position of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]  regarding the current peace process, reads thus:    We are very disturbed by the artificial barriers that have  been erected to delay the seating of the entire Liberian  National Transitional Government, the LNTG, including autonomous  agencies and public corporations. Even more disturbing is the  apparent prevailing attitude of relegating the Cotonou Accord,  by those who derive their authority from them, in pursuit of a  fruitless exercise and usurpation of powers not delegated to  them. Lest we forget, the Council of State is only a part of  the LNTG. It is a creation arising out of the Cotonou Accord,  signed by the NPRAG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly  Government], NPFL, ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia], and IGNU [Interim Government National  Unity] on 25 July, 1993 in Cotonou, Benin, and was sworn into  office on 7 March, 1994. The LNTG is only a transitional  government, with a very short and definite life span.    The press statement continued: The present tragedy we are  experiencing was primarily caused by the failure to respect the  rule of law, or the fundamental law of the land -- or just basic  ground rules. We had hoped that our people would have learned a  valuable lesson by now, and change their attitude accordingly.  Instead, we see a disheartening compulsion by the creature to  violate the laws that created it.    For example, the following have been observed since the  Council of State was seated, the statement continued:    1. The council's first public pronouncement stated, among  other things, that as of 7 March, 1994, the NPFL and ULIMO are  dissolved, and have been referred to as erstwhile, former, et  cetera.    2. The Council of State's attempt to frustrate the full  implementation of the allocation of ministries, public  corporations, and autonomous agencies, as spelled out in the  allocation of Cotonou III, defies common sense. This had not  only violated the Cotonou Accord, but effectively delayed the  progress of the peace process.    3. The chairman of the Council of State has begun to behave,  and usurp, the powers of the president of the Republic of  Liberia, thereby attempting to marginalize the other members of  the council. This is also in violation of the Cotonou Accord.    4. The Council of State had assumed appointed powers which  are reserved by and for the parties to the Cotonou Accord.    The press statement continued: Now therefore, it has become  necessary to indicate that the Council of State must abide by  the Cotonou Accord in its entirety, if the process of  disarmament is to proceed unimpeded, leading to peaceful,  democratic, free, and fair elections. The statement, signed by  President Taylor, also stated the following:    1. The Council of State must correct the erroneous  statements  about the dissolution of ULIMO and the NPFL;    2. The Council of State must be allowed to function in  accordance with the Cotonou Accord. The council is a collective  presidency, and therefore its five members are co-equals. The  chairman is not president of the Republic of Liberia, therefore,  all privileges accorded the chairman must be equally accorded to  the other members of the council.    The press statement continued: The allocations for public  corporations and autonomous agencies must be allowed to go  through, in fulfillment of Cotonou III. The Council of State  must not allow itself to be manipulated by individual interests,  at the expense of bringing peace to all people and the nation.    The statement concluded: Since the LNTG has a life span of  six months, these blatant violations of the Cotonou Accord must  remedied immediately. Failure to do so will coerce us to review  the entire process, with a view to taking the appropriate  corrective actions, in order to sustain and maintain the peace,  bring about disarmament, and create the necessary conditions of  free and fair elections, the statement concluded.</p>

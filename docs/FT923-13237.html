			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Transnationals pace the growth track: United Nations World Investment Report MULTINATIONAL companies, far from being the gloved hand of first world imperialism, are an important source of economic growth for developing countries, at least those countries lucky enough to share in their largesse. This is the message of the second World Investment Report, published today by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Development. Entitled 'Transnational Corporations as Engines of Growth', the UN study concludes that foreign direct investment by transnational companies is fast overtaking international trade as the driving force behind the globalisation of the world economy. Global foreign direct investment flows rose rapidly during the second half of the 1980s, growing four times faster than domestic output and 2 1/2 times as fast as exports. The total stock of foreign direct investment world wide now stands at Dollars 1.7 trillion (million million) with annual flows in 1990 amounting to Dollars 225bn. The bulk of this investment originates in developed countries, which also attract more than four fifths of total outflows, with the EC, US and Japan together accounting for 70 per cent of world inflows. Developing countries have been losing out in the race to attract this growing source of new investment. While the volume of total FDI to developing counties continued to increase in the 1980s, its share in the total fell. The distribution of FDI across developing countries has remained highly uneven; and those countries receiving the largest shares have tended to post the fastest economic growth rates. East and south Asia together received 53 per cent of the total FDI inflow in 1986-1990. Africa's share in total FDI is, by contrast, both small and shrinking. Inflows of FDI fell to Dollars 2.2bn in 1990, 50 per cent down on the previous year, and were only slightly more than that received by Portugal. The UN report identifies a number of ways in which direct investment by multinationals may speed economic development in developing countries: Capital formation: while FDI constitutes only a small share of total domestic investment it often constitutes a larger share of investment in key growth industries such as consumer durables and high technology manufacturing; Technology transfer: the share of high or medium research-intensive industries has increased as a proportion of total sales in the last decade; Trade: US manufacturing affiliates in developing countries exported 33 per cent of their output in 1989, up from 22 per cent in 1982. These growth benefits tend to accrue to middle and high income developing countries. The growth requirements of low income countries - higher agricultural productivity, basic infrastructure and increased educational and nutritional standards - are marginal activities of transnational corporations. As a result, the UN fears that many developing countries may become increasingly marginalised because of their non-inclusion in the global strategies of transnational corporations. To counter this risk the UN report calls for the establishment of a multilateral foreign direct investment facility as a tripartite venture between host, home and transnational corporations to alleviate imbalances in FDI flows.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jacques Amalric: "France Urges NATO To Take </F> Action"]    [Excerpts] By asking for an emergency meeting of the NATO  Council to decide on the implementation of an "ultimatum,"  France chooses a hard line -- thus forcing its allies to take a  stand. [passage omitted]    At least, the ultimatum France wants its 15 NATO partners to  issue is clear. It cannot be ignored or regarded as a dilatory  measure: If it is approved by NATO and rejected by the Serbs,  it will actually endanger UN soldiers in Bosnia, beginning with  French troops. On the other hand, the United States, which --  hiding behind a convenient "understanding" of the position of  Bosnian Muslims -- has so far refused to commit itself in the  crisis, not even on a diplomatic level, may now be constrained  to take a stand. In a phone conversation on Sunday [6 February],  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was reportedly rather  surprised at the concrete nature of the French position.    It is too early to tell whether this first reaction means  that everybody is going to unite around the French proposal.  Paris is intently awaiting the response of three other NATO  members: the Greeks, who are pro-Serb; and the Canadians and  British, who also have troops in Bosnia and have always opposed  the use of force. A first indication of the Greek and British  positions should come out of the meeting of the Council of  Foreign Ministers of the European Union in Brussels starting on  Monday.    In the meantime, France does not intend to cease striving to  achieve a negotiated settlement, that is, a partition of Bosnia.  It expects that the ultimatum it wants to send to the Serbs  will give more credibility to its efforts for a peaceful  settlement by demonstrating that it wants the initial partition  proposal to be revised in favor of Bosnia's Muslims. Paris also  recognizes that pressure will have to be exerted on the Croats  to make them grant the Muslims the access to the sea they have  been demanding.</p>

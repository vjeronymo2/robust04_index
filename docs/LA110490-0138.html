			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE READERS RESPOND TO 'MOVIEMAKERS, MOVIE CRITICS AND YOU';  </P> <P> THEY GIVE FRANKLIN LESS THAN A 10  </P> <P> Of all the movie critics in town whose recommendations are suspect, the worst  offender is television's Gary Franklin.  </P> <P> It used to be that Franklin gave rave reviews sparingly, but it seems as though  half the full- and double-page ads for major movies now feature a quote from  Franklin calling some movie "a 10" or "10 plus."  </P> <P> Because we all know that barely a dozen movies a year truly are that good, it  is ludicrous to believe Franklin when he implies that so many films are among  the greatest of all time.  </P> <P> His obvious zeal for getting his name in print destroys his credibility.  </P> <P> JIM BOYD, Los Angeles  </P></p>

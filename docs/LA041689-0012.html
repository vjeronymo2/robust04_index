			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE INTIMATE EXPERIMENT  </P> <P> It is interesting that there is no mention at all of any of the Anglo fathers  in this article. Could it be that they are so uncomfortable with the  servant/nanny/ housekeeper/ baby-sitter that they have chosen to distance  themselves from the whole thing and left their overburdened wives to deal with  la situacion? If this is indeed an experiment in child rearing, when, how and  by whom will the results be judged?  </P> <P> LELDE GILMAN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

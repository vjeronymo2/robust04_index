			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Restructure costs drive Logitech into deficit Logitech, the world's largest maker of computer pointing devices (mice and trackballs), has reported a SFr31.6m (Dollars 25m) loss in the six months to September 30, mainly because of a SFr24m restructuring charge. The Swiss group, struggling to bring down costs in response to a price war in the worldwide personal computer industry, is curtailing production in the US and Ireland with the loss of some 500 jobs, a fifth of its total workforce. Sales were down 16.2 per cent to SFr192.2m in the first half in spite of a 20 per cent rise in volume. Mr Daniel Borel, chairman, said prices of pointing devices and scanners, the group's other product line, had fallen by between 30 and 40 per cent during the period. Excluding extraordinary items, the loss reached SFr7.6m, compared with a profit of SFr4.7m in the first half of fiscal 1993-94. Mr Borel acknowledged the figures were 'troubling', and admitted the group had not responded quickly enough to the intensifying challenge from low-cost east Asian-based production. It had also excessively diversified. Production of commodity items would now be concentrated in China, and high-technology products would be made in Taiwan. The group had given up an attempt to break into the market for sound systems for computers. Mr Borel confirmed rumours that the directors had considered seeking a partner to secure the company's future, but decided to 'keep fighting'. Operating costs were now better aligned with those of competitors and the balance sheet was strong with SFr83.9m in shareholders' funds at the end of September. In the second quarter, the operating loss had been cut to SFr1m after losses of SFr4.1m and SFr4.6m in the two previous quarters. He said the remainder of the current fiscal year would be 'delicate' because of production transfers and redundancies.</p>

Industrial specimens 15 mm  long and 10 mm in diameter were loaded in an Instron machine  while being heated by the SiC element of a laboratory furnace.  The strain rate was varied over the 10[.sup]-4[/]-  10[.sup]-2[/] s[.sup]-1[/] range in discrete 10 % steps.  The temperature was varied over the T= 800-1000C range,  specimens being heated not longer than 10 minutes and sprayed  with cooling water as the load was being removed. The  sensitivity of the yield stress _s_ to change of the strain  rate  d_e_/dt was calculated as the ratio of log(_s_[.sub]2[/]/  _s_[.sub]1[/] to  log[(d_e_/dt][.sub]2[/]/(d_e_/dt)[.sub]1[/]]. The apparent  energy Q of plastic flow activation was determined from the  slope of the log(d_e_) - 1/t diagram and the z-parameter was  calculated according to the z= (d_e_/dt)e[.sup]Q/RT[/]  relation (Q= 495 kJ/mole, R- gas constant, T- temperature).  Metallographic examination was performed in an ``Epiquant''  structure analyzer and the dislocation structure was examined  under a JEM-2000EX emission electron microscope. The  stress-strain curves indicate the existence of three  ``temperature - strain rate'' regions characterized each by  different recrystallization dynamics: In region A (T=  800-900C, d_e_/dt &gt;  10[.sup]-3[/] s[.sup]-1[/])  deformation is attended by softening after the yield stress _s_  has peaked under a _e_= 20% strain. In region B (T=  900C,  d_e_/dt &lt; 10[.sup]-3[/] s[.sup]-1[/]) the yield stress  oscillates, the amplitude of its oscillations decreasing with  increasing strain. In region C (T= 1000C, d_e_/dt &lt;  10[.sup]-3[/] s[.sup]-1[/]) the yield stress _s_ does not  peak and the strain remains constant after hardening. The  results indicate that the kinetics of microstructural changes  during hot deformation of this steel depend on the mechanisms of  the preceding deformations and particularly on the slip pattern.  The parameters of the new structure formed in the process,  namely its grain size and recrystallization volume, depend  accordingly on the z-parameter characterizing the deformation  process conditions in terms of temperature and strain rate: both  parameters becoming larger when the z-parameter is increased.  When z is very large and the number of slip patterns is limited,  then strong local deformation takes place and dynamic  recrystallization is effected by fragmentation of grains  followed by fissure of the fragments. As the strain increases,  the yield stress becomes more sensitive to change of the strain  rate, dynamic recrystallization thus controlling the yield  stress. Figures 5; tables 1; references 6.</p>

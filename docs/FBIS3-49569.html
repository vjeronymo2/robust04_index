			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The session of the People's Assembly of the Srpska  republic ended last night with a discussion behind closed doors  on the peace negotiations in Geneva and Brussels. The deputies  did not study possible corrections to the present platform as  the political basis of the Serbian negotiating team. It was  decided not to change anything in the essence of the political  stands presently contained in the platform. The final decision  regarding the platform will be made at the next assembly session  in Bijeljina on 17 January, one day before the talks in Geneva.</p>

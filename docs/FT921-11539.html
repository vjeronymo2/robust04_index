			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Observer: Not music to their ears Why is Greek shipowner and rising media-baron Yannis Alafouzos nursing bruises after forcible arrest by a police riot squad? The official reason is that, as boss of the top private station Sky Radio as well as Greece's most respectable paper Kathimerini, he was trying to set up a 30-megawatt transmitter on Mount Hymettus above Athens when his licence allowed only 1MW. But onlookers suspect his real crime was refusing to behave like a traditional Greek newspaper tycoon and toe the party line, in this case a conservative one. The ruling New Democracy party dislikes being publicly criticised by one of its own. Alafouzos, in his later 30s, is open to further punishment through his plan to start a news-centred television station, which looks likely to be refused a licence. Broadcasting minister Sotiris Kouvelas, who would be the one to grant it, says the Alafouzos media empire is a looming monopoly - a curious claim when there are 80 other private radio stations in Athens, besides 15 daily papers and over 20 television stations. Ironically, Kouvelas himself came near to a similar bruising experience a few years ago when, as mayor of Salonica, he set up a popular city hall radio station. The socialist government of the day threatened to send in the riot squad to tear down the transmitter. At the time Kouvelas was acclaimed as a champion of the right to free speech. But Greek politicians' memories are notoriously short.</p>

The paper did not say if the March 2 attack in the  Sunni-majority town of southeast Iran close to the border with  Pakistan caused any casualties or damage.    But it said security forces had arrested several members of  the group "Sahab army" who had admitted responsibility for the  attacks.    It was the first time that the fundamentalist Wahhabi group,  which has close links to Saudi Arabia and is based in Pakistan,  has been publicly blamed by Iranian authorities for an attack in  Iran.    Numerous attacks on the Shiite community in Pakistan have  been attributed to the group.    Zahedan with 350,000 inhabitants is one of the main Sunni  towns in Iran, a country where 80 percent of the population is  Shiite.    At least six people were killed in violent clashes between  Sunni demonstrators and security forces in Zahedan last month  during a protest against the destruction of a Sunni mosque in  northeast Iran, reliable sources said.    The Iranian media has since January warned of the risk of  attacks in the region by Wahhabi fundamentalists, charging that  they were backed by Iran's main armed opposition movement, the  Mojahedin-e Khalq.</p>

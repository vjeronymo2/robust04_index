			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NORTH AMERICAN COMMON MARKET: GOOD FOR ALL, BUT A HARD ROAD AHEAD;  </P> <P> FREE TRADE: MEXICO HOPES FOR LESS AUSTERITY AND MORE AID. WASHINGTON THINKS IT  WOULD BE A WAY OF GETTING MEXICO TO TAKE MORE IMF MEDICINE.  </P> <P> The long, complicated and often unhappy relationship between the United States  and Mexico has entered a new and hopeful phase: Discussions on a U.S.-Mexico  free-trade agreement are under way. But the relationship remains a minefield  for negotiators.  </P> <P> Both countries have mixed feelings about the other; not everybody in either  country favors closer ties. Mexico matters for the U.S. Southwest, not much for  Maine and Minnesota. In Mexico, some see deeper North American involvement as  the only solution to their country's prolonged economic downturn; others argue  that the political and economic costs of Yanqui capital outweigh its benefits.  </P> <P> Yet Mexico has a president who believes in the United States, and the United  States has a President who believes in Mexico. Since both leaders also believe  in free trade, it is not surprising that the current climate is conducive to  plans for a North American common market.  </P> <P> Problem is that the idea means different things on each side of the border.  Washington still has a touching faith in the kind of ultra-free market,  ultra-austerity programs supported by the International Monetary Fund. Raise  taxes, cut social spending, pay the foreign debt, keep wages low, allow foreign  companies unrestricted rights to compete in domestic markets; the doctors of  the international economy proscribe these remedies to all their patients.  </P> <P> Mexico's ruling party has been swallowing this medicine in increasing doses for  more than a decade. The result: the most serious political crisis since the  horrors of the Revolution. Mexico hopes that a common market would mean less  austerity and more aid. Washington thinks it would be a way of getting Mexico  to take a bigger dose of medicine.  </P> <P> The American concept of a common market is simple: Mexico will drop its  barriers to U.S. investment while each side removes impediments to trade. This  version of the common market will be popular in corporate board rooms here and  in Japan, but it will be controversial elsewhere.  </P> <P> In the United States this plan won't find friends among labor and environmental  groups. In essence, the plan would make it easier for U.S. firms to avoid  paying U.S. wages and to comply with U.S. environmental and safety  requirements. Japanese and other foreign investors would also be spared the  necessity of building plants in the United States to take advantage of our  markets; their products assembled in Mexico would benefit from the free-trade  agreement and they would not face the higher costs of production in the United  States.  </P> <P> Such a free-trade agreement would also be controversial in Mexico, though for  different reasons. A surge of new foreign investment would bring badly needed  jobs to Mexico and extend the benefits of the maquiladora system of  export-oriented production beyond the immediate border zone. New exports would  provide the foreign exchange with which Mexico could service its debt. Both  these developments would be widely welcome.  </P> <P> But the consequences of a free-trade agreement would go farther. For 70 years,  Mexico's political and economic system has rested on the protection of key  industries and limits on foreign investors. The Mexican Revolution was a  revolution against foreign investment. In 1910, U.S. investors owned roughly 10  million of the 14 million hectares in Baja California, and more than 100  million hectares, overall, in Mexico. U.S. companies controlled Mexico's  railroads, mining industries and oil; altogether, according to John Mason  Hart's "Revolutionary Mexico," foreign investors controlled 130 of the 170  largest enterprises in pre-revolutionary Mexico.  </P> <P> Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is in a difficult position. The  economic order that emerged from the Revolution is no longer viable. But  neither Salinas nor Mexico's ruling party is prepared to return to the policies  of Porfirio Diaz, the much-hated turn-of-the-century Mexican dictator who tried  to build national prosperity on the basis of foreign investment.  </P> <P> When Mexicans think about a common market with the United States, they think of  the Common Market in Europe, and, specifically, the way in which the richer  countries in the European Common Market have reached out to help the poorer  members, especially Spain.  </P> <P> Rich European countries like West Germany and France are still making generous  contributions to the Spanish economy. Some estimates put the annual aid to  Spain at close to $20 billion; on a per-capita basis, that would mean $40  billion annually from the United States to Mexico for such things as  infrastructure construction, debt relief and agricultural assistance.  </P> <P> This kind of aid to Mexico would probably be good for the United States, and  pay for itself in new export business. If linked to better wages, working  conditions and more stringent environmental standards in Mexico, a substantial  aid program would overcome many of the most troubling consequences in the  United States of such a pact. Even a fraction of that money would help Salinas  explain more convincingly to his constituents the difference between his  program and Diaz's. But it is safe to say that neither the Bush Administration  nor the Congress is contemplating $4 billion, much less $40 billion in aid to  Mexico.  </P> <P> These different ideas suggest that the United States and Mexico are still far  from a mutual understanding, and that the route to a common market will be a  long and torturous one -- much more so than in the case of the U.S.-Canada  free-trade agreement. A North American and ultimately a Pan-American common  market could be good for everyone, but we need to think more clearly about what  such an agreement would be worth to us. The lesson out of Europe is that the  rich countries have gotten plenty out of their Common Market only after making  substantial, long-term cash commitments.  </P></p>

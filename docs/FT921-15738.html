			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Institute of British Geographers' Conference in Sheffield: Car parts groups shun 'just-in-time' production FEW EUROPEAN car compo-nent suppliers have either introduced rapid delivery 'just-in-time' (JIT) production or clustered around car assembly plants operated by Japanese investors, the Institute of British Geographers' Conference in Sheffield was told yester-day. Japanese car producers based in Europe are far more concerned with quality, price and the potential for developing long-term relationships than having suppliers close by, Professor Ray Hudson and Dr David Sadler from Durham University's department of geography concluded. In a survey conducted for the European Community, the researchers found that 40 per cent of component suppliers claimed to operate JIT production, which allows very short production cycles and delivery within a few hours. However, only 5 per cent in fact used these methods. Many analysts have forecast that the European car industry would develop geographically along the lines of that in the US, where many JIT producers locate near assemblers. But the study found little evidence of the pattern being repeated in Europe. Dr Sadler said that the US distribution pattern resulted from the fact that there only 25 per cent to 30 per cent of components by value come from external suppliers. In Europe, there is a far stronger tradition of independent suppliers, representing about 50 per cent of components by value. In Japan, more than 70 per cent of components are sourced externally. 'Talk about clusters is very much overblown,' said Dr Sadler. 'Japanese car assemblers are sourcing from across Europe. Only a few low-value-added or very specialist components are clustered close to the plants.' He said European production capacity by Japanese investors would increase sharply by the mid 1990s, and that European companies would have to respond to their requirements over the next two or three years or face competition from component suppliers from Japan and eastern Europe.</p>

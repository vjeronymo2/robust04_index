			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- Japan imposes nuclear game  rules on the world while accusing Russia of developing new  weapon types, concluded Russian experts when 70 kilos of  unregistered plutonium were founded in reactors of a Japanese  splitting fuel plant at the Tokai-Mura Nuclear Center.    Seventy kilos are enough to make eight nuclear warheads.  Specialists put into question Japanese claims that the pure  plutonium powder "stuck" to the equipment and pipes.    While storing unregistered raw materials for nuclear bombs  Japan continues to spread sensational rumors on Russian  development of a new small-size neutron bomb on the basis of red  mercury. It gives the new bomb's parameters - a size of a  coffee cup, and address and possibilities of its use - Bosnia, a  terror weapon. [sentence as received]    In the opinion of experts, this is done to conceal Japanese  secret nuclear activities. According to IAEA norms, eight kilos  of plutonium are enough to make a bomb and dangerous for  non-proliferation of nuclear arms.    The revealed materials make one doubt "full transparency of  the plutonium peace use programs" against the background of  Japanese claims it is a model state in the sphere of nuclear  control, said the experts.    This opinion is confirmed by a classified report of the U.S.  Institute for Control over Nuclear Materials submitted to the  U.S. secretary of state. Some paragraphs of the report have  leaked and were used by the press.    Deputy head of the Russian Ministry for Nuclear Power  Engineering's Information and Public Relations Department  Vitaliy Nasonov told ITAR-TASS the report on Japanese plutonium  requires more studies, as it is hard to reveal the plutonium  source.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Building society returns to pension transfers Yorkshire Building Society is re-entering the pension transfers market with a service offering customers independent actuarial advice. The new service, which will be available from the end of this month, comes against a background of widespread failure across the financial services industry to comply with regulatory requirements in cases where people transferred savings out of occupational pensions schemes into private plans. A study by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick for the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, found that regulatory guidelines were breached in nine out of 10 pension transfer cases. Yorkshire's service will link the society with Buck Consultants, an independent firm of actuaries. Under the arrangement, which has been worked out over the past six months or so, Yorkshire will make the initial contact with a customer and will then take him or her through a questionnaire. For a flat fee of Pounds 75, Buck will then assess the benefits from the occupational scheme and the investment returns required for higher benefits. It will then prepare an actuarial report to go to both customer and building society. This will include a statement recommending whether the customer should take the transfer value or not. If the advice is to transfer out of the scheme into a personal plan, Yorkshire, which is one of the few larger societies to act as an independent financial adviser, would hope to advise the customer. Their usual fee for a similar service would be about Pounds 150, Buck said. Mr Derek Roberts, Yorkshire chief executive, said yesterday that the society hoped 'to bring some order to the marketplace'. He believes that people are more likely to trust advice from a society than from elsewhere in the financial services industry. Yorkshire, the 12th-largest society in the UK, has given financial advice to around 50,000 customers, but has only 300 pension transfer cases. Its customer base is about 1m. It stopped writing pensions transfer business early last year. Yorkshire decided to re-enter the market because the question of what to do with a pension from previous employment loomed so large in its discussions with customers about personal pensions. One of the issues thrown up by the inquiry into pension transfers has been that sales agents and advisers seek enough information about the occupational scheme, on issues such as discretionary benefits, to ensure that they can give proper advice on whether a customer should take a transfer.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Sacrifice to woo the franchise gods - Granada's awkwardness over its departing chief MR ALEX Bernstein, chairman of Granada Group, seemed ill at ease yesterday despite announcing that the financial problems facing the group had been dealt with - at least for the time being. Granada has sold its bingo business to Bass for Pounds 147m and is launching a 1-for-3 rights issue at 140p a share to raise Pounds 163m net. Mr Bernstein was quite prepared to talk about other planned disposals expected to bring in a further Pounds 60m. He was happy to talk about the bingo sale and the company's hopes for retaining the emotional heart of its business - the ITV franchise for the north-west. What he was not prepared to talk about was the last paragraph in the company's press release and, specifically, the sentence that read: 'Derek Lewis is announcing his intention to resign from the board.' Mr Lewis will stay on as chief executive until a replacement has been appointed from outside the company and, for someone on their way out, he seemed cheerful and reconciled to his fate at yesterday's briefing. Thanks to a series of leaks, it is now common knowledge that the departure of Mr Lewis was the price for the completion of the rights issue. With considerable neatness of timing, the complex financial package was completed just before Wednesday's deadline for bids for the new 10-year ITV franchises. It is less clear who was responsible for exacting the human sacrifice. Fingers have been pointed at SG Warburg, Granada's financial adviser, and, furthermore, questions have been asked about the relationship between financial advisers and the management of public companies. Warburg's argument would be that as financial adviser it merely reflects the reality of the market place, the worries of institutional shareholders and the impact of disappointing results. It is believed that Hoare Govett, one of Granada's advisers, the other being Warburg Securities, holds the same view of the company. The crisis at Granada came to a head because of businesses that went wrong, as well as the increasing levels of debt flowing from the commitment to British Sky Broadcasting and the Pounds 200m move into computer servicing. Events began to move faster when an institutional shareholder contacted Mr Peter Davis, a non-executive director of Granada. He and another non-executive, Mr Alan Clements, then contacted between six and eight institutional investors. That the institutions were unhappy and wanted changes at the top came through loud and clear. Some said Mr Lewis should go, others that the chairman should carry the can. And some just wanted change without being very sure what form it should take. Against such a background, the clear advice from the City was that someone would have to go if the company's financial future was to be secured. Granada revealed yesterday that its debts stood at Pounds 634m  - higher than expected. The imminence of the franchise bids, was, it is believed, a factor. As a member of Granada's founding family and with his close links with Granada Television, Mr Bernstein stood for continuity. Mr Lewis was hardly involved with television at all. Despite the fact that the strategy decisions of the past few years had been taken by the whole board, the view was that Mr Lewis would have to go. He wanted to challenge the views of the institutions and call in Barclays de Zoete Wedd, another financial adviser, for a second opinion. But events moved too fast for that. Yesterday Mr Bernstein did maintain: 'We are pretty clear what our strategy is at the moment.' But he would not answer the questions that many will now ask about Granada. If there was agreement about the strategy of the company why had there to be a scapegoat, and why was it the chief executive? Had Mr Bernstein considered resigning or should he have considered resigning as chairman? What had been the role of Warburg in the affair?</p>

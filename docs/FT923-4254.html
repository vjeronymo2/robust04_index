			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Observer: Paramount coup? Anyone spotting Michael Heseltine whispering in the Queen's ear need not suspect a threat to John Major's premiership. Hezza the Prezza will simply be passing on glad tidings in what has been a wretched summer for Britain's royal family. The board of trade president himself learned the news while on holiday in Fiji. The island's lately elected prime minister Major General Sitiveni Rabuka would like to rejoin the Commonwealth, from which his country was ejected after Rabuka led two military coups five years ago. Although now a republic, it still pictures the Queen's head on its revamped currency. Moreover, despite the installation of former governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau as president, Fijian diplomats stress that the Queen remains Tui Viti or paramount chief; this means the citizens get a day off on her birthday. Even so, Rabuka's ambitions to rejoin the Commonwealth are likely to be blocked by India pending a promised review of the post-coup constitution. As things are, it provides an inbuilt majority for indigenous Fijians at the expense of ethnic Indians. As for the rest of the Pacific, apart from New Zealand where the Queen remains highly popular, the royal outlook is unsettled. To add to the buffeting from Paul Keating's Labor government in Australia, which deems a British head of state to be demeaning, it's said that Tuvalu, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands are considering a turn to republicanism. If so, they may need to be quick. Given the ways things are going at home, the British may get there before them.</p>

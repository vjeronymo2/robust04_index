			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Former head of Bundesbank takes chair at drugs group A fierce boardroom battle has broken out at Corange, the Bermuda-based pharmaceutical group which is parent company of Boehringer Mannheim, one of Germany's largest healthcare companies. Mr Curt Engelhorn, the 67-year-old German who owns 24 per cent of the family-owned Corange's shares, has been removed as chairman and replaced on temporary basis by Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former president of the Bundesbank, who has been deputy-chairman since 1992. The Corange board is also attempting to eject Mr Engelhorn as chairman of the supervisory board of Boehringer Mannheim, a company founded 125 years ago. Mr Engelhorn was chief executive for 30 years until 1990 when he moved up to the supervisory board. The dispute follows a change of strategy at Corange, a group with worldwide sales last year of Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.14bn) in diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and orthopaedic products. The new strategy is due to the appointment of Mr Max Link as chief executive last year. He made two moves into the fledgling US biotechnology sector and has implemented a restructuring of Boehringer Mannheim. This will lead to the loss of 15 per cent of the 9,600 jobs in Germany and some manufacturing activities are to be transferred to cheaper locations abroad. Mr Peter Warburton, the London-based international counsel to Corange, said yesterday that Mr Engelhorn had been displaced as chairman 'because of a complete breakdown in confidence between the board and Mr Engelhorn'. Mr Pohl, who left the Bundesbank in 1991, is the only German national among the six members of the Corange board.</p>

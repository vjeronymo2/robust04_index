			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat  'Abd-al-Majid held a news conference this morning in the Press  Syndicate office.    He said the south Lebanon issue has nothing to do with the  Middle East problem. He expressed the hope that the Lebanese  negotiations [with Israel] would resume and that Israel would  withdraw from south Lebanon and from all the occupied Arab  territories, because the Arabs have a just cause.    In his news conference, which coincided with the 19th  anniversary of the war in Lebanon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: We  hoped the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho would have  been implemented today. But Israel has retreated from its  position. He stressed that the Arabs have a just cause and that  the negotiations must continue and succeed, especially if the  aim is to achieve peace:    [Begin 'Abd-al-Majid recording] There are of course  difficulties and obstacles facing the peace negotiations. This  is happening on every track: the Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese,  and Jordanian. But the peace process must continue and we must  not decide to stop the negotiations with Israel. I do not  support such a stance because we have a just cause. It would be  the easiest thing to stop the negotiations but the most  difficult thing to resume them, especially if their aim is to  achieve peace. Peace is [words indistinct] and is missed most  by those who are deprived of it. [passage omitted]    The peace negotiations must continue but continuing them  does  not mean I capitulate. Never. I insist on my stance and do not  abandon my demands. I do whatever would ensure the success of  these negotiations and peace. I reiterate that peace is not a  gift from Israel to the Arab countries. Not at all. Israel is  acting as if it is honoring us with peace. Thank you very much.  When the just and comprehensive peace is achieved, Israel will  be among the first to benefit from it.

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Bundesbank intervention fails to lift French franc INTERVENTION by the Bundes-bank yesterday failed to give more than a modest lift to the French franc, in a development which held out the possibility of further strains in the embattled European exchange rate mechanism. The action by the German central bank in buying francs for D-Marks was triggered by further shifts of US and European investors funds into the D-Mark, as a result of widespread perception that German interest rates are likely to stay high for some time. The latest signs of tension in the ERM, which threaten a further round of realignments to follow the three which have taken place since September, are due to be discussed today by French and German political leaders in a two-day meeting in Bonn ahead of next week's European Community summit in Edinburgh. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, are to confer with their foreign and finance ministers about broad foreign policy issues, including the outcome of the Gatt trade negotiations. As the franc fell in early trading yesterday to a 10-week low against the D-Mark, a senior French finance ministry official formally denied market rumours that the Bundesbank was putting pressure on France to raise interest rates to defend the franc, or that French and German authorities had discussed moving the franc into a narrower ERM band. In recent days, there has been intense market speculation that the two countries might be preparing a plan to 'harden' the ERM by some unspecified initiative to damp the recent selling pressure on some of the weak currencies. Yesterday's intervention by the Bundesbank - which took place in at least two separate rounds in the morning and afternoon - propped the franc from its low point of FFr3.4150 to the D-Mark. The support was reciprocated by action from the Bank of France purchasing its own currency for D-Marks, in a repeat of its intervention on Tuesday. But the combined operations of the two central banks succeeded in lifting the franc only as far as a closing level in London of FFr3.411 to the D-Mark, barely changed from the previous close of FFr3.412 and within two centimes of its FFr3.43 ERM floor. As a wave of concern about the ERM's future swept Europe, there were other currency-related events yesterday: Mr Piero Barucci, the Italian treasury minister, told the Rome parliament that the ERM would need a major revision if the D-Mark continued to dominate the other seven currencies. The central banks of the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark bought the Danish krone on currency markets in exchange for guilders and Belgian francs to prevent the weakest ERM member from falling through its ERM limits. At the close of European trading, the krone was quoted at around DKr3.88 to the D-Mark, just above its floor of DKr3.90. The Belgian central bank, custodian of a strong EC currency, said it spent BFr70bn (Pounds 1.4bn) from its reserves in the week to November 30 supporting weak currencies. In an effort to reduce the strains, Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC economy commissioner, ruled out further realignments and said selling of the krone, the French franc and the Irish punt was 'irrational'. In a more hopeful sign for the punt, which has been under pressure recently, the Irish currency strengthened against other major currencies, in spite of yesterday's move by the Irish central bank to cut its overnight interest rate from 100 per cent to 30 per cent. The upheaval in the currency markets is certain to be high on the agenda at the Bonn summit, which lasts until tomorrow. France and Germany will seek to co-ordinate their strategy for the forthcoming EC summit, with both deeply committed to ensuring the Community-wide ratification of the Maastricht treaty. They want to find a solution which can accommodate Denmark's objections to the treaty, without having to renegotiate it. Yet their talks are likely to be overshadowed by the battle over the French franc, and by their differing views over the Gatt negotiations.

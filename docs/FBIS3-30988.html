These properties are -- let me remind your  viewers and all those people who are following the work and  visit of the Yugoslav delegation -- that it has been  representing and I think that it will continue to represent a  bridge between the two civilizations, a region without which  modern world could not even be imagined.    However, if somebody claims -- I am therefore in a way  already inviting critics of such a visit and its consequences --  that progress is very small, insignificant, or that it is  (?benign), I would not agree with this, because such steps which  pervade concrete lives show that life itself can often influence  the creation of politics or can change politics in a certain  way. It is not true that only politics can influence life and  change it in this or the other way.    I think that the Croatian public, just as the public in  Yugoslavia, is aware of the fact that the politics that is on  the scene in Yugoslavia today is of such a kind that its only  aim is to establish peace and to carry out policy devoid of any  arrogance, arrogance which is, so to speak, alien to Yugoslav  politics.    [Avramovic] Were the Serbian Krajinas, or, as the Croatian  side puts it, the regions under UN protection, touched upon [in  the talks]?    [Simic] It goes without saying that when I said that the  most sensitive issues and the most difficult questions which in  a way represent disturbing factors in the relations between the  two countries were touched upon, that the problem of the  krajinas could not be avoided in any way. However, I must say  that both sides -- it is immodest to say so on behalf of my own  delegation, but I think that the Croatian side will also confirm  that -- have shown the good intention that any kind of extremism  should be avoided in taking any stands. The Yugoslav side had a  clear stand that the legitimate will of the Serbian people in  the krajinas cannot be avoided and that it is the factor which  we must take into account and will always take into account.    [Avramovic] Which of these conclusions, these agreements you  consider to be the most significant?    [Granic] Well, I would say that the most important thing is  that we have agreed that settling Croat-Serbian relations and  the relations between the Republic of Croatia and the FRY is the  foundation of the stability of the region and that all problems  should be solved in [word indistinct]. In the concrete case, as  regards the commission for the disappeared persons, refugees,  and humanitarian issues, this is a great step forward. There  are problems on both sides equally, and they can be solved only  in such an atmosphere.</p>

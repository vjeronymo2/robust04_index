			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / GM reshuffles top management: Jack Smith to concentrate on strategy - Wagoner strong contender for senior job General Motors yesterday announced a big reshuffle of top management. The shake-up includes the promotion of Mr Richard Wagoner, its 41-year-old chief financial officer, to run its troubled North American vehicle operations in place of Mr Jack Smith, GM's chief executive, who will now concentrate on group strategy. The company also announced it was separating its automotive components group, which supplies GM and other car manufacturers, from the North American vehicle operations, so that the parts business could focus more on global expansion. The unit will continue to be headed by 51-year-old Mr J. T. Battenberg III, who has run it for the past two years. He said yesterday the components business faced extremely tough global competition, but also big opportunities in regions such as Latin America Asia/Pacific. The shake-up is the biggest since the autumn of 1992 when the GM board, alarmed at severe losses in North America, forced the resignation of the then chairman and chief executive, Mr Robert Stempel, and replaced him as chief executive with Mr Smith, who had been battling to turn around the US operations. Mr Smith's relinquishment of his North American responsibilities underlines the improved financial performance of this core GM business, which is expected to return to the black this year. However, the unit is still a long way from generating strong results. Obstacles include poor manufacturing productivity and a model line-up with considerable weaknesses. Mr Wagoner's elevation puts him among the leading contenders to succeed 56-year-old Mr Smith as group president and chief executive, but his chances will depend on his success in North America over the next few years. His background includes periods as GM's vice-president for finance in Europe and running the group's Brazilian operations. Another possible contender for leadership of the group, 45-year-old Mr Louis Hughes, will continue in his current post as president of GM Europe and executive vice-president in charge of international operations. Yesterday's shake-up was prompted in part by the impending retirement of Mr William Hoglund, 59, head of corporate affairs and a key adviser to Mr Smith. Mr Wagoner will be succeeded as chief financial officer by Mr Michael Losh, 48, currently in charge of North American vehicle sales and marketing. Mr Harry Pearce, GM's 51-year-old general counsel, will hand over that job to Mr Thomas Gottschalk, and take on additional executive responsibilities.</p>

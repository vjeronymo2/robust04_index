			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE EASES LAW ON HANDLING OF UNSAFE MATERIALS  </P> <P> Businesses handling hazardous materials will report to the city only once a  year under a revised ordinance that has been approved by the City Council.  Companies previously updated the city semi-annually on the storage and use of  dangerous substances.  </P> <P> "We found that the disclosure didn't change," Fire Marshal Edward Rowlett said.  "What we were getting in effect was a duplicate (report) every six months."  </P> <P> The reports created unnecessary paper work for both the businesses and the city  staff, Rowlett said.  </P> <P> The revised ordinance follows state health and safety codes, said Anne Bland,  hazardous material specialist for the city.  </P> <P> Companies using more than 55 gallons, 500 pounds or 200 cubic feet of toxic,  infectious, flammable or corrosive materials each year are required to file an  inventory with the city, Bland said.  </P></p>

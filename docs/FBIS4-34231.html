			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Honduran  President Carlos Roberto Reina proposed here today to create  authoritative organizations with economic integration  decision-making power. He invited other countries to stimulate  the creation of an Ibero-American Economic Community. Speaking  during the first session of the Fourth Summit of Ibero-American  Heads of State and Government, which opened on Tuesday in this  Colombian port, Reina extended an invitation to endorse "the  gradual and progressive creation of an Ibero-American Economic  Community."    "The leading role played by commercial enterprises in the  new  interdependence schemes should not lead us to think that this  role ends with the creation of free trade or tariff-free zones,"  he said. Reina pointed out that the Central American countries  are willing to negotiate commercial agreements jointly with  third countries and establish a shared economic policy "based on  sustainable development."    According to the Honduran president, the proposed alliance  between Central America and the United States for sustainable  development is "the pioneering creative framework" for a  regional economic integration process. He expressed his desire  that the multilateral agreement, which was reached during the  so-called Summit of the Americas, to which the United States  invited all of the regional countries with the exceptions of  Cuba and Haiti and which is scheduled to be held in Miami in  December, be signed.    Reina, who is participating in an Ibero-American summit for  the first time, also asked for the recognition of developmental  differences among countries that participate in economic  convergence processes. Regional interdependence "can take place  only within the context of equality in which all costs and  profits can be shared equitably ," Reina said. According to  Reina, development imbalances are compatible with integration  processes, "provided differences in the countries'  competitiveness are recognized and taken into consideration at  the time of the negotiations."    Tomorrow, the 22 heads of state and government, in addition  to Dominican Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso, will close  the Ibero-American Summit in this Colombian Caribbean port  located 1,200 km away from Santa Fe de Bogota.</p>

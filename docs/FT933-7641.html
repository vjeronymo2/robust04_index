			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Technology: New glass shatters car-jackers' plans - Worth Watching A shatter-proof glass, developed for the windows of jet airliners, could soon protect the domestic car driver from 'car-jacking', where the windows of a stationary vehicle are smashed by a thief intent on removing valuables. Developed by Pilkington Aerospace, the glass has a plastic inner lining bonded to it. The plastic, part of the polyurethane family, is 'self-healing' so that if scratched it returns to its original form. It would take a thief up to 50 strong blows to break through the new glass. The plastic lining also prevents shards falling into the car if the glass is broken. Pilkington believes the technology will be used first in VIP and police cars, as it would add several hundred pounds to the cost of a new car. Pilkington: 021 451 3901.</p>

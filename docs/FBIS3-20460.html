			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cai Xianshi (5591 0341 1395), Sichuan Province </F> Branch of the People's Bank of China: "Some Thoughts on How To  Stimulate Treasury Bond Sales"]    [Text] As the curtain has gently descended on our 1993  activities of issuing treasury bonds, and as we earnestly recall  the events of that memorable year, we cannot evade the thought  that the image of the treasury bond urgently needs to be  rehabilitated and improved.    1. Treasury Bonds Too Must Be Marketable and Adapted To  Demand    Any new product that enters the market will have to stand  the  test of the market. If its sales are sluggish, the first check  should concern itself with the product itself, for instance,  whether consumers find price, quality, style, or after-sale  services acceptable or not, how well the world is aware of the  product, whether it has been sufficiently publicized, whether it  has made an impression on the minds of the people, and how the  product ranks in its competition with similar products. If there  is nothing questionable in these respects, the product is bound  to find favor in the eyes of the consumers. The accuracy of this  principle has indeed been well revealed in the course of  marketing treasury bonds since 1981.    In its present era of sustained economic development, China  is faced with an extremely serious contradiction in the supply  and demand of capital funds for its entire economic operations.  Raising capital for its construction projects, through an  appropriate amount of borrowing, in order to stimulate the  economy toward sustained and solid development has, therefore,  become a matter of major significance. This year the task of  placing treasury bonds will be further enhanced beyond the  foundation laid in 1993. Faced with this grim challenge, we must  free ourselves from old ideas, update our concepts, and we must  also, while consciously and firmly resolved to develop the  socialist market economy, become highly proficient in matters of  placing government bonds, so that the sale of government bonds  will proceed more actively and more effectively in the new year.    Issuing government bonds amounts to fiduciary borrowing by  the state and the government from the people, and establishing  with the subscribers to such bonds, on a voluntary and mutually  beneficial basis and on certain conditions, a relationship of  creditor and debtor. Buying government bonds and paying taxes  are two completely different concepts. Characteristic of the  former is its voluntary and remunerative nature, while the  latter is compulsory and without remuneration. If these two  concepts are confused and become mixed up, actual work will end  up in devious aberrations. The voluntary character is therefore  an unshakeable principle in government bond subscriptions. In  marketing the bonds, it is not sufficient to have the masses  regard buying government bonds as doing one's bounden duty or  merely as a patriotic act, they must rather fully understand and  recognize it as a profit-motivated investment alternative. As  the socialist market economy is developing further and as the  people are becoming ever more knowledgeable about financial  matters, this alternative of acquiring government bonds is  becoming a more rational alternative. Under the past system of  the unitary planned economy, financial assets of China's  citizens showed up only as savings deposits, while now, the  investment tendency is toward shares and high-yield bonds  (government bonds essentially occupy an insignificant place in  the vast majority of households). There is here actually an  imbalance in the structure of financial assets of households.  During 1993, in spite of a large-scale political mobilization  and of raising interest rates twice, the issuing of government  bonds still did not proceed satisfactorily, and this is a matter  that deserves serious thought. Ample consideration to the  economic capability of the masses to take up bonds and to the  psychological threshold of the masses must be precondition  before we zealously strive to create the macroclimate that is  needed for the successful placing of government bonds. History  has proven that the effective way of propagandizing government  bonds is not to merely stress the financial advantages for the  government or the financial advantages for the investors. The  correct way is, on the one hand, an intensified mobilization of  political thought, and, on the other hand, continuous arousal of  investment fervor among the masses. This is the only way to  gradually nurture a healthy investment attitude. It should not  be a matter of the government wanting me to buy government  bonds, but rather that it is I who needs to buy government bonds.    2. Serious Efforts To Improve Operations, Perfecting  the Image of Government Bonds    To ensure timely fulfillment of this year's task of placing  government bonds, it is in my opinion necessary to do a good job  in the following respects:    A. Governments at all levels must foster an overall point of  view and a long-term point of view, to doubly cherish the  reputation of government bonds. Intensified political propaganda  must be incisive and meticulous, must be fastidious about  method, while the sentiments of the investors must also be fully  respected. Oversimplification and overeagerness for quick  results are short-sighted and will in the end impair the  investment enthusiasm of the masses, will be psychologically  counterproductive, and will fester like an incurable disease. If  repeated efforts still fail to achieve fulfillment of the task  of placing government bonds, the deficiency must be made up in  some other way, based on a comprehensive improvement of the  investment climate.    B. Reaffirming the principle of the priority of government  bonds. Higher government agencies must delegate to lower fiscal  and financial departments the authority to impose punitive  restraints against capital-raising activities that violate the  principle of the priority of government bonds. Against  obstinately self-willed units, the government should take a  clear-cut stand in exposing them through the news media, and if  necessary even freeze the funds these units may have raised, and  hold them until the requirements of the government bond sales  have been met.    C. We must exert great efforts in opening up a secondary  market for government bonds. In a certain sense, the secondary  market for government bonds is also a kind of post-sale  servicing of this financial commodity. The more lively the  secondary market gets, the more outstanding the performance of  the post-sale service, and the higher the reputation of  government bonds. For this purpose, we must effect a  comprehensive regulation of the financial order, then exert a  major effort in initiating a secondary market for government  bonds, and accomplish a benign cycle of interdependence and  mutual support between the secondary and the primary market. For  the purpose of protecting the legitimate interests of the  investors, the government should intervene, as necessary, with  the intermediary organs dealing in government bonds, prescribing  the minimum rate to be paid by purchasers of government bonds  and demand that listings be subject to supervision by the  general public.    D. Rational determination of the interest rate of government  bonds. In China this determination must consider the  attractiveness of bonds for investors, and consideration must be  given at the same time to the costs of raising capital and the  capability of public finance to repay capital and pay interests.  In Western countries, the general level of interest rates of  government bonds is not at all high (in some countries it is  somewhat lower than the interest for savings deposits of the  same quality), but they are made attractive by exempting  interest income from such bonds from taxation. Investors can  therefore still expect good profits from the purchase of  government bonds. However, since China's tax system is not yet  in perfect condition, the treasury bonds, though by themselves  quite attractive, are now making a poor showing. Starting out  from the Chinese realities, it would be appropriate to set  interest rates for treasury bonds two or three percentage points  higher than the interest rates for savings deposits of the same  quality.    E. Adjusting the irrational denominational structure of  treasury bond. The irrational denominational structure of the  treasury bonds is also a major impediment to the sale of these  bonds. An investigation has shown that the general situation of  Chinese households that are presently capable of buying  government bonds is such that most are of middling financial  capability, with few at the extreme ends. We must therefore  start out from this fact in determining the denominational  structure of treasury bonds. A scientific determination of this  structure would not only benefit their marketing but also reduce  printing expenses. It has been computed that printing bonds in  the three denominations of 50, 100, and 1,000 yuan would meet  the needs of investors in the various income brackets, and  printing should best be at the rate of 20, 70, and 10 percent,  respectively.    3. Issuing Bonds at a Premium Might Be Tried    The issue of government bonds has by now been resumed for 13  years, since 1981. Issues have always been at face value, with  repayment of principal and payment of interests on maturity.  Investors have become somewhat tired of the same old appearance  of the bond issues, which for a long time have lost the  stimulating attractiveness of something new. To create a new  image for government bonds and arouse new buying fervor among  investors, it might be tried to issue government bonds at a  premium. The advantages would be:    A. Enhanced incentive to buy government bonds. From the  psychological viewpoint of the investor, rather than gaining a  portion of interests by means of a large amount of initial  investment, it might appear a better way to invest only a part  of the capital and at due date receive a fixed sum. Laying out a  fraction and having it grow to a large sum is generally the  psychology of persons intent on saving. If a 3-year government  bond pays 14 percent interest, a 1,000-yuan bond will have grown  to 1,420 yuan, principal and interest, at maturity. If the bond,  on the other hand, would have been issued at a premium, the bond  of 1,000-yuan face value could have been bought for about 705  yuan (getting back to the capital amount according to the  formula: capital and interest = capital + capital x interest  rate x time. To overcome the trouble that odd fen amounts would  present at the time of issuing the bonds, it should be  permissible to make appropriate adjustments and round off  capital figures as much as possible to whole yuan numbers,  within the limits of the interest rate). At maturity the bond  would be redeemed at face value. Even though the same amount  would in the end be gained whether issued at face value or  issued at a premium, there is a big psychological difference as  far as the investors are concerned, and this new style of the  financial commodity may act as an increased inducement for  investors.    B. It is beneficial for medium-term and long-term investing,  it will also prevent indiscriminate large-scale dumping. An  investor who has bought government bonds at a premium will  thereby have decided on obtaining his profit at maturity. In  general, an investor will not abandon his profits halfway. This  kind of stability will greatly contribute to an increased trust  in and reputation of government bonds.    C. Simplification of procedures, facilitating cashing in by  the general public. Cashing-in of government bonds has always  been troublesome for public finance and banking departments.  Most of the general public have also often resented the much too  cumbersome procedures of filling out forms for payment, for  interest calculations, and for make-up funds [pei kuan 6792  2949]. If bonds were now issued at premium, payment procedures  would be extremely simple. The teller would only have to check  whether the government bond is genuine and whether it has  matured, and would then cash it at face value. The bond would be  redeemed in exchange for cash. This heightened efficiency of  cashing-in would eliminate lining up in long lines at the  counter. It would really create favorable conditions for the  next round of bond issues.    D. Simplification of accounting procedure, improving  accounting quality. When issuing treasury bonds at premium,  cashing-in of bonds would not involve computing capital and  interest, it would merely require verifying the year, the bond,  and the amount, and this would significantly reduce calculations  by the teller and be beneficial in helping to avoid accounting  mistakes.    E. It would create favorable conditions for the flexible  adjustment of time limits for government bond issues.</p>

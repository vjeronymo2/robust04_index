			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A 16-year-old boy, serving time for causing injury by hurling concrete blocks  from an overpass on Interstate 15 in San Diego, escaped from a Riverside County  juvenile facility -- allegedly with the help of his mother. Officials at St.  John's School for Boys in Whitewater said a judge had barred the mother from  visiting the boy, but a guard who was unaware of the order allowed her into the  minimum-security facility. The boy was convicted of heaving a 6-pound block  that smashed the windshield of a car, striking the head of passenger Kurt  Meyerling, who was comatose for more than two months after the February, 1988,  incident.  </P></p>

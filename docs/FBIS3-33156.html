			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ricardo Tapia] </F>   [Text] The Shining Path [SL] document published by LA  REPUBLICA a few days ago giving an account of what was discussed  by Abimael Guzman and other main SL imprisoned leaders, as an  underlying fact throughout it, recognizes the validity of the  policy chosen in May 1982. This fact is taken as a basis for  the peace agreement.    Considering "the people's war to be the greatest social  revolutionary movement in Peruvian history...." and "the strong  point, the most developed in the democratic path....," it  describes clearly how difficult it will be for those defending  true democratic interest to reach a peace agreement when faced  with this SL fundamentalism.    The greatest majority of Peruvians want peace and an end to  the attacks, the blackouts, and the car bombs. We would also  like an end to the cases of disappeared prisoners and a  reduction of the number of provinces in a state of emergency so  that we can gradually return to our normal lives and to the full  state of law throughout the land.    We would like to see differences among Peruvians on the  grave  problems afflicting the country resolved through democratic  mechanisms. This and nothing else was the lesson derived from  the 1976-78 struggle that allowed us to recover our democracy  and to end 12 years of military government. Even the 5 April  self-imposed coup, the legitimacy of which will be decided by  history, had to withdraw some of its initial objectives and  allow CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] and municipal  elections. The authoritarian characteristics of the present  government, which were useful for the initial coupist project,  are today increasingly isolating the government from the masses.  If the wearing effect is still slow to affect this government  it is only because of the mistakes made by those who from  government positions ransacked democracy or as a result of  errors by those who from radical and alarmist opposition  positions showed a resounding lack of loyalty.    The start of the SL armed struggle was, undoubtedly, a  growing destabilizing factor that affected our democratic  achievements. If we look at the 13 years of internal warfare in  hindsight we will not only see the dead, injured, and maimed;  damage to the Peruvian economy, displaced persons, the culture  of violence, and the arming of peasants; we will also see the  overall weakening of democracy, the growing military presence,  and, particularly, the disintegration of people's movements and  the crisis of those who wanted to assume their political  representation.    It is clear, then, that the so-called SL people's war has  not  served to establish any democratic path. On the contrary, it  has served directly or as a pretext -- together with other  factors -- to advance toward more authoritarian positions.    In fact, Abimael's boast that he had given "harsh blows" to  the three mountains -- feudalism, imperialism (including the  "social- imperialism" of the USSR), and bureaucratic capitalism  -- does not stand any analysis. This is because, first, the  large landowners of the semi-feudal era had already been  virtually eliminated as a result of the agrarian reform of [Juan  Velasco] Alvarado by the time he started his war. Second, the  Unites States, as we all know, enjoys good health and it has  consolidated its position as a world hegemonic power. The  disintegration of the USSR can be explained in many ways, but it  would be preposterous to link it to any SL or MRI  [Internationalist Revolutionary Movement] actions.    Now, and because of the importance Abimael grants it, let us  analyze the "harsh blows" by the SL to the so-called  "bureaucratic capitalism." As we all know, Mao referred to a  capitalism that was linked to feudal large landowners' interests  in the China of the 1930's and which joined forces with the  imperialist interests of the time to monopolize state powers and  were politically represented by the Kuomintang and Chiang  Kai-shek. Mao identified four large families that directly  benefited from this Chinese bureaucratic capitalism. It seems  that, at the beginning of the 1970's, Abimael fell in love with  the term and in an anti-Marxist way defined it the way he saw  fit in order to continue to defend the characterization of  Peruvian society as "semi-feudal" and justify its peasant war  strategy. Therefore, all objective discussion on industrial  progress, the growth of cities, the relative decrease of the  importance of agriculture in the country's overall economic and  political structure were for him nothing but the confirmation of  the semi-feudal character of the country and our developing  capitalism was only consolidating this semi-feudal system.    It is not clear if the murders and pillages perpetrated  against small retailers who live on the mountains, against  private agricultural companies, and against SAIS's [Social  Interest Agricultural Association] in the countryside, are the  harsh blows dealt to the "bureaucratic capitalism." Perhaps,  Guzman is referring to the dynamite attacks on bank branches and  the burning of some industrial facilities in Lima. If he  alluded to the former, the result of his action only served to  deepen the agricultural crisis that batters the country and to  increase our dependence on foreign foodstuffs; in other words,  to favor agricultural producers from "imperialist" countries.  If he referred to the dynamite attacks, his action was  instrumental in helping insurance companies and leading security  companies -- established precisely through "bureaucratic  capitalism" -- to increase their profits.    If he intended to "dismantle" government investments in the  economy, in fact by blowing up nearly 2,000 high-tension towers  he merely managed to leave many little villages without  electricity and to facilitate pretexts for laying off staff from  large companies which were affected by the crisis and which lost  less money by being closed down than by producing. The bulk of  these losses were passed on to users by hiking the price of  electricity rates and reducing -- or at best by freezing --  workers' salaries and wages.    In fact, a better and more efficient dismantling of the  state  economy occurred during the current administration, from which  not even the National Bank seems to escape. The consolidation  of a true bureaucratic bourgeoisie is also under way by all  those who, with or without debt notes, stand to gain with the  so-called privatization process.    Notwithstanding this, by "applying the ideas of MLM [Marx,  Lenin, and Mao] in a creative way, and specifically the PG  [Thoughts of Gonzalo, that is Guzman's Plan]," we might venture  to suggest that the SL's greatest contribution has been to the  drug trafficking business. The "novelty" of all this has been  the attempt to displace hirelings, mafias, and small "firms."  Initial efforts were rapidly absorbed by powerful foreign and  domestic interests that capitalized on the terrorists presence  to consolidate a new hegemony that considered the interests of  representatives of the different armed powers present in the  region. Following a brief encounter, the "firms" decided that  SL members who had settled in areas under the control of  traffickers would handle the stocking and transportation of up  to 50 kg of "cocaine paste." Other, more powerful individuals,  receive "orders" under the protection of the SL for consignments  of 400 or 500 kg and guarantee its transport to the airstrips  where Colombian light aircraft land and take off.    Even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the document  --  possibly due to the context in which it was written, with his  captors present and the need to use a "diplomatic language"  given the present circumstances -- it does not refer to the  "harsh blows" dealt to the Armed Forces, which were hitherto  considered as the main stanchion of the three mountains.  Neither does it refer to "the generals specialized in defeat,"  as he did in previous documents when, using an impassioned  language, he deceived his followers into believing that an SL  victory was imminent.    During the 11 years the Armed Forces have combated terrorist  subversion, they had a little more than 800 casualties -- merely  0.7 percent of their personnel. Losses suffered by the PNP  [Peruvian National Police] during subversive actions total 1,500  -- nearly 1.3 percent of its personnel. If we look at the  situation that faced the Armed Forces in relation with society  and the state in general before they engaged in the fight  against terrorism, we can see that the situation has greatly  improved. Deployment throughout the interior has been stepped  up as have the advantages they achieved in the emergency areas  and in the Military Political Commands are countless. They also  played a decisive role by taking on in the true ruling of the  country -- if we leave aside all euphemisms.    Abimael Guzman is right when he says there has been a  centralization of power, which in turn has strengthened the  conditions ("formed the basis" in SL jargon) for the "successful  development of a bureaucratic capitalism." Guzman believes a  long- term project and a government to "manage it and implement  it" have become a state "need" (and therefore, there is nothing  we can do but accept it). He is completely mistaken on this  point. The need to maintain the current correlation between  military commands and Fujimori's reelection may surely be urgent  for some, but not for the entire Peruvian society.    Cynically, he notes that the people advocate peace and  answers that "he realizes the need...." The truth is that for a  long time his so-called people's war has been rejected and  caused resentment among the absolute majority of the population.  What does he want? Did the cowardly murderers of Maria Elena  Moyano, of the children of the Ashaninka Indians whose throats  were sliced, or the car-bomb in Tarata create support for his  fundamentalist craziness and his interminable desire for power?    About 1,300 mayors and councilmen -- including candidates  for  those positions -- thousands of humble peasants, lieutenant  governors, and community leaders as well as hundreds of  teachers, and district and union leaders have been murdered in a  cowardly manner; some of them out of rage, by SL detachments who  put into practice the "Great Military Plan" meticulously  prepared in Guzman's morbid mind.    Thousands of youngsters who became fanatics through the  "thoughts of President Gonzalo" were tortured, killed or are  missing. Many others were killed in clashes with the police.  Undoubtedly, also thousands of innocent individuals were  jailed, are missing, or were shot in their heads and buried in  clandestine graves.    But don't let that lead to confusion. We do not want to put  at the same level the action of terrorism and the violation of  human rights by the Armed Forces. The spark that started the  fire was purposely programmed by Guzman. His objective was to  set the meadows on fire. For a long time the Armed Forces, in  their effort to put out the fire, made the mistake of throwing  fuel instead of water.    Everything that has happened cannot be erased with a simple  change of language which is now called "diplomatic." The fact  that now Guzman uses the phrase "Mr. President Alberto Fujimori"  instead of "sly hotshot who acts as president" does not change  in the least the past events and the responsibilities of having  shed blood in our fatherland.    In the document, Abimael does not rule out a people's war.  Curiously enough, he points out that six or seven years are  required to resolve the problems of today's world and, we would  add, today's Peru. In a nutshell, Abimael is proposing to  suspend his armed actions until the second Fujimori  administration ends. Abimael wants "to form close links with  the masses" and fight his foes through a hatred based on class  differences.    If we consider Abimael's proposal for "objective  convergence"  with the current Armed Forces echelons, and the acceptance of  the Fujimori administration for "historical needs," against  whatever -- or whomever -- the neo-SL people fight in their  effort to get close to the masses? Abimael boasts that his  followers have always been "politically strong." In a party  that has fanatic militants who voluntarily express their  "physical submission" to "President Gonzalo," and a totalitarian  internal structure, it is not hard to imagine the party's  effectiveness in the mass struggle. The APRA [American Popular  Revolutionary Alliance] people from the time of the buffaloes  and truncheons -- the times of the communist workers guard --  will seem like a kindergarten compared to the events in store  for us.    As Abimael admits in his second letter, and confirms in the  document on which we are commenting, the identity of the SL is  expressed by the struggle against "revisionism." The SL  understands that revisionism basically represents accepting  elections as a way to reach power. Therefore, the work with the  masses, mentioned by Abimael, does not seek to gain strength for  future elections. The goal actually involves fighting the  "electioneers" (the traditional parties, especially the legally  established left) who are working within the people's  organizations.    All this considered, we reaffirm our stance that, if there  is  a transition toward a "war without bloodshed," we will have a  sort of semi-legal neo-SL, with a shock apparatus linked to  obscure interests in Peruvian politics until they decide to  resume "a bloodletting policy." Let's hope we are mistaken!</p>

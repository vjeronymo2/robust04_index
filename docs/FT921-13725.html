			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / International Company News: UK fund to be distributed in Germany and Holland THE first UK unit trust to be approved for distribution in Germany and Holland has been launched by private client stockbrokers Adams and Nevile, and will invest in international equities. The fund, to be known as Millenium International Fund, will hold a 35 to 45 per cent weighting in European equities, with specialisation in medium-sized companies in growth sectors of the market. Funds will also be invested in listed equities in the US and Asia. The units will initially be priced at Dollars 10.55 each, with a minimum holding of Dollars 5,000. The purchase price will include a preliminary charge of 5.5 per cent. While new so-called UCITS legislation on retail investment vehicles allows funds in one EC country to be marketed in another, Millenium has not been designed as an EC-wide vehicle, and permission is being sought for distribution in Australia and the Far East as well. The fund will be distributed in Germany through a German broker, CRM Securities, a subsidiary of Amro Handelsbanken. In Germany, about 90 per cent of retail investment products are distributed through banks which largely sell their own products. Non-domestic producers have had to rely on the new independent financial advisory sector for distribution.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NRI TOKYO BOND INDEX  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                PERFORMANCE INDEX  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Average December 1983 = 100              yield       Last   12 wks   26 wks                        16/01/92   (%)        week     ago     ago  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall                 169.88    5.57      169.88  164.48   156.41 Government Bonds        168.70    5.41      169.02  162.73   153.99 Municipal Bonds         171.73    5.93      171.38  166.71   158.18 Govt.- guaranteed Bonds  174.09    5.92      173.63  169.15   161.01 Bank Debentures         165.64    5.35      165.48  160.68   153.52 Corporate Bonds         171.63    6.43      171.37  166.85   159.78 Yen-denom.

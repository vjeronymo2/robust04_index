			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> KILLING LAID TO POWER BATTLE  </P> <P> Police said the murder of a Hells Angels leader in a bloody barroom brawl in  San Leandro last month may have been part of a power struggle between the  motorcycle clan and an Aryan Brotherhood prison gang. Michael (Irish)  O'Farrell, known to authorities as the No. 2 man in the Hells Angels, died in  the bar fight on June 6. Aaron (Jerry) Marsh has been arrested in connection  with the murder. Police said Marsh, identified as a member of the white  supremacist-oriented Aryan Brotherhood, may have killed O'Farrell to gain  status within his own organization. O'Farrell was repeatedly stabbed and shot.  </P></p>

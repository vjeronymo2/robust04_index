			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Esko Aho by G. Philip Mok in </F> The Hague; date not given: "A Pointer From the North -- Finnish  Premier Pleads for Realism on Russia"; first two paragraphs are  ELSEVIER introduction]    [Excerpts] Finland is well on the way to acquiring European  Union membership, with negotiations to be completed by 1 March.  Last week, Esko Tapani Aho, the very young premier of Suomi, the  "land of a thousand lakes," made a trip to The Hague in order to  present and secure Finnish interests. [passage omitted]    Politically, as a representative of the agrarian Finnish  Center Party, he is a moderate man. But he looked sharply  across the low table and quietly gesticulated in reaction to the  comment that Europe had reacted with euphoria to the  revolutionary developments in the former Soviet Union and East  bloc, whereas Finland had suffered a severe setback. "I do not  deny that this was the direct result of the upheavals," he  says. "It was indeed dramatic, we lost our markets in the East.  As a result we had to look elsewhere, and increasingly to the  European market."    [Mok] Therefore you have everything to gain in The Hague,  where your colleague Lubbers has been tipped repeatedly as a  possible future Commission president?    [Aho] Yes. But things are now going much better in Finland.  And do not forget that other factors than developments on the  other side of the eastern border also affected our economy: the  general, international recession, the lack of investments,  inflation. We have applied successfully certain measures to  fight inflation and reduce unemployment.    Our aim now is to attract industrial investments. We will  succeed in this, and our competitive position has improved  already. And now we are recovering gradually from the blow we  received following the events in Russia. In 1990, 13 percent of  our exports were destined stil lfor the Soviet Union; in 1991  the percentage had fallen to nearly 3 percent (a fall of 10  percent in just one year), and in 1992 they fell even further.  But in 1993 our exports to Russia doubled, so we have reason to  be optimistic.    [Mok] Perhaps. But we hear of long queues at the Finnish  soup kitchens, and a lot of people have fallen by the wayside.    [Aho] I am not saying that everything in our welfare state  is  perfect; just that we are on the right road. But you must not  overestimate the speed with which you can succeed in situations  like this.    [Mok] You have adopted a positive position on the  Partnership  for Peace initiative, which President Clinton presented so  forcefully in Europe. But, apart from EU membership, you are  not, like some East European countries, seeking NATO membership.  Is Finland, with the vast arsenal of Russian weapons and  nuclear power stations like Chernobyl just outside St.  Petersburg and practically in Finland's own backyard, to remain  politically aligned with Finland and Finland alone?    [Aho] We are not so keen on new measures for our security.  The East European countries which, as members of the Warsaw  pact, have been deprived of their security guarantees, are  naturally in a different position than neutral, nonaligned  Finland. Our interest in the Partnership for Peace is in that  part of the program which deals with peacekeeping activities, a  field in which we have experience.    [Aho] How do you view the phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy, who  with his buffoonery as war-horse of the right won the votes of  nearly a quarter of the Russian voters? The Finnish defense  budget is to be increased for 1995, is it not?    [Mok] The one has nothing to do with the other. We are faced  simply with the need to spend money in order to modernize our  military equipment. Buying new aircraft, for example, costs  money. But as far as the success of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is  concerned, all I can say is that I find it easy to understand  the growth of nationalism in Russia. People, also outside the  former Soviet Union, have overestimated the rapid changes. Many  observers thought Russia would be totally transformed in two  years. But it does not work like that: politically,  economically, and in the field of civil and human rights,  expectations were too high. Realism is the best guide, also in  order to view developments in Russia in a long-term perspective.</p>

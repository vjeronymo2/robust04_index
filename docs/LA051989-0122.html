			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE / KENNETH T. YAMADA: FAMILY TRAGEDY SPURS CHP OFFICER TO LECTURE  STUDENTS ABOUT DRUNK DRIVING  </P> <P> Haunted by the deaths of an aunt and two teen-age cousins in an accident caused  by a drunk 17-year-old driver a decade ago, California Highway Patrol Officer  Al Arredondo is determined to keep drunk drivers off the road.  </P> <P> So while on the job, he keeps his eyes open for drunk drivers. And after work,  Arredondo organizes high school assemblies, talks to driver-education classes  and lectures community groups. He sometimes asks victims of drunk-driving  accidents to help him spread the message that drinking and driving are a deadly  combination.  </P> <P> "When you're on the road (on patrol), you don't ever feel like you're doing  enough," said Arredondo, 35. Arresting a couple of drunks a night is not the  answer, he said.  </P> <P> His message is especially urgent during spring, he said, the season of proms,  graduation parties and consequently, drunk-driving arrests. While off duty, the  6-year California Highway Patrol veteran and Orange resident spoke at more than  40 Orange County schools last year. He also is a volunteer with the Orange  County chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and has spearheaded a  springtime campaign that has so far taken him to five high schools in an effort  to keep celebrations from turning to tragedy.  </P> <P> High school students are especially at risk, Arredondo said, because, "they are  inexperienced drinkers and inexperienced drivers." Such students, he said, "are  still at the age when a driver's license is a big thing."  </P> <P> Youths face peer pressure to try drugs and alcohol, a pressure that he hopes  his 9-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son can withstand.  </P> <P> "I don't want to let other students put pressure on (my children) to risk their  lives," he said.  </P> <P> Arredondo, who is assigned to a CHP office in South Los Angeles, said he wants  to spread his message to Orange County teen-agers because many of them tend to  have more mobility, money and access to cars than teen-agers in less affluent  areas.  </P> <P> Last week, Arredondo spoke to a group of 400 students at University High School  in Irvine. He warned students: If you drink, don't drive.  </P> <P> "Don't be stupid," he said. "Use your options."  </P> <P> Call a friend, relative or cab to pick you up, he suggested.  </P> <P> At the assembly, Arredondo invited KEZY disc jockey Mark (The Shark) McKay to  speak.  </P> <P> "Call me," McKay told the students. "If you can't find one person, if no one  else understands, then call me. I'm totally serious."  </P> <P> McKay, 22, said he will suggest options and solutions for students who find  themselves too drunk to drive home.  </P> <P> McKay said his memories of a happy school prom were shattered when his  girlfriend, who had been drinking, stepped on her car's gas pedal instead of  the brake, flipping the car and killing her 2 weeks before prom night.  </P> <P> "It's a stupid way to die," McKay said. "It's not fun to spend the day before  your high school graduation in a . . . church."  </P> <P> Arredondo also asked James P. Quinn to speak. Arredondo first saw Quinn 3 years  ago, lying on a highway with a severely fractured skull. On that night,  Arredondo reached down and failed to detect a pulse. Quinn was dead. Or so  Arredondo thought.  </P> <P> Three years later, Arredondo discovered that Quinn, 25, was alive.  </P> <P> At the assembly, Quinn stood up and spoke to a hushed audience.  </P> <P> Three years ago, he said, a friend gave him a ride from a Halloween party. They  had both been drinking. Their car grazed another car before even pulling out of  a driveway, he said.  </P> <P> "I was so loaded I didn't have enough sense to get out of the car then," Quinn  said. He stayed in the car, which eventually flipped in the near-fatal  accident. The driver, he said, later pleaded guilty to felony drunk-driving  charges.  </P> <P> Quinn concluded by saying, "If you choose the life of a drug addict or an  alcoholic, there (are) only two places you could end up: in prison or in hell."  </P> <P> The message, Arredondo said, is: "Remember your options."  </P> <P> People Columnist Herbert J. Vida is on vacation.  </P></p>

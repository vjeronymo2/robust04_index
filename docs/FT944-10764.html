			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Munich Re feels global warming's impact on growth Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance group, warned yesterday of a trend towards increasing natural disasters which is forcing it to reduce or end exposure to some high-risk areas of business. It said this policy was the result of high population growth, greater concentrations of people and property in vulnerable areas, and climatic changes, associated with global warming, which are causing unusually severe storms and floods. This more selective approach to business will lead to much slower growth this year but strengthen future profitability, said Mr Hans-Jurgen Schinzler, chief executive. Premium income growth will be well under 5 per cent after a 12 per cent rise to DM28.6bn (Pounds 12bn) in the year to June 30, 1994. Although Munich Re benefited from a reduction in natural disasters and higher premiums last year - underwriting losses fell from DM1.3bn to DM379m and earnings rose 4.6 per cent to DM300m - Mr Wolf Otto Bauer, a director, said the company was convinced the global trend to more frequent and damaging catastrophes would continue over the long term. 'If I was a betting man, I could offer you a bet that the records of recent years will be beaten by new damage records,' he said. Munich Re placed great stress on risk management, and was studying the danger of changes in climate through global warming. 'The signs that we are experiencing such a change in climate are increasing,' he added. This meant the industry had to pay out for damage by storms and floods as well as on claims for buildings, vehicles and crops damaged by hailstones. A hailstorm in the Cologne-Bonn area in July, for example, will cost the company around DM40m. Mr Schinzler said the earthquake near Los Angeles this year would lead to a claims burden of some DM150m for Munich Re, though the figure would be higher if it had not previously reduced its exposure there. With total damage of around Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19bn) and insured losses of Dollars 10bn, this was the second-most costly loss in insurance history since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Last year, however, was the first since 1987 without a new record being set for insurance losses on a natural catastrophe. Munich Re took the opportunity to stock up its provisions for earthquake and other risks, as well as for outstanding claims, by DM850m. It has already announced a DM1 rise in the dividend to DM12; earnings per share were DM48.60 (DM30.70). Ahead of tighter German disclosure regulations, Munich Re revealed stakes of just over 5 per cent in BHF-Bank, Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, IKB Deutsche Industriebank and Mannheimer Versicherung. It also owns more than 8 per cent of the Aachener und Munchener insurance group. In the UK, it owns 6 per cent of SG Warburg, the merchant banking group, 3 per cent of Commercial Union and 8 per cent of Trade Indemnity Insurance.</p>

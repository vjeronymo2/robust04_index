			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: GE Hungarian venture in profit Mr Jack Welch, chairman of General Electric of the US, yesterday declared that Tungsram, its Hungarian lighting venture, was moving into profit after three years of losses. He said that GE Lighting Europe, combining Tungsram and the lighting business bought from Thorn-EMI of the UK in 1991, had improved to a pre-tax profit last year of up to Dollars 25m. This represents a strong improvement on the 1990 - 92 period, when Tungsram made a total loss of Ft16.4bn (Dollars 160m), which effectively wiped out the company's capital. 'We found the light switch. We are a couple of years - not five years - away from having a very profitable, big-winning operation,' he said. This forecast offers hope at a time when other multinational investors, such as Volkswagen and Air France, are running into problems with their acquisitions in the region. Investors have taken GE's experience with Tungsram as a bellwether. GE has a reputation for industrial turnrounds, and its purchase of Tungsram in 1990 was the first significant commitment by a western company in eastern Europe, and remains one of the largest to date. Mr Welch, while bullish about Tungsram's future, admitted that GE had underestimated the effort required to restructure Tungsram. 'We couldn't be happier; we probably could not have been more nave four years ago,' he said. GE paid Dollars 150m for 50 per cent of Tungsram in 1990 but buying out minority shareholders and injecting fresh capital has taken the investment to Dollars 550m and GE's stake to 99.6 per cent. 'We spent more than we thought we were going to spend but we are happy as hell that we did it,' said Mr Welch. GE needed Tungsram's market share in western Europe to give it the critical mass to compete against Philips of the Netherlands and Osram of Germany. 'Strategically, our major competitors are located in Europe and they have positions in the US. We had to be in Europe,' said Mr Welch. Tungsram's financial performance has benefited from the retirement of the company's most expensive debt with the Ft16bn capital injection into Tungsram effected in August 1993.</p>

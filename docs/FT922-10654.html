			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Rosehaugh Serious investors have long since abandoned Rosehaugh to the banks. But yesterday's comment from the company that prospects for new letting in the London office market have deteriorated in recent months may still send a chill down the odd spine. Property shares, after all, have outperformed the FT-A All-Share by 7 per cent over the last two weeks in the grim hope that the worst may finally be over. A touch of realism is certainly overdue from Rosehaugh, but given its new masters it has no reason to overstate the problems. The fact that the company managed a Pounds 28m loss before exceptional items in the last six months of 1992 is a vivid enough illustration of the dismal level of activity. Shareholders, though, may be more concerned that just 2 per cent was knocked off staff and administrative costs over the period. To be fair to Rosehaugh, the company differs from most of its peers in running a large number of small projects, while its annualised staff and admin total is now running at a little over Pounds 10m, against Pounds 17.7m for the full year to 1991. If nothing else, it all goes to show that operational gearing is not a concept easily applied to the property sector.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PROTESTS  </P> <P> Spanish-language station KVEA-TV Channel 52 in Glendale came under fire again  Thursday from protesters who allege that the station discriminates against  Mexican-American employees. The latest Mexican-American figure to leave the  station was 11 p.m. anchor Alberto Aguilar, whose contract was not renewed last  week. Frank Cruz, the station's general manager, was replaced in February,  followed in June by news director Bob Navarro. "There is a pattern of  dismissals there," said Raul Ruiz, coordinator of the protesters and a  professor of Chicano studies at California State University Northridge. The  protesters want the station to hire more Mexican-Americans and to air more  locally produced programming. It was the fifth protest since June at the  station, which is owned by the Telemundo network. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

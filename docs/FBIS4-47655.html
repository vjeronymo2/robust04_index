			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] As the fighting continues in various parts of  the country, many more massacres are committed by the remnants  of the Presidential Guards, the CDR [Coalition for the Defense  of the Republic] and MRND [Republican National Movement for  Democracy and Development] youthwingers [words indistinct] and  some elements in the Rwanda Army. The latest and horrifying  incident took place yesterday [29 April] in Cyangugu, where  about 300 people were killed. These were among the 5,000 people  who had taken refuge in the stadium. The murderers threw  several hand grenades at the refugees and used machine guns in  heavy fire to kill the innocent people. The ICRC is making  arrangements to help the rest of the people escape to Bukavu, in  Zaire.    Meanwhile, a ceremony to hand over Burundi refugees took  place at Mulindi yesterday. The Burundi refugees, who numbered  about 20, had been rescued by RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front]  troops from Kigali passing through Byumba to Mulindi. They were  handed over to the Burundi ambassador in Uganda and were taken  to Kampala [passage omitted]    In a [word indistinct] incident, thousands of refugees and  displaced people flocked to Byumba town, controlled by the RPF.  All these people had come from Commune Rutongo near Kigali.  The worst thing to note about these people was that they had  all lost their families. [passage omitted] To the relief of the  refugees in Byumba, the Red Cross brought in several tons of  food and cooking oil and the RPF medical personnel were doing  their best to treat the wounded. Meanwhile, foreign journalists  continue to visit areas under RPF control. Today, they visited  (Kami) Barracks near Kigali, which is completely under the  control of the RPF.</p>

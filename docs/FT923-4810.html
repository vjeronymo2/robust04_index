			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Observer: Nonchalant Norman Heaven knows there are pressing questions aplenty facing the European Community finance ministers at this weekend's meeting in Bath. Quite apart from the present mayhem in currency markets, there's the matter of how to stop the exchange rate mechanism etc from going down the plughole if the French say no in the referendum on September 20. So what sort of a programme has Britain's Norman Lamont in mind for his EC guests? Well, dinner tonight of course. But his welcoming letter says it's to be a 'purely informal occasion, at which I do not intend any business to be done.' Then 'for our spouses there will be an opportunity to visit Wells and to see an example of how traditional English country cheese was prepared in the West Country.' While the letter includes an agenda, the topics seem hazily focused to say the least - 'the economic situation in the Community', for example. And thereafter Lamont devotes two pages to asking his European counterparts to join him in discussing how to gain greater powers for their own Council of EC Finance Ministers. Such things are highly important, no doubt. But this does seem an odd moment to have the community's finance supremos contemplating their navels and advancing their trade union interests.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television Elijah Moshinsky's new production of Aida, sung in Italian, is broadcast Live From Covent Garden by Radio 3. Cheryl Studer is in the title role, Dennis O'Neill sings Radames and Luciano D'Intino is Amneris (7.25 till 10.20). If you watched the first half of Dances With Wolves yesterday then presumably you will want to see the remainder today (8.00 ITV). Despite the fuss made about this revisionist western, which, reasonably enough, sees the 'native American' as a tragic figure, it is not as powerful an indictment of white colonialism as was 'Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee'. Soccer fans have a choice, of sorts. At 8.30 BBC2 begins two and a half hours of World Cup Grandstand during which Germany plays South Korea and Spain plays Bolivia. Difficult to believe that any football enthusiast will ignore that in order to watch a repeat of the notorious documentary Graham Taylor: The Impossible Job., This is the programme for which the England manager agreed to be followed by a camera crew and to wear a radio mike (9.00 C4).</p>

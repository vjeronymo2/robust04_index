			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Observer: Loose cannon One US congresswoman who is not going to be pleased with the UK government's decision on the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant is Elizabeth Furse, an Oregon Democrat. No friend of the British nuclear lobby, she said recently that she didn't want to face up to a failed nuclear proliferation policy and 'find that our closest ally tripped us up'. Born in Kenya and brought up in South Africa, she became a US citizen in 1972, growing grapes near Portland before she ran for Congress last year. Much of her life has been spent campaigning for migrant farm workers and American Indians, and against apartheid. But it's her outspoken stance on nuclear power which will really upset some older members of Britain's military brass. After all, her father was an admiral in Britain's Royal Navy, as was her grandmother, who founded the Wrens. So much for the traditions of the silent service being handed down . . .</p>

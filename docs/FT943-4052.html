			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Directors of the Rank Organisation, the leisure giant, are not among the most active traders on the market but James Daly, director of the television and film division, has sold almost two-thirds of his stake at a price of 424p. Brandon Hire rents out all manner of tools and equipment, ranging from power tools to marquees. The share price has been an outstanding performer over the past year, growing from about 28p some 18 months ago to trade now around 77p. Brian Nathan, the chairman, is one of the largest shareholders with a stake of more than 14 per cent. His recent sale of 39,000 shares at 80p must represent a little profit taking. Keith Carnelly, the chairman and chief executive of Polar, an electronics outfit, is another director with a considerable stake in his company. His recent sale of 50,000 shares still leaves him with a holding of more than 3m. By the end of August, we had recorded a ratio of 3.5 buys to every sell over the course of the month. The figure for July was 4.2 buys for every sale, suggesting there has been some slow-down in directors' enthusiasm for the market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                No of Company                   Sector        Shares     Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Brandon Hire              BCon          39,000    31,200        1 Eurocamp                  L&amp;Hl          50,000   140,000        1 Perpetual                 OthF           7,000    82,950        1 Polar                     Dist          50,000   137,500        1 Rank Org                  L&amp;Hl          22,000    93,280        1 Marston Thompson          Brew         116,500   347,170        2*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Airsprung                 HGod          80,000   200,000        1 Barr &amp; WAT                L&amp;Hl          42,000   228,900        4 Eclipse Blinds            BM&amp;M         650,000    52,000        3 GEC                       EE&amp;E          10,000    31,000        1 Granada                   L&amp;Hl           2,000    10,000        1 Hartstone                 Text         386,427    57,964        4 London Ins Mkt            Insu          33,323    32,323        1 Northumbrian Fds          FdMa         330,000    36,300        3 Quadrant Group            L&amp;Hl          10,000     3,100        1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

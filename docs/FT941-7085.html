			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Sinn Fein wants talks link renewed Sinn Fein leaders are to insist at the party's annual conference in Dublin this weekend that a direct channel of communication with the British government must be reopened if the Northern Ireland peace process is to move forward. Mr Gerry Adams is today expected to use a keynote speech to refer to 'positive aspects' of the Downing Street declaration but to stop short of giving the document his approval. The Sinn Fein president will focus on what he sees as the declaration's shortcomings on the issue of Irish self-determination. But as republican leaders responded favourably to this week's efforts by London and Dublin to address nationalist concerns about their joint initiative, Anglo-Irish tensions were heightened by an Irish High Court decision to free a terrorist suspect wanted for questioning over the murder of a soldier. Mr Joseph Magee, 27, from Armagh, was released after Mr Justice Feargus Flood ruled that the alleged offence of killing a soldier in Derby was a political one for which he could not be extradited. Meanwhile, mounting unionist hostility towards the direction of the initiative was underlined when Mr John Taylor, a senior Ulster Unionist MP, urged his party leadership to boycott new political talks. The IRA's political wing yesterday reacted positively to an article published in the Irish News, the Belfast-based nationalist newspaper, in which Mr John Major, the prime minister, made an eve-of-conference appeal to republican leaders to embrace the peace process. Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, said Mr Major's statement deserved 'very, very careful study'. He said the article - along with a number of recent speeches by senior ministers - had been 'of assistance'. Mr McLoughlin said an offer of a temporary IRA ceasefire made last year during the secret negotiations between the British government and Sinn Fein was 'still on the table'. Mr Major emphasised in the article that the joint declaration left 'no conceivable reason for continued violence' and that London would not 'try to persuade people to go for Irish unity'. But he combined this uncompromising message with a vision of the possible outcome of political talks designed to reassure nationalists. After yesterday's Irish High Court decision Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, said the case was 'another example of what we have been complaining about to the Irish for a long time. Their extradition laws are flawed. They have acknowledged they are flawed.'</p>

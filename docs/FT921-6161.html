			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Williams rise to Pounds 168m CRITICISM OVER the accounting policies of Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, overshadowed its announcement of a 42 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. Just over Pounds 40m of the increase to Pounds 168m (Pounds 118m) was due to last year's acquisition of Yale &amp; Valor, the security products company. However, average margins of 17 per cent across businesses ranging from household and building products to engineering and electronics, ensured that Williams still increased pre-tax profits by Pounds 10m without counting the contribution from its most recent acquisition. Sales rose to just over Pounds 1bn (Pounds 833m) although earnings per share only increased by 5 per cent to 22.8p (21.8p). Yet the shares fell by 12p to 313p mainly because of a debate over its accounting policies. Following the group's failure to win control of Racal Electronics last December Williams is treating its 9.98 per cent stake in Racal as a short-term fixed asset. The Racal shares - which it bought at an average of 55p and which are now trading at 56 1/2 p - are being valued in Williams' balance sheet at 50p and the associated write-down of Pounds 7m is being taken as an extraordinary item against reserves rather than profits. Some analysts argued that since conglomerates are in the business of acquiring other companies the write-down on the Racal stake should have been taken above the line. Stockbrokers James Capel also questioned Williams' decision to take a Pounds 10m write-down on the closure of its Banbury conservatory manufacturing company as an extraordinary item, arguing that it would have been more prudent to classify it as an exceptional item. However, as a discontinued business, Williams said it was right to classify it as an extraordinary item. In all, extraordinary items came to Pounds 23.3m - which included Pounds 6m of costs arising from its bid for Racal Electronics. Mr Brian McGowan, Williams' chief executive, strongly defended his right to take the write-down on the Racal shares below the line. 'This was a one-off case, not to be repeated. If we sell the shares and make a profit that will also not benefit the profit and loss account.' However, the new accounting rules may force Williams to take any profit it makes from selling its Racal stake above the line. Apart from the disappointment of a dividend of 12.35p - only just up on last year's 12p - the group's management of the businesses, with its attention to return on sales, was well received by most commentators.

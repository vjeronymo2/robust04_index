			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / 'Jericho accord may take weeks' It could still take 'weeks' to reach agreement with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation on implementing self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said yesterday. His comments came after several other Israeli ministers involved in the peace process sought to cool hopes that a final agreement could be initialled between Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, in Cairo next Monday. Mr Rabin's pessimism follows excitement raised at the weekend when Mr Peres and Mr Arafat drafted understandings on the main outstanding issues. Israeli officials say Mr Rabin has taken a more cautious attitude than his foreign minister and is concerned about the concessions Mr Peres offered the PLO on control of border crossings. Mr Rabin is determined the final agreement will be comprehensive and include all remaining obstacles, including the new Israeli-Palestinian economic arrangements and the division of authority between the Palestinian police force and Israeli security. 'People are not aware of the complexity and I don't want to start to implement before overall agreement is reached and signed,' Mr Rabin said. Yesterday, in the first serious Palestinian attack for weeks, Islamic gunmen wounded three Israelis near the West Bank town of Hebron. In the Gaza Strip, the bodies of five Palestinians killed by Arab gunmen as suspected collaborators with Israel were left on the streets. Meanwhile, the Israeli right-wing opposition to the peace process continued to splinter as three parliamentarians from the ultra-right wing Tsomet party said they had quit and formed a new faction. The three accused the Tsomet leader Mr Rafael Eitan of authoritarianism. Mr Nissim Zvilli, secretary-general of Mr Rabin's Labour party, invited them to join the fragile coalition government.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan eases curbs on foreign borrowers JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance has eased restrictions on Euroyen bond issues by foreigners and overseas bond issues by Japanese companies, Reuter reports from Tokyo. An MoF official said the deregulation will allow foreign governments and institutions without a credit rating to issue Euroyen bonds. He said the requirements were scrapped as foreigners wishing to tap the Euroyen bond market tended to receive a credit rating automatically. The MoF will also allow Japanese corporations to issue foreign bonds overseas under a programme through which issuers can launch bonds quickly up to a certain ceiling whenever conditions are favourable, the official said. This is expected to shorten the time that it will take to issue foreign bonds from the current 20 days to three days and at the same time reduce the costs of documentation. But the MoF will leave in place rules that require issuers to present a statement of each bond issue to the ministry, he said. The system will be useful for firms that often raise funds outside Japan. The MoF official said there were not so many firms hoping to use the new system, but that there was some demand. Up to now, overseas subsidiaries of Japanese firms have been allowed only to issue bonds abroad under a medium-term notes programme.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hungarian airline reveals 57% profits gain MALEV, the Hungarian national airline, reported a 57 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1991 to Ft2.09bn (Dollars 26.5m). Revenue, fuelled by high inflation, rose 29 per cent to Ft22.6bn. Malev's hotel business, tours and innovatory flight packages helped it mitigate the effect of the 25 per cent drop in passenger miles which accompanied the collapse in eastern European travel. The group's defiance of the worldwide downturn in airline earnings is likely to heighten western carriers' interest in the minority shareholding which is up for sale as part of Hungary's privatisation drive.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Oil There are two ways of looking at yesterday's fall in the oil price. One is that the 5 per cent drop in Brent crude was a clear thumbs down for the Opec meeting in Geneva. The other is that, now that the chance of effective production cuts has passed, the price is simply returning to levels before that meeting. Indeed the oil price could meet some resistance to attempts to push it much below Dollars 13. At that level, oil would become increasingly competitive with coal. The equity market erred yesterday on the side of pessimism. Shell, which thanks to its downstream strength is less affected by movements in the crude price, rose slightly. BP slipped 2 per cent, Enterprise 3. Lasmo, the most vulnerable of the production companies, has now slipped some 10 per cent since early February. Yet share valuations depend more heavily on where the oil price settles rather than on the extent of any short-run dip as a surplus builds up in the second quarter. The share movements are more understandable in that the arguments for the promised recovery in the oil price later in the year look flimsy. Though this would reflect the usual seasonal pattern, it is hard to see Opec becoming more disciplined in the face of hardening demand. The threat of resumed Iraqi supply also hangs over the market. Perhaps, though, only a change as large as that would make the cartel willing to confront the quota issue.</p>

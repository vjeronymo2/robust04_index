			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that  the report UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali submitted to the  Security Council will act as a deterrent in achieving a just  solution to the Cyprus issue and even cause a deadlock.  Recalling that President Rauf Denktas had accepted those  agreements reached at the meetings held with UN representatives  in Vienna which were within the framework of the  confidence-building measures, Ciller continued: The Turkish  side agrees to the package but the report creates an obstacle in  the way to a just solution to the Cyprus issue.    Addressing the True Path Party National Assembly caucus in  Ankara, Ciller discussed the Cyprus issue and criticized the UN  secretary general's report. Ciller indicated that previous  experiences have proved that it is impossible to achieve a  solution to the Cyprus issue by coercion and threats.    Stating that Turkey supports a just, realistic, and viable  Cyprus solution based on the equality of both communities,  Ciller stressed that Turkey will continue to support the Turkish  Cypriots to the best of its ability.</p>

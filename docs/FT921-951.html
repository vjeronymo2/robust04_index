			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock crew strives for a smug-free zone - The flying start to the Labour party's bid for power THERE IS a total ban on complacency, smugness or presumption on the Kinnock tour. At least, that is what they say. Dare so much as hint that Labour might actually win and a posse of earnest faces will fall on the offender with assurances that there is everything to play for, that the campaign has merely had a good start and that it is not over yet. At a break for a replacement aircraft on Monday, the leader himself was indirectly tackled on the cockiness question. 'What was the difference in mood between 1992 and 1987?' Mr Neil Kinnock was asked. Struggling to stifle a satisfied smile, he dodged the tackle. 'We aren't starting from 10 points behind,' came the diplomatic reply. But beneath the air of quiet professionalism cultivated by the Kinnock team, it is hard to disguise a spring in Labour's steps. Almost to its own astonishment, the machine is beginning to believe its own propaganda: that it can, indeed that it will, win outright. In part this confidence arises from genuine incredulity that all has so far gone - more or less - according to plan. 'We had feared that they had planned a 1992 campaign,' said one Labour insider. 'In fact, by using the QEII Centre for the manifesto launch and doing 'Major. The Movie' they are copying our tricks from 1987.' Labour's campaign script had dictated that it should begin with the shadow Budget, absorb the punches on tax and spending then, after a decent interval, get on to the safe home territory of public services. In defiance of Murphy's Law, that has broadly happened. Not only did the Smith Budget fail to spring a significant leak, but the Conservatives were in disarray over how to respond. 'It was the return of Mrs Thatcher that convinced us we had scored a hit,' said one media minder. 'That really showed they were rattled.' Senior campaigners are less openly euphoric, preferring to weigh the political value of the upbeat mood rather than question whether it is justified. The decline of the damaging gaffe, a crucial component in the 1987 election, is one consequence. There have, of course, been minor gaffes aplenty. Yet repeated Tory allegations of blunders has devalued the charge. 'Because they are behind, people tend to see the gaffe accusation as a desperation measure,' one Labour strategist claimed. Old hands argue that Labour started quite poorly in organisational terms. Initial forays from London were unfocused and not newsworthy. Party organisers will concede some ground to these charges. But they also say the criticisms are small beer. With an average two-point poll lead, Labour's until-now-smooth cruise hit its first choppy waters yesterday when the impact of its National Health Service election broadcast 'went nuclear'. This turned Mr Kinnock from dignified leader on a regal progress to something similar to a red-haired fox pursued by a pack of ravenous journalists from the Tory tabloids. But, so far, the worst fear of his minders - an outburst of Celtic temper - has not happened. Everyone is working to keep it that way. Party strategists believe they must now keep the campaign on a steady course, confronting rather than dodging the tax and spending charges with the 'positive programme' of its recovery package and continuing to press the NHS and education buttons. The aim is to build a slow, but steady opinion poll lead - 'two points a week will do us' - and hope that the Conservative camp will follow ancient tradition and self-destruct amid internal recriminations. 'Defence is a dead issue, they can't make the union card work so they have only got tax and Kinnock left,' one party official argued. 'But if they play those too hard there will be a hostile response from the public to the stress on negative campaigning.' All this fails to address the question of whether Labour is being too optimistic in assuming that the drift will turn to a rout. There is, dare one say it, just a touch of complacency about it. The truth is Labour has not yet broken through the barrier that turns those who say the Tories do not deserve to win into voters who argue that Mr Kinnock merits the keys of Downing street. But they have made a start.</p>

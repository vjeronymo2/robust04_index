			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bourse suspends CBR shares TRADING in the shares of CBR, the Belgian cement group, was suspended yesterday on the Brussels bourse pending an announcement today. Meanwhile, Societe Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company which owns a 43 per cent stake in CBR, unexpectedly brought forward announcement of its interim results to today. Analysts immediately speculated that La Generale was preparing to sell all or part of its stake in the cement company. Neither CBR nor La Generale would comment on yesterday's market developments. La Generale has made no secret of its desire to reduce exposure to cyclical industrial stocks and has been seeking 'industrial partners' for some of its main holdings. The Belgian authorities did not suspend the shares of the holding company. They rose BFr60 to close at BFr2,590. CBR's shares were suspended at lunchtime yesterday at BFr11,475, against BFr11,250 at the start of trading. The shares will remain suspended throughout today's session. 'If they're suspending CBR for more than a day, (the announcement) has got to be more than CBR buying something,' said one analyst. At the suspension price, CBR would be worth a total of more than BFr50bn (Dollars 1.45bn). Potential buyers would have to decide whether to buy out La Generale's stake at less than the market price, or pay a small premium and trigger a bid for the whole company. Only this week, Lafarge Coppee, the French cement company, denied it was interested in CBR. Analysts believe other likely candidates include Holderbank of Switzerland, and Heidelberger Zement of Germany.</p>

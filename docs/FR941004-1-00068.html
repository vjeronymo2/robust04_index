The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) now announces a 90-day finding on a recently received petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petition was submitted by Australians for Animals (in Australia) and the Fund for Animals (in the United States); about 40 additional organizations in the United States and Australia were named as supporting the petition. It was dated May 3, 1994, and was received by the Service on May 5, 1994. It requests that the koala  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Phascolarctos cinereus), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a bearlike Australian marsupial, be classified as endangered in New South Wales and Victoria, and as threatened in Queensland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The koala once occurred over much of the three indicated states, as well as in part of South Australia, and numbered in the millions. The petition presents an extensive compilation of data, including recent direct testimony from authorities on the species, suggesting that the koala has declined greatly in distribution and numbers, and that its status is likely to continue to deteriorate. Reportedly, there are practically none left in South Australia and only a few thousand in New South Wales and Victoria; the Queensland population may be less than 10 percent of what it was in the 1920s. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The species was drastically reduced by excessive killing for its fur up through the 1920s. It subsequently was provided legal protection from such killing, but, according to the petition, remnant populations are relatively small and badly fragmented. Logging, agriculture, and other problems have eliminated at least two-thirds of the original forest and woodland habitat, further declines are occurring, and little of the remaining habitat is well protected. The species is totally dependent for food and shelter on certain types of trees within forests and woodlands. The destruction or degradation of this habitat will reduce the viability of populations, even if the animals are otherwise protected, and many local populations are said to have disappeared in recent years. Other reported problems include fires, diseases, droughts, harassment by dogs, interference with normal gene flow, and killing along the roads now penetrating habitat. The largest population remaining in Queensland is now said to be immediately threatened by a major highway project that would bisect its habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service is aware that the koala is generally protected by federal and procincial laws in Australia, and that there have been intensive government efforts to conserve and reintroduce some populations. However, the information presented by the petition gives cause for concern about the over-all prospects for the species and its natural ecosystems, and suggests that further review of the situation is advisable. The Service therefore has found that the petition presents substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. Also, pursuant to Section 4(b)(3), the Service hereby commences a review of the status of the involved species. Submission of appropriate data, opinions, and publications regarding this petition is encouraged. In accordance with Section 4(b)(3), within 12 months of receipt of the petition, the Service will make another finding as to whether the requested action is warranted, not warranted, or warranted but precluded by other listing measures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority for this action is the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 26, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Bruce Blanchard, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Director, Fish and Wildlife Service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24512 Filed 10&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

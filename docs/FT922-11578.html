			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (33): Postscript Are equities really the best place for long-term investment? The arguments look rather hollow when set against the unit trust figures revealed in the accompanying tables. An investor in the average smaller companies fund, for example, is still losing money on his initial investment after five long years. And the UK growth sector has produced a pitiful 8.6 per cent average increase (including reinvested income) over the five-year period. What makes these figures doubly sad is that early 1987 was one of the great boom periods for unit trust sales. Many investors' first trust experience of equity investment will have been a disappointment. Only those who backed the Far East (excluding Japan) sector will have had a good chance of beating the building society. Investment trust shareholders did rather better - the average international capital growth fund rose 32.6 per cent over five years, compared with 8.4 per cent for the unit trust equivalent. But even so, only the Far Eastern funds produced returns to make building society or national savings investors envious. All this may change, of course. The five-year period covered by the statistics included the stock market crash of October 1987, the Gulf crisis and the recession. Historically, equities have proved themselves as better long-term investments than building societies. Whether the same patterns will recur is another question. During the 1980s, equity income funds tended to outperform their capital-growth brethren. But over the past year or so, many high-yielding shares have had problems maintaining their dividends. The average UK equity income trust has fallen almost 13 per cent during that time. Dividend pay-outs are currently high in relation to corporate profits by historical standards, so income funds may have problems in producing income growth over the next years. Analysis of individual fund managers' performance produces evidence for the 'random walk' theory of investment. More than 90 management groups have a top-20 sectoral performance to boast about, but none achieves a ranking in all of the 14 sectors. Sixteen groups have five or more funds in the top 20s, with allied Dunbar, Capel-Cure Asset Management (via the Capability and N&amp;P ranges), Invesco MIM and Fidelity standing out with the most appearances. Only one group, Abbey, has a first-place ranking in two sectors. Looking back at the tables in our first Quarterly Review (October 1990), what is striking is how many of the top unit trusts have changed. Of the top 10 UK general trusts in that issue, only two are still among the best 10. So if you want to back a trust, you must resign yourself to taking your chance on the performance of both the general market and the individual manager. Good luck.</p>

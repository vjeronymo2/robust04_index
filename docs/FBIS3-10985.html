In Jacmel, a first step  was taken by the president of the lower chamber, Frantz Robert  Monde, who presented the plan to the population there. He did so  during the inauguration of an information and communication  office for the Southeast deputies and their constituents. Our  correspondent in Jacmel, Pierre Nazon Beauliere, filed a report:    [Begin Beauliere recording, in Creole] On Sunday, 13 March,  Deputy Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of  Deputies, inaugurated a deputies' office in Jacmel, an office  serving as part of a transmission network between the Chamber of  Deputies and the voters in all the constituencies.    Following the inauguration ceremony, Deputy Joseph Lambert  and Frantz Robert Monde met with the population at the Samba  Night Club for a conference-debate on the topic: analysis of the  current political situation, the settlement plan voted by the  deputies, and its future. Agronomist Joseph Lambert, deputy of  Jacmel's first constituency, presented an analysis of the plan,  then outlined the current political situation with a  retrospective dating from 7 February 1986. The deputy assessed  the eight years since the overthrow of Jean-Claude [Duvalier],  during which 12 governments have come and gone, with the country  regressing further and further. Deputy Lambert strongly  criticized the seven months of Father Aristide's presidency.    The president of the House of Deputies, Frantz Robert Monde,  presented the crisis settlement plan called the Legislators'  Plan. Deputy Monde detailed the plan, stating that it came from  President Aristide's laboratory and that it is not an American  plan, as many people believe. Deputy Monde did not hesitate to  criticize President Aristide, who he says rejected the plan  while enjoying millions of dollars in the United States. Deputy  Monde asserted that President Aristide never knows what he  wants. Monde believes the entire world will soon realize that  President Aristide does not want the crisis to be solved. Deputy  Monde let it be known that he will not be a hostage of either  Father Aristide or General Cedras. He stated that he is  defending his country while being destroyed by an embargo. He  advised that if within a month, this legislators' plan does not  pass, they in the parliament will consider a Haitian solution  for the crisis.    Senator Margaret Martin intervened to explain the reasons  the  senators made the decision to dismiss the office presided over  by Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis. According to Sen. Martin, it was  because Firmin never held a session. The Senate is blocked and  the country is collapsing. She added that Sen. Firmin is  spreading corruption in the Senate. She said he had offered her  $130,000 and a diplomatic post abroad to resign.    Many people came to the news conference and asked questions.  It had been a long time since the population of Jacmel had  participated in such a conference. The population is not at all  informed on the Haitian crisis.    Deputy Jose LaFrance, Rita Frederick Moncoeur, and Joseph  Elisca Bomier attended this conference. Deputy Lambert had hired  the band, Les Invincibles, to play in front of the building.  Many people believe that this conference is a campaign for a  second mandate that Deputy Joseph Lambert has begun.    Pierre Nazon Beauliere for Radio Metropole. [end recording]</p>

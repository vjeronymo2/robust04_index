			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Observer: Marathon man Kingfisher's Nigel Whittaker has set an unofficial Footsie - or footsore - record. As the only director of a FTSE 100 company to admit to taking part in Sunday's London marathon, his official time of 4.02 hours has to be a benchmark for next year's event. Yesterday, 43-year-old Whittaker was at his desk as usual, and says he will definitely run again next year. 'The experience was good for the sole,' he quipped, but the run has done nothing for his sense of humour.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that if the  problems regarding the Serbian attacks on Gorazde are not solved  then this will be an indication that the international system  has collapsed. Replying to reporters' questions on the issue at  the Cankaya Mansion, Demirel said that NATO which has been a  deterrent force against nuclear war close to 45 years has been  reduced to a position where it cannot even protect a city. He  added: Not only Turkey but all the NATO member countries and  everyone who is responsible for and in favor of peace in Europe  should ponder this issue. Demirel said:    [Begin recording] I am concerned that, and I have been  saying this for close to a year now, the United Nations which is  charged with securing world peace and the UN Security Council  have been unable to implement the CSCE resolutions in Europe  because they do not have the power to impose sanctions. The  Gorazde incident is not an insignificant one. The quiet  achieved in Sarajevo for a while [words indistinct]. The  Gorazde developments can wipe it all out. There will be other  incidents in other parts of the world. This international system  can collapse. Maybe the word collapse is a very strong one but  it can be greatly damaged. A damage that is close to a  breakdown. [end recording]    Demirel stated that the Serbs have the weapons of the former  Yugoslav Army, and that the people of Gorazde cannot procure  arms because of the embargo. Recalling that he has been arguing  with world leaders for the last year saying that they neither  protect the Bosnian people nor sell them arms, Demirel concluded  by saying that he sent messages on the issue to everyone.</p>

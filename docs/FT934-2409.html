			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Grown from fertilisers but floundering in mire: The sorry history of a one-time high-flyer For Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group, yesterday's bad news was only the latest episode in a succession of management changes, profit warnings and restructurings over the past three years. This was once a high-flying company, transformed during the 1980s - under the then chairman and chief executive Mr John Kerridge - from a loss-making fertiliser manufacturer into a drugs and equipment group that was touted as the next Glaxo. After Mr Kerridge took the helm in 1980, Fisons' share price rose from a low of 12.5p to a high of 513p in July 1991. Five months later Mr Kerridge resigned for reasons of ill-health. Yesterday the stock closed down 24p at 113p, its lowest since 1984. Fisons' difficulties first manifested themselves two years ago following regulatory problems with the US Food and Drug Administration. The subsequent management reshuffle left Mr Patrick Egan, a non-executive and Unilever veteran, as chairman. After some delay, Mr Cedric Scroggs, the scientific equipment director, was promoted to chief executive. The first managerial change was fairly orderly. The latest crisis, which climaxed on at a Sunday night board meeting, has left the company in disarray, without a chief executive, without a finance director and without an apparent strategy. Mr Egan's first task is to replace Mr Scroggs and Mr Roy Thomas, the finance director who resigned on Friday. That could prove difficult. The chances of finding a credible executive from the drugs industry to replace Mr Scroggs are remote, given the company's plight. The scientific instrument business will suffer a collapse in operating profits this year, falling from Pounds 12m last year to a loss of about Pounds 16m. Mr Egan says the business is a curate's egg. The organic analysis equipment operations are good; parts of the inorganic business are performing well, but others are in difficulty. One inorganic business is regarded as non-core, while surface science is losing money. In the drugs division some dubious accounting practices have come to light. It was boosting sales and profits by offering heavy discounts to wholesalers towards the year-end. This policy, which started as early as 1984, became increasingly important until, in 1991, it generated additional sales of Pounds 78m out of a divisional turnover of Pounds 427m. After Mr Kerridge left, the board decided to gradually wind down such discounts, reducing them to Pounds 62m last year and about Pounds 50m this year. However, the collapse in the scientific instruments business forced the board's hand. Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals managing director, insists the division is sustainable. He has launched a cost-cutting programme called 'funding Fisons' future'. Its initial aim is to cut 15 per cent from fixed costs, saving Pounds 25m a year by 1996. Provisions of Pounds 10m will be made in 1994 and Pounds 5m in 1995 and there should be a net benefit in each year, according to Mr Egan. He insists the company has cleared out the stables and management can now take a firm grip. But management protests that the pharmaceuticals business is sustainable are open to question. The division's new product, Tilade, has proved a disappointment in Europe, it has no product in late-stage development, and it has not been able to obtain compounds from other sources. The obvious answer is a merger or takeover by another company. One option is for a Japanese drugs group, anxious to acquire development expertise and distribution in the US and Europe, to approach Fisons. The timing is awkward, though, because of Japan's recession. Nevertheless, with Fisons' share price cheaper than at any point in a decade, a suitor may emerge. Otherwise it is difficult to see how this former fertilisers group can escape from the mire. Lex, Page 18; SmithKline Beecham drug approval, Page 21; Capital Markets, Page 28</p>

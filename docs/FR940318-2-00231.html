			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A ``qualified stock index'' is defined to be a stock index that includes one or more Nasdaq National Market securities, provided that more than 10% of the weight of the index is accounted for by Nasdaq National Market securities. The amendment also provides that a qualified stock index shall be reviewed as of the end of each calendar quarter, and the index shall cease to qualify if the value of the index represented by one or more Nasdaq National Market securities is less than 8% at the end of any subsequent calendar quarter. In this connection, the NASD has proposed the 10% minimum requirement for qualified stock indexes to help ensure that exempted short sales effected by index options market makers are in fact the result of legitimate hedging needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, an index options market maker would become a ``qualified options market maker'' for certain classes of stock index options only if it has received an appointment as such from a qualified options exchange. In this regard, the rule is designed to ensure that only those index options market makers who regularly engage in making markets in options classes overlying indexes containing Nasdaq-listed securities are designated as qualified options market makers. Specifically, before an options exchange can become a qualified options exchange, it must have rules in place to identify and designate as qualified options market makers those market makers who regularly engage in market making activities in particular options classes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the equity options market maker exemption, the NASD also has proposed that the index options market maker exemption shall only be in effect for an eighteen-month pilot period. Throughout this eighteen-month period, the NASD will review and analyze with the options exchanges whether the exemption is resulting in destabilizing trading in Nasdaq stocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the NASD notes that the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, which provides for the sharing of surveillance information between the exchanges and the NASD, may assist in evaluating possibly manipulative activity and other possibly destabilizing short selling activity by qualified options market makers and other options market makers in Nasdaq securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD also is proposing four other amendments to its short-sale rule. First, the NASD proposes to amend its short sale rule to provide that all market maker exemptions from the rule are uniform in duration. Specifically, under the proposal, the exemptions afforded qualified Nasdaq market makers, Nasdaq warrant market makers, and qualified options market makers all will expire eighteen months after the effective date of the NASD's short sale rule. Previously, only the options market maker exemption was proposed on a pilot basis. With all of the market maker exemptions expiring simultaneously, the NASD believes it will be better able to evaluate and respond to the market impacts, if any, resulting from these exemptions. Accordingly, prior to the termination of the eighteen-month pilot period, the NASD will evaluate whether these exemptions should be extended, modified, approved on a permanent basis, or terminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the NASD is clarifying that transactions by options market makers and warrant market makers unrelated to their normal options/warrant market making activity, such as index arbitrage or risk arbitrage that in either case is independent of an options/warrant market maker's market making functions, will not be considered a hedging transaction for purposes of the options/warrant market maker exemption from the NASD's short-sale rule. Amendment No. 4 to the short sale rule provided that Nasdaq market makers will not be able to avail themselves of an exemption from the short sale rule for ``transactions unrelated to normal market making activity, such as index arbitrage and risk arbitrage that is independent from a member's market making functions *&blank;*&blank;*''. Thus, this amendment merely extends to options and warrant market makers the same restriction that already applies to Nasdaq market makers. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The NASD also would like to correct an error that was made in the filing for Amendment No. 4 concerning the entitlement of a Nasdaq market maker to an exemption from the NASD's short sale rule when the risk arbitrage department of a firm takes over the firm's market making functions after the announcement of a merger or acquisition. Specifically, the filing stated that ``registered Nasdaq market makers that qualify for the exemption according to the standards of Sections 46 and 47 would relinquish their market making exemption if the risk arbitrage department of the firm took over the market making functions after the announcement of a merger or acquisition.'' Instead, the filing should have stated that the firm would not have to relinquish its market maker exemption if the risk arbitrage department continued to engage in bona fide market making and the firm continued to qualify for an exemption for that issue under sections 46 and 47 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice. To the extent that the risk arbitrage department effected risk arbitrage transactions unrelated to bona fide market making activity, however, the exemption would not be available for those transactions. (As discussed below, the NASD proposes to renumber Sections 46 and 47 upon approval of this filing.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japanese support for lifting of rice ban NEARLY two-thirds of the Japanese public thinks Japan either will or must end its ban on imported rice, according to a newspaper survey. Among the justifications given for an open market were more choice for consumers, cheaper rice and an improved international image. This throws doubt on government claims that it would be politically difficult to replace the import ban with tariffs, a condition for concluding the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Government officials say they will feel under no pressure to decide until the EC and the US settle their differences over farm subsidies, another big barrier to a Gatt deal. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, is thought likely to leave a final decision until close to the December 15 deadline for concluding the talks. Japan's ability to sustain self-sufficiency in rice has thrown into question in the past few weeks by the worst harvest since the war, which has obliged it to import rice for the first time in nine years.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is finalizing the requirement that nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers and importers use certified nonroad engines. EPA believes that the most effective way to ensure that certified engines are used in nonroad vehicles and equipment is to require such engines to be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the May 17, 1993 NPRM, EPA stated that CAA section 213 provides authority to require nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers to use certified nonroad engines. However, EPA did not propose such a requirement. Instead, EPA requested comment on how it might assure that only certified nonroad engines be used in nonroad vehicles and equipment. EPA received comments on this issue from a State and an environmental association. Both comments requested that nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers be required to use certified nonroad engines. One comment agreed that EPA has authority under CAA section 213 to establish such a requirement, and the other pointed out that the entire program would be undercut without such a requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the October 4, 1993 notice, EPA proposed requiring nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers and importers to use certified nonroad engines. EPA received 12 comments on this issue, from six companies, four industry associations, one State, and one environmental association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters opposed the establishment of this requirement. One company argued that failure to require use of certified engines would not undercut the program because engine inventories are already kept to a minimum as their purchase is a significant investment. An association argued that without a technical support document and regulatory language, it could not comment meaningfully.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA disagrees that industry inventory control practices can take the place of a requirement that certified nonroad engines be used in nonroad vehicles and equipment. Without a requirement that certified engines be used, nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers would be free to use uncertified engines, thus undermining the environmental and public health benefits of the nonroad large CI engine emission reduction program. EPA is not requiring vehicle or equipment manufacturers to be responsible for certification or performance of nonroad engines; that is the responsibility of the engine manufacturer. The final regulations merely prohibit nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers from using uncertified nonroad engines in their nonroad vehicles and equipment. Violation of this prohibition would be a violation of CAA section 203(a), and would subject nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers to sanctions under sections 204 and 205. EPA does not agree that the October 4, 1993 notice was so lacking in specificity as to require reproposal. In fact, this prohibition was clearly discussed in the October 4 notice. EPA does not find regulatory language regarding prohibited acts to have been required in the October 4 notice because such language would have only restated the requirement that nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers must use certified nonroad engines. That requirement was clearly spelled out in the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters agreed with the requirement. Of the two companies that supported the requirement, one stated that the responsibility of vehicle and equipment manufacturers should be limited to assuring that engines have emission compliance labels, and that engine manufacturers should be responsible for certification, testing, audits, warranty, and recall. A State that supported the requirement said it is the only way to ensure that certified engines are used. An environmental association said the requirement should improve the enforceability of the rule. EPA agrees with these comments. The nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturer is responsible only for assuring that certified engines are used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters neither agreed nor disagreed with the requirement but raised questions regarding it. Several commenters asked about the use of noncertified engines built prior to the implementation dates of this regulation. Several commenters requested implementation dates for vehicles and equipment, to provide sufficient lead time for engine manufacturers to produce certified engines for vehicle and equipment manufacturers to use. Two commenters stated that an implementation date for engine manufacturers was sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is not establishing separate implementation dates for nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers. However, EPA recognizes that certified engines are not likely to be available in the numbers needed by nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers on the implementation date, and that vehicle and equipment manufacturers will continue to use noncertified engines built prior to the implementation date until noncertified engine inventories are used up and certified engines are available. As long as vehicle and equipment manufacturers do not inventory engines outside of normal business practices (that is, as long as they do not stockpile noncertified engines), vehicle and equipment manufacturers will be considered to be in compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BECKER BOUNCES LENDL TO WIN HIS FIRST U.S. OPEN  </P> <P> Boris Becker of West Germany won his first U.S. Open on Sunday, staking claim  to the world's No. 1 ranking by beating top-seeded Ivan Lendl, 7-6, 1-6, 6-3,  7-6.  </P> <P> In blistering heat that had Becker frequently icing his legs and eating fruit  during breaks, the second seed from West Germany took his fourth Grand Slam  title. He won his third Wimbledon crown in July.  </P> <P> Becker's double success won't be enough to lift him past Lendl in the computer  rankings. But his strong serve and improved court command were enough to  outlast the three-time Open champion in the 3-hour, 51-minute battle in  temperatures that reached 110 degrees on the court.  </P> <P> For Lendl, it was a second straight long and disappointing Open final. After  winning three straight titles from 1985-87, Lendl lost in five sets to Mats  Wilander last year, surrendering the top ranking that he soon recaptured.  </P> <P> Becker, 21, now has won four consecutive meetings with the 29-year-old Lendl.  They are 7-7 lifetime.  </P> <P> Becker's win gave West Germany a sweep of the singles championships at  Wimbledon and the Open. Steffi Graf also won both.  </P> <P> It was Becker's first Grand Slam final anywhere but Wimbledon. His best  previous showing at the Open was the semifinals in 1986.  </P> <P> Lendl tied an Open record with his eighth consecutive final, something Bill  Tilden did from 1918-25. The Czech, who now lives in Greenwich, Conn., less  than an hour from the National Tennis Center, lost to Jimmy Connors twice, John  McEnroe once and Wilander in previous Open finals.  </P> <P> Becker won $300,000, while Lendl earned $150,000.  </P> <P> After Becker took a 5-0 lead in the the first-set tiebreaker and won 7-2, Lendl  easily took the second set. But Becker got a decisive break in the eighth game  of the third set -- just after Lendl had broken his serve -- to take a two sets  to one lead.  </P> <P> Becker was up a break point in the fourth set, but couldn't hold serve in the  eighth game. They went to another tiebreaker, which Becker won on a service  winner 7-4 after losing the first two points.  </P> <P> Becker, who had 11 aces and 11 double-faults, became the first German to win  the American championship. With a section of fans shouting, "Boris, Boris,"  Becker stood at the baseline with his hands raised high after winning the  title.  </P> <P> The West German nearly was out of the tournament in the second round. He was  down two match points to Derrick Rostagno, but rallied to win with the help of  a timely netcord.  </P> <P> Against Lendl, Becker grabbed a 3-0 lead, holding serve in a nine-minute game  before breaking Lendl in another long game. Lendl double-faulted on break  point.  </P> <P> But Lendl came right back, winning the next three games and holding two break  points in the seventh game. Becker saved those and a service winner gave him a  4-3 lead.  </P> <P> They each held serve into the tiebreaker, which Becker dominated. He won the  first five points, Lendl took two, then a pair of nice cross-court backhands  clinched the 76-minute set for Becker.  </P> <P> Lendl broke in the fourth and sixth games to easily take the second set in 28  minutes, but Becker won the first three games of the third set. Already  bleeding mildly on the right leg from an earlier spill, Becker also began icing  his legs early in the third.  </P> <P> Lendl came back in the seventh game as Becker hit several sloppy approach  shots. Becker responded with another break, then held a set point, which Lendl  saved with a forehand passing shot. Becker set up another set point with his  ninth ace and a service winner ended the 43-minute set.  </P> <P> Trailing two sets to one, Lendl immediately broke serve, only to see Becker  come right back to win the game with superb net play.  </P> <P> Becker then won the next three games, but Lendl surged back, breaking in the  eighth game with two terrific backhand passes to even the set at 4-4. They held  serve into the final tiebreaker.  </P></p>

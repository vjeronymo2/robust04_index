			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the political department under the rubric "Press </F> Digest. Elections-94": "Right, Left--Which Side?"]    [Text] The weekly TSARA published in its 23 November  issue a report from the press bureau of the Khynshet division of  the KhDNF [Christian Democratic People's Front]. It says:    "On 17 November the chairman of the Khynshet ispolkom  [executive committee], Ion Donica, called together a limited  number of individuals with leadership (and influential)  functions in the rayon and also leaders of a number of villages  and called for them to do everything within their power along  with their relatives, loved ones, friends, and subordinates to  block the Alliance of the KhDNF in this campaign.    Following the example of the rayon "head," the village mayor  Mindzhir, a lawyer by profession, in violation of Article 14 of  the Law on Elections to Parliament, arbitrarily, without  convening a village council for this purpose, formed local  electoral commissions which included a good part of the brigade  leaders of the farms--the most conservative elements, including  the last secretary of the local party organization. On 18  November early in the morning, at a meeting of workers of the  Mindzhir agricultural firm, he made public a list of members of  precinct electoral commissions. When the violation of the Law on  Elections to Parliament was pointed out to him, the mayor  responded that the workers of the agricultural firm had been  informed of them by way of a discussion.    Violations of this kind were committed by the mayor of the  village of Serata Galbene as well.    The same newspaper printed an article by the candidate from  the Alliance KhDNF electoral block, Eugeniu Garla. The author  presents the main aspects of Moldovan-Romanian integration: The  strategic basis of economic integration of the Republic of  Moldova and Romania is the existence of a common economic space,  which will provide for: free movement of the work force,  capital, goods, and services; functioning of the  financial-currency complex because of the unification of  financial-currency, tax, banking, pricing, and rate system; and  simultaneous implementation of economic reforms and joint  implementation of the economic and social policy.    The achievement of this goal will create the conditions for  stable development of the economies of the two Romanian states  based on market relations.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   The chairman of the Democratic Labor Party, Aleksandr  Arseni,  also thinks that "relations with Romania must be strengthened  and deepened." This is how he responded to a question from a  DELOVAYA GAZETA correspondent:    "We do not think that the Sangheli cabinet has done anything  to introduce our country into the world community. Moreover, the  leaders of Moldova have an especially kindly attitude toward the  CIS. This is the only place where they can see the republic's  salvation. They frequently cry on our shoulder and ask for  things. But our party thinks that too much significance is being  attached to the role of the CIS in the life of Moldova. With a  different policy we could quite easily change our economic  orientation and achieve success in economic management.    "Unfortunately, the present prime minister of Moldova is not  distinguished by his new thinking and is not prepared for this  kind of dialogue with the world community. We are looking  exclusively to the East. Yet there are people in the republic  who have assimilated this thinking. Including in our party. The  future is with them!"  <H6>  * * * </H6>   A well-known deputy, a member of the ADPN [Agrarian  Democratic Party of Moldova], Nicolae Andronic, granted an  interview to the weekly ZEMLYA I LYUDI. Here is how he views the  situation that has developed in the republic:    "Of course, I attribute all problems--economic, political,  and others--to the fact that we do not now have unity of all  political forces regarding the question of statehood. When all  political forces are sincerely striving to create and strengthen  the independence of one republic or another, when there is  understanding of the fact that it is possible to maneuver, it is  possible to join one bloc or another and then leave, but the  main goal is to preserve independence. Take, for example, the  Baltics. Regardless of their leanings--slants--all political  parties of the Baltic region have the same center. And this  center is independence. It is from here that the spiral  develops. But what do we have here? Some see a panacea in one  thing, some in another, and still others in something else. The  political forces of the republic are fragmented and dispersed.  Some are afraid of strong influence from the East, others--of  strong influence from Romania. And all this is solely because of  political skirmishes, for the republic's independence is seen by  various people and various political parties from various  angles."  <H6>  * * * </H6>   A preelection address was delivered by the Socialist Party  and the Unity Movement for Equal Rights, who are forming an  electoral bloc:    "PRESERVE AND DEVELOP the historically formed COMMON VALUES  of our society--interethnic peace and harmony, territorial  integrity, fraternal cooperation among people of various  nationalities, national public ownership of the land, natural  resources, large basic branches of industrial and agricultural  production, efficient centralized administration of the national  economic complex, mutually advantageous cooperation with all  fraternal republics of the former USSR.    "Our most important COMMON VALUE is the MOLDOVAN LANGUAGE  and  we must do everything possible to make sure that it is  voluntarily mastered by all citizens of Moldova. A no less  important COMMON VALUE is the bilingualism that has developed,  especially in the cities, and extensive use of the RUSSIAN  LANGUAGE, which almost all people living in Moldova have  mastered.    "Still an indisputable COMMON VALUE is the worker, the  person  employed in socially useful labor in the spheres of material and  nonmaterial production and the sphere of labor itself.  Thoughtless, hasty reform in this sphere on the basis of  neocapitalistic ideas is a crime.    "An enduring COMMON VALUE has been and will be the history  of  Moldova, including its Soviet period, which is characterized by  rapid, historically unprecedented rates of socioeconomic  development, the creation of the industrial and agrarian  complexes, and the establishment of its science and systems of  education, public health, and culture.    "To RESTORE and DEVELOP these unjustifiably lost COMMON  VALUES, and above all those such as full, universal employment  without degrading the human dignity of unemployment, which  entire generations of workers have not known, a guarantee of job  placement for all graduates of schools, vocational and technical  schools, and secondary and higher educational institutions,  unconditional and effective social protection of pensioners,  children, and youth, large families and disabled persons, free  education and medical service, legal protection, a state program  for housing construction and provision of housing,  representation of all social groups in legislative organs at all  levels, public monitoring of the activity of the executive  power, and elections of judges and people's assessors."</p>

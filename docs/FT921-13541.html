			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris feasts on food and drink as bidders emerge DOMESTIC matters were more important than international influences in continental trading yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS continued to focus on the food industry where, for once, takeover speculation became reality. The CAC 40 index rose 5.90 to 1,865.85 in turnover of FFr2.2bn after Friday's FFr2.9bn. Shares in the mineral water company Perrier and the holding company Exor were suspended at Friday's close of FFr1,396 and FFr1,320 respectively as Nestle and Suez made aFFr1,475-per-share bid for Perrier, fanning speculation of a counterbid from the Agnelli family and its allies. News that Nestle and Suez had taken legal action to review the recent sale of Perrier's treasury stock to the Agnelli camp indicated that the shares would remain suspended for quite a while. Meanwhile, BSN jumped FFr14 to FFr1,154 with a heavy 312,600 shares traded on continued rumours that the Agnellis would make a bid for the food giant. Among other gainers, Lyonnaise-Dumez added FFr16 or 3.5 per cent to FFr474 with 147,782 shares traded as the market acknowledged that it had misread last week's results. Paribas, which fell 7.3 per cent on Friday on news of big provisions for Maxwell loans, recouped FFr14 or 4.2 per cent to FFr344 with 84,550 shares traded. One of the day's prominent losers was Euro Disney which fell FFr6.20 or 4 per cent to traded after several UK newspapers said that the shares were overvalued. MADRID continued to descend, the general index closing 1.28 lower at 252.64. Fecsa rose Pta2 to Pta704 after a placing of 3.055m shares, about 1 1/2 per cent of the equity in the electrical utility. Schroder Securities took the block out of Spain and placed it with institutions in London at a price of Pta718 a share against Friday's Pta702. Mr Miguel Olabarri of Schroder said the placing represented about four weeks' volume in Fecsa, and that the premium was partly due to the availability of stock, Fecsa's above-average cash generation in a highly leveraged sector and its dividend prospects between now and 1994. MILAN eased as operators took the view that the recent rally had been overdone. The Comit index fell 1.86 to 546.25. Problems with the screen-based trading system restricted volume to around L100bn from Friday's L140bn. One of the day's big losers was Sip which fell L38 or 2.5 per cent to L1,458 in heavy trading of 2.1m shares. Analysts said that they had expected profit-taking to emerge after the stock reached L1,500 last week. Furthermore, the industry reform approved by parliament, also last week, is expected to take the edge off Sip's performance. Talk of a large buy order in Generali out of London lifted the share off the day's low of L30,200 to an official close of L30,460, up L95 from Friday. The stock then hit L30,600 on the kerb. Among industrials, Pirelli fell L58 or 4.5 per cent to L1,222 ahead of an extraordinary meeting later in the day to approve the tyre and cable's group L526bn capital increase. FRANKFURT had a late rise on a fall in west German wholesale prices of 0.7 per cent in December from November, renewing hopes of an interest rate cut later this year. The DAX index rose 6.18 to 1,677.17, after a 1.58 fall to 677.06 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume fell from DM8.2bn to DM6.2bn. Siemens and Deutsche Bank led the intraday rally, rising DM4.50 to DM656.10 and DM6.50 to DM704.70 respectively. Siemens gained on news of large telecommunications orders from Syria, Iran and Kuwait. AMSTERDAM was depressed by the weaker dollar but most stocks recovered from their day's lows on foreign buying interest. The CBS Tendency Index closed 0.7 lower at 119.8. The truck manufacturer DAF gained 50 cents or 2.1 per cent to Fl 24.40 on hopes of a recovery in UK truck sales later this year. BRUSSELS saw preferred shares in the chemical group Gechem jump BFr35 or 10.3 per cent to BFr375 in speculative trading as 88,000 shares changed hands. The Bel-20 index closed up 5.31 at 1,161.81 in turnover of BFr751m. STOCKHOLM put banks up 3.2 per cent and the forestry sector by 1.4 per cent as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 7.0, or 0.7 per cent higher at 989.2. SE-Banken rose SKr2 to SKr50. Dealers said that banks had simply been laggards, but that forestry stocks reflected speculation that pulp and paper prices are on the way up. ISTANBUL fell 3.7 per cent after the unveiling of a government economic plan on Saturday that dealers said was in line with expectations but would take time to implement. The 75-share index fell 183.14 to 4,817.02.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100 - Jan 20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1129.17  1130.04  1132.37  1132.32  1133.12  1135.05  1136.03  1135.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High   1137.19     Day's Low   1128.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Jan 17     Jan 16     Jan 15     Jan 14     Jan 13 1135.24    1131.02    1140.52    1112.87     1105.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Denmark plunged into crisis as PM quits over scandal: Schluter criticised for misinforming parliament on Tamil refugees affair DENMARK, current holder of the European Community presidency, was thrown into political crisis yesterday when Mr Poul Schluter, prime minister since 1982, announced his resignation after a judicial inquiry savagely criticised him for misinforming parliament. Mr Schluter, 63, the leader of the Conservative party, gave the Folketing, Denmark's parliament, misleading and incorrect information in 1989 on a scandal surrounding the government's attitude to Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka, and he must have known this, said the report released yesterday. Mr Schluter nominated Mr Henning Dyremose, finance minister in the minority Conservative-Liberal coalition government, to succeed him. But it was increasingly doubtful last night that Mr Dyremose could win majority support. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the opposition Social Democratic party, called for the establishment of a broad coalition. Negotiations between party leaders for a new government were also demanded by the Radical Liberals and the Centre Democrats, two small parties which have hitherto supported Mr Schluter's government. Constitutional experts said a general election was unlikely, and could only be called once a new prime minister was installed. The next election is not due until the end of 1994. The upheaval could complicate plans for a second referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union, although Danish officials insisted yesterday a switch of government would not harm prospects for Maastricht since seven of the eight parliamentary parties support the treaty after the special deal on opt-outs agreed at the Edinburgh summit last month. Last June, Danish voters narrowly rejected Maastricht in a referendum. In London, Downing Street said there was no reason to suppose Mr Schluter's resignation would significantly affect the timing of the second Danish referendum on Maastricht, even if it led to an election. Nonetheless the timing is awkward for British ratification as MPs are in the middle of detailed discussion of the bill to approve Maastricht. Diplomats and Commission officials in Brussels said they believed the resignation would not have a dramatic effect on the smooth running of the Danish presidency of the EC, which ends in June. Most refused to commit themselves until it was clear how the government crisis would be resolved. A spokesman for Mr Hans van den Broek, the EC's new commissioner for external relations, would say only that 'it's not clear yet what the implications are'. An Irish diplomat said it would be difficult for someone to step into Mr Schluter's shoes in the EC presidency, given the personalised nature of the job. 'Obviously for someone to change in midstream isn't desirable, because you are losing the preparation that the original people have done in the run-up to the presidency,' he said. Ahead of the news, the Copenhagen all-share index dipped 2.39 points to 263.73 yesterday, but government bond prices remained stable. The resignation also came too late to affect the krone in European foreign exchange trading. But there have been concerns in recent days that a political crisis could undermine the currency, which is already close to its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism. After opening in London at DKr3.8615 to the D-Mark, the krone weakened in the morning in Europe to about DKr3.8750 as the contents of the Tamilgate report filtered out. After the resignation announcement, it was quoted at DKr3.8646 at lunchtime in the US, compared with its ERM floor of DKr3.9016. Mr Schluter was only one victim of yesterday's report. The Speaker of the Folketing, Mr HP Clausen, also resigned, while several senior civil servants may face disciplinary action.

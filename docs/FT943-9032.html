			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Good rally after favourable US consumer data - Market Report The UK stock market staged a highly successful recovery yesterday afternoon as a rally in bond prices followed the announcement of satisfactory US consumer price statistics. Early trading saw the London market down by more than 27 points on the FT-SE 100 Index but there was little sign of the selling pressure feared in the wake of Thursday's interest rate rises in Europe. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 4.1 up on the day at 3,142.3. The recapture of the Footsie 3,140 mark was acclaimed by some equity chartists who now see the market in safer territory than seemed likely at the close of the previous session. In very late trading, the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index reached 3,166, breaking above another important support level. The Footsie had touched 3,110.7 yesterday morning, kindling fears that 3,100 might be challenged. The initial setback was influenced in part by awareness that a heavy seller of stock index futures at Thursday's close was still in the wings. British government bonds were also weak during the first half of the session. Equity marketmaking firms were inclined to mark share prices lower while waiting to see what the leading strategists would make of the rate rises in Italy and Sweden. Kleinwort Benson Securities commented that 'tightening jitters (on the turn in interest rates) will affect the Continent more than the UK'. Ratings on UK equities are seen to be less demanding than in the other leading European markets. Many analysts stressed the benefits for UK shares of the rapid growth in corporate earnings now flowing through. Such views were buttressed yesterday by unexpectedly good trading figures for the second quarter from Unilever, the food to detergents group. However, most strategists agreed that the 'interest rate cycle is now turning in Europe'. The recovery spread across the full range of the stock market, leaving the FT-SE Mid 250 Index with a gain of 2.2 at 3,728.8. Trading volume, as measured by the Exchange's Seaq electronic network, remained high, with 640.3m shares traded compared with 694.4m on Thursday when retail or genuine investment business of Pounds 1.36m remained within the range of recent daily averages. Good trading volume has continued to underpin the stock market Interest-related stocks suffered, at worst, only minor falls and some moved higher. The blue-chip internationals were restrained by weakness in the US dollar but steadied before the close as the currency steadied, with the oil stocks firm. The regional electricity stocks continued to forge ahead, extending the gains which followed the announcement on Thursday of what has been seen as an extremely favourable price review - from the point of view of the companies. The Footsie Index was boosted by the strong gain in shares of Unilever, and also in Reckitt &amp; Colman which rose in sympathy. The Footsie Index has lost 25.2 over the week, with virtually all the loss coming in the wake of the rate increases in Sweden and Italy. The focus has now turned to next Tuesday's meeting of the US Federal Open Market Committee. The rise of only 0.3 per cent in US July consumer price index announced yesterday appeared to leave open the question of whether inflationary pressures are sufficient to alarm the US authorities and cause them to tighten credit policies again. Short-dated UK gilts, which are the most closely linked to base rate expectations, closed some  7/32 lower but had  3/8 off. Longer dates, encouraged by the US bond market, recovered more strongly and closed a shade higher on the day - regarded as no mean achievement against the present uncertain background on interest rates.</p>

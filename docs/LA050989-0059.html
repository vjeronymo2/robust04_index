			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOO WANTS TO REPLACE HOLLYWOOD CITIZENS PANEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo will ask the council today to abolish  the contentious citizens advisory committee on Hollywood redevelopment and  replace it with a panel he would appoint, Woo told The Times on Monday.  </P> <P> The action is certain to set off a tumultuous new round in the protracted fight  over renewal of the faded movie capital, which has pitted Woo and the Community  Redevelopment Agency against a group of anti-redevelopment activists.  </P> <P> For several years, critics of the 1.7-square-mile redevelopment area have used  the panel, the Project Area Committee, to air their complaints and fears. In  December, elections to the committee gave critics a clear majority on the panel  for the first time.  </P> <P> Last week, defiant committee members voted to sue the city if the council votes  to disband the group. Orry P. Korb, the committee's attorney, said Monday that  he has been authorized to go to court as soon as the council moves to do away  with the group.  </P> <P> "They are free to sue," Woo said in an interview. "I basically don't care. The  important thing for us is to continue the momentum for the redevelopment  process."  </P> <P> Under state law, the Community Redevelopment Agency is required to consult with  the Project Area Committee only during the first three years of the  redevelopment project. The three-year period expired Monday. After that, the  City Council can extend the committee's life for one-year intervals or simply  allow the committee to expire.  </P> <P> But opponents of the redevelopment effort point to a provision in the Hollywood  Redevelopment Plan that states the Community Redevelopment Agency must consult  with the committee on "activities . . . pertaining to implementation" of the  plan.  </P> <P> Korb interprets that to mean that the committee must remain in existence during  the 30-year life of the plan. Attorneys for the city and the agency, however,  say the provision does not require consultation beyond the three years provided  by state law.  </P> <P> The committee reviews various aspects of the redevelopment effort, including  proposed traffic and urban design plans as well as some individual projects. It  makes recommendations to the CRA board of commissioners but has no official  decision-making powers.  </P> <P> In proposing the overhaul, Woo said he wants to give Hollywood redevelopment "a  fresh start" by appointing a panel he can work with. Woo has characterized the  Project Area Committee as "an official forum for wacky behavior," a reference  to the group's reputation as rowdy and largely unproductive.  </P> <P> Woo appoints four members of the Project Area committee, but the others are  elected by residents, property owners and local businesses. Woo's new panel --  the Hollywood Community Advisory Council -- would have 11 members, all  appointed by Woo. He said he would name the new committee members in July.  </P> <P> "Given the disastrous consequences of the election process in the past, I  didn't think it was worth institutionalizing that process in this new  arrangement," Woo said. "The advantage provided here is that it enables me to  have a citizens advisory committee which I will be able to work closely with.  And I will be able to find panel members whose views on transportation or  economic development or urban design are compatible with my own."  </P> <P> Woo's action does have precedence. In 1985, Councilman Gilbert Lindsay replaced  the Chinatown Project Area Committee with an appointed body. Woo hinted as  early as January that he was considering following in Lindsay's footsteps. His  foes in Hollywood complained then that an appointed committee would simply  become a rubber stamp for the councilman and would deny a cross section of  Hollywood residents -- in particular, Woo adversaries -- a role in the  community's future.  </P> <P> "It is a raucous group because that is the nature of the Hollywood community,"  said Korb, who was hired by the Project Area Committee in January. "For better  or worse, this PAC is representative. . . . Any effort by the city and the CRA  to limit the PAC is a statement that they do not want to hear all the voices in  Hollywood."  </P> <P> Woo said Monday that he will introduce his resolution to disband the Project  Area Committee at today's council meeting.  </P></p>

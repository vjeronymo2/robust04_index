			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (9): China becomes a competitor - Japan's biggest neighbour offers openings and challenges WHEN the Japan Cotton Spinners' Association began collecting information this month in an attempt to prove that Chinese manufacturers were dumping fabric in the Japanese market, it was also gathering evidence that economic and political ties between the two countries are changing. The cotton spinners complain that Chinese producers are damaging their industry by exporting materials for 30 to 40 per cent less than the selling price of the domestic product, echoing the past concerns of US producers about lower-cost Japanese textile exports in the early days of the economic rise from the wartime rubble. Japanese government officials are embarrassed by the cotton case, as they are leading the debate over reform of anti-dumping procedures, often used to keep markets closed to more competitive products. But the emerging might of China has already prompted Tokyo to be the aggressor for the first time, imposing penalties this year on Chinese exporters of ferrosilicon manganese, which is used in steel production. These cases highlight the ambivalence of Japanese industry towards China. The Chinese market provides remarkable opportunities for export growth, particularly compared with the sluggish demand from other international markets and the declining demand at home, where companies have excess production capacity after a capital spending surge during the late 1980s. However, the improvement in the Chinese production quality, often aided by the transfer of Japanese technology and expertise, has already undermined the profitability of textile producers and other industries are conscious of a threat from China. Garment makers in Kyushu, in the south, estimate that two-thirds of their number will be forced to close factories by the end of next year. In the first half, Japan's exports to China rose 51.2 per cent from a year earlier, with exports of cars six times larger and those of television cameras increasing fourfold, while exports of steel, communications equipment, motorcycles and construction equipment all doubled. Over the same period, China's exports to Japan expanded 15.2 per cent, with a tripling of office machinery exports, most made in Japanese-run joint venture factories. The increasing Japanese business confidence in China's economic refroms has coincided with the need for Japanese manufacturers to reduce costs to improve profitability after three years of falling earnings. Combined with the lure of China's domestic demand, companies have concluded that the conditions are finally right for direct investments that they were reluctant to make in the past. Last year, Japanese direct investment in China doubled and, in recent months, a company has announced a new factory, outlet or partnership in China each day. Nissan Motor has just formed a joint venture to produce jet looms in Shenyang, in the north, while Toshiba has stretched its service network by opening new branches in Jinan, in the east, and Kunming, in the south-west. The interest extends to securities houses. Nomura Securities, the country's largest broker, has been chosen as lead manager for the Hong Kong listing of Dongfang Electric, a mainland power company based in Sichuan province. Nomura, cutting employees in Europe, has increased its Asia department personnel from 580 to 616 over the past year and shifted the operation's base to Hong Kong from Tokyo. Mr Hideo Sakamaki, Nomura's president, said cultivating business in China takes longer than elsewhere: 'You need a long-term perspective. Over a decade or two decades you can build a human network - that is how you do business in that country.' Not every Japanese company has the patience or the funds to wait so long for a return, and there is concern in Tokyo that the measures taken by Beijing to cool an overheating economy could lessen the short-term opportunities to profit from China. An official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said past attempts to reassert control of the economy have been heavy handed, and it remains to be seen if Beijing has learned from those errors. The tangible power of the emerging China has also stirred debate in Tokyo on whether Chinese political and military influence in the region will also be overwhelming. Japanese defence analysts have advised the government to take more interest in the consequences of rising Chinese military spending and weapons renovation. Publicly, Japanese officials are careful not to offend China, but, in private, they suggest that US concerns about the expansion of Japanese influence in Asia should be redirected to the rapid growth of Chinese influence in the region. One finance ministry official complained that the US is 'looking in the wrong direction when they worry about a yen bloc in Asia', and should pay 'far more attention to the changes in China'. Within the foreign ministry, which would like Japan to take an active role in the international arms debate, there is division over whether pressure should be applied to China on military issues, backed by the implied threat that the flow of Japanese financial assistance could slow if Beijing does not exercise restraint. In the past, Tokyo has not wanted to tackle China on sensitive political issues. Japanese officials have been reluctant to express clear support for the proposed expansion of democracy in Hong Kong and, in private meetings with Chinese, are said to express dismay that the UK is creating 'instability' in the territory. But the emerging strength of China has not only ruffled the cotton spinners; it is also forcing the Japanese government to redefine a relationship partly based on the idea that Tokyo could score points with Beijing by 'representing' its interests in international gatherings and ensuring that China would not be 'isolated'. Dealing with an increasingly confident China will be less simple in the future, and the Japanese government will need to develop a broader set of principles that takes into account demands ranging from its own ambitions for a higher profile in Asia to the interests of the cotton spinners.</p>

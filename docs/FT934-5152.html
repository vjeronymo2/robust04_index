			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Small businesses Mr Clarke clearly has a bee in his bonnet about small businesses. There was a welter of measures to help them including, after years of lobbying, the possibility of interest charges on the late payment of bills. Equity capital may also be raised through a replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme and, in time, via venture capital investment trusts. It will be interesting to see whether the Enterprise Investment Scheme is any more successful than BES at attracting genuine risk capital. Even before industrial companies were crowded out of the BES market by assured tenancies, the thrust of the BES was to construct low risk ways to exploit the tax advantage. The new EIS attempts to avoid that by lowering the entry tax relief but reducing the cost of failure by granting tax losses. Yet there are inherent difficulties with direct investment in this area, not least the high failure rate which requires a well-analysed portfolio and the provision of exit routes from those investments which do survive. Even the new scheme is thus not suitable for most private investors, and may not raise the desired cash for small businesses. Perhaps the best use for the EIS will be in encouraging successful entrepreneurs to reinvest their profits in a new venture and add their experience to the board. That gives plenty of room for abuse, but the lack of management skills in small companies is every bit as important as the dearth of equity finance.</p>

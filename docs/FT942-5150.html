			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: New York US bond prices proved more resilient than the European capital markets which were battered by fears of rising inflation last week. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended the week a point higher than it began it after the market took an optimistic view of mixed signals from Friday's employment data. If US bond prices are more stable than European ones, it is because they have suffered months of downward pressure. This was caused by fears that the US economy was growing too quickly, culminating in last month's half-point increase in interest rates. Now, they are looking for a fresh direction. This may not be the week in which they get it. Although data for instalment credit and capital spending are due out tomorrow and Thursday respectively, the figures that will be most closely watched are those for the May producer price index, due out on Friday. But economists predict that, after the 0.1 per cent decline in April, the index will be barely changed. If so, that would be taken as a sign that inflationary pressures further back in the supply chain remain absent. Even so, stripping out the more volatile prices of food and energy, the index for finished goods may have risen by 0.3 per cent. If the figure is higher than that, it could be a cause for alarm.</p>

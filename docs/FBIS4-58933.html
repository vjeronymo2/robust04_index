			<p>BFN     [Text] [Arab] Member of the Knesset [MK] Talab al-Sani' has  met with Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, a founding member of Hamas, the  Islamic Resistance Movement, at ('Ashmoret) Prison today. Talab  al-Sani' had this to say about the session:    [Begin recording] [Al-Sani'] The meeting follows recent  political developments. This is not the first time I have  called on Shaykh Yasin at the prison. I met with Foreign  Minister Shim'on to press for Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's release  against the background of recent political developments and  Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's deteriorating health.    [Unidentified reporter] Political developments in the peace  process and the Israeli-Palestinian agreement must have come up  during your talk with him. Where does he and the Islamic  movement in general stand on these issues?    [Al-Sani'] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin expressly stated that Hamas  will not use violence to topple the agreements; it will use the  same civilized methods used on the Israeli street. He said the  opposition has the right to express itself. Hamas, said Shaykh  Yasin, will respect the Palestinian police force in that it is  of the Palestinian people. As for the prospects for Shaykh  Yasin's release, he said it is every human being's wish is to be  free and that freedom is a natural right for every human being.  However, he is in detention because he believes in the  Palestinian people's right to freedom. He also argues that  people under occupation are entitled to resist occupation.  Shaykh Yasin said he supports the principle of a just peace  that guarantees the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.  He is opposed to occupation and the shedding of innocent blood  on both sides. [end recording]</p>

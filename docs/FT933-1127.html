			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Underground staff hold strike vote THE RMT transport union is balloting its members on the Central line of the London Underground on a possible 24-hour strike in support of a dismissed colleague. Mr Pat Sikorski, a union activist, was dismissed after alleged threatening behaviour. A preliminary hearing of an industrial tribunal this week made an order forcing London Underground to continue paying him until a final hearing of the case. That could be any time in the next year.</p>

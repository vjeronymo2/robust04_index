			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / No. 10 rallies to Howard after jail Semtex find The prime minister yesterday made it clear that he would continue to back Mr Michael Howard as home secretary following the discovery of Semtex explosive in Whitemoor jail. Downing Street acknowledged that the incident was a matter of concern for the government but stressed that the home secretary continued to enjoy Mr John Major's 'full support'. However, one minister and several backbenchers privately predicted that Mr Howard may be forced to resign. A senior member of the Conservatives' 1922 backbench committee said: 'Unfortunately for Michael (Howard) this is one slip too many. He looks incompetent and may have to go.' Mr John Bartell, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, called on Mr Howard to resign. 'If you worked in one of Britain's prisons today and you had to face the unchecked criminality, the daily violence and the daily breakdown in control, I think you would share our sentiments,' he said. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, urged the prime minister to take control of the situation by replacing Mr Howard as home secretary. The Labour party, however, while critical of Mr Howard's performance, stopped short of calling for his dismissal. Mr Howard said he had no intention of resigning. 'I have a job to do and I'm determined to see it through,' he said. His officials made it clear that he would get to the root of the problem at Whitemoor, the Cambridgeshire prison that was the scene of a failed escape by five IRA terrorists and a convicted armed robber this month. Mr Howard told journalists at Reading University in Berkshire, where he was giving a speech on race relations: 'The Whitemoor incidents are being looked at, a fuller inquiry is taking place and I shall be determined to learn every lesson possible to be learned from it.' The home secretary has faced a series of embarrassing defeats in the Commons this year which have given ammunition to his opponents. Mr Howard was forced to back down on a proposed shake-up of the criminal justice system involving a big increase in the home secretary's influence over police authorities and the introduction of contracts for justices' clerks, who advise magistrates. Conservative peers went on to inflict five significant changes to the criminal justice bill. In the Commons Mr Howard was forced to promise action against violent videos to head off a widely supported amendment by Mr David Alton, the Liberal Democrat MP.</p>

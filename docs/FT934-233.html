			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Researchers identify vital entrepreneurial qualities Researchers at Durham University claim to have identified seven factors which indicate which entrepreneurs have the greatest potential for business success. The seven factors are: Vision - the ability to project an image into the future of where the individual would like their business to be. Need for achievement - motivation to succeed and the ability to set realistic goals and a structure to achieve them. Need for autonomy, but also an ability to accept information and guidance from others. Calculated risk taking - the ability to evaluate risk and plan a strategy to reduce it. Opportunistic tendency - the ability to perceive opportunities for business development within the surrounding environment. Internal locus of control - an acceptance of personal responsibility for the business's performance rather than explaining success or failure by external factors such as luck and chance. Creativity and innovation. The conclusions were gleaned by Durham University Business School from a review of other research and tested on a sample of 16 graduate entrepreneurs and 100 past and present Midlands small businesses. Mr David Johnson, lecturer in entrepreneurship at the school, who directed the research, said: 'It may be crashingly obvious, but people don't seem to use the information.' The challenge, he said, was not only to define the entrepreneurial behaviour which can lead to business success but to devise a way of assessing accurately in what measure people have it and whether it can be developed through training. The initial findings, to be published in early 1994, will be linked to training workshops for users. The aim of the workshops is partly to prevent the seven factors being used as a crude rejection tool.</p>

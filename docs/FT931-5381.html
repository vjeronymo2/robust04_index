			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Italy acts to limit fall-out from corruption scandals ITALY's fragile four-party coalition last night agreed on controversial legislation to limit the political and economic damage of the ever-expanding corruption scandals that started a year ago. The moves, agreed after a day-long cabinet session, centre on a complete overhaul of the funding of political parties and the sanctions attached to illicit contributions. Other measures include more transparent rules for tendering on contracts - the main source of bribes paid to the political parties. In announcing the measures, Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, insisted Italy's political establishment had not agreed to provide an all-embracing amnesty to those politicians, officials and businessmen caught up in the series of scandals. The government said the crime of extortion in particular would still be enforced - where politicians and officials oblige busimessmen to hand over money to obtain contracts. But this extortion is considered by lawyers to be one of the hardest offences to prove. It is also one of the charges which Milan magistrates are seeking to have waived for Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader. Although part of the legislation is in the form of decrees and will have immediate effect, it will still require endorsement by parliament. Such backing is far from guaranteed. Indeed, the government has taken a serious gamble with public opinion and the mood of parliament in promoting the measures which can be a seen as a barely disguised means of providing an honourable exit to a disgraced establishment. It is also far from clear how the judiciary will react. The government argues that the investigations into corruption risked getting out of hand - both in overloading the judiciary and in decapitating the political class. At the same time public works activity has been brought to a near standstill by the scandals. The scandals originated in kick-backs on Milan municipal works contracts but now cover almost every area of public life in the country's main cities. More than 50 parliamentarians are caught up in the affair and two parties' leaders have been forced to resign, including Mr Craxi, of the Socialist party. The new rules on funding political parties make illicit finance a mere misdemeanour sanctioned by harsh fines and disqualification from office. But many of the details still require intricate elaboration. The cabinet failed to agree on changes in the rules on preventive detention, a controversial weapon used by magistrates in the investigations to force confessions. Last night it appeared that the main beneficiaries of the legislation would be those who had already confessed to either paying or receiving bribes connected to party finance. Also those who now come forward could benefit from plea-bargaining.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maribel Osorio] </F>   [Text] Abdon Vivas Teran, president of the Venezuelan  Investment Fund (FIV), has stated that the country's fiscal  situation is much more precarious than what the government  thought two weeks ago. In fact, "an error" by the Ramon J.  Velasquez administration led to a miscalculation in the interest  payments on the foreign debt. In the 1994 budget, the previous  administration estimated a payment of 300 billion bolivares when  the figure truly is 370 billion.    In addition, Vivas Teran explained that 340 billion  bolivares  worth of expenses were not included in the budget. President  Velasquez approved these funds for universities and for an  increase in salaries for public employees. However, the funds  basically had no source of income backing them. Consequently,  they will be cut by nearly 50 percent. This situation prompted  Vivas Teran to say that the fiscal deficit for the public sector  ranges between 8 and 10 percent of the GNP instead of 4 percent  as the Finance Ministry reported.    This means that the fiscal deficit is between 560 and 700  billion bolivares, taking into account that each point of the  GNP is equivalent to 70 billion bolivares.    The FIV president agrees with Finance Minister Julio Sosa  Rodriguez who said the fiscal gap will be reduced to 2 percent  of the GNP by year's end. However, the sources for financing  the budget are limited.    Vivas Teran said he is aware that an estimated 70 billion  bolivares were included in the 1994 budget as an adjustment in  the price of fuel. However, the Caldera government has already  rejected this measure. Furthermore, the crisis in the oil  market will prevent the country from receiving 200-250 billion  bolivares in revenues to the point that the Venezuelan export  package is estimated at $11.50 [as published].    In addition, revenues for 70 billion bolivares were  estimated  through an issuance of Treasury bonds; however, according to  general budget regulations, such a measure can only be applied  when there are no indirect taxes. Privatization cannot be used  as a way to obtain revenues because funds obtained from the sale  of state assets in 1994 can only be used in 1995, but not to  cover regular expenses.    In the face of this, Sosa Rogriguez maintained that the plan  named after him will only generate 150 billion bolivares. The  government will decide on the feasibility of applying a tax on  bank debits within 10 days.    It must be stressed that if bank transactions are taxed, the  government could collect approximately 70 billion bolivares,  which is exactly the amount that was not included in the budget  due to a miscalculation in the foreign debt service for 1994.    Vivas Teran reiterated that the government will continue to  reduce budgeted expenditures by as much as 15 percent. This  represents 210 billion bolivares if it is considered that the  balance between revenues and expenses for this year amounts to  1.435 trillion bolivares. Nevertheless, Sosa Rodriguez admitted  on Wednesday at the Council of Ministers meeting that his  ministry was barely able to make 110 billion bolivares in cuts,  less than 10 percent of the budgeted expenses.    In sum, this is "what we have been able to do after  assessing  the country's finances. We want the country to know, without  euphemisms, the exact dimension of the problems our nation is  facing. The central government's deficit is approximately 8  percent of the GNP."    This same situation, Vivas Teran noted, is what has led the  finance minister to be very cautious and "to take his time  because, often, there are many unexpected ways in which a fiscal  deficit can increase."</p>

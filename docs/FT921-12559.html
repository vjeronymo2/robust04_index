			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: Arts 2000 catches on in the provinces - The competition is cut-throat to attract specialised festivals ONE OF Lord Palumbo's more bizarre ideas has turned out to be one of his most successful. When the chairman of the Arts Council unveiled Arts 2000, a wheeze through which a different part of the country would hold a specialised arts festival every year up to the millenium, the media response was tepid. But the idea has caught on. Local authorities are increasingly convinced that the arts are the catalyst to regenerate their economies and although the Arts Council is only offering Pounds 250,000 to each festival it has been enough to unleash a flurry of competitive activity. Birmingham is currently hosting a year long music festival, exploiting its new concert hall, and next year dance will be breaking out all over the East Midlands. On Tuesday Lord Palumbo announces the winners of the contests to present drama in 1994, literature in 1995, and the visual arts in 1996. The competition has been cut throat and many of the decisions were on a knife edge, the choice between beguiling opposites. Take drama, where the contestants are Manchester, with its rich tradition, multi-ethnic diversity and abunndace of venues, and Sussex, a mainly rural region where, apart from Brighton, drama has hardly touched the people. Manchester claims that local councils and the private sector will produce an extra Pounds 10m if it wins the bid; Sussex says that its campaign has put the arts on the agenda and the award would trigger a much needed impetus, including the restoration of the Essoldo in Brighton. The safe decision would be Manchester; the brave one Sussex. Manchester must be favourite. For literature the rivals are Swansea, Kirklees and Nottinghamshire, all of which promise to set up National Centres of Literature. Once again all the options have attractions. Swansea offers two languages is prepared to convert one of its abandoned dockside buildings into a sanctury for writers; Kirkless has a strong tradition of literary out-reach and a council supportive of the arts; and Nottinghamshire has carefully fostered its Lawrencian roots and plans to build on its Byronic connections at Newstead Abbey. Swansea might just get it, to spread the money into Wales. The visual arts are just as open. Glasgow has a brilliant track record but perhaps not the need; Bradford, too, has an established committment to the regenerating powers of the arts; the Northern Region is a large, amorphous, contender; while Hampshire is almost virgin territory. If Sussex loses out on drama its southern neighbour may get the visual arts. Otherwise Bradford could register a win for inner city vitality. In the event it hardly matters. Arts 2000 has encouraged many councils to take the arts seriously for the first time and has already released some extra funds. The hope is that the losers, inspired by the experience, are now so committed that they will push ahead anyway with their artistic ambitions. One town already enjoying a rip roaring love affair with the arts is Halifax. In the early summer EUREKA], the UK's first Children's Museum opens there. It has a fairy godmother, Mrs Vivien Duffield, whose Pounds 5m cheque has covered most of the construction cost, and a fairy godfather, the Prince of Wales, who, along with the Princess, agreed to act as patron on condition the Museum was located there. Judging by the success of other childrens museums overseas, and a glance at the plans, EUREKA] will have no trouble in attracting its target of 500,000 visitors a year to its blend of educational entertainment, which allows kids the thrill of working on an assembly line, playing at bank manager, overhauling a car, watching their food digest, etc. More to the point EUREKA] puts the seal on Halifax's campaign to regenerate itself by drawing on the arts and, or as it prefers to call it, 'inheritance'. Glasgow, Birmingham, Bradford have sold themselves to their citizens, and potential investors, as latter day Medici's presiding over a cultural renaissance. It is excellent PR, and probably has some commercial spin off. Halifax is different in being more desperate in its need, more modest in its ambitions, and also more obviously successful. A decade ago the town was tottering. The textile mills were falling silent; even the rail service was under threat. The place looked like a doomed, dank, relic of the industrial revolution. Yet Halifax, which was expanded into Calderdale in local government re-organisation, received no grant aid. It did however attract the interest of the Prince of Wales. Today Halifax is the kind of place to warm his heart - small scale, homely, old fashioned, and apparently thriving. The Council's 'Inheritance Decade 1985-95' concentrated on smartening up the place, with the old shops and market halls spring cleaned to a golden brown and encouraged to adopt the comforting fascias of around 1930. Even Macdonalds has gone art deco. The Council has shown a Yorkshire caution in its cash hand outs - spending less than Pounds 1m but, by ensuring that business gets immediate planning decisions, the private investment in the city has exceeded Pounds 13m. It may look like a superficial sprucing up, but the shift in attitude triggered two far reaching developments, one a happy chance, the other a gamble. Ernest Hall must be the only classically trained pianist to run a large property company, Mountleigh. He saw the commercial potential in the redundant textile mills and was able to acquire the abandoned Dean Clough, with 1.25m square feet, at a basement price. He is converting it into a unique mix of commercial offices and arts centre. Over half the space is already occupied by companies like the Halifax Building Society and Sun Alliance whose rents enable Hall to offer free accommodation to over 20 artists, and to drama companies like Compass and IOU. Other residents include the Henry Moore Sculpture Trust and the Design Museum's educational programme. The walls of the former mills are decorated with over 400 works of art, and there is a gallery with constantly changing exhibitions. The commercial tenants get a stimulating work place and the artists creative encouragement from a business environment. Halifax gave Hall the go ahead to buy Dean Clough in four hours. Its other coup, bringing Northern Dance Theatre to the town, caused more heartache. Four years ago the company was in crisis, with the Arts Council threatening to cut off its grant. It needed a home more supportive than Manchester and found one in West Yorkshire, with Calderdale providing a base, a mill owners mansion, and half the Pounds 330,000 subsidy. This vote of confidence brought back Arts Council funding and nowNDT is about to receive its first major sponsorship, Pounds 150,000 from British Telecom, which will help raise orchestral standards. With Christopher Gable in charge ENB has just finished a successful tour with its new production of Romeo and Juliet and is steadily paying off its debts while seeking to raise Pounds 1.5m to move the Central School of Ballet from London to Halifax to crown its new confidence. A Halifax swarming with kids, ballet dancers, artists and theatricals might need some mental re-adjustment, but the town seems to have arrived already where more pretentious cities are still journeying towards.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey share sale details soon DETAILS OF the sale of Pounds 250m-worth of shares in Johnson Matthey, the platinum marketing company, by the Charter Consolidated conglomerate are likely to be made known next week. A clue to the timing came when Johannesburg Consolidated Investment, the South African mining finance house which is widely expected to play a crucial role, possibly by buying 29.9 per cent of JM postponed the announcement of its annual results. JCI said the board meeting at which the figures were to be approved would be held 'towards the end of next week' because that would be more convenient. All the companies are perceived by the investment community to be part of an extended 'family' controlled by the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa. Analysts suggested that, while Anglo might be willing to see Charter cut adrift, it would want to maintain an influence over JM. Anglo and its sister organisation, De Beers, between them own more than 60 per cent of Minorco, the group's Luxembourg-quoted offshore investment arm, and Minorco owns 36 per cent of Charter. Mr Jeff Herbert, Charter's managing director, has dismissed analysts' suggestions that his relationship with the former Minorco management was strained and had contributed to his desire for Charter to sell its 38.4 per cent of JM . He said that the working relationship between Charter and Minorco had always been 'excellent' and that the two former joint managing directors of Minorco, Mr Tony Lea and Mr Roger Phillimore, had become his personal friends.</p>

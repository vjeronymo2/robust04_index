He informed the deputies on Friday [21 January] about his  meetings with the president and with Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin the day earlier.    Rybkin pointed out the constructive character of his talks  with the president. He said Yeltsin expressed readiness for  permanent interaction with the State Duma and suggested holding  regular meetings with the chamber's speaker at least once a  month.    Rybkin said that he had discussed with the president the  State Duma's location. The chamber's speaker noted that the  State Duma will receive the facilities which formerly belonged  to the Supreme Soviet. Rybkin mentioned "a wonderful building  which has a total area of not less than that of the current  building of the State Duma or of the building of the former  Supreme Soviet, and which is much better equipped." However, he  refrained from answering a question what this building is,  saying only that he would not like to talk about it now and that  "there are many choices."    The speaker of the State Duma informed deputies that the  president had signed a decree disbanding the earlier formed  staff of the Federal Assembly and forming independent staffs of  the Council of Federation and the State Duma.    Commenting on the two-hour meeting with Chernomyrdin, Rybkin  said that the State Duma would be given the institute of  comparative science of law of the former Supreme Soviet. He  also said that on Friday the premier planned to hold a  conference with participation of all services in Moscow in order  to discuss the acceleration of the restoration of the buildings  housing the State Duma now. Up to 500 construction workers will  be sent there.</p>

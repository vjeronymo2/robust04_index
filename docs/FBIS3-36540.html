But it has been  learned that the original plans envisaged debates on such  important questions as the State Duma's draft declaration on  succession and draft laws on amendments to the Criminal Code and  on an amnesty.    Commenting at the editorial office's request on this marked  difference between the original plans and the final version of  the agenda, M. Mityukov, first deputy chairman of the State  Duma, reported, in particular, that the draft declaration on  succession prepared by V. Isakov, chief of the Duma's  Legislation Committee, was not recommended for consideration as  a result of two Duma Council sessions because, in the opinion of  most council members, it was quite clearly aimed at a  confrontation between the Duma and the president and had all the  prerequisites for dragging legislators into a lengthy process of  discussing the president's edicts issued from 21 September  through 24 December last year. Mityukov believes that Isakov's  main aim was, in camouflaged terms and in a competently compiled  legal document, to throw doubt on the president's norm-creating  activity.    Neither could the factions reach agreement on the draft law  on amendments to the Criminal Code. This sounds paradoxical,  because in their election programs practically all parties,  associations, and deputies promised to fight crime ruthlessly.  But the proposals made by the "Russia's Choice" faction --  which envisage, in particular, the standardization of  responsibility for crimes against property (the concept of  "socialist ownership" is excluded here), increased punishments  for terrorism and organized crime, and the extension of  citizen's rights to necessary self-defense -- did not meet with  support from the bloc of communists, agrarians, and the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia. It is worth noting that this draft  law was adopted by the former Russian Supreme Soviet in its  first reading without any problems.    Neither was it possible to submit the draft law on an  amnesty  for discussion. The formal reason for this was the lack of an  official letter from the president on submitting the draft law  to the State Duma. But the main reason for postponing  consideration was once again the position of certain factions  which, according to Mityukov, "tried to play the amnesty card  for their political purposes and which want, on top of 20,000  convicted invalids, pensioners, women, and war veterans, to  pluck the participants in the October events out of Lefortovo."    Consequently the agenda turned out to be a rather tame one  which did not promise any furors. Possibly wanting to  capitalize on the polemical potential that accumulated during  the week, most State Duma members decided to supplement the  agenda with the favorite question of all Soviet deputies -- "On  Mass Media Coverage of the State Duma's Activity."</p>

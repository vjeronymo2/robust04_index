			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Japan takes step-by-step approach to deregulation Japan's ministry of finance yesterday outlined the schedule under which the country's nine city, or commercial, banks' subsidiaries will enter the securities industry. The announcement is part of the MoF's blueprint for the 'gradual' lowering of the barriers between the banking and securities industries and comes almost a year after it opened the door to Japan's three long-term credit banks, Norinchukin Bank, the central agricultural bank, and trust banks to set up securities units. The step-by-step approach has been taken in response to fierce opposition by Japan's brokers, which are still recovering after the plunge in the Tokyo stock market in 1990 and a spate of securities scandals. The ministry has also limited operations by securities units to underwriting, dealing and broking corporate and government bonds, and underwriting equity-linked bonds. The deregulation comes while banks are still suffering the effects of bad loans made during the late 1980s. Of the 11 institutions permitted to enter the securities industry last year, only Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term Credit Bank, Norinchukin, and two trust banks have set up subsidiaries. The MoF said the city banks would be allowed to establish securities units in July, November and March 1995, in an 'orderly manner to avoid confusion'. Asahi Bank is expected to set up new operations in July, followed by six leading city banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Sakura Bank, Sanwa Bank, and Sumitomo Bank, in November.</p>

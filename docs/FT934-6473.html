			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Volvo shareholder deals blow to plan for Renault merger: Intensive effort fails to dispel widespread Swedish doubts Volvo's struggle to win approval for the planned merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault suffered a serious blow yesterday when the first institutional shareholder to declare a final position said it would vote against the deal. Although the so-called Fifth Fund state pension fund holds only 1.3 per cent of Volvo's voting capital, its rejection indicated that an intensive effort mounted by Volvo to overcome objections by significant Swedish shareholders had failed to dispel widespread doubts about the merger proposal. The outcome of a shareholder vote on December 7, already rescheduled from early this month, may now swing on a decision expected today from another state pension group, the Fourth Fund. It is Volvo's second largest shareholder after Renault, holding 7.5 per cent of the voting capital to the French group's 10 per cent. The board of the Fourth Fund includes senior representatives from industry and the trade unions, including both supporters of Volvo and merger sceptics. If the Fourth Fund rejects the deal, the prospect of Volvo winning majority shareholder support will be sharply diminished. Mr Bert Ekstrom, chief executive of the Fifth Fund, said the fund rejected the merger because of uncertainties over the values implied in the agreement, which proposes a 35 per cent share for Volvo in the merged company. He said the fund, governed by trade union, local government and state industry representatives, was also sceptical about French commitments to privatise Renault, despite written assurances from Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, that his government intended to complete privatisation by the end of next year. Volvo this week secured Mr Balladur's assurances, contained in a letter to Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, and a promise that a golden share the state intends to keep in the merged company will not be used to dilute Volvo's 35 per cent holding. These two issues have been the focus of criticism by Volvo shareholder institutions. However shareholders have also expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of detail published on the valuation of the respective Volvo and Renault assets in the merged company. In an interview with the FT on Tuesday, Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chairman, warned that a rejection of the planned merger would damage existing co-operation between Volvo and Renault. 'The momentum would disappear' said Mr Schweitzer. He added that the disruption to the merger process in recent weeks had already slowed and destabilised efforts to build a joint management organisation. Mr Schweitzer went on to stress the industrial logic of the proposed merger. The cost savings which would result through joint purchasing, research and development and economies of scale would strengthen the two companies' car and truck operations. He also pointed out that European car markets showed signs of bottoming out, he forecast a modest recovery in demand from mid-1994. He said he was confident that Renault would remain profitable despite the protracted downturn in car and truck markets. Renault chief firm, Page 18</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] While the opposition New Democracy (ND)  party has received its share of attention in the Greek press,  most newspapers focused on developments within the Panhellenic  Socialist Movement (PASOK), in light of its upcoming congress  and the rumors about the succession to the PASOK leader, Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou.    It is generally accepted that the April PASOK congress will  be the last with Papandreou as leader and that the prime  minister intends to run for the presidency in 1995, writes  Stavros Liyeros in the 27 March Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. The  congress is therefore viewed as a "way station" during which  potential successors will affirm themselves and alliances will  be sealed in view of the "final battle." The absence of ailing  Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas has resulted in  a "huge vacuum" and a lot of concern, for the election of  PASOK's most popular official to the party leadership had been  considered certain and had allayed fears of a succession  struggle, Liyeros comments. The race for the succession, which  is taking place in a "moving sands" environment, now includes  the quartet of Minister of Interior Akis Tsokhatzopoulos,  Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis, Minister of Industry  Kostas Simitis, and alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs  Theodhoros Pangalos. While until recently Tsokhatzopoulos had  been considered only Papandreou's "executive organ" and a  significant factor in intraparty affairs, the picture has  "totally changed" and the "Tsokhatzopoulos group" may presently  be the most important intraparty apparatus. According to  Liyeros, the interior minister is going to the congress with two  main goals:    -- Modify the existing--but not enforced--provision  prohibiting the party's secretary general from simultaneously  being a member of the government.    -- Elect as many of his own supporters as possible to the  new  central committee to secure his reelection to the position of  secretary general. Liyeros comments that this goal should not be  difficult, for it coincides with Papandreou's. He also cites  unidentified Tsokhatzopoulos aides as arguing that the prime  minister has already selected the interior minister as his  successor because "he would only entrust the government and the  party to him."    On the other hand, Arsenis will participate in the congress  from a "position of strength," following a gradual and  successful strategy of broadening his influence in the party and  the parliamentary group, continues Liyeros. In recent years,  Arsenis has become a "pole of attraction" for all dissatisfied  PASOK members. He presently enjoys a broad network of  supporters, among them, reportedly, Minister of Environment  Kostas Laliotis, whose help has "symbolic" value, for it erases  Arsenis' image of a "black sheep" and his past attempt to found  his own party.    According to Liyeros, Simitis has been attempting a  "dynamic"  comeback on the political scene in an effort to occupy the  vacuum left by Yennimatas. Liyeros cites "reliable" sources as  reporting that Simitis has concluded an alliance with PASOK  luminary Vaso Papandreou and is hoping to secure the assistance  of some members of the Yennimatas group. As the last potential  successor, Pangalos, viewed as an "outsider," has been  "desperately" attempting to enter the race. Liyeros comments,  however, that the alternate minister's "garrulous and impulsive"  statements are probably producing the opposite result. Liyeros  cites Pangalos' own friends as saying that his greatest  liability is "his own self." In addition, Pangalos lacks a power  base in his party.    Liyeros concludes that of the four candidates, Arsenis is  reportedly attracting the support of many deputies, who "are not  on the same wave length as Simitis, do not trust Pangalos, and  believe Tsokhatzopoulos could not adequately fill Papandreou's  shoes."    A brief note in the 27 March I KATHIMERINI reports that  according to recent information, Arsenis has been able to break  out of his isolation and is maintaining open lines of  communication with such PASOK luminaries as president of the  Chamber of Deputies Apostolos Kaklamanis, Yiorgos Katsifaras,  Minister of Public Order Stavros Papathemelis, Minister to the  Prime Minister Andonis Livanis, Deputy Minister of Foreign  Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou, and Stavros Tzoumakas. Reportedly,  Arsenis has also reinforced his ties with PASOK deputy Yiorgos  Lianis, a relative of Dhimitra Liani-Papandreou.    An article in the 30 March I KATHIMERINI reports on Simitis'  speech to a large meeting of party officials. The industry  minister criticized PASOK for its "inability to identify and  prioritize goals and carry out its announced intentions."  Simitis was also quoted as saying that "the control of economic  power and the fairer distribution of income are far-away goals,"  and that "the context of politico-social life as it is now  shaping fails to convince the public that our attempt at renewal  will become reality." PASOK, Simitis continued, has been  unsuccessful in finding a new role in a society where everything  is changing. While the party leadership views criticism and  "heretical" opinions as "importune," these usually express  deeper social concerns or interests. The absence of internal  confrontations undermines the party's programmatic and  ideological renewal, as well as its future, Simitis is quoted as  saying. The article points out that Simitis' criticism, sharp as  it was, did not include concrete proposals for change.    The 27 March Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS reports that  the question of Dhimitra Liani-Papandreou's position in light of  the upcoming PASOK congress has "bedeviled" the party, given  that the prime minister's wife and director of his office has  reportedly been an active PASOK member for a number of years.  The initial solution of proposing her as a "meritorious" member  of the central committee was rejected "out of hand" by the prime  minister. The second proposal was to submit her candidacy to the  local PASOK organization in Kifisia, to which she belongs, and  launch her electoral battle for a central committee post from  that base. The prime minister accepted the proposal and  Liani-Papandreou was elected with 130 votes out of 220, or 60  percent, far outpacing other candidates.</p>

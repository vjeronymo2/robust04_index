			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P lowers VW and Fiat debt ratings The debt ratings of the Volkswagen and Fiat groups, two of the big six west European carmakers, have been lowered by Standard &amp; Poor's of the US (S&amp;P), a leading international credit rating agency. The downgrading reflected 'increasingly difficult' industry conditions in Europe, said the agency, and follows the lowering of debt ratings for other car producers including Nissan and Honda of Japan and BMW of Germany. The ratings of Renault and the PSA Peugeot Citroen group of France are also being examined and have been placed on the agency's credit watch 'with negative implications'. S&amp;P has lowered the rating of VW's long-term debt to A+ from AA- (the highest investment grade rating is AAA, and the lowest is BBB), while VW's commercial paper rating has been lowered to A-1 from A-1+. Fiat's commercial paper rating has been lowered to A-2 from A-1. The rating outlook for Volkswagen was negative, said S&amp;P, because of the extent of the group's cost problems and 'uncertainty over the adequacy of its remedial actions'. Fiat's competitive position was weak owing to the company's ageing product range and high degree of reliance on the Italian market. The success of its current new product development programme was critical. S&amp;P said the increasing economic integration of Europe meant that the automotive market was more subject to volatile cyclical fluctuations than in the past. Long-term growth was expected to slow as markets approached saturation, and competition was intensifying as national trade barriers were eliminated. Significant excess capacity in the European car industry was expected to persist, due in part to the development of new assembly plants by leading Japanese carmakers.</p>

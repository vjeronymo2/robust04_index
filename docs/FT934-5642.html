			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Chelsfield flotation to raise Pounds 110m Chelsfield, the private property company led by Mr Elliott Bernerd, is coming to market through a placing and intermediaries offer likely to value the group at between Pounds 240m and Pounds 250m. On this basis the group, founded by Mr Bernerd with Pounds 200,000 of capital in 1986, will rank as the 12th largest quoted British property group. Chelsfield will raise a total of Pounds 110m in new capital, Pounds 50m through the placing and intermediaries offer and Pounds 45m from existing shareholders to coincide with the flotation. At the same time the group, which had fixed assets of Pounds 356m at the end of June and has current net assets of Pounds 141m, has agreed to acquire a portfolio of properties from Allied Lyons Pension Fund for Pounds 30.6m, of which Pounds 15m will be in the form of new shares. Mr Bernerd, who is expected to retain a 30 per cent stake in the group after flotation, said yesterday the new money raised 'will enable the company to continue to enlarge and develop our UK properties and to take advantage of the opportunities.' Chelsfield will come to market with a portfolio of wholly-owned UK properties with a total value of about Pounds 250m and annual rental income of about Pounds 19m - sufficient to cover existing overheads, interest costs and forecast dividends. The group's UK portfolio is notable for the number of income-producing properties, particularly in central London, with refurbishment and development potential. In addition the group holds interests in the Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands and in Stockley Park, a business park near Heathrow Airport. Chelsfield also retains a 60 per cent interest in the Wentworth Golf Club which it operates. The issue is sponsored by Hambros Bank and stockbrokers de Zoete &amp; Bevan. The issue price, which will be based on an existing net asset value of 165p per share, is due to be announced on December 9.</p>

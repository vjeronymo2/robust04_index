			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Safer route to the door Answering the doorbell can pose problems for the disabled, or those who are concerned about the risk of letting a potential burglar into the house. A Coventry-based company has launched a mobile answering intercom device, which allows the user to talk to the caller without opening the door. The Answermaid works within a range of 70 metres, allowing the door to be answered from anywhere in the house or garden. The system also has a panic button, which allows a user faced with an unwelcome caller to activate an alarm. The system is also able to alert the user to intruders breaking into outbuildings such as garages. The system, which costs Pounds 179.95, consists of a control panel, a handset, a door-push and a perimeter alert unit. Answermaid International: UK, tel 0203 221126; fax 0203 551098.</p>

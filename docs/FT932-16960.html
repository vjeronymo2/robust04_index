			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures traded in a tight range as dealers reflected on current interest rate policy in both the UK and Germany following the decision of the Bundesbank to leave rates unchanged, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 Index started the day in positive mood at 2,901, more or less where it had ended the previous session, and was in demand from the outset which led it to advance to 2,908 by 10am. The contract then traded sideways before sellers emerged, taking the view that the gains had gone too far. June then drifted to the day's low of 2,888 just after 11am and remained at the lower levels after the Bundesbank made its announcement on interest rates, which did not surprise the market. A feeling that there may still be a reduction in UK rates, however, saw June recover the lost ground and by 2.30pm it was trading at 2,909. Profit-taking towards the close saw June end at 2,894, down 6 from Wednesday's finish and around 3 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 11. Volume was 9,306 lots. There was little strength in traded options. Some 24,583 contracts were dealt, of which 5,273 were in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,991 in the Euro FT-SE option. Asda was the busiest stock option with 2,962 traded, followed by Marks and spencer at 2,448.</p>

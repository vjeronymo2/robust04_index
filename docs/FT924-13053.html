			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Rover unions back 7.3% 18-month deal UNIONS at Rover have rec-ommended acceptance of a two-stage 18-month pay deal worth a minimum 7.3 per cent which would take effect after the current pay freeze. The six-month pay freeze for the UK carmaker's 34,000 workers was imposed last month. The first stage of the increase, if agreed, will take effect on May 1, instead of the company's normal November 1 settlement date. The package illustrates the continuing downward pressure on private-sector pay, with settlements currently running at about 4 per cent. The government wants increases in public-sector pay - which are now rising faster than those in the private sector - depressed to about 2 per cent a year, its target for long-term inflation. Pay talks at Rover lasted three days and both management and unions said the talks had gone 'smoothly'. Mr Tony Woodley, national officer with the TGWU general union, described the pack-age as 'reasonable' for both sides. He said there was no doubt that a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies agreed recently with Rover had played an important part in negotiations. The job-security guarantee was made as part of the company's 'new deal' reforms in working practices. Under the latest pay agreement, pay would rise by 3.6 per cent, with a second 3.6 per cent increase from November 1993 for one year. The package contains an inflation trigger - should inflation exceed 4 per cent next October employees would get a lump-sum payment of Pounds 150, equivalent to an extra 1.2 per cent for production-line workers who earn about Pounds 240 a week. The complicated package would give some 5,000 skilled workers an additional 3 per cent, according to union negotiators. Mr Woodley said the package contained 24 separate improvements including increased holiday entitlements. The Rover pay freeze followed recent moves by Ford and Rolls-Royce to cut 2,500 jobs in the UK as the recession continues to take a heavy toll on the British motor industry. The freeze includes directors and senior managers as well as shop-floor workers. Mr John Towers, group managing director, said it was necessary to 'help protect the company from the worst consequences of the recession'.</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> EVERYTHING IS FALLING INTO PLACE  </P> <P> I've been 18 years with the district, and I've never had a boring moment. There  have been times when I wish there had been.  </P> <P> On certain (bus) lines, it's a little too alive, if you know what I mean.  </P> <P> On the Blue Line, it's a little too active at the grade crossings. You fear  making contact with another human being coming through there. You're moving  through there at 55 (m.p.h.) or 45 -- most times 55 -- points where other  vehicles are crossing. That's a little hectic, mentally, but you learn to cope  with it, try to take every precaution.  </P> <P> Everything is ironing out pretty good, though. I think the Blue Line will be  something that will be around for a while. Everything is falling into place.  We're getting the bugs out of the system.  </P> <P> I wouldn't look forward to driving a bus (again). Some of the guys look like  they've died and gone to heaven! That's the way we relate to it. It's a  different atmosphere. We look back over the crowd, and we have a nice class of  people -- nice clientele of people -- going to work. They're reading the  papers, and we try to give them as smooth a ride as possible. We have a system  called ATP -- automatic train protection system. And if a train up ahead breaks  down or whatever, and we don't know it, this is something that will shut us  down right away.  </P> <P> I went through extensive training (for this job)) and I didn't know it was  going to be that extensive. I went home on many days and told the wife I might  just go back to the buses. I didn't have this many exams when I was in college!  I'm glad I did now. I'm glad I stuck with it.  </P></p>

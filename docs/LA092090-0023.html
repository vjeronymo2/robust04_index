			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPLES;  </P> <P> STRAIGHT FROM THE TREE  </P> <P> Apple picking is under way in Oak Glen, Southern California's largest  apple-growing region. This year's crop, however, is slightly delayed by the hot  weather, says David (Robie) Robertson, president of the Oak Glen Apple Growers  Assn.  </P> <P> Golden and Standard Delicious and Glen Seedlings, which are similar to pippins,  are ready now, and more varieties are due in October. Fresh cider and apple  juice are also for sale.  </P> <P> Ranches open for picking are Los Rios Rancho, Riley's Farm and Orchard and  Four-Oaks Ranch. Apples from the new crop are on sale at Parrish Pioneer Ranch  and Law's Cider Mill &amp; Ranch. Pickers can check locations through brochures  available at local businesses.  </P> <P> This weekend is an especially good time to go because Oak Glen is staging a  two-day harvest celebration. Events include pie eating and cider drinking  contests, an arts and crafts fair, country and Western music shows, a benefit  pancake breakfast, hay rides and pony rides.  </P> <P> To reach Oak Glen from Los Angeles, take the San Bernardino Freeway 12 miles  past San Bernardino to the Yucaipa Boulevard off-ramp. Turn left at the top of  the ramp and go to the third signal, which is Oak Glen Boulevard. Turn left  again and continue six miles to Oak Glen.  </P> <P> Certified organically grown apples are yours for the picking and a price of $13  a bushel at the De Vera Ranch, 22500 Highway 202, Tehachapi.  </P> <P> The ranch is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. through November. This week, Red  and Golden Delicious, Early Blaze, Gala and Rome Beauty varieties are ready for  harvest, says Dante De Vera. The ranch provides pickers with facilities for  pressing fresh apple juice. Other attractions include a private lake for  fishing, horseback riding, an animal petting area and a store selling souvenirs  and snacks. Picnic tables are available too, and there's a campground nearby.  </P> <P> For further information, call (213) 254-1766, (818) 993-0752 or (805) 822-1120.  Tehachapi is 108 miles from Los Angeles. Take the Antelope Valley Freeway to  Highway 58 and head west to the third Tehachapi exit, marked "Highway 202  Correctional Institution." Turn right on Tucker Road, then right on Highway 202  and continue for about four miles to the ranch. BARBARA HANSEN  </P></p>

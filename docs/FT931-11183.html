			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Mediators push Bosnia peace plan: Vance and Owen seek to overcome Washington's reservations THE international mediators for a settlement of the Bosnian conflict, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, continued their uphill battle yesterday to win the UN Security Council's and the US's endorsement for their peace plan. In the face of what appear to be serious reservations by the Clinton administration about aspects of the plan deemed to favour the Serbs, the mediators have adopted a remarkably robust stance to hammer home their view that the proposed solutions are fair and equitable. Lord Owen in particular has not hesitated in newspaper and TV interviews to pour ridicule on the arguments of members of the American political establishment who, while calling for international military intervention to stop the killing of Bosnian Moslems, do not seem to be prepared to send ground troops to Bosnia. Calls for the lifting of the UN arms embargo to help the Bosnian Moslems have been given equally short shrift by Lord Owen, who has pointed out that such a move would lead not only to an intensification of the fighting, but would not be accepted by the British or the French, let alone the Russians. The consensus that has been built up in the Security Council since the end of the cold war could thus be completely wrecked. Even Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's representative and a former US Secretary of State, has lost his customary calm under persistent criticism of his negotiating stance. He treated a suggestion at a press conference at the UN on Tuesday that he was appeasing the Serbs as 'absolute hogwash' which made him 'pretty damned angry'. From Mr Vance, that is fighting talk. The mediators, whose plan has been approved by at least four of the five permanent members of the Security Council, were due to continue their consultations with the other 10 Council members yesterday. Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: The UN met Croat and Serb leaders from the enclave of Krajina yesterday, amid clashes in the disputed territory and throughout Bosnia Hercegovina. Serb commanders in Krajina accused Croat forces of pushing forward across UN lines, Belgrade radio said. Mr Boro Martinovic, a member of the self-styled Krajina government, yesterday confirmed that UN officials were meeting both sides in an attempt to begin talks towards ending the clashes. He said Krajina's Serb leaders had been invited to attend talks at the UN. 'But we continue to insist Croat forces unconditionally withdraw to the confrontation line, as called for by the Security Council,' he added by telephone from Knin, the mountain-top centre of Krajina. In Bosnia the UN High Commissioner of Refugees suspended humanitarian convoys along the route from the southern city of Mostar to Sarajevo. A UNHCR relief convoy on Tuesday was shelled in a valley near Mostar, killing one person and seriously wounding another. Croatian radio blamed the attack on Serb forces. Further south, the radio said Serb forces yesterday launched a counter-offensive on the Mostar-Stolac lines. In a conflicting report, Srna, the Bosnian Serb news agency said Croat forces had launched the attack.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, March 15 (TANJUG) -- The Serb Army  headquarters in the republic of Serb Krajina said on Tuesday  that the Croatian Army launched, on Monday, a fierce artillery  attack on sector south of the republic of Serb Krajina, despite  the ceasefire agreement. One Serb soldier was wounded and  civilian buildings were considerably damaged in the attack.    The Krajina Serb Army headquarters specified that the  Croatian attack, which lasted all day long, started in the wider  Kozjan region, southwest of Korenica, which came under tank and  artillery fire, spreading then to the entire region along the  front line, west of Korenica and Vrhovine.    The headquarters statement said that Krajina Serb forces had  responded to all attacks, and the Serb defence line remained  stable.    According to the statement, the Croatian Army violated the  ceasefire in the territory of the western Slavonija (sector  west) on Monday, opening fire from small arms around the forest  of Prasnik. The Croatian actions ceased when the Serb troops  returned fire, the statement said.    A twice extended ceasefire between the Republic of Serb  Krajina and Croatia has been in force since Christmas. It will  be in force by March 31, when the U.N. Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) mandate in Krajina expires.    The republic of Serb Krajina has been declared by the Serbs  in their ethnic and historical territories in Croatia, in  response to Croatia's violent secession from former Yugoslavia  and the downgrading of Serb civil and national rights by  Croatian authorities.    The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed a U.N. Protected  Area in spring 1992 following the conflict between the Croatian  Army with the Krajina Serbs and the former Yugoslav Peoples  Army. The U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed there under the  Vance peace plan. Croatia has launched three offensives on the  Republic of Serb Krajina since then, trying to take control of  it by force.</p>

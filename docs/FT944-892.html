			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Mercury reduces overseas tariff Mercury Communications, the UK's second biggest public telecommunications operator, yesterday made substantial cuts in international call prices for its largest users in reaction to intensifying competition, Alan Cane writes. It said daytime telephone calls to north America would come down 55 per cent, to 20p a minute from 44p, for customers spending Pounds 35,000 or more a month. To important European destinations the price will also be 20p a minute compared with 26p while calls to Hong Kong will be 55p a minute compared with the standard Mercury business rate of 78p. The moves reflect Mercury's need to improve its competitiveness for long-distance calls.</p>

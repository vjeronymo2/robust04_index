			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> You may not have tickets to Saturday's big USC-UCLA football game at the Rose  Bowl, but if you're interested in soaking up some cross-town rivalry or basking  in college nostalgia, you're not necessarily out of luck.  </P> <P> Those who want to listen to bands, watch cheerleaders and haul out the old  tailgate brunch can do all that -- without tickets -- outside the Rose Bowl  this Saturday, if they're willing to mingle with the other 100,000 or so fans  who will be sticking around to watch the game, said Rick Purdy, associate  athletic director at UCLA.  </P> <P> "For this game, people will probably start arriving about dawn," Purdy said.  </P> <P> Even if you're not an alumnus, you can spread out a picnic on the soccer field  just south of the Rose Bowl, where UCLA will sponsor a pregame rally at about  9:30 a.m. with music from the school band and some cheerleading performances,  Purdy said.  </P> <P> If you're a USC fan and wouldn't be caught dead in the UCLA camp, you can  always  </P> <P> mingle, hum the fight song and break out the picnic.  </P> <P> "The tailgating is quite a spectacle in itself, what with fans from both  schools all wearing the colors," said Rob Asghar of the USC News Service.  </P> <P> Parking on the Rose Bowl golf course is free; the paved lots are reserved for  season ticket holders. But you could also ride a bicycle into the area (and  avoid anticipated traffic jams) or park in the Parsons Co. lot at Fair Oaks  Ave. and Walnut Boulevard in Old Pasadena and take a free shuttle bus to the  Rose Bowl. Dave Casey of Rose Bowl operations said shuttles will begin running  at 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> As of Tuesday, there were still a few game tickets for sale through the UCLA  ticket office for $27 each. The tickets belonged to season ticket holders who  returned their tickets. "Usually, we're sold out by now, but this is unusual.  It's probably because we've had such a terrible season," a UCLA ticket operator  said. UCLA's record is 5-5.  </P> <P> The game begins at 12:30 p.m. KAREN E. KLEIN  </P></p>

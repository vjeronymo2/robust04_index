			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy commander Aleksandr Bespalov of the Russian  border troops told INTERFAX that the Tajik Government-in-exile  was directly responsible for the terrorist actions against  Russian servicemen in Tajikistan.    According to Bespalov, forces of the Black Imam group played  the leading role in the terrorist actions. General Bespalov  described them as fanatical and exceptionally ferocious. The  latest assault on Russian border guards was reported in Dushanbe  on 24 June.    Bespalov said that on orders from the Tajik opposition  leaders and the commander-in-chief of the opposition forces  Rezvon, opposition buildup continued in the Shuroabad, Darvaz  and Bakhorak directions on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border.    The Tajik opposition leaders issued orders for the  Badakhshan  group of forces to move from central Afghanistan to the border  areas and eventually into Tajikistan. Iranian, Pakistani, and  Saudi mercenaries had joined the Tajik fighting units. A field  hospital for Tajik forces and mercenaries had opened in the  Afghan city of Chakhiab. Nationals of Islamic countries worked  on its staff, General Bespalov said.    All that proved, Bespalov said, that the Tajik opposition  leaders aimed to launch a new round of hostilities. Those who  opposed moves for peace on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border and  inside Tajikistan, he stressed, would be held responsible for  escalating violence.</p>

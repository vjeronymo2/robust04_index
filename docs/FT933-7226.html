			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: German chemicals The disintegration of the ERM could hardly have come at a worse time for the German chemicals industry. Petrochemicals are blighted by overcapacity, agrochemicals are in decline thanks to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and pharmaceuticals are being depressed by government reforms - most notably in Germany itself. These factors matter in different measure to the German chemicals giants: BASF is most geared to bulk chemicals, Bayer to pharmaceuticals. The depreciation of other European currencies against the D-Mark is painful for all. The half-year results season is unlikely, then, to bring much cheer. The big gains would come from a rise in commodity chemicals prices from the current depressed levels. Tentative price rises seen earlier this year fell back with the oil price. With industrial demand for plastics weak and fresh capacity still coming on stream - BASF's Antwerp petrochemical complex is scheduled to open at the end of the year - any sustained improvement looks some way off. This autumn's round of contract negotiations is unlikely to provide relief. Still, the trend towards asset swaps and joint ventures is encouraging. Hoechst's recent merger of its agrochemicals interest with Schering and BASF's proposed acrylic for polypropylene swap with ICI might open the way for more rationalisation and cost-cutting than has been in evidence until now. While the currency markets are working against them, though, it will take more of the same to restore the competitive position of the German chemicals industry.</p>

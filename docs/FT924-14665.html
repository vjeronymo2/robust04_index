			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Austria (5): Earnings squeezed - Banks worry over foreign competition IT HAS been a dreadful year for Austrian banks so far, with little prospect of any relief in the second half. But the one benefit is that the on again-off again process of reducing the ridiculous levels of overcapacity in the industry seems to be perking up. For the record, there are 1,165 banks in Austria today, down by 144 in the past decade. Profits of all the leading banks were well down in the first half, as high interest rates squeezed already wafer thin spreads between borrowing and lending. The stock market remained in the doldrums. Partial operating profit (pretax profit, excluding exceptional items) of Bank Austria, the bank formed by the merger a year ago of Zentralsparkasse and Osterreichische Landerbank, tumbled 15.7 per cent to ASch815m. Creditanstalt, the number two bank, which did not have exceptional merger expenses to deal with, saw its partial operating profits drop 9.5 per cent to ASch845bn. Giro's main traditional business has been investing funds that savings banks must by law deposit with it. But the savings banks are gradually being freed to invest where they like, and realise they can get better returns in the open market than with Giro. The earnings squeeze on the banks appears finally to have forced them to abandon the frantic battle for market share that has characterised the sector in recent years. Bank Austria, exercising its new role as market leader, raised its lending rates after the German Bundesbank hikes in July, and others duly followed. Customer charges have been increased. All the banks talk about cutting costs, and Bank Austria executives are pretty well decided to cut about 60 branches out of their merged 360 total over the next couple of years. it is probably significant that the merger that created Bank Austria has concentrated market shares. Also, the banks are increasingly worried about foreign competition. German banks in particular have become more active in the Austrian securities market, bankers say. Medium term, the anticipated raising of withholding tax on savings accounts and the outlawing of anonymous accounts could cause a significant outflow of funds from the banks. Austria now has one of the highest savings rates in the world, nearly 14 per cent of net disposable income. As for further restructuring in the banking industry, Giro is the subject of most speculation these days. Because its natural franchise is fading, Giro has been trying to build up its own network of branches. The snag is that the two largest shareholders in Giro are Bank Austria and Erste Osterreiche Spar-Casse-Bank. With their own savings bank networks, they appear to have joined forces to try to prevent Giro from becoming more powerful. Negotiations on a merger between Erste and Giro came to nought last year, but they could be revived in the future. Or Giro could be gobbled up eventually by Bank Austria. There was speculation in Vienna last month that Bayerischen Landesbank, the large Bavarian savings bank, would take a 10 per cent stake.</p>

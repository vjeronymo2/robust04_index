			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed KvdB: "Poll: Scandal Atmosphere Pushing </F> Socialist Party Down to 15.3 Percent"]    [Text] The scandal atmosphere which swept through the  socialist movement in March has left deep scars. The March  poll, which was conducted by Dimarso on behalf of DE MORGEN,  revealed that the SP [Socialist Party] has to settle for only  15.3 percent of the votes. This is a decrease by 2.1 percent.  The French-speaking sister party, the PS, had already been the  victim of the scandals around "the three Guys" in December and  January. In March, Busquin's party fell back to only 30.5  percent of the votes. As a result, the socialist family is now,  for the first time since 1919, only the third political  formation in Belgium. SP and PS combined, get only 19.7 percent  of the Belgian votes. CVP [Christian People's Party] and PSC  [Social Christian Party] score 19.9 percent, while the liberals  are the largest family with 27.4 percent. In Flanders, Agalev  [Live Differently] made great progress in March: from 11.3 to  13.5 percent. This is also an historic record. The CVP  continues to concede ground (21 percent), the liberals rose  slightly (to 29.2 percent), but no longer exceed the 30 percent  limit. According to Dimarso, the federal coalition has only  39.6 percent of the votes left. The Walloon majority barely  reaches 51 percent, while the SP-CVP-VU [People's Union]  coalition in Flanders has only 42.2 percent.</p>

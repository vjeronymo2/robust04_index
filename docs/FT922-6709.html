			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Butte initiates legal action in US claiming damages of Dollars 325m BUTTE MINING, which at present has a market value of about Pounds 5m, has launched a legal action in the US against a number of defendants, including former directors and advisers, claiming damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 183.6m). It also is asking for this to be trebled under US anti-racketeering legislation. Named among the defendants are Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur who has been involved in a number of oil and mining ventures, and Mr Martin Byatt, whose firm Byatt Michau &amp; Smart, was Butte's legal adviser. Also named are Ernst &amp; Young, the international accountancy group, and Robertson Research, the UK minerals consultancy organisation and Simon Engineering, its parent since last year. Mr Roy Bichan, who at one time was chairman of both Robertson and Butte, is also among the defendants named. The suit, filed in the US District Court in Montana, Butte division, by Butte Mining's contingent-fee lawyers, Deutsch and Frey of New York, makes extensive allegations of fraud and misrepresentation. It claims damages from about 100 companies and individuals. None of those contacted about the suit yesterday had seen the details and some - including Ernst &amp; Young - withheld comment. However, Mr Smith said: 'I have never been involved in any racketeering. Any claims are frivolous.' He said that his family's shareholding in Butte remained at the same level as when the company was launched on the London Stock Exchange in October 1987: some 19m shares. A Simon Engineering spokesman said any allegations were strongly denied by Robertson which had taken extensive legal and other professional advice at the time of Butte's acquisition of its US interests. 'If and when proceedings are received, they will be defended vigorously (by Robertson).' Among the many allegations, Butte has complained that in 1988 it paid Pounds 51m, mainly in shares, then priced at Pounds 1.25 each, for a company whose sole asset, bought only a short while before, had cost Dollars 90,566. It has also alleged that shareholders were told Butte was fully indemnified against environmental liabilities in respect of some of its US properties, when it was not. Papers filed in connection with the suits contend that these matters came to light only in the first quarter of 1992 as a result of new management, including Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, a former Consolidated Gold Fields managing director, who was recruited by Credit Lyonnais Laing. No trial date had yet been fixed but Butte believes the case might reach court at the end of 1993. It said: 'No assurance can be given as to the eventual outcome of the suits, nor of the amounts of damages that may be recovered.' The Butte share price remained unchanged after the news at 2p.</p>

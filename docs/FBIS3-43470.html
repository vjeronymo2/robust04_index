A press release from the Ministry of  Communications says the minister, Alhaji Abubakar Rimi, ordered  the suspension of the officials following the findings of an  internal investigation panel which looked into the operations of  Nipost. The other suspended officials are Mr. (Egbadin), deputy  postmaster general, Finance and Investment; Mr. (Zubike  Ogbonna), deputy postmaster general, Territorial Administration;  and Mohamed Bashir, secretary, legal adviser of Nipost. They  are to remain suspended until the final determination of their  roles in causing financial losses to Nipost and mismanaging its  affairs.    The statement said Mr. (Zumi), as postmaster general, was  involved in questionable transactions which included the payment  of more than 43.5 million naira to a foreign airline for the  hire of aircraft which was not delivered and did not carry any  mail. He is also said to have paid 50 million to another  airline without ministerial approval. In the meantime, the head  of state, General Sani Abacha, has approved the appointment of  Mr. (Gban Gbele), deputy postmaster general, operations and  planning, as the acting postmaster general.</p>

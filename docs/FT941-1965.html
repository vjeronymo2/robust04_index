			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unclear trend on shorter working hours Sir, In the short term it does seem as though the increase in part-time work occurring in the British economy is such that average hours worked per week are falling ('In, out, share the work about', March 15). This fairer distribution of available work is surely to be welcomed whatever other qualms one might have about the economy's inability to produce enough person-hours of work in total. The question is, however, whether the mere existence of a more flexible labour market will mean that this trend continues as David Goodhart suggests it will. The labour market has become more deregulated since 1979, yet analysis in New Economy has shown that over this period average working hours have actually increased - in stark contrast to the trend of the last 100 years or so. Certainly there have been more part-timers over this period but there have also been more self-employed (who tend to work longer) and also the manager and professional class have been working longer, generally unpaid, extra hours. We do not really understand this latter phenomenon. It may be employers demanding more effort or it may be an increased incentive to get promotion due to the increased monetary rewards and the hedge this gives against the growing insecurity of any job. Until we understand this, it will be difficult to say whether the new deregulated labour market will of its own accord share out the work better or whether more positive action will be needed.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Branko Jokic: "It Is Ljubljana's Move"] </F>   [Text] The occasional "minor disagreements" are  casting a shadow over bilateral economic cooperation; Skopje  expects more understanding; will the joint commission resolve  the situation?    From our correspondent.    Skopje, 24 Apr--Aco Spasovski, secretary of the Macedonian  Chamber of Commerce's Department for Economic Policy and  Development, claims that economic cooperation between Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and  Slovenia is proceeding without major problems, in spite of the  measures that the Macedonian Government introduced for imports  of goods from Slovenia. He did add that "minor disagreements"  happen in doing business.    As we know, in the middle of March Macedonia introduced  special 15-percent tax on goods imported from Slovenia. At the  same time, it also introduced several additional measures, among  which those requiring a mandatory certificate for all goods are  particularly important. Macedonian importers can acquire it from  the Slovene producer, but it has to be confirmed by the  appropriate institution in Macedonia. If it turns out that the  goods were not manufactured in Slovenia, the authorities can  confiscate or destroy them. All products imported from Slovenia  must have labels and all accompanying documentation in the  Macedonian language, in Cyrillic.    Importers of Slovene goods in Macedonia have already  calculated that because of the new measures, the goods will not  become 15 percent more expensive, but rather at least 18 to 20  percent, since additional customs duties also have to be added  to the taxes introduced by the government. Aco Spasovski is not  convinced that with all these measures Macedonia will succeed in  reducing the trade deficit that it has in trade with Slovenia.  That deficit reportedly amounts to $80-100 million. One could  conclude from Aco Spasovski's statements that the Macedonians  introduced those measures only in order to get their Slovene  partners to abolish the requirements for certificates for  Macedonian goods, so that Slovenia would also recognize the  documents offered on the origin of goods, and Slovene customs  officials would treat goods imported from Macedonia differently.    In vino veritas, as the ancient Romans claimed. Macedonian  businessmen, in fact, point out that most of the deficit arose  because of the Slovene government's protective measures against  imports of Macedonian wine. The amounts of Macedonian wine on  the Slovene market supposedly declined because of that. Even the  first analyses performed in Macedonia showed that things were  completely different. In fact, recently Macedonian and Slovene  businessmen concluded an agreement according to which Macedonia  was supposed to export 15 billion liters of Macedonian wine to  Slovenia by June. It is not completely clear, however, whether  the Macedonian goods will finally end up on the Slovene market  or some other one. On the other hand, Macedonian merchants also  have to accept some of the blame. The fact is that those  merchants are raising prices uncontrollably for Slovene  products, so that those goods are extremely expensive. Since  people cannot buy them, large amounts of those goods remain in  Macedonian warehouses (it is true, however, that Slovene  producers have also not adjusted their prices to the Macedonian  market).    It is interesting that the Macedonian press is mostly  keeping  quiet about this Macedonian-Slovene dispute, although it  previously wrote enthusiastically about cheap medicines from  Slovenia (which undermined the products of the domestic  pharmaceutical industry), about expensive Slovene products that  they were forced to import because they were not manufactured in  Macedonia, and also about the "closed and exploitative Slovene  market." There is hope, however, that all these problems will be  solved soon. Specifically, a meeting of the joint commission on  economic cooperation, proposed by Slovenia, is to be convened  soon. The Macedonians, to be sure, expect Slovenia to be the  first to take steps. In their opinion, Slovenia ought to take  into account the difficult economic situation in Macedonia  (previously that country exported 60 percent of its goods to  Serbia, and now the border with Greece is also closed), perform  a good analysis of the surplus in its favor, and then propose  measures that would at least partly coordinate bilateral trade.  Members of the Macedonian leadership even think that Macedonia  should have certain privileges in trade with Slovenia.</p>

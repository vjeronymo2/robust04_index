			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / EC and Russia in aluminium trade row TALKS in Moscow have failed to resolve the growing the rift between the European Community and Russia over trade. The EC appears likely to restrict aluminium imports from Russia and other former Soviet states. Such a move would choke off a market which has produced a flow of desperately needed hard currency. The opening of the western European market to Russian goods has been identified by Russian President Boris Yeltsin as a key objective - but one which the Community has so far denied him. Russia's key contention, underscored last week by Mr Gyorgy Gabunia, deputy minister for foreign trade, is that 'we are no longer a command economy - we are a market economy. We want to be treated by the Community as a market economy - no better than others, but no worse.' However, for Mr Hugo Parmen, the senior EC official in charge of negotiations with the Russians, 'it is obvious they are still a state trading country. They still have the remnants of a planned economy.' Russia has said it wishes to become a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which seeks to reduce or eliminate tariff barriers between members. Mr Yeltsin has said he wants Russia to be a member by the end of the year - an unrealistic demand of a body which takes at least two years to process an application, but evidence of the Russian desire to get in quickly. However, Russia has not yet submitted the memorandum necessary to begin the application process. Mr Gabunia says: 'We have one of the most open markets in the world - we have tariffs on practically nothing.' He instances particular restrictions against Russian goods - such as low ceilings on imports of cars into Spain and Portugal, shoes into Spain, and television sets and vodka into France. Mr Parmen agrees these restrictions exist but says they are strictly disapproved of by the EC and 'will be removed'. The most crucial commodity is aluminium, though. According to EC figures, aluminium exports from the Soviet Union to the EC were running in 1989 at 147,000 tonnes while in 1992, the former Soviet states exported to the Community 529,000 tonnes (85 per cent of which came from Russia), an increase of nearly 250 per cent. At the same time, the EC aluminium market grew from 3.86m tonnes to 4.24m tonnes - an increase of only 14 per cent. 'The aluminium coming into the EC is being sold at very low prices,' said Mr Parmen. 'The European producers cannot possibly compete with it.' He says that the Community does not want to introduce ceilings, but will be forced to do so if the exports are not cut.</p>

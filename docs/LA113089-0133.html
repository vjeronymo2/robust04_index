			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> 8 COUNTIES AGREE TO FORM AIR DISTRICT  </P> <P> In an attempt to avoid state intervention, eight San Joaquin Valley counties  have agreed to form a valleywide agency to control air pollution. Fresno County  Supervisor Judy Andreen announced the agreement at a hearing before the state  Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Wildlife. The hearing was called to  consider a proposal by state Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) to require  formation of a single air pollution control district in the San Joaquin Valley.  Andreen said the new valleywide agency would replace individual air pollution  control districts in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin,  Stanislaus and Tulare counties. Andreen said the agency is expected to be  approved by the member counties by the end of the year.  </P></p>

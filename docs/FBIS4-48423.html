			<p>BFN     [Text] Emil Zinsou, Benin's first president, was at the  Futungo de Belas Palace today to convey a message to President  Jose Eduardo dos Santos from Nicephore Soglo, the current  president of Benin. The president of the Republic received the  envoy of the head of state of Benin at the Futungo de Belas  Palace early this afternoon.    Apart from conveying the message, Emil Zinsou introduced to  the Angolan head of state Dr. Fagna, a scientist from Benin who  recently discovered a medicine to lessen the [words indistinct]  in human beings. The discovery has already been recognized by  the World Health Organization, and many African and other  countries have been expressing their interest in the new  medicine. Emil Zinsou, the first head of state of Benin, held  power until 1968.    [Begin Zinsou recording] I then briefed the Angolan head of  state on an important project. I am a doctor, and this project  deals with a widespread disease among blacks, Africans, and the  American people. It is called (?trypanosomiasis), a disease  which attacks red cells. Like malaria, it is a very common  disease among Africans. My compatriot here Professor Fagna  found a medicine which had never been discovered before. He has  already had an opportunity to treat some Angolans. Thus, we  want to maintain with the Angolan people and government close  contacts so that this medicine can cure the largest number  possible of Africans. This will also permit us to develop  efforts to discover new medicines for other diseases. The  Angolan president received our views favorably. [end recording]</p>

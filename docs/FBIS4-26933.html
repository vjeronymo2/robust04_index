			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Low economic efficiency  of many enterprises was now a major problem in China's economy,  Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning  Commission, recently told a group of economic reporters here.    He pointed out that such low efficiency in particular  enterprises could be termed micro-economics -- but this had  great macro-economic effects.    To solve some of these problems, the reform of enterprises  will be top of the agenda in China next year.    He said that his commission is in charge of the macro  economy, but it also pays attention to the study of  micro-economic activities.    The minister said that the government's structural reforms  this year had far-reaching effects on large and medium-sized  enterprises. But it was not enough to carry out the reform  measures -- the reform of the enterprises should also be  promoted.    He said that now many of the enterprises have no access to  the market, which has affected their viability. They needed to  push for access to the market and become a major part of the  market.    This was the fundamental way out for enterprises to reduce  losses and increase profits, he said.    The minister said that some noted foreign specialists had  said that the development of enterprises depended on two wheels,  technological progress and scientific management. But in China,  the two wheels can operate only through reform of enterprises.</p>

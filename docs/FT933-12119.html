			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Gerstner expected to announce boardroom shake-up at IBM INTERNATIONAL Business Machines' new chairman and chief executive, Mr Lou Gerstner, is expected to announce a reshaping of the company's board of directors tomorrow along with the struggling computer giant's second-quarter results. Although IBM declines to comment, two of the company's outside directors, Mr Richard Munro, the retired co-chairman of Time Warner, and Mr Stephen Bechtel Jr, chairman emeritus of the Bechtel Group, are believed to have tendered their resignations. Mr Helmut Sihler, former chief executive of Henkel, retired from IBM's board last month, while Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM's vice-chairman, has previously announced plans to retire next month. At IBM's annual meeting in April, shareholders criticised directors for being out of touch with the computer industry, operating an 'old boy's network' and having been management cheerleaders, rather than shareholders' watchdogs. Signalling change, Mr Gerstner, who joined IBM in April, responded by saying that the 'composition of the board and the board's ability to contribute to building this company 'would be considered'. However, boardroom changes are unlikely to placate IBM shareholders fully. Last week, IBM's shares touched an 18-year low of Dollars 41 5/8 , closing on Friday at Dollars 42 1/4 . Wall Street analysts are projecting operating losses of about 23 cents per share, for the second quarter, compared with net income of Dollars 1.29 per share in the same period last year. Large write-offs, to cover the cost of thousands of job cuts, could exacerbate IBM's losses. Already, IBM has said that it expects to reduce its workforce by more than the 25,000 estimated at the beginning of the year. Now analysts say the total could rise to 50,000 or even 75,000, with additional charges against earnings of at least Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) Talk of multi-billion charges has raised new fears of a further cut in the dividend.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vika Uzdina under the heading "The City": "The </F> Government Promises Us Financial Aid"]    [Text] During talks with the government of St. Petersburg  Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin promised to lobby for  federal budget allocation of $10 million to purchase Ikarus  buses for St. Petersburg. This was reported yesterday by Aleksey  Kudrin, Economics and Finance Committee chairman.    It is possible that St. Petersburg will once again be among  the "clients" of a special government fund which up until 1989  subsidized the city's transportation expenditures. However,  municipal transport will only receive government support if 40  percent of expenditures for its upkeep are paid for by ticket  sales. As for the bus production that is supposed to be started  up by KaMAZ and Kirovskiy Zavod in the town of Gorelovo, that  project will very likely be included in the federal list of  facilities eligible for priority funding (at least according to  a proposal submitted by Russian vice-premier Aleksandr Shokhin).    Viktor Chernomyrdin also announced that in the near future  the government will pay off last year's indebtedness for the  city's Metrostroy company, a debt that currently stands at R19  billion [rubles]. A total of 170 billion "federal" rubles are  supposed to be allocated for subway construction here in 1994,  but only R8 billion has been made available thus far. (By way of  comparison, the Moscow subway system has received funding of  R1.1 trillion.)    Of the R32 billion allocated by the government for the  preparation and conducting of the Goodwill Games, only R18  billion has been transferred to the city budget. As Aleksey  Kudrin noted, even those funds have not reached their proper  destination, and at this time sports facilities are being built  and renovated at the city's expense. In addition, Aleksandr  Shokhin intends to attempt to get the funding increased to R49  billion. Additionally, the Russian Government will consider  whether to provide tax incentives for the importation of the  imported products required for the Goodwill Games.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORKS ALONE, LIKES IT  </P> <P> As a structural engineer in practice since 1957, I take exception to R. D.  Crowell's quote, "A one-man office is an accident waiting to happen," from the  article "Architects Are Drawing Lawsuits for Malpractice" (Nov. 5).  </P> <P> I have employed engineers, but I've worked alone for the last 13 years. My  employees were first-rate, and many are now in practice. In recent years, it  has become difficult to find people who wish to take on structural engineering  with its headaches and responsibilities.  </P> <P> As a one-man engineering operation, I prepare calculations and details, review  shop drawings, correct structural plans, coordinate with the other disciplines  and make whatever changes or corrections are necessary. It may seem like a  great deal of work for one person, but it is the most efficient way to do it  and, I believe, the best way to eliminate costly errors.  </P> <P> Also, on large projects with weekly construction meetings where all of the  disciplines are present, when the contractor asks questions about facets of  one's work, I have no problem responding. On the other hand, architect's or  engineer's representatives often cannot answer until they contact their boss.  </P> <P> Owners take a dim view of this delay, and later, if they feel that the  professionals they hired let them down, don't mind calling an attorney for  imagined or valid grievances.  </P> <P> Incidentally, not surprisingly, I don't carry insurance.  </P> <P> FRANK L. BURKE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

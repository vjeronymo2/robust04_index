Substances capable of forming solid solutions with  periclase, which have lattice defects and thereby accelerate  diffusion processes, significantly affect solid phase sintering.  Effective activity has been observed in oxides having greater  valency than magnesium. There appears to be contradictory  evidence in the case of interaction of magnesium oxide with  CeO[.sub]2[/] and Nd[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. In the  present work with these oxides, phase composition of calcined  samples was controlled with a special device and lattice  parameters were deduced from profile lines obtained by scanning  diffractometry. Microstructure was studied with both reflected  and transmitted light. The results of the investigation led to  the development of a technology for the preparation of a  vacuum-tight structured periclase ceramic which functions  successfully while in contact with melts and vapors of  high-melting alkali metals and carbons. Stable metal-ceramic  structural materials of the ceramic-alloyed steel-ceramic type,  capable of being used in electronics and magnetohydrodynamics,  were prepared by thermal-compression welding under vacuum.

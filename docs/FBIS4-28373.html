			<p>BFN     [Text] Reliable sources at the Defense Ministry of the  puppets say that Tie Banh [co-defense minister of the Royal  Government of Cambodia] has embezzled about $10 million in  foreign aid. Tie Banh has given some of this money to Hun Sen's  wife and to Pol Saroeun [deputy chief of staff of the Khmer  Royal Armed Forces]. The $10 million is part of around $50  million provided by foreign countries for Cambodia's  construction. However, allies have given advice to puppets of  the communist Vietnamese and the two-headed government to divert  this money to buy tanks, artillery pieces, and ammunition for  launching military operations in the recent 16th dry season.    This information concerning Tie Banh's embezzlement of $10  million came from a high-ranking puppet officer who has not  received his share. This officer said that troops on the  battlefields have not received their salaries and that they have  no money, no supplies, no foodstuffs, and no medicine. They  sleep in the rough exposed to rain and wind, while officers who  are not doing the fighting have been amassing the money destined  for the troops. These officers are exploiting the troops. The  officer also said that he will try to find ways to expose to the  public Tie Banh's embezzlement, information that is only known  among the circles of high-ranking officers and puppet leaders.</p>

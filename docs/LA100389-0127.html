The 16-kilometer  "Walk for William" will begin at 8 a.m. at the Festival Amphitheatre in Garden  Grove.  </P> <P> "We're hoping for 100 walkers," Susan Baldwin-Wenner, the newly hired general  manager of the Grove's Gem Theatre, said Monday. "At this point we have 50  walkers." She said the Festival Guild hopes to raise as much as $25,000 for the  cash-strapped theater between the walk-a-thon and a previously announced  "Shakespeare Closet Sale" of costumes from Grove productions, which is also  being held Oct. 14 at the amphitheater.  </P> <P> The route for the walk will wind through the streets of Garden Grove over a  four-kilometer course.

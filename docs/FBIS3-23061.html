Reliable sources have informed EXPRESO that the transfers  occurred at the end of January, and that it included a  high-ranking DINCOTE colonel and other PNP unit chiefs.    It must be noted that EXPRESO was the first to report, at  the  beginning of February, that the PNP had implemented a 30 percent  reduction in DINCOTE personnel.    This reduction is part of the announced "streamlining" of  police force personnel, which was disclosed not so long ago by  PNP General Director Victor Alva Plasencia.    According to the same source, DINCOTE has already submitted  to the PNP General Staff the names of the 300 DINCOTE agents who  will be fired.    The officer added that it is still unknown whether all of  these agents will be transferred to the SIN or to other police  units, and that this situation is causing uncertainty among  DINCOTE personnel.</p>

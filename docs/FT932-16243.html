			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Clinton forced to postpone Dollars 16bn stimulus spending bill PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and his Democratic allies in Congress have bowed to the immovability of Senate Republicans and agreed to put off consideration of the president's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn) stimulus spending bill until after the two-week recess. Senator George Mitchell, the Democrats' leader in the Senate, and Senator Robert Byrd, chairman of the appropriations committee, have been given the go-ahead by the White House to negotiate with their Republican counterparts on a compromise that might allow the bill to come to a vote. Although the Democrats have enough votes to pass the spending package, they lack the three-fifths majority required under the Senate's eccentric rules of procedure to shut off debate. The Republican filibuster showed less physical endurance than past efforts to hold up legislation, such as Senator Strom Thurmond's record 24-hour speech against civil rights legislation in 1957. Nevertheless it appears to have been effective, in forcing the Democratic majority to back off. Mr Clinton said yesterday he was 'working on a proposal that I think will address some of the legitimate expressed objections.' But he remained pugnacious in tone, and it appeared unlikely that he would be willing to cut enough spending from the bill to satisfy the opposition. He accused the Republicans of thwarting majority rule, and of political posturing. 'It's just more gridlock and I think the people will rebel against it,' Mr Clinton said. Mr Clinton's problem in the Senate could be repeated in future. So long as the 43 Republicans remain united against him, the 57 Democrats will fall short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster - even in the unlikely event that they too remain united. Party loyalties are rarely solid in the Congress, and especially not in the Senate. Indeed, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, though nominally Democratic, has voted so consistently against Mr Clinton that party whips are virtually discounting him when they count up likely votes. But a number of other Democratic conservatives, especially from the south and west, are also potential defectors on several critical issues. They include Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, Senator Howell Heflin of Alabama, Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona. Senator Robert Krueger of Texas, who was appointed to fill the seat vacated by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, now the treasury secretary, has also voted against the administration line, but some political analysts suggest he is trying to prove his independence before his by-election next month, and may prove more amenable in future, if he survives. Republican party loyalty is generally stronger, but a number of centrist senators, including four from New England, have proved unreliable on occasion.</p>

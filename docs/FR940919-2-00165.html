			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the NYSE, REIT Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine the protection of a portion of the principal amount of the MITTS with potential additional payments based upon the performance of a portfolio of securities representing 20 highly capitalized REITs. In particular, the proposed REIT Portfolio MITTS will provide 90% principal protection of the original issue price at maturity with the opportunity to participate in the dividend stream related to the REIT Portfolio components plus any upside appreciation of the underlying REIT Portfolio. REIT Portfolio MITTS will mature in August 2000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of June 6, 1994, the REIT Portfolio consisted of the common stock of 20 REITs that have significantly different levels of market capitalization, ranging from a high of approximately $2.3 billion (Simon Property Group, Inc.) to a low of approximately $216 million (Excel Realty Trust, Inc.). Also as of June 6, 1994, the exchange market prices of the components of the REIT Portfolio ranged from a high of $40.25 to a low of $11.25. The average daily trading volume for the components of the REIT Portfolio for the period from January 16, 1994, through July 14, 1994, ranged from a high of approximately 145,318 shares to a low of approximately 22,030 shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The common stocks of 19 of the 20 component REITs are listed on the Exchange and the common stock of the other component REIT is traded on the American Stock Exchange (``Amex''). The initial weightings of the components of the REIT Portfolio will be based upon each stock's relative liquidity ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , relative trading volume in dollars) in the Untied States; provided, however, that no component may represent more than 10% of the Original Portfolio Value. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amendment No. 1, supra note 5. For purposes of this calculation, the weight of any component that would otherwise exceed 10% of the Original Portfolio Value will be reduced to 10%. The remainder of the Original Portfolio Value will then be allocated among the remaining components of the REIT Portfolio based on relative liquidity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine relative liquidity, Merrill Lynch will compare the average daily consolidated dollar volume of a stock over the 90-day period immediately preceding the date on which the REIT Portfolio MITTS are priced for issuance to the average daily consolidated dollar volume for all of the stocks in the REIT Portfolio for that 90-day period. As of June 6, 1994, the highest weighting for any stock in the REIT Portfolio was 10.00% <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  and the weighting for the five components with the highest relative liquidity was 42.50%. Also as of that date, the lowest weighting for any stock in the REIT Portfolio was 1.58% and the weighting for the five components with the lowest relative liquidity was 10.24%. For the six-month period from January 16, 1994, through July 14, 1994, the average dollar daily trading volume of the components ranged from a high of $2,468,375 (Simon Property Group, Inc.) to a low of $345,618 (Western Investment Real Estate Trust). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The weight of this component (Simon Property Group, Inc.) was reduced from 10.22% to 10% as a result of the modified weighting system described herein.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except for certain multiplier adjustments discussed below, once the initial weightings have been determined, the multipliers will remain constant throughout the term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The value of the REIT Portfolio MITTS at any point in time will equal the aggregate for the components of the price of each component times the multiplier for that component plus the cumulative dividends paid on each component since the issue date for the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The multipliers assigned to the component REITs will be adjusted for certain events such as stock splits, reverse stock splits, or stock dividends, and the value of the common stock of the component REITs will also be adjusted for certain events including a liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, merger, or consolidation involving the issuer of the underlying shares. For example, if the issuer of the shares underlying a component REIT has been subject to a merger or a consolidation and is not the surviving entity, then the value for such common stock will be determined at the time such issuer is merged or consolidated and will equal the last available exchange market price for such common stock plus the cumulative dividends paid on that stock from the date of issuance of the REIT Portfolio MITTS through that date. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  That value will then be constant for the remaining term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. In addition, no adjustments of any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the multiplier then in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the issuer of a portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, insolvency, or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the REIT Portfolio so long as an exchange market price for such security is available. If an exchange market price is no longer available for a portfolio security, including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any other similar proceeding, then the value of that portfolio security used in calculating both the daily value of the REIT Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio Value, will be equal to the cumulative dividends paid on that stock from the date of issuance of the REIT Portfolio MITTS through that date. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  This value will be used as long as no exchange market price exists for that security. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Merrill Lynch will not attempt to find a replacement stock or to compensate for the extinction of a security due to bankruptcy or a similar event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based upon the exchange reported prices of the common stock of the component REITs, an independent third party will calculate and disseminate the value of the REIT Portfolio no less frequently than once every minute during the trading day. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If for any reason during the term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS the issuer is unable to obtain an independent third party to calculate the value of the REIT Portfolio, the issuer and the Exchange shall immediately notify the Commission to discuss the implementation of adequate procedures to protect investors and minimize any potential for manipulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

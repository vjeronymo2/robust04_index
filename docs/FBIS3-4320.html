Since the 1980s more and more of China's rural areas have  begun to develop methane, electric, solar, wind and geothermal  energy.    Electricity is now accessible to 87 percent of China's rural  areas, and 5.8 million Chinese households are benefiting from  methane, which is clean and easy to use.    Hogpens and toilets, which used to breed flies and  mosquitoes, have become enclosed methane-generating pits. Offal  and waste water from slaughterhouses are also being used to  produce methane.    While exploiting new forms of energy, farmers have been  motivated to save as much energy as possible. At present, 150  million Chinese farmers are using firewood-saving stoves.    Statistics show that the energy newly developed and saved in  China's rural areas each year is equal to that produced by 80  million tons of standard coal.    But experts said there is still a long way to go before the  energy problem in rural areas can be solved fundamentally.  While 120 million rural people still have no access to  electricity, there is also much waste of energy.</p>

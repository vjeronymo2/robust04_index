			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Warning of 'chaos' over council tax COUNCIL TAX could produce as much administrative chaos as poll tax unless it is changed significantly, the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux (Nacab) warned yesterday. Nacab says in a report comparing plans for council tax with its experience of poll tax that clear information about the operation of the new tax should be made available well before its introduction. Nacab also wants an option for taxpayers to pay weekly, and says they should be allowed to pay any council-tax debts by 'realistic instalments' before bailiffs are called in. Nacab adds that much tighter regulation of bailiffs is needed. The 456 Citizens' Advice Bureaux are still dealing with 14,000 queries a month about poll tax, also called the community charge, and Nacab recommends 100 per cent poll-tax rebates for those on low incomes compared with the present 80 per cent ceiling. Ms Ann Abraham, Nacab chief executive, said: 'From registration right through to arrears and enforcement, bureaux all over the country have seen thousands of people in difficulties over paying their community charge. The government is in danger of making the same mistakes with the council tax.' Charging Into The Tax. Nacab, 115 Pentonville Road, London N1 9LZ. Pounds 5.</p>

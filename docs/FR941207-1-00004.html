This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal would require various inspections for cracks in the outboard chord of the frame  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at Body Station (BS) 727 and in the outboard chord of Stringer 18A; and repair or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement of cracked parts. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those outboard chords. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such fatigue cracking, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the outboard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chords, and subsequent rapid decompression of the airplane.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by February 3, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;159&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through Friday, except Federal holidays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The service information referenced in the proposed rule may be obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O.

There also have been reports of cracking in the outboard chord  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Stringer 18A. These cracks were found on eight airplanes that had accumulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between 39,000 and 54,100 flight hours, and between 56,200 and 73,200 flight cycles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cracks have been determined to be caused by fatigue that was initiated by fretting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjacent parts. Fatigue cracks in the chords, if not detected and corrected in a timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner, could result in reduced structural integrity of the structure, and subsequent rapid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decompression of the airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 737&hyph;53A1166, dated June 30, 1994, which describes procedures for the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repetitive inspections:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Close visual inspections to detect cracking of the edge of the forward flange of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. High frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracking of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fastener holes in the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Pulse echo shear wave (PESW) inspections to detect cracking in the area of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two forward lower fastener holes in the outboard chord where Stringer 18A is attached;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. HFEC inspections to detect cracking of the outboard surface of the outboard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chord of Stringer 18A at Station 727 and of the surface around the heads of two fasteners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for either the installation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time-limited repair or the replacement of the chords, if any crack is found in the outboard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chord of the frame at BS 727. (The alert service bulletin references Boeing Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bulletin 737&hyph;53&hyph;1088 as an additional source of service information for replacement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the outboard chords.) In addition, the alert service bulletin describes procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of a preventative modification, which, when accomplished, eliminates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for repetitive inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections for cracks in the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727 and in the outboard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chord of Stringer 18A; and repair or replacement of cracked parts. The proposed AD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would also provide for an optional terminating action for the required inspections. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 999 Boeing Model 737&hyph;100 and &hyph;200 series airplanes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 296 airplanes of U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours per airplane to accomplish each of the proposed inspections, and that the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection requirements of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $71,040, or $240 per airplane, per inspection cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should an operator elect to accomplish the optional terminating action that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be provided by this AD action, it would take approximately 50 work hours to accomplish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $3,680 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> optional terminating action is estimated to be $6,680 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

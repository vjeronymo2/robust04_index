			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "The government has not  considered the issue of imposing a tax upon foreign  investments", Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets  told TASS on Thursday. Soskovets dismissed reports by some mass  media that the government was drafting a document to raise  import duties. He noted, however, that following the recent  rise in import tariffs, "a commission will be set up to specify  these issues".    The first deputy prime minister believes the draft federal  budget for 1994, which was submitted by the government to the  State Duma, should be taken as a basis. He is confident that  this document provides a most thorough analysis of all items of  revenues and expenditures. The draft budget "is to be finalized  and approved within the next few weeks", Soskovets reported.  "For the time being, the government has to manage with the  quarter budget", he said. The first vice-premier declined to  give any comments as concerns wage indexation for  state-subsidized industries in the second quarter of 1994. He  admitted, however, that the government did not have the  necessary resources.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNK BOND DEFAULTS AT HIGHEST LEVEL IN 20 YEARS;  </P> <P> FINANCE: THE FAILURE RATE ON HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES HAS BEEN 5.8% SO FAR THIS  YEAR.  </P> <P> Junk bond defaults rose in the first half of 1990 to a rate that, if sustained  the rest of the year, would generate the highest corporate bond default rate in  20 years, an investment service says.  </P> <P> In the first seven months of the year, 32 high-yield bond issuers defaulted --  a default rate of 5.8%, according to John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's  Investor Service Inc.  </P> <P> If maintained, it would be the highest default rate since the collapse of the  Penn Central railroad accounted for a 10.9% rate in 1970, Lonski said.  </P> <P> Analysts say a weak economy and higher oil prices make it a good possibility  that the near-record default rate this year will be sustained.  </P> <P> As the economy slows and higher gasoline and heating oil prices leave consumers  with less money to spend in casinos, department stores and on new homes,  businesses will have less cash to make interest and principal payments, Lonski  said.  </P> <P> "I don't think we've passed the bottom yet in all likelihood, especially for  the highly leveraged firms that depend on discretionary income," he said.  </P> <P> Prices of issues that usually ride up and down with the business cycle have  taken a pounding since Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, causing oil prices to  skyrocket.  </P> <P> Numbers compiled by Citicorp show that returns on junk bonds issued by  recession-prone industries suffered the most in the first half of August.  Casinos dropped 7.8%, building materials fell 7.1% and retailers were off 3.6%.  </P> <P> Toilet maker American Standard Inc., which relies heavily on energy in making  its ceramics, saw its 12 7/8% senior subordinated debentures, which mature in  the year 2000, skid from 93 to the high 80s last week.  </P> <P> Junk bonds are debt securities typically issued by companies that lack  investment-grade credit. Often used to raise capital for expansion, they carry  high interest rates to compensate for their risk.  </P> <P> A recession would hit steeply leveraged companies particularly hard because  their fixed costs include huge principal and interest payments, Lonski said.  When looking to cut expenses, capital spending and employment are likely to be  hit harder than if a company didn't have a high debt obligation.  </P> <P> Even industries such as food, tobacco and health care, whose fortunes tend to  resist economic downturns, could be hurt as consumers resist price hikes that  heavily indebted companies have relied upon to boost cash flow, Lonski said.  </P> <P> Citicorp's numbers show returns on health-care issues dropping 0.9% and  broadcasting issues 1.7% in the first half of August.  </P> <P> On the other side of the coin, there are likely to be some bond-issuing winners  in the post-Iraqi invasion climate. One segment, Lonski said, is utilities that  rely heavily on nuclear power to produce electricity.  </P> <P> Arizona Public Service Co. and Philadelphia Electric Co. are examples of  utilities with speculative-grade bonds that have substantial nuclear-power  generating capabilities, he said.  </P></p>

The chairman of the organization,  Boris Kakubava, member of the Georgian parliament; the political  secretary, Malkhaz Pataraia; and Abkhazia's military commissar,  Vakhtang Vekua, answered journalists' questions.    Boris Kakubava blamed the government because for four  months,  since handing over Abkhazia, it had done nothing for the return  to Abkhazia, in the same way as we were evicted from there.    They criticized sharply the Geneva talks. We are not against  talks, said Kakubava, but we must have a reserve of permanent  armed forces and must not allow the Russian troops under the  auspices of the UN into Abkhazia.    The members of the organization expressed the wish that as  of  now, representatives of the evicted population of Abkhazia  participate in talks on settling the conflict. They protested  against the return of refugees in the Gali rayon and justified  their protest by the fact that it was being conducted under the  jurisdiction of the [Abkhaz] separatists and that the civilians  would have no security guarantees. Our only aim is to return to  Abkhazia, said Boris Kakubava, and every lost day makes it  unlikely.</p>

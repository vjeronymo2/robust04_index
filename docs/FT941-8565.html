			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (6): All quiet (almost) on the political front - Labour faces a hard task after a second defeat The overwhelming impression of politics in Malta used to be one of confrontation, partisanship and often violence. But a remarkable transformation has taken place in recent years. The tension has gone and party allegiance does not now dominate every issue, however small. The change began in 1987 when the Nationalist government of Dr Eddie Fenech Adami gained power after 16 years of turbulent rule by the Labour party under the charismatic, abrasive Mr Dom Mintoff and his successor, Dr Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici. Politics at that time was conducted with the fierce intensity of a family feud, with villages, factories and football teams deeply split by party loyalties. The Labour era of the 1970s and early 1980s was characterised by a shift in international allegiances. The country that had obtained independence from Britain in 1964 became a republic a decade later. British forces were forced to leave in 1979 after 180 years, and pacts were signed with Libya, the former Soviet Union, China and North Korea. On the domestic front, policy focused on state enterprise, wage freezes, strict credit regulations and severe import restrictions. It was as tightly controlled an economy as any outside the old Soviet bloc. Under the Nationalist government, re-elected with an increased majority two years ago, the focus has changed dramatically. A pro-west, pro-European Union membership ticket has proved a vote winner. The economy has been transformed by liberal trade policies and the introduction of a private enterprise culture. Dr Fenech Adami became Nationalist leader in 1977 when he took over as a relative unknown from Dr George Borg Olivier, the former premier, with the task of reviving the limp fortunes of a demoralised party trounced at the polls twice in five years by Dom Mintoff. The keynote of his strategy since gaining power has been to reform by stealth, and this has sometimes laid him open to criticism of fudging and blurring issues that need to be faced. But Dr Fenech Adami insists he has to perform a difficult balancing act to change the country's culture, and that to go too fast would be fatal. His softly-softly approach has also puzzled many of his own supporters who were initially longing for the perks that power in Malta traditionally brings. It has not been an easy political path for Labour, either. After 16 turbulent years in office its image as an ideologically militant socialist party has been hard to shake off. At the last election Dr Mifsud Bonnici failed to reassure the increasingly important bloc of floating voters that Labour would not again unleash the disruptive passions and violence of the past. Labour reacted to its second defeat by changing its leader and cutting formal links with the trade unions. Dr Alfred Sant, 46, is a writer and intellectual, with a master's degree in physics from Malta and a doctorate in business administration from Harvard. He has also served as a diplomat in Brussels. He admits his task has not been an easy one. 'After two election defeats, morale was bound to dip. We are having to fight back by reviewing all aspects of policy,' says Dr Sant in an interview at the party's Senglea headquarters outside Valletta. His attitude is essentially pragmatic. There is an acceptance that the economy has moved forward under the Nationalists, partly through deficit financing, the impressive growth in tourism, and buoyancy in the construction industry, and there is an admission that the liberalisation of imports has worked in the government's favour. 'More jobs have been created in services, and we did not sufficiently appreciate the impact on employment of opening up Malta to more trade,' Dr Sant says. However, he questions how permanent the growth in service industry jobs will be and expresses anxiety about the lack of greenfield investments in manufacturing. His main task is to improve the party's image, which he admits needs refurbishing. 'We have deliberately not developed the previous confrontational style, which we think would be politically counter-productive, and we are now formulating policies that would accept the need for competition but would provide mechanisms that would give the individual more rights,' he says. Dr Sant is regarded as an able, practical leader who will not resurrect the old partisan strategies or scare off potential foreign investors and tourists, but he has yet to unite all his party behind him. There is still a considerable 'old guard' in the Labour hierarchy who pine for the former days of autocratic power and widespread patronage, and there are signs of a damaging split with the powerful General Workers' Union led by Mr Angelo Fenech. To Dr Sant's frustration and anger, the union has allowed Mr Lorry Sant, a militant ex-Labour minister suspended from the party four years ago, access to its newspaper's columns. The GWU's decision represents the most public and serious disagreement between party and union since formal links between the two were dissolved after the last election. There are also tensions between the party and union, and between the union and government, over the cost of living and low wage awards. A series of union protest marches have been held, but it is not clear whether these herald a return to more confrontational policies or are merely shadow-boxing as a new tripartite accord between government, union and employers is discussed. An issue that is certain to divide the parties over the next few years is entry to the European Union. This is the Nationalist government's core strategy and all legislation is being drafted with membership in view. However, Labour argues that full membership could harm the country's industry and agriculture, and would lead to foreign ownership instead of foreign investment. Labour advocates a free trade area with Europe and maintenance of Malta's policy of political non-alignment.</p>

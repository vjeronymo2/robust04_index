			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Mexican bank to raise Dollars 150m in global offering Grupo Financiero GBM Atlantico, one of Mexico's regional banks, is hoping to raise up to Dollars 150m with a global share offering which is due to be priced today. GBM-Atlantico is issuing 22m 'L' shares, with 45 per cent to be offered to US investors in the form of American Depositary Shares, 30 per cent to international investors in the form of Global Depositary Shares, and 25 per cent issued to domestic investors. The shares will be priced at close of trade in Mexico today, although some market participants point out that the issue is taking place against a difficult background. 'The Mexican stock market has been relatively weak over the last month, and investors are concerned about the currency and the general political background,' said one investment banker. He added that the kidnapping of a prominent Mexican banker earlier this week has not helped investor sentiment.</p>

This is an effective means of supporting reform and  solving financial problems, and is also an important matter  concerning this year's overall situation of our work in all  fields.    Issuing national debts to raise funds for national  construction in a compensatory form is the method that has been  used for many years in our country since the beginning of reform  and opening, and this method plays an important role in  balancing the state's financial budget, supporting reform and  opening, supporting key construction projects in the national  economy, and improving the people's livelihood.    This year, the issuance of state treasury bonds is of  greater  immediate and profound far-reaching significance. As Premier Li  Peng pointed out in his government work report, the general  tasks for the whole party and the whole nation are to grasp the  opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening, promote development,  and maintain stability. In order to support the fulfillment of  these general tasks, support reform in various fields this year,  increase workers' wage income, and support agriculture, science  and technology, and capital construction at some key points, the  central government must provide sufficient financial guarantees.  This will result in increasing expenditures and reducing  financial revenues in state finances to a certain degree. Thus,  the financial deficit may become a bit larger. In order to  strengthen budgetary management and control, beginning this  year, deficits in central finances will not be made up for by  means of bank overdrafts in order to prevent the aggravation of  inflation caused by the deficit-led currency issuance.  Therefore, in addition to measures for increasing revenue and  reducing expenditures, the financial deficit of the central  government will have to be covered by means of issuing  government bonds. People's active purchase of state treasury  bonds will be their concrete action of supporting reform and  opening and supporting key state construction projects.    Through purchase of state treasury bonds, part of the  consumption funds and idle money scattered in society may be  turned into state's construction funds and used to guarantee key  state construction projects and economic development. In fact,  this is structural redistribution of financial resources in  society. Such practice not only solves financial insufficiency,  but also prevents excessive increase in the money supply. It  gives correct guidance to the flow of funds in society, and also  helps increase the lasting momentum of national economic  development and mitigates inflation pressure. The people may  also benefit from such results. Therefore, purchasing state  treasury bonds is a good thing beneficial to the state and the  people.    In recent years, with the gradual establishment of the  market  for government bonds, a favorable tendency to take an active  part in trading and purchasing state treasury bonds has appeared  among the masses. People have paid more attention to making  financial investments, mainly through purchasing state treasury  bonds. Government bonds not only play a role in raising  construction funds for the state, but have also become a major  means of saving and investment.    This year, consideration was also given to the personal  interest of bond purchasers when arrangements were made for the  issuance of state treasury bonds, and more sales points were set  up so that purchasers would find it easier to buy the bonds.  Various specialized banks and post savings offices have set up  tens of thousands of bond selling points. Securities companies,  government bond service centers, and the securities departments  of trust and investment companies also are involved in selling  state treasury bonds. All relevant sales points should act  positively and adopt various measures to make things more  convenient for investors. The masses should be able to feel  that investing in state treasury bonds will bring stable returns  to them, and should also be able to feel that it is convenient  to purchase and resell the bonds.    We believe that with the full understanding and great  support  of the people throughout the country, with the leadership of the  people's governments at all levels, and with the joint efforts  of the institutions involved in the process, the task of issuing  state treasury bonds this year will certainly be fulfilled.</p>

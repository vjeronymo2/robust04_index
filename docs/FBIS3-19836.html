Of the approximately 4 billion  schillings that have so far been invested by foreigners, about 1  billion has come from Austria. About 25 percent of the 4,500  joint ventures and subsidiaries in Slovakia are controlled or  owned by Austrian enterprises, Katharina Dragschitz, deputy  trade delegate to Bratislava, said at a symposium on  Slovak-Austrian relations in Moravany near Pistyan. In 1993,  Austrian exports amounted to 4.1 billion schillings while  products worth 3 billion schillings were imported from Slovakia  last year.    For Slovakia, Austria's accession to the European Union [EU]  would be of major importance because Vienna supports the  integration of East and Central Europe into the community, Jan  Lisucha, state secretary in the Slovak Foreign Ministry, said.  Austria was playing an important role for Slovakia in  connection with other issues, too: Some embassies in Vienna are  accredited for Slovakia, and many Western companies are dealing  with the Slovak market via Vienna. Bilateral contacts in the  spheres of culture, science, and the arts have intensified.  However, new border checkpoints must be opened, Lisucha noted.  [passage omitted]</p>

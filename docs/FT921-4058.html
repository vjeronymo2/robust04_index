			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont's lament for gilts FT-SE Index: 2,574.8 (+24.1) The City may have been hoping for some nice surprises from Mr Lamont yesterday. In the event, it received one nasty one. Next year's PSBR will be some Pounds 4bn higher than most forecasters expected, even after the most niggardly of tax cuts. The only consolation for those who have been discounting a Tory victory was that the Budget takes some wind out of Labour's sails. Labour would find it awkward to unwind yesterday's tax cuts. Whoever wins the election will be saddled with a PSBR of 4.5 per cent of GDP. Labour could scarcely finance an ambitious programme without steep tax increases. That, however, is a mere theoretical advantage. It is a long way from the budget guaranteed to win electoral support for which the City had hoped. The prospective Pounds 28bn PSBR was already weighing on both sterling and the gilts market last night. Interest cuts look more remote than ever. There was a disappointing limpness in the chancellor's reiteration of the commitment to put sterling into narrow bands. The danger of the vicious circle still lurks in which currency weakness and the government's dwindling standing in the polls feed on each other. Against this background, it is difficult to see why the FT-SE should hold on to yesterday's 1 per cent gain. The market may have expected the chancellor to trim his 1992 growth forecast; it had scarcely an inkling of the extent to which revenue erosion has caused the PSBR to balloon. The Bank of England has virtually satisfied its funding needs for this year, but was quick to announce an increase in the size of its regular auctions. Equities will thus face extra competition for investors' money. Even the market's modest recovery hopes may be dented by the daunting scale of the effort that will eventually be needed to put the government's finances back on an orderly footing.</p>

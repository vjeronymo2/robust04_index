			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter addressed by Lieutenant General Marin Pancea, </F> secretary of the Supreme Defense Council and counselor to  President Ion Iliescu, to Ion Cristoiu, editor in chief of  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI]    [Text] Mr. Ion Cristoiu,    Being convinced of the fact that the following will be  integrally published in the pages of the daily you head in order  to more "fully" inform public opinion, I am sending you this  letter and also ask for your concrete support.    I have learned from the 14 March 1994 issue of EVENIMENTUL  ZILEI that I have a new capacity -- besides being a KGB and GRU  agent, about which I also learned from the press, and that news  was also carried by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI as well -- namely that now  I am also "a spy for the French secret service."    Owing to the fact that the remuneration I am entitled to  from  that secret service to which you referred has yet not been  remitted to me, I am asking for your support in my efforts to  collect the amount the French secret service owes me in exchange  for the information I offered them about the sessions of the  Supreme Defense Council of the country, and which, according to  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, were "channeled" there via your hero, Radu  Petrica Popa, whom the daily you head presented not as a crook,  but rather as a victim of deception.    I am counting on your "good will," because as far as I can  see, you have already specialized in investigating and clearing  up cases such as mine, although, considering that this is an  espionage case, you should have kept total secrecy and "whisper  about it solely in my ears," and then we might have been able to  find a mutually profitable formula to "secludedly" split the  reward I am entitled to from the French secret service and  which, I presume, must be a very substantial one, given  especially my high capacity, rank, and value.    However, owing to the fact that your daily has already aired  the issue in public, we now have to obey the rules of  consistency, because now we cannot afford to hide anything and  therefore I hope that you will accept that our mutual  "cooperation" should be done also in public, although in this  case, I ought to warn you, I am not ready to split the dollars  with you.    Hoping that you will publish this letter and thanking you in  advance for your support, yours,    THE SECRETARY OF THE SUPREME DEFENSE COUNCIL OF THE COUNTRY  [title in capital letters as published],    Lieutenant General Marin Pancea</p>

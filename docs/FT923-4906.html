			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UN seals treaty to outlaw chemical weapons The United Nations-sponsored Conference on Disarmament agreed yesterday to send a treaty banning chemical weapons to the United Nations for approval, despite a last-minute Iranian move which threatened to block it, Reuter reports from Geneva. The decision ended 24 years of negotiations on the pact, which will be the first to ban the use, possession and manufacture of chemical arms. Negotiations on the pact, replacing the 1925 Geneva Protocol which banned simply the use of chemical weapons, began in 1968 but were deadlocked by Cold War rivalries. The talks gained momentum after Mr Mikhail Gorbachev achieved power in Moscow even though the old Soviet Union did not admit until 1987 that it had any chemical weapons. But even after the long negotiations the 190-page draft text which will go before the UN General Assembly later this year only just scraped through the 39-nation conference. Iran, terming itself the last victim of chemical attacks during its 1980-88 war with Iraq, said yesterday that it would veto the adoption of the treaty because of the composition of the body that will police it. Iran held separate negotiations with other Asian members in an apparent attempt to ensure that it was fully represented on the 41-member executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The organisation will be based in The Hague. The Asian nations, which will have nine seats on the council, decided to continue negotiations among themselves on how to distribute their seats. Other Asian members, including China and Pakistan, had earlier expressed strong reservations about the treaty, largely because they saw its inspection regime as too intrusive. After almost seven hours of bickering and to an ironic round of applause, the conference finally agreed to pass the draft treaty to the UN General Assembly.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Times Mirror sees difficult year TIMES Mirror, the US publishing group, expects 1993 to be a difficult year. The group also expects to take special charges against fourth-quarter 1992 earnings, although it declined to detail them, Reuter reports from New York. The company said it expected 1993 first-quarter earnings to be affected by several 'serious impediments'. Times Mirror earned 26 cents per share in the 1991 first quarter, before a non-recurring gain. The fourth-quarter charges will include those for restructuring publisher Matthew Bender and adoption of an accounting change on post-retirement benefits.</p>

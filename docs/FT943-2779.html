			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Intelligence report helps shape strategy The government's refusal to accept unequivocally that the IRA ceasefire is permanent persists even though an intelligence assessment says that the IRA's internal discipline is holding. Before announcing the lifting of the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and the opening of some border roads, the government was advised by security experts that the IRA leadership remained committed to the ceasefire. Yet security officials are thought also to have advised the government that there were hardliners in the IRA who agreed to the ceasefire because of raised expectations about the speed of the government's response. The most immediate threat of renewed violence is thought to come from loyalist paramilitaries, who are ignoring the advice of more moderate unionist politicians and are prepared to exploit anxieties in the unionist community. The referendum announcement is aimed at minimising that risk. There have been some symbolic gestures since the IRA ceasefire such as ordering British soldiers to wear berets instead of helmets, but security forces have not relaxed their monitoring of suspected terrorists and their sympathisers. One area of concern is thought to be the civil disobedience campaign by Sinn Fein, which includes the illegal opening of border crossings. The security forces are also aware that some army and police personnel continue to be tracked by IRA 'intelligence' units. British intelligence is thought to be keeping a close watch on any arms movements by paramilitaries and whether they are using the ceasefire to re-arm. There is still uncertainty about whether the ceasefire has brought about any significant change in the paramilitaries' fundraising activities. It is against this background that the government appears to have opted in public for caution - awaiting reassurance from security advisers that the military situation remains under control while being seen to maintain an even-handed approach to the peace process. The strategy includes moderating its objections to a US visa being granted to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader.</p>

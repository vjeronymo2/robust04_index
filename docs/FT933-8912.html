			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / British Coal seeks up to 15 pit closures in 8 months BRITISH COAL wants to close up to half its 30 working pits within eight months after a thorough investigation of the energy market persuaded it that only about a dozen pits have a long-term future. British Coal's latest prognosis is far worse than anything it has acknowledged publicly to date. It means a significantly larger contraction of the industry than the government admitted was in prospect even last October, when public anger forced a retreat on widespread pit closure plans. In considering whether to sanction 15 closures in the current financial year ending on March 27, as British Coal would prefer, ministers will be wary of stirring controversy at a time when they need maximum Conservative backbench support for coal privatisation this year and next. The Department of Trade and Industry is thought to have accepted the economic case for the 15 closures. Hesitation in implementing them stems from concern about the political consequences. Ministers and British Coal are, however, acutely aware that delay will store up problems for the 12 or so core pits that are likely to comprise the company when it is privatised. British Coal's stockpiles, already above 14m tonnes, are growing at up to 1m tonnes a month. The higher they rise the greater the likelihood that private sector operators will add to the closure list in future years. Mr Gerard McCloskey, disclosing British Coal's thinking in his Financial Times International Coal Report weekly facsimile to subscribers, says that not even 12 pits will survive long term if new private sector mine owners opt to meet contracts from stocks. Pressure is building for a closures announcement as early as next month. The simultaneous closure of 15 pits is unlikely following the reaction to last October's announcement. More likely, British Coal will announce fewer than half a dozen closures at first. More would follow piecemeal throughout the remainder of the financial year, with public reaction influencing how many can close. British Coal's problems stem from the coal white paper in March which reprieved 12 pits earmarked for closure in October 1992 but did little to find a market for their coal. Since then, the electricity generators, which are British Coal's main customers, have shown reluctance to buy coal above existing contracts. Moroever, sales to generators under these contracts will fall from 40m tonnes this year to 30m in 1994-95, making closures among the previous core of 19 pits inevitable. The government is committed to offer to the private sector any pits no longer wanted by British Coal in the run-up to privatisation. Companies will be offered subsidies for any coal they can sell to the generators before privatisation. British Coal last night refused to comment on how many closures would be necessary.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (14): Toughness needed - Environmental degradation must be reversed STUNG BY international donor criticism, Mauritius has started work on a comprehensive environmental policy aimed at preventing further serious degradation of its fragile resource base. Reversing the serious damage done to the environment from the past eight years of rapid but unregulated growth in manufacturing and the tourism sector will be a big challenge, requiring some tough - and politically and economically courageous - decisions. However, for some of the environmental damage already done - such as the destruction of part of the marine and coral life around Grand Baie, caused by from the discharge of untreated sewage into the sea by the mushrooming hotel industry - government awareness has come too late. The critical challenge for government lies in balancing the often conflicting demands of enhancing 'the second phase' of economic growth, while spending money and instituting controls and regulations on businesses to preserve the environment. A comprehensive 400 page report, prepared by the Mauritian government for the presentation at the Rio Earth Summit last June, recognises this. 'The rapid pace of industrialisation has admittedly given rise to a degradation of the environment which to a large extent stems from haphazard development and poor planning,' the report says. But it also stresses the need for a pragmatic policy towards the industrial sector and the need to 'frame intervention to protect the environment at least cost to industry." Whether the government will be able to tread this tightrope, successfully trading off environmental concerns with demands for even faster growth, remains questionable - given the political strength of business interest groups. But there seems to be widespread recognition of the problems and the need for action. The creation of a Ministry of the Environment in 1990 was a turning point in the Mauritian government's environmental awareness and in its efforts to construct a comprehensive policy structure. Among the pressing environmental problems identified by the new ministry are: The need to arrest coral depletion by coral sand mining companies, by introducing incentives for switching to basaltic sand. 600,000 tonnes of coral sand are used every year in the building industry. The ministry has stopped allocating new licences to coral sand dealers, and will carry out a review by next June, with a view to phasing out the trade completely. Tackling the heavy use of agrochemicals and fertiliser. A National Physical Development Plan to relocate economic activities and allocate scarce land resources in an environmentally friendly way. An important upgrading of solid waste management and the development of a sewerage master plan. Rubbish dumps are to be phased out; in future all waste will be transported to transfer sites, where it will be compacted into bales and then taken to land-fill sites. Five of these have already been identified and are being prepared. The promotion of environmental protection and low waste technologies through incentives, loans and subsidies to Mauritian manufacturers, particularly the worse environmental offenders such as the textile dyeing houses, sugar factories, stone crushing plants and boilers. Introduction of the 'polluter pays principle' through charges, penalties and taxes. Creation of a special industrial estate for high pollution industries where skilled technicians can work to reduce environmental damage. Zoning of marine parks to protect marine life and coral reefs. Mr Bashir Khodabux, environment and quality of life minister, says that identification of these problems by the ministry's 400 page report has been a significant plank in the government's policy. Passage of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) in July last year has also laid the legislative framework for the next phase of quantitative action. Under the Act, all new projects must be subject to an environmental impact assessment, which will allow the ministry to impose environmental conditions into the project plan. For existing businesses the government is developing a series of quantifiable 'norms and standards' under the EPA to control the emission of effluents, smoke, noise, odour and water purity. The standards are now at the solicitor general's office, and will then go through a process of public comment. 'As soon as these standards are prescribed by law we shall start inspecting premises,' said Mr Khodabux. 'We are not going to be dictatorial. We want a consensual approach and we want to be pragmatic and practical but we do also want to start seriously on environmental action.' The minister believes the process will be completed by January 1993. 'As from that date Mauritius will have a pragmatic but effective environmental policy.' A number of other studies and projects are also under way - funded by donors who pledged Dollars 93m in 1989 for an environmental programme. The list of ongoing projects includes funding technical specialists and scientists; establishing four environmental laboratories; providing infrastructure for the special industrial park; an emergency sewage project for Baie de Tombeau; preparation and implementation of a National Sewage Master Plan; establishment of a hazardous substance control board and plans to improve pesticide use and regulation. Observers say that the Mauritian government has moved swiftly, albeit after a long period of damaging inaction, to prepare a sweeping environmental policy. The critical question which remains, however, is whether the g o v e r n m e n t has the political will to implement its policies effectively - especially in the face of business opposition and claims that environmental protection is costly, and acts as a brake on development.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATIONS BAN CBS RELEASES;  </P> <P> BOYCOTT: BLACK OUTLETS HIT SONY OVER JAPANESE CABINET MINISTER'S SLUR.  </P> <P> Two black-owned radio stations are boycotting new releases from Sony Corp.'s  CBS Records because of a racial slur by a Japanese Cabinet minister, a station  official said today.  </P> <P> Joe Tamburro, programming director for WDAS-FM, said his station and WDAS-AM  will continue to play CBS records but will not play any new releases.  </P> <P> Tamburro said "a whole bunch of stuff" came out this week that the station has  not played.  </P> <P> The boycott is in retaliation for a comment made recently by Japanese Justice  Minister Seiroku Kajiyama, who compared prostitutes in Tokyo to black Americans  who move into white neighborhoods and force whites out.  </P> <P> Kajiyama, who has since apologized for the slur, made the statement after  watching a raid on prostitutes in a red-light district in Tokyo.  </P> <P> "It's like in America when neighborhoods become mixed because blacks move in  and whites are forced out," the official said.  </P> <P> Tamburro said he did not know how long the record boycott will be in effect.  </P> <P> "We're giving CBS an opportunity to respond to the racist statement by the  Japanese government," he said. "Certainly a company as large as Sony would have  some influence on the Japanese government. We're not trying to do anything but  stop racism."  </P> <P> CBS Records in New York had no immediate comment.  </P> <P> WDAS-AM and WDAS-FM are owned by Unity Broadcasting Inc. of New York.  </P> <P> CBS's Japanese parent, Sony, bought the record company in 1988 for $2 billion.  </P></p>

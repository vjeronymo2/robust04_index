			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / BA, USAir may switch to Airbus if alliance is blocked BRITISH Airways and USAir, two of the US Boeing company's biggest aircraft customers, may consider switching to the European Airbus consortium if their Dollars 750m (Pounds 460m) alliance is blocked by the US government. The threat was raised this weekend by Mr Seth Schofield, USAir chief executive, in a letter to Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, who warned last week he would oppose BA's acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir if elected. Mr Schofield told Mr Clinton that the deal would not only ensure security for 47,000 USAir jobs and increase domestic airline competition, but also had important implications for the US aircraft manufacturing industry. 'The alliance will provide a solid future for Boeing,' he wrote, adding that USAir operates 268 Boeing aircraft and has firm orders and options for 183 additional Boeings to be delivered over the next eight years. 'The financial infusion from the BA investment assures that those aircraft will be delivered,' he told Mr Clinton, implying that the orders would be threatened if the deal collapsed. BA is also a big Boeing operator, with 174 Boeing aircraft in its fleet and firm orders in place for 81 additional Boeings and options for 70 more. Neither USAir nor BA had ordered European Airbus aircraft so far, Mr Schofield added. Apart from 10 Airbus A320s it inherited from the British Caledonian merger five years ago, BA since privatisation has opted for Boeing aircraft and is the only large European airline not to have bought any Airbus jets. This has led to a fierce controversy with Airbus whose chairman, Mr Jean Pierson, has repeatedly accused BA of being anti-European. Last year he asked the European Commission to investigate BA's aircraft purchasing policy after the airline placed a Pounds 3bn order with Boeing for new Boeing 777 widebody aircraft instead of Airbuses. BA also chose US General Electric engines for its 777s rather than UK Rolls-Royce engines. After losing the BA order, Mr Pierson banned all Airbus staff from flying on BA aircraft. Although no decision has been taken, a US rejection of the USAir deal could lead BA to reconsider its aircraft purchasing policy in favour of Airbus. Relations between the UK airline and Airbus also appear to be improving following a recent meeting between Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, and Mr Pierson. A decision by BA and USAir to switch their allegiances would be all the more significant because of the depressed state of the civil aircraft market. Mr Schofield said the biggest three US carriers, United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which have all lobbied furiously against the BA-USAir deal, have bought Airbus equipment. Last night Sir Colin, in Montreal for the International Air Transport Association meeting, gave assurances that the proposed USAir deal would not result in job losses.

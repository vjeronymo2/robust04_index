			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Anna Dano: "The New Government Is Almost Ready"] </F>   [Text] After the agreement on political guarantees,  personnel issues have also appeared on the agenda of the  coalition talks. According to our information, contrary to  previous promises, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will  only receive four ministerial positions: The Interior Ministry,  the Cultural Ministry, and the newly established ministry in  charge of issues of infrastructure seem to be certain;  negotiations are still going on regarding the Justice Ministry.  The political state secretaries will probably emerge from the  party that provides the minister too, but the other party can  nominate the chairmen of parliamentary committees. Alajos  Dornbach will probably be the chairman of the Parliament.    After agreeing on the political guarantees of the future  coalition, the issue of distributing the ministerial positions,  including the personnel decisions, can no longer be delayed.  Although after winning the elections, the Socialists said that,  as a gesture toward their coalition partners, they will not  divide up the ministries according to the number of mandates but  will give 40 percent of them to the liberals (at least five  ministries), no one mentions this anymore. According to our  latest information, the SZDSZ can count on four ministerial  positions at most, and only one of them is a really strong  position.    The fact that Gyula Horn will be the prime minister has been  clear for quite some time. After the leading players of  international politics and the big capital recognized the  victory of the chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  with a spectacular gesture, the SZDSZ is forced to forget about  Balint Magyar's statement that there will be no coalition under  Gyula Horn's premiership, a statement confirmed by the executive  body. This, as well as the position that it would be a mistake  to restore the institution of minister without portfolio,  something that would also require the modification of the  Constitution, designed the place of Gabor Kuncze, who was  professionally "sold" in the course of the campaign, as head of  the Interior Ministry. The only problem here is that Gabor  Kuncze is an economist, and not a legal expert.    The fate of the head of the Foreign Ministry is also most  probably decided. Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, the travelling  ambassador of the liberals, could not even be considered, so  this position will most probably go to Laszlo Kovacs, the former  MSZP head of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee.    According to the rumors, Laszlo Bekesi will become the head  of the Finance Ministry. This shows some contradiction, because  if the Bekesi-program is the basis of the common government  program, then Bekesi should lead the economic top ministry. And  the Finance Ministry can hardly be this top ministry if, along  with it, a centralized ministry will deal with the economy, a  top ministry that will incorporate the current Industry  Ministry, the Ministry of International Economic Relations, and  the National Technological Development Committee. The  privatization issue could also be incorporated here, namely the  National Property Agency.    The debate is still going on on whether to also incorporate  the Treasury Property Management Organization into all this.  The MSZP supports the idea, but the SZDSZ opposes it. There is  not yet a sure candidate for this mammoth ministry but,  according to our information, the MSZP would prefer Laszlo Pal  in this position, but he still lacks the support of the liberals.    The Justice Ministry is the other critical point. The SZDSZ  candidate is Peter Hack, but the MSZP would also like to see  their own man in this position, and Pal Vastagh is the person  considered for this position. According to the current state of  affairs, the MSZP seems to win the debate. The fate of this  ministry can be important, all the more so because both parties  came up with the proposal to eliminate the position of minister  without portfolio in charge of the intelligence services. In  that case, the civil intelligence services could only get under  the control of the Interior Ministry or the Justice Ministry.  However, the former could bring bad memories because of the  Danube-gate scandal. If the Justice Ministry gets it, the  person who gets this will obtain two ministry seats  simultaneously. It is true that MSZP Deputy Chairman Ferenc  Baja has also been considered for supervising the Intelligence  Services, but the SZDSZ does not support his nomination.  SZDSZ's Andrea Szolnoki ran for the position of welfare  minister, but it is almost a fact that MSZP's Pal Kovacs will  get this position. The idea of transferring social policy  issues from the Welfare Ministry to the Labor Affairs Ministry  seems to be fizzling away. Mrs. Kosa Magda Kovacs is the  plausible candidate to head the Labor Affairs Ministry.    There is full understanding regarding the Culture Ministry:  Both parties support the nomination of Gabor Fodor, who changed  places from the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] to the  SZDSZ.    The position of MSZP's Laszlo Lakos as head of the  Agricultural Ministry seems to be similarly sure.    There is not yet any agreement on the fate of the Defense  Ministry. It will probably also remain under the control of the  MSZP. Gyorgy Keleti has repeatedly been mentioned as a possible  candidate. The same applies to the issue of environmental  protection.    The parties also discussed establishing two new ministries.  One would be in charge of issues connected with European  integration; the other would deal with matters of infrastructure  (transport, urban development, investments, the world expo).  The latter should go to the liberals, but there is not yet a  concrete candidate.    The MSZP is also urging the establishment of a third  ministry, or more precisely a position of minister without  portfolio. This would deal with national minority issues.  Their candidate is Csaba Tabajdi, but the SZDSZ supports  neither the position nor the candidate.    The delegations have already agreed that the head of every  ministry can also bring the political state secretary with him.  To counterbalance the expected two-thirds MSZP advantage, Gyula  Horn and his party offered the position of head of the relevant  parliamentary committee to the representative of the other  party. There will also be some counterbalance if Alajos Dornbach  receives the position of parliament chairman.    There is also agreement on the candidate for the National  Bank chairman. Both parties would welcome Gyorgy Suranyi in  this position.</p>

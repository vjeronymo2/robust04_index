			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [PFLP] has denied that it is about to move its headquarters from  Damascus to Baghdad.    The PFLP and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP], as well as other factions, moved their  headquarters from Beirut to Damascus after the Palestinian  resistance evacuated Beirut in September 1982, while Fatah and  other factions moved from Beirut to Tunis.    Following his return from Baghdad a few days ago, PFLP  Political Bureau member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh told AL-RA'Y that  the PFLP delegation's visit to Baghdad had nothing to do with  this subject, and said the PFLP's main office is still in  Damascus.    Malluh denied that the opposition factions, including the  PFLP, are facing harassment by the Syrian leadership.    He described the press reports published by London  newspapers  on moving the PFLP headquarters from Damascus to Baghdad as  completely untrue, and said the front has the right to be  present in the Arab states bordering Palestine.    He said that cooperation and coordination between the  Palestinian opposition forces and the Syrian leadership  continue, based on their position which calls for full Israeli  withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories,  and their joint position on the dangers of self-rule because it  is unfair to the Palestinian national rights.    Meanwhile, a DFLP official said he expects a DFLP delegation  to visit the Iraqi capital within 10 days. DFLP Political  Bureau member Saji Salamah denied any intention to move the  front's headquarters from Damascus to Baghdad, and emphasized  that the DFLP delegation's visit to Baghdad had been decided a  long time ago.    The visits by the PFLP and DFLP delegations to Baghdad are  the first since the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva.    Fatah and other factions have announced that they will move  their headquarters to the self-rule region after Israel's  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, expected to be completed next  April.</p>

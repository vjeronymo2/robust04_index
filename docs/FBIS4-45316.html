			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Writing on page 21 of Tel Aviv MA'ARIV  in Hebrew on 4 May, Uri Arazi reports that on 3 May, Sharon  District policemen "arrested 30 people in the Netanya area,  including several women, suspected of trafficking in `heavy'  drugs. In the carefully planned raid, the police seized large  quantities of drugs" and "arrested a resident of Netanya known  to be one of the largest drug dealers in Israel."    A report by Raine Marcus on page 12 of Jerusalem THE  JERUSALEM POST on 17 May notes that Tel Aviv narcotics squad  detectives "seized liquefied cocaine disguised as Colombian  coffee liqueur, worth around $700,000, allegedly smuggled here  from Colombia by international drug traffickers." Detectives  arrested 30-year-old suspected courier Moti Spiegel at  Ben-Gurion Airport. Spiegel's partner, 23-year-old Tamir  Peretz, and Miguel Octavio, a 32-year-old Colombian who has been  in Israel three months, were arrested in the Tel Aviv area and  remanded in custody for 11 days.    Writing on page 3 of Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST on 25 May,  Raine Marcus reports that in their second raid in five months of  the Abu-Sayf clan's Yafo orange groves, "police arrested four  family members early yesterday morning, after an undercover  agent taped drug transactions." Marcus adds that in an  operation dubbed "Black Night," detectives also arrested two  members of Yafo's Daka clan, and four other alleged dealers.  Nearly 20,000 shekels in cash, "which police believe to be  profits from drug trading, was found in their possession.  Traces of white powder and scales were found in one apartment."  The report goes on to say that the 47-year-old undercover  agent, a Yafo drug addict "with several charges pending against  him, agreed to work for police in return for the closing of the  cases and payment."    Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 26 May, in a page 15 report by  David Zohar, reports that "the Israeli drug trade totals $2.5  billion a year. The annual damage accruing to the market by the  use of drugs--according to Beni Arad, chairman of the Anti-Drug  Authority--amounts to 33 billion shekels." According to Arad  some 200,000 Israelis, including 27,000 high school students,  use drugs. Some 33,000 of the users are addicted to heroin.  Arad says that the annual consumption of heroin in Israel  amounts to between 3-4 tons; 4 tons hashish, and half a ton  cocaine.    A report by Yosi Levi on the same page of MA'ARIV states  that  "the Jerusalem police have uncovered a sophisticated ring of  drug smugglers from the United States. The ring was headed by  Asher Abutbul, 31, who has resided in Manhattan for the last 15  years." The report adds that the Jerusalem police have seized 11  shipments of cocaine addressed to various people in Jerusalem  and Ramat Gan. Altogether 125 grams of cocaine valued at  approximately $15,000 were seized.</p>

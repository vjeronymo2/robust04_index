			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK 'must make further cuts in budget deficit': World economic outlook BRITAIN will have to make further efforts to cut its budget deficit in addition to the tax increases and public spending restraint already planned for 1994-1995, the International Monetary Fund warns. In its latest World Economic Outlook, it says that the structural part of the budget deficit (that part not caused by recession) has increased sharply to about 5 per cent of gross domestic product this year. Although the Fund expects the structural deficit to fall 'significantly' next year, because of budget measures already decided, it is expected to average about 3.5 per cent of GDP over the medium term. The IMF pinpoints the rise in public spending as a share of GDP from 38 per cent to 44 per cent over the past four years as a cause of the UK's structural budget problem. Mr Michael Mussa, the IMF's chief economist and head of its research department, said yesterday that Britain should reduce it deficit by action on both the spending and the revenue sides of the budget. Reducing the deficit over the rest of the decade 'will be essential for growth to be sustained and for inflationary expectations to continue to moderate,' the IMF says. In spite of the deficit worries, the IMF is more bullish about the UK's current economic performance than it was when it published its last Economic Outlook at the end of April. Britain is the only G7 country for which the IMF has revised upwards its growth forecast for this year. The Fund now expects growth in the UK to be 1.8 per cent this year, against expectations of 1.4 per cent growth in the spring. The Fund says that the lowering of interest rates and improved competitiveness that followed the decision to float sterling a year ago helped turn an incipient recovery into a moderate expansion. As the recovery gains momentum, growth is expected to rise to 2.8 per cent next year. This, however, will be a slightly less buoyant performance than the 3.1 per cent growth forecast for 1994 at the end of April.</p>

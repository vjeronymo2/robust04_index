			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by XINHUA correspondent Su Kuoshan (5685 2368 </F> 0810) and XINHUA reporter Zhou Zhifang (0719 1807 2455): "A  Long Sword and Two Stars Soar Into the Southern Skies -- An  Eyewitness Account of the Launching of Our Country's New Carrier  Rocket"]    [Text] Xichang, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 8  February, a brand-new rocket sat bolt upright next to a gigantic  launch tower at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center. Its white  body, emblazoned with a bright-red drawing of the national flag  and the characters "China Aerospace," glistened in the bright  afternoon sunlight.    This was the Long March 3-A, a new type of carrier rocket  developed by our country scheduled to be launched soon. Inside  the cowling at the tip of the rocket were a space survey  satellite codenamed "Shijian-4" and a simulated satellite a  total of 52.52 meters high. The new rocket is a single-body,  three-stage, heavy-thrust carrier rocket developed on the basis  of the "Long March-3." It is capable of lifting a 2.5-tonne  payload into geosynchronous orbit around the earth.    At 1530 [0730 GMT], the first long wail of the siren pierced  the sky. The launch site was unusually quiet, except for the  commands transmitted through the loudspeaker and the noise  caused by liquid hydrogen and oxygen burning in the combustion  pond.    The vast blue sky was cloudless. The row of huge slogans at  the bottom of the launch tower was exceptionally striking: Each  and every screw links up to form the space industry, whereas  small buttons hold the motherland's dignity together.    At 1615, commander No. 1 issued a command: "We have entered  a 20-minute state of readiness. Only one of the five work  platforms on the tower is not yet open. The last stage of  fueling is in full swing. The work platform, which ran  parallel to the cowling, spewed white clouds of smoke generated  by the fueling process. [no closing quotation marks as received]    Thereafter, commander No. 1 ordered operator No. 301 to  leave  the site and to enter a five-minute state of readiness for the  launch. The siren sounded for a fourth time, and the last group  of people on the tower ran away from the launch site.    At 1634, a loud sound rattled the entire valley as the Long  March 3-A emitted a huge, bright orange plume from its rear  portion. The launch site was filled with smoke as the white  body of the rocket lifted off into the cloudless sky. Scores of  fluorescent screens kept flickering on the work counters in the  room of the command and control center. The gigantic main  display screen illustrated the rocket's path. Data relayed from  the Xian Satellite Monitoring and Control Center and the  Yuanwang survey ship in the Pacific Ocean showed that the  satellites had entered geosynchronous orbit with the earth.    At 1717, a responsible person from the China Aerospace  Industry Corporation proclaimed: The experiment of the Long  March 3-A's maiden flight is successful. The room was filled  with joy. Bursts of firecrackers erupted outside the room,  greeting the successful launch and bringing in the Spring  Festival.</p>

The estimated margin is shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Case History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the initiation of this investigation on December 2, 1993, (58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993), the following events have occurred:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 27, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified us of its preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is being materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of silicomanganese from the PRC that are alleged to be sold at less than fair value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 6, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) sent antidumping questionnaires to 18 producers and exporters that may have sold silicomanganese to the United States during the period of investigation (POI). Company names and addresses were either obtained from the petition or from the Census Bureau's IM&hyph;115 data. In the accompanying cover letter, the Department requested that companies without U.S. sales during the POI advise the Department of this fact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, on January 6, 1994, the Department sent a copy of the antidumping questionnaire to the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). In our transmittal letter, the Department requested MOFTEC to 1) furnish the questionnaire to any silicomanganese producers and exporters with U.S. sales during the POI that were not on our list of 18 companies, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2) provide a comprehensive list of those additional companies that received the questionnaire from MOFTEC. On April 12, 1994, the Department sent a second letter to MOFTEC again requesting a list of all companies that had received the questionnaire from MOFTEC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MOFTEC did not respond to either letter, and most of the potential respondents neither replied to our questionnaire nor notified us that they had not made any sales to the United States during the POI. The only two companies that did respond to our questionnaire, Jinzhou Ferroalloy Works (Jinzhou), a PRC producer of silicomanganese, and Bogay Investment, Ltd. (Bogay), a Hong Kong company that purchased silicomanganese from Jinzhou and exported it directly to the United States, reported one sale made four months prior to the POI. Although, as noted above, the cover letter accompanying the questionnaire stated that companies with no sales of the subject merchandise during the POI need only notify us of this fact, Jinzhou and Bogay chose to respond to the questionnaire. Bogay submitted its questionnaire responses on February 14 and February 28, 1994, and Jinzhou submitted its questionnaire responses on March 7 and March 23, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 2, 1994, the Department determined that this investigation was extraordinarily complicated. Therefore, in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B) of the Act, the Department postponed the preliminary determination until June 10, 1994. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Notice of Postponement of Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination: Silicomanganese from the PRC and Ukraine, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  59 FR 11250, March 10, 1994.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 20, 1994, counsel for petitioners alleged the existence of critical circumstances. The Department has investigated whether critical circumstances exist, and our preliminary results are listed below under ``Critical Circumstances.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department determined on May 23, 1994, not to expand the POI to include Jinzhou and Bogay in the investigation (see Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford, dated May 23, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The merchandise covered by this investigation is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by weight not less than 4% iron, more than 30% manganese, more than 8% silicon and not more than 3% phosphorous. All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of these investigations, including silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of both silicon and manganese. These investigations cover all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (HTS). Some silicomanganese may also be classifiable under HTS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation is June 1, 1993, through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 30, IRNA -- Interior Minister 'Ali  Mohammed Besharati said here today that the lack of credibility  of the United Nations and its Security Council has become the  "problem of the 20th century" and considered it as damaging to  the Secuirty Council.    Besharati in his meeting with the Australian Ambassador  here,  Nicholas Warner, referred to injustice in the Security Council  and said the Senate of the U.S. in contrast to the view of its  government is calling for the lifting of arms embargo on B-H  [Bosnia-Herzegovina] and "this indicates the depth of the crisis  which will lead the West to deadlock."    The UN Security Council under pressure from the United  States  and other Western powers is refusing to lift the arms embargo  against the aggressed Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina despite the  demands by Islamic countries including Iran.    The interior minister told the Australian ambassador that  "what our people want is human rights in the real sense of the  term and what the Westerners are after is a particular culture  that has led them to a dead end."    The two also reviewed bilateral ties, with Warner  emphasizing  on the necessity of expansion of Iran-Australia cooperation.    Warner described the latest situation in Australia and said  that exchange visits between the officials of the two countries  and exchange of opinions can be effective in expanding relations  in such fields as political, economic and cultural.    Besharati replied that one of the ways of expanding economic  relations was for Iran and Australia to identify their present  capacities.</p>

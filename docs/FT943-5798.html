			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Morocco and Israel to open liaison offices Israel and Morocco moved towards establishing full diplomatic relations yesterday, marking a another breach in the wall of Arab economic and political isolation which has surrounded the Jewish state since its creation in 1948. Morocco will become the second Arab state to have direct ties with Israel after Egypt signed a full peace with its neighbour in 1979. Although Israel and Morocco will initially open 'liaison offices' rather than embassies, Israel's foreign ministry said its mission in Rabat and Morocco's mission in Tel Aviv would be staffed by diplomats and cover all economic, cultural, trade and diplomatic activities including issuing visas. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the move paved the way to 'an opening of a regional system of relations'. Israeli officials said other Arab and Islamic states, such as Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Kuwait and Oman could soon follow Rabat's lead. They also said the step erodes the Arab economic boycott of Israel, which the Israel Chambers of Commerce estimates has cost the Jewish state about Dollars 50bn (Pounds 32bn) in lost trade and investment since 1950. Morocco's decision to open its liaison office in Tel Aviv follows international diplomatic practice of not recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. King Hassan of Morocco is also chairman of the Islamic Conference Organisation's Jerusalem committee and as such is committed to reversing Israel's assertion of sovereignty over the city. The kingdom also said, in a separate statement aimed at maintaining a balance between Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, it would open a liaison office in Gaza for relations with 'Mr Yassir Arafat, President of the State of Palestine'. Israel has long maintained clandestine relations with Morocco and trade between the two countries was estimated to be worth Dollars 100m last year. Up to 600,000 Israeli Jews have Moroccan origins and both states believe the potential for trade and tourism is considerable. In October King Hassan of Morocco will host an international conference on economic development in the Middle East sponsored by President Bill Clinton. Hundreds of companies from Israel, Europe and Arab states are expected to attend the Casablanca event to devise ways of financing multi-billion dollar Middle East projects in the post-peace era. Israelis, particularly Jews of Moroccan descent, will be overjoyed by the move in a country where many people judge the peace process by the extent to which it ends Israel's isolation. Israeli businessmen will also hope relations with Morocco will help end the Arab economic boycott. Jordan and Egypt both have formal trade relations with Israel, Qatar is talking with Jerusalem about a natural gas project and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have eased some of the boycott rules to attract US companies which do business with Israel. Egyptian industrialists, who visited Israel last week, said the time had come to 'warm-up' the 16-year-old 'cold peace' with Israel and forge much deeper economic, trade and financial ties. A formal suspension of the boycott, however, is unlikely until Israel withdraws from the still-occupied West Bank and Golan Heights.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATYPICALLY ENGLISH;  </P> <P> BOOKS: JAPANESE-BORN AUTHOR KAZUO ISHIGURO EXPLORES POWER AND SELF-DECEPTION  FROM A UNIQUE AND VERY BRITISH VANTAGE POINT.  </P> <P> An observer watching Kazuo Ishiguro serve small cups of Japanese tea in his  hotel suite would assume that this is a right and hereditary ritual.  </P> <P> The connection between the crushed tea leaves steeping in the blue china pot  and the man with the Japanese name is due, however, solely to the well-meaning  courtesy of the hotel management.  </P> <P> "There's very little you can do to resist these stereotypes," the novelist  laments in a distinctly British accent, wondering what sort of refreshments  would have awaited him had he registered with a French or a Russian name.  </P> <P> Born in Nagasaki, Japan, Ishiguro, who is 35, has lived in England since he was  5 years old. Last fall he was awarded that country's highest literary honor,  the Booker Prize, for his novel, "The Remains of the Day," which uses as its  narrator the quintessentially English stereotype, the butler.  </P> <P> So convincing is the portrait that an article in the Sunday Times of London,  Ishiguro notes, quoted a source close to the queen as reporting that after  reading the novel, she fretted, "Is this really how it was for the servants?"  </P> <P> The book has also attracted Harold Pinter, who is halfway through writing a  film script, and Mike Nichols, who is set to direct the movie for Columbia  Pictures. Meanwhile, the novel has been published this fall in paperback by  Vintage International Books, bringing Ishiguro on tour to Los Angeles, where he  is pouring Japanese tea and discussing stereotypes.  </P> <P> With due respect for his royal, as well as his ordinary, readers, Ishiguro  calls concern for his butler, Stevens, "slightly beside the point. I was never  really interested in what it was like for real butlers," he says.  </P> <P> The gentleman's gentleman -- most widely known in the stylized personages of  Jeeves in P. G. Wodehouse's books and Hudson in the television series,  "Upstairs, Downstairs" -- offered a comically cardboard figure through whom  Ishiguro could explore the introspective themes of self-deception and betrayed  ideals. English author Doris Lessing has commented that such a contrast has  produced a book, "which is very funny and one of the saddest I can remember."  </P> <P> While on a scenically restful trip through the English countryside, Stevens,  who has served for 35 years in one of the country's greatest houses, struggles  painfully to justify his unfaltering professionalism and thereby accord a  dignity to his life. By seeing that the silver gleamed in the sideboard drawers  and the port was served to the gentlemen in the drawing room -- even as his  father lay upstairs dying -- Stevens rationalizes that he has contributed to  the important events of the between-war years being decided within his master's  house and readily subsumes any personal desires into the cause of serving "this  land of ours Great Britain."  </P> <P> But as stealthily as the shadow of a killer creeping across the pages of a good  mystery thriller, shards of Stevens' disillusionment quietly lodge themselves  in his consciousness as he "motors" on in his terrible voyage of  self-discovery.  </P> <P> For his creator, however, Stevens' anguish is but a practical means of  exploring the suppression of emotions and the relationship of small, ordinary  people to political power.  </P> <P> "In British and Japanese society, the ability to control emotions is considered  dignified and elegant," Ishiguro points out. In Stevens, there is "the tendency  to mistake having any emotions at all with weakness."  </P> <P> "Ultimately," he says, "the book is about the tragedy of a man who takes that  thing too far, who somehow denies himself the right to love and be human. This  is something the middle-class and upper-middle-class English do a lot."  </P> <P> Ishiguro attributes the historical source of classic British restraint to  mandatory stints in boarding school, endured by generations of boys and girls  who were separated from their parents at an early age.  </P> <P> "Any boy who spent all his time crying would very rapidly become the butt of  all his fellows. The ability not to show your emotion must have been paramount  to surviving with any kind of reputation."  </P> <P> This early emotional discipline was deliberate, Ishiguro thinks, "because the  British public schools were a training ground for people who would go out and  administer the colonies. So people were taught how to maintain a stiff British  exterior in far-flung corners of the world where they'd feel desperately  homesick. But they must never show that the British were weak."  </P> <P> A similar outward reserve in the Japanese has different origins, he believes.  While British restraint is based on "a fear of revealing how human you actually  are," he says, Japanese formality derives from "a fear of offending."  </P> <P> It is "about avoiding at all costs anything that might lead to open conflict,"  says Ishiguro, adding, "I know less about Japanese society, but my guess would  be that it has to do with a lot of people living on top of each other in very  confined circumstances, which the Japanese have always had to do. . . . You  have to learn not to say what you feel sometimes."  </P> <P> Beyond social mores, however, Ishiguro has delved into the more universal  impulse to protect "that very vulnerable terrain in all of us where we expose  ourselves to feelings and put ourselves at risk in the search for friendship  and love." Often what appears to be the exercise of dignity and restraint, he  observes, "is merely a kind of alibi for cowardice."  </P> <P> The subject of self-restraint was brought to Ishiguro's attention by his  critics. Reviewers almost universally commented that his first two novels, "A  Pale View of Hills" and "An Artist of the Floating World," both set in Japan,  were written in an understated style in which meaning was to be found in the  spaces between what was said.  </P> <P> "I started to wonder where this was coming from," says Ishiguro, who decided to  make understatement part of his theme rather than a mere accident of style.  </P> <P> The author's concern for participation in political systems is a more conscious  outgrowth of his experience in coming of age in the late 1960s and early '70s,  when an idealistic generation thought it was destined to better the world.  </P> <P> "As time has gone on, I've felt this growing frustration that on the one hand  it's ordinary people such as ourselves who are supposed to be responsible for  the way a country is run because we are supposed to live in a democracy. On the  other hand, most of us don't live in the big world where these big decisions  are made. We just struggle with everyday life. . . .  </P> <P> "So I was drawn to this figure of the butler who tries to gain his dignity by  doing these menial things very well. . . . What he says is what most of us say,  that we're offering our little services up to an organization or an employer. .  . . Our little contribution is going up there somewhere. We all hope it is  going to be used in a way we approve of.  </P> <P> "That's the position I felt most of us who had been radical and idealistic had  ended up in -- social workers, teachers, journalists, writers. . . . what  happens to our contribution is often out of our hands."  </P> <P> Educated at the University of Kent, where he earned a bachelor's degree in  philosophy and literature, and the University of East Anglia, where he received  a masters in creative writing, Ishiguro was part of the scene of student  sit-ins and rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> Taking time off from his studies, he worked in a housing development project in  Scotland for six months and later worked for several years helping the homeless  in London, and living for a time in a hostel, while campaigning for housing  rights.  </P> <P> In one year he worked as a grouse beater, driving birds from cover during hunts  at the Queen Mother's holiday castle, Balmoral, on the Scottish moors, and  hitchhiked across the United States.  </P> <P> "At that time in England it wasn't such an eccentric thing to want to do  something useful," he says. "We were as competitive as the would-be Trumps of  today, but in other terms. . . . In those days we used to vie with each other  about how worthily we were living our lives. We would actually pull rank on  each other. We'd look down on somebody who got a regular job at a bank.  </P> <P> "This is why I'm fascinated by that -- wanting to live your life well rather  than simply wanting to live your life comfortably."  </P> <P> Ishiguro's technical apprenticeship to becoming a novelist came as a songwriter  and guitar player in a student band.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of these wild experimental splurges where I'd be playing  thousands of jazz chords and writing this free-form, free-association poetry  with lots of brilliant pyrotechnical images flashing around," he says.  </P> <P> By the end of his musical career, Ishiguro had settled down to the artistic  economy of form and expression that mark his literary work. "I try to say  things as simply and cleanly as possible," he says, "rather than trying to  reach out for some meaning that's just beyond your grammar."  </P> <P> In the abstract art of music, he also learned to trust his instinct."Because  you are a writer working in the medium of words, there is sometimes a tendency  to think you have to logically justify everything you do. You have to think of  some kind of argument, why one passage is better than another possible passage.  You just know that's the way you conceived it when you are a musician."  </P> <P> Turning to the subject of his Japaneseness, Ishiguro is on less solid ground.  Ishiguro's father, an oceanographer sent to England to do research related to  the North Sea, and his mother, planned every year to return to Japan. Their son  received monthly packages of educational material about his homeland.  "Throughout my childhood I had grown up with this very precious country that I  called Japan, which was a very intense and real place in my imagination."  </P> <P> By the time he was 22, and the family had made no move to return, Ishiguro  decided to commit this ever-fainter mix of memory and imagination to paper,  which he did in his first novel.  </P> <P> It was not until he won the Booker Prize a year ago, however, that he made his  first trip to Japan. "When I went back to Nagasaki I felt I was returning  home," he says, noting that this "beautiful place of hills and sea" was as  different from Tokyo as Portland, Ore., is from New York. "That was quite a  nostalgic visit."  </P> <P> But, Ishiguro states firmly, "I couldn't survive in Japan. It's as alien a  place (for me) as it is for the next person."  </P> <P> But unlike bona fide foreigners, Ishiguro's predicament is being Japanese-born.  "I would have to keep explaining myself," he says. "I would not be exempt from  the very complicated social etiquette."  </P> <P> As a successful Japanese living abroad, Ishiguro says, he is the embodiment of  the people's "worst nightmare and their best dream." Nightmare because he is "a  child who went away with his parents and lost his Japaneseness and became  contaminated," and dream because "they think, 'Oh, but that can happen to our  children. They can be accepted and successful in other countries.'  </P> <P> "Precisely at this moment in Japanese history, people like me hit an odd sort  of nerve. It's a country opening up psychologically long after it has done so  commercially. . . . They're having to redefine Japaneseness."  </P> <P> For his part, Ishiguro plans to continue to live in London, where he owns a  house with his wife, Lorna MacDougall, a social worker, on the south side of  the city. They manage the house together, doing quite well, he says, without a  butler.  </P></p>

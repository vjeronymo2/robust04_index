			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Citicorp bows to closer scrutiny CITICORP, the biggest US bank, has bowed to closer scrutiny from banking regulators, joining 530 other US banks which require special attention because of financial difficulties with bad loans and shrinking capital. The bank announced on Friday that it signed a memorandum of understanding with the US Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency as long ago as February agreeing to accept closer oversight by the regulators. Citicorp, which is thought to be the only big US money-centre bank to have agreed to special oversight in this way, has been under strong pressure from regulators for the past two years to improve its finances. According to Mr John Reed, the bank's chairman, the memorandum did not impose any new constraints on the bank's activities, but merely embraced Citicorp's publicly-announced plans to strengthen its balance sheet with asset sales, securities offerings and dividend cuts. Through its reorganisation and capital building programme, the bank has already added Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 780m) of new capital so far this year, raising its main Tier One capital-to-assets ratio (the main capital adequacy measure used by US bank regulators) to 4.25 per cent, up from 3.74 per cent a year ago. It also boosted its reserves against problem loans by more than Dollars 1bn. Although a memorandum is the mildest form of reproach available to regulators, the Citicorp chairman and other bank officials wasted no time saying the agreement was not an indication that Citicorp's problems were escalating. Reporters were invited to Citicorp's Park Avenue headquarters on Friday for a rare briefing from the chairman. Evidence of close regulator interest was provided on Friday, when the bank announced it had been forced by regulators to reduce its previously-announced second-quarter profit from Dollars 171m to Dollars 143m to account for an expected flood of mortgage prepayments by homeowners in the wake of July's interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The bank said it had planned to recognise the prepayments in its third-quarter results, and analysts believe the restatement will have little impact on Citicorp's share price.</p>

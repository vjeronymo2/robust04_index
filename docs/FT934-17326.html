			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Yeltsin accepts church mediation over crisis: Peace talks to begin today at monastery PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday agreed to church-mediated talks to try to end Moscow's political crisis, while Russia's regions stepped up pressure on him in his confrontation with parliament. The talks, to begin today at a Moscow monastery, were agreed when Mr Yeltsin met Patriarch Alexy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church. Although other talks have been under way between supporters of Mr Yeltsin and defiant deputies, the patriarch's mediation is widely seen as offering a way out of the crisis provoked by Mr Yeltsin's decree dissolving parliament last week. In a joint statement, Mr Yeltsin and the patriarch emphasised the need to calm political passions and avoid violence. The government will be represented at the talks by Mr Sergei Filatov, the president's chief of staff, and Mr Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy prime minister. Defiant deputies, of whom about 100 are still barricaded in the White House, the parliament building, will be represented by high-ranking officials. The move came after representatives of 62 of Russia's 88 regions demanded that police and troops end their barbed-wire blockade of parliament and that Mr Yeltsin withdraw his decree dismissing parliament ahead of new elections in December. Deputy prime minister Sergei Shakhrai, who met the regional spokesmen, said they were unrepresentative of their people. But as a sign of its concern, the government is sending seven ministers to various parts of the country, including southern Russia, the far east and Siberia to whip up support for Mr Yeltsin. In their Moscow talks, the regional spokesmen threatened 'all necessary measures of economic and political pressure' to restore 'constitutional legality'. Potentially more significant was the regional officials' announcement that they planned to form a federation council, which would supplant a similar body foreseen by Mr Yeltsin as the unelected upper chamber of a new parliament. Barricaded inside the White House, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliament's speaker, who has cultivated the regional councils, said that 'everything would now be decided by the regions'. Mr Yeltsin reiterated that he would not repeal his decree dissolving parliament. But a close aide, Mr Gennady Burbulis, said all means had to be found to secure a dignified exit from the White House for Mr Khasbulatov and vice president Alexander Rutskoi. Pressure is also growing for Mr Yeltsin to hold early presidential elections simultaneously with an election to the new-style parliament, rather than six months later.

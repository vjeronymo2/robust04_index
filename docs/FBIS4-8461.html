			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BTA correspondent Nikolay Koev] </F>   [Text] Skopje, April 14 (BTA) -- The two-day official visit  of Bulgarian Minister of Science and Education Marko Todorov to  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  was broken off yesterday.    Having conferred with his Macedonian counterparts Selmani  and  Bajaldziev on April 12, at the end of his visit Todorov was to  sign a protocol on cooperation between the similar ministries of  the two countries. The document, coordinated in advance with  Macedonian experts in Sofia, said that the protocol was to be  signed in the official languages in Bulgaria and Macedonia.    Yesterday the Macedonian side demanded that this established  wording in bilateral practice and documentation be substituted  for [as received] "the Macedonian and Bulgarian languages." The  Bulgarian side refused to sign the document which marked the end  of the visit which also envisaged a meeting with Macedonian  Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski.</p>

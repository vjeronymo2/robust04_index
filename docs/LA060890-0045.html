			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> 4-QUARTER SCHOOL SCHEDULE APPROVED  </P> <P> In the hope of improving student grades at Hueneme High School, the Oxnard  Union High School District has approved a plan to divide the school year into  four nine-week quarters, rather than two 18-week semesters.  </P> <P> Beginning in September, Hueneme High School will lengthen class periods from 55  minutes to 90 minutes, a change that will add 30 minutes to the school day.  </P> <P> Students will take four classes each quarter rather than six a semester.  </P> <P> The two-semester system will remain intact at the four other high schools in  the 11,000-student district.  </P> <P> Trustees said Wednesday that they believe that the restructured school day will  bolster grades and improve attendance at the 2,000-student school because  teachers will be able to spend more time in the classroom. The change could  make it easier to spot learning problems, officials said.  </P> <P> "Teachers will have more time to focus on individual children," Hueneme High  School Principal Terry Taylor said.  </P> <P> With fewer classes to study for each quarter, students will be better able to  focus their attention and will be able to spend more time studying for each  class, Taylor said.  </P> <P> Students will be able to take more classes in four nine-week quarters than  under the old system. They will be able to take 16 courses a year rather than  12 now.  </P> <P> "We think it will give our kids an edge because they will have a chance to  accelerate their high school schedules," Taylor said.  </P> <P> The different schedule will allow students who are doing poorly in class or  must miss part of the school year to have a fresh start every nine weeks,  school officials said.  </P> <P> "There's a lot more chance for renewal under the quarter system," Taylor said.  </P></p>

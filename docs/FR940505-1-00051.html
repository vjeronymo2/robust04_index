Section 182(c)(4) places a similar requirement on the South Coast ozone SIP. The Act mandates SIP provisions requiring the purchase of clean new vehicles, beginning in 1998, for use in centrally fueled fleets of cars and light-duty trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 13, 1992, CARB submitted as a SIP revision the State's regulations mandating the availability of clean fuels. At the same time, CARB applied for conditional approval of an opt-out from this requirement based upon a showing that the State's Low- Emission Vehicles (LEV) and Clean Fuels programs (adopted in 1990) qualify as a substitute for the federal clean fleet program. On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62532), EPA approved the State's clean fuels availability regulations and conditionally approved the opt-out request. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In Section III.D.2.d.(6), EPA proposes as part of the South Coast FIP a clean fuel fleet program, consistent with EPA's final fleet program rules [see 58 FR 64679 (December 9, 1993)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Employee Commute Options Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 187(b)(2) requires SIP submission by November 15, 1992, of an Employee Commute Options (ECO) regulation to reduce commute trips to the worksites of large employers. Section 182(d)(1)(B) mandates that the ECO SIP requirement also applies to ``Severe'' and ``Extreme'' ozone nonattainment areas, and this same section establishes minimum program performance levels: the rules must ``require that each employer of 100 or more persons in such area increase average passenger occupancy per vehicle in commuting trips between home and the workplace during peak travel periods by not less than 25 percent above the average vehicle occupancy for all such trips in the area at the time the revision is submitted.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In December 1992, EPA issued Employee Commute Options Guidance to assist states in developing approvable ECO SIP revisions. This guidance, and the ECO requirement in the 1990 Amendments, derive in part from the SCAQMD employee trip reduction program, Regulation XV, which was adopted on December 11, 1987, as the Country's first large-scale ECO program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulation XV has undergone several significant revisions since that date to expand the program and address implementation issues. The SCAQMD rule was initially submitted as a SIP revision on February 7, 1989, and CARB submitted an amended Regulation XV on two occasions: March 31, 1991 and May 31, 1993. EPA has reviewed the amended Regulation XV for consistency with the Act and EPA's guidance. This review is available as a Technical Support Document, ``EPA Analysis of the Approvability of South Coast Air Quality Management District Regulation XV.'' Based on this detailed analysis, EPA proposes in this NPRM to approve Regulation XV as meeting the requirements of sections 187(b)(2) and 182(d)(1)(B) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the current Regulation XV meets federal approval criteria, EPA encourages the SCAQMD to continue to evaluate and adjust the program, if necessary, to ensure that the rule is fully and successfuly implemented. Any adjustments to the rule must not jeopardize timely achievement of average passenger occupancy targets and emissions reductions from the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) forecast and contingency measures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 187(a)(2)(A) requires the South Coast CO plan to contain a forecast of VMT for each year until attainment. The plan must also provide for annual updates of the forecasts along with annual reports regarding the extent to which the forecasts proved to be accurate. Finally, section 187(a)(3) requires that the plan contain specific contingency measures to be implemented if the annual estimate of actual VMT or a subsequent VMT forecast exceeds the most recent prior forecast of VMT or if the area fails to attain the CO NAAQS by the attainment date. These contingency measures must be adopted and enforceable in the SIP and must take effect without further action by the State or the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The required VMT forecasts are included in Table 3&hyph;3 and Appendix A of the plan. The forecasts require significant update, and SCAG is now preparing and adopting such an amendment for a new Regional Mobility Plan and an air quality plan revision scheduled for adoption later in 1994. EPA therefore proposes to approve the forecasts, but intends to amend the VMT projections in the FIP when the new VMT numbers are adopted and submitted as a SIP revision. EPA also proposes to approve the responsible agencies' commitments to replace the VMT projections and monitor actual VMT levels in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has not yet submitted, however, fully adopted and enforceable contingency measures to meet the requirements of section 187(a)(3). The plan includes three groups of potential controls, identified as contingency measures. The measures, in fact, are surplus rather than contingent. The committal measures achieve reductions beyond those needed for progress and attainment, and they are scheduled for adoption and implementation by fixed dates, which are independent of determinations that VMT levels have been exceeded or that the plan has failed to achieve progress milestones or attainment. Although the measures are not designed to be triggered by excess VMT levels or by a failure to achieve scheduled progress or attainment, the measures could be approved as meeting the contingency requirement if: (1) They are submitted in fully adopted form, and (2) the RFP and attainment deficiencies are resolved by SIP submission of approvable enhanced I/M authorization and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first group of ``contingency'' measures (Table 6&hyph;4 of the plan) consists of two stationary source measures: P&hyph;B&hyph;5, Control of Emissions from OCS Exploration, Development and Production; and P&hyph;B&hyph;6, Control of Emissions from Petroleum Refinery Flares. Emissions reductions were not estimated for these possible measures. Moreover, neither of the controls have yet been adopted, although the plan scheduled both for adoption in 1992. Thus, the two measures cannot be approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second group (Table 6&hyph;5) comprises five measures. One of the measures is assigned to CARB: ARB&hyph;8, Fleet Average Standards for Post-2003 Model Years (Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks, and Medium-Duty Vehicles). The remaining four measures were scheduled for adoption by 1992, but the State has provided no evidence that the measures have in fact been adopted. The four measures are energy conservation programs: E&hyph;D&hyph;1b, Residential Sector; E&hyph;C&hyph;1b, Commercial Sector; E&hyph;C&hyph;2b, Industrial Sector; and E&hyph;C&hyph;3, Local Government Sector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of the five measures is designed to serve as contingency measures after the year 2000. As such, the measures would be appropriate for SIP submission in the context of a CO maintenance plan. In their present form, they could not serve to meet contingency requirements for the attainment plan, since the measures are not designed to remedy plan shortfalls in achieving reasonable further progress before, and attainment by, the year 2000. Moreover, EPA cannot either approve or conditionally approve the measures since the scheduled full adoption date has elapsed without evidence of such adoption. Nevertheless, the measures are important pollution prevention initiatives with multiple benefits, and EPA strongly encourages further progress at the State, regional, and local level to implement the measures fully.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third group of ``contingency'' measures (Table 6&hyph;6) includes 11 transportation and indirect source measures. The plan requests conditional approval of the measures to allow time to fully develop and adopt the controls, and the resolution of adoption commits the SCAQMD to revise the measures in 1993 to be fully quantifiable as required by the CAA (SCAQMD Board Resolution No. 92&hyph;36, Finding 10).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast] </F>   [Text] The former members of the Nicaraguan Resistance [RN]  who this morning occupied the Colombian Embassy and the CIAV  [International Commission of Support and Verification]-OAS  offices have continued to demand that the government negotiate  with Enrique Quinonez, a member of RN's Higher Council. This  evening Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta said there would be  no negotiations.    [Begin Mendieta recording] I would like to point out that  Mr.  Luis Ignacio Montiel, from Comalapa, Chontales, 37, was never a  member of the RN as he claims. He participated in highway  occupations in 1990 and, subsequently, was involved in  considerable criminal activities. He was arrested for a murder  in Nueva Guinea Department. According to his record, in 1980 he  was charged with the murder of an Agriculture Ministry employee,  and in 1991 he again participated in highway occupations and  other acts of protest against the government.    Mr. [indistinct] Madariaga, 36, a former member of the  National Guard and a former member of the [word indistinct], was  discharged in December of the same year [as heard] and  reenlisted in the National Guard in January 1979. He  subsequently left the country and returned after the 1990  elections.    I have sufficient evidence to assert that there have been  ties between these individuals and followers of Charrito and  Northiel. Over the past week the two sectors even held  conversations. [end recording]    The government minister also asserted that today's actions  are linked to actions by Northiel and Charrito in northern  Nicaragua. These actions, he said, are financed by Quinonez and  other members of the former RN.    [Begin Mendieta recording] If Mr. Quinonez' involvement in  today's incidents is clearly proven, and, if after today's  meeting such ties are clearly established, Mr. Quinonez will be  arrested. [end recording]    The government minister did not dismiss the possibility that  the occupiers of the Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS  headquarters may be dislodged this evening.    [Begin Mendieta recording] I have asked the Colombian  ambassador, through the Foreign Ministry, to authorize the  police to dislodge them, and we are awaiting Colombia's answer.  We are making the same request of the CIAV-OAS to immediately  dislodge the occupiers. [end recording]</p>

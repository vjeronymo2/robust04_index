Economic Development Board [EDB] chairman Philip Yeo said  yesterday that the commitments were in "better-quality" projects  and were expected to generate $3.12 billion in gross value-added  or GVA. This is a measure of the contribution to Singapore's  gross domestic product. "We have kept to our objective of  attracting better-quality projects resulting in higher GVA per  worker," Mr Yeo said. "Projects in our pipeline are even  better." He did not give details of the nature or value of the  projects in the pipeline. But at the end of 1992, around $9.4  billion worth of projects were under serious negotiation.    The 1993 commitments translate to a GVA per worker of nearly  $294,300. This is nearly four times the current average GVA per  worker for the manufacturing sector.    Mr Yeo emphasised the importance of manufacturing  investment.  "We look for a balance. We like to have both manufacturing and  services," he said. "But manufacturing is the key because it  creates a multiplier effect. Without manufacturing there will  be no demand for services."    More than half of the total commitmments in 1993 came from  the chemicals and electronics industries. The U.S. remained the  biggest investor, pumping in about $1.45 billion or 32 percent  of the total. Next was Europe with $857 million, then Japan with  $779 million. Investments by home-grown companies came to $741  million, accounting for 19 percent of the total. This was 6.7  percent rise over 1992. The services sector attracted  commitments of $352 million and generated total business  spending of $470 million.    At a briefing yesterday, EDB managing director Tan Chin Nam  also outlined EDB's strategic thrusts for the year in the light  of the generally weak Western economies and growing competition  among Asian countries.    These are some of EDB's tasks for 1994:    -- Play a key role in the development of world-class  industry  clusters. These are groups of manufacturing companies, covering  a product from the start, such as design, to the final phases of  assembly.    -- Help make Singapore a global business hub. The EDB is  finalising an International Business Hub 2000 study to set a  framework and direction. The focus will be on headquarters and  business services, communications and information.    -- Regionalisation. The Finance Ministry has provided a  special budget for the International Business Development  Strategic Business Unit to be expanded into a full operating  division of the EDB.    -- Developing local enterprise. The EDB will seek to  strengthen the supporting industry base to attract more quality  foreign investments.</p>

A defiance of the authority of the state, or  better still a foretaste of the "insurrection" which  somebody may be planning to dish out to Ivorians after President  Houphouet-Boigny's burial? Many are our countrymen who still  wonder and anxiously await the end of the state burial which  Cote d'Ivoire and the rest of the world are preparing for the  deceased head of state. They wonder whether "February  94" is not going to be a repeat of "February  92," as though it were already predestined that the second  month of the year will be for us like the month of May for  France -- the month of all perils. Remember May 1968 in  metropolitan France and May 1958 in Algiers.... among others.    If it was a defiance of state authority, then there is  reason  to ask a few questions. Who is steering the wheel? Who is  behind what happened on 22 January? This question is pertinent  because no one can prove that it was in a spontaneous fashion  that these "supporters" of the former prime minister  moved to the airport. Consistent reports talk of distribution of  money throughout Abidjan and in the communes and the hiring of  minibuses, "woro-woro," and "gbaka" [parallel taxi and minibus  services, respectively], the idea being to prove, on the one  hand, that the former prime minister's popularity has remained  intact and, on the other, that the new head of state, whose  assumption of office on 7 December 1993 was by virtue  of Article 11 of the Constitution, does not in any way enjoy the  trust of his countrymen.    The proponents of this thinking, who maintained from the  onset that Article 11 was inapplicable and that it "would  put the country to fire and sword as soon as Houphouet-Boigny's  death is announced," have not yet lost hope of seeing their  wish materialize -- i.e. setting the country ablaze, turning it  definitely into another Liberia, for the simple reason that  "power has eluded them," for the time being.... In  short, they have lost "the battle," but have not yet "lost the  war." Hence, the end justifies the means, not only in defying  the authority of the new head of state but particularly in  impressing upon all and sundry that without the former prime  minister there can be no salvation for Ivorians, now at the  mercy of the worst cataclysm.    We all remember the February 1992 attempt which was roundly  condemned by all true patriots and men of good judgment from  both the Right and the Left, and while the view held then by  students and some opposition leaders that the swoop by the  military on the Yopougon University hall of residence was  "a causus belli," what are we to understand this  time? That Cote d'Ivoire is wrong to have had institutions that  function? That the Constitution of the Republic ought not to  have been applied after President Houphouet-Boigny's death?  That a military or civilian coup d'etat would have been far  better that a constitutional provision which, even though  admittedly imperfect, had the merit of existing?    Whatever the case may be, the strategic and tactical  alliance formed between a section of the opposition --  which, only recently, held Alassane Ouattara up to public  obloquy -- and friends of the former prime minister is a  curious one. Together, they are committing the fatal  error of consciously setting the stage for disorder through acts  of provocation and defiance and by misinforming and poisoning  the minds of the people. No one stands to gain from a  disintegration of the country. No one has ever gained anything  by destroying their own country. Savimbi and Charles Taylor can  bear witness to that. This is why it is self-evident that just  as the return fire to the "final onslaught" was  "fatal," Cote d'Ivoire still has the means to deal  with "rabble rousing" were it to resurface. The  state must stand firm in the interest of the majority of  Ivorians, who aspire to nothing but peace.    [Paris AFP in French in an Abidjan date-lined item at 1107  GMT on 26 January adds the following: "These remarks were  received with "surprise and regret" by Ouattara who, in a  statement to AFP, maintained he had "nothing to do" with what  happened and had "never done any act to disturb anything  whatsoever," and called for serenity. He stated that for the  time being he had made no decision regarding his future,  political or otherwise. He also played down his differences  with Mr. Bedie, saying he had "nothing against him." Mr.  Ouattara further recalled that he had made no public statement  since President Houphouet-Boigny's death on 7 December which led  to his resignation two days later."]</p>

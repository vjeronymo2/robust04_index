			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / FT Traveller, Barcelona (18): A taste of the region - The Hinterland / Not far outside Barcelona are a number of villages where the region's excellent wines can be sampled IF YOU can add a long weekend to a Barcelona trip, go to one of the select spots on the Costa Brava or head up to the Pyrenees. But if time is at a premium and your liver is in good shape, go to the Penedes wine-growing district that lies a 40-minute motorway drive south-west of the city centre. Save Sant Sadurni d'Anoia, the first of the district's two main towns, for the return trip to Barcelona, and carry straight on to Vilafranca del Penedes where the Museu del Vi, the wine museum, is housed in what was the palace of the kings of Aragon during the 14th century. It is certainly the best museum of its kind in Spain, and is arguably unrivalled in Europe. All the wine harvesting tools and gigantic wooden presses that one could wish for are on display, and there is a convivial tasting room for sampling and purchases. But it is the collection of Roman amphoras that remains in the mind. A monograph, published by the Museu, on the area's wine production 2,000 years ago establishes that custom-built wine ships, with grooved planking to secure the amphora's pointed base, regularly departed the Penedes for Italy, bearing 6,000 of these earthenware jars aboard. The problems of the EC's 'wine lake' clearly existed in the first century, and Rome was forced to ban new vineyards in what was then the province of Tarraconensis, in order to protect Italian producers. By that stage, super-tankers that could transport 10,000 amphoras of Penedes wine had come into service. The vinification centre of the Torres winery in the village of Pacs, close by Vilafranca, with its huge stainless steel tanks and state-of-the-art bottling plant, brings the Penedes wine story up to the present. The centre includes an oenological research laboratory where some 250 experiments into new wine production methods, new grape varieties and grape mixes are currently being conducted. Torres has spearheaded both the improvement of the Penedes' native grapes - the white Xarel-lo, Macabeo and Parellada and the red Carinena, Tempranillo and Garnacha varieties - and also the successful adaptation of foreign 'noble' vines to the area's soil and climate. Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay are now widely grown in the Penedes, and Gewurztraminer and Riesling do well in the area's cooler uplands. Torres also grows limited quantities of Pinot Noir in the Penedes. If you can get hold of it, buy Torres' Vina Magdala, which mixes 70 per cent Pinot noir with 30 per cent native Tempranillo grape; or, better still, the 100 per cent Pinot noir Gran Vina Magdala. Returning to Barcelona, stop at Sant Sadurni d'Anoia to visit the headquarters of the Cordoniu, the biggest cava producer in the world, and to eat some of the best local fare to be had in Catalonia. Cordoniu's extravagant establishment has extensive water gardens, modernist buildings designed by Gaudi's contemporary, Puig i Cadafalch, and 18 km of underground cellars. The restaurant Canals y Munne, on Sant Sadurni's Placa Pau Casals, is one of several unpretentious eating houses in the town that stock a long list of Penedes wines and serve prodigious amounts of Catalan specialities.</p>

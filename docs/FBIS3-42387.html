			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant-Colonel M. Syrtlanov under the rubric </F> "Military Reform: In the Air Forces of the Commonwealth  Countries": "In Independent Flight"]    [Text] Ukraine was among the first nations of the  Commonwealth to declare its right to resolve issues of military  organizational development independently. The uncompromising  stance of Kiev on the question of the formation of a national  army did not suit everyone, but to give them their due, it made  it possible to set about the practical realization of the  conceptual framework for the creation of air forces in the  republic in a very short time.    Many associate the successful emergence of this branch of  the  armed forces with the name of the commander--Lieutenant-General  of Aviation Valeriy Vasilyev, whose service was linked with the  former Odessa and Carpathian military districts for many a year.  The commander himself had this to say: "My emergence as an  aviator really did take place on Ukrainian soil. And every  officer would agree with me that one cannot in good conscience  fulfill one's military duty without being instilled with respect  for the history and traditions of a people whose peaceful labors  you are entrusted to protect. That is why the aspirations of the  Ukrainians for sovereignty, for the genuine right to dispose of  their own fate, including on questions of defense, are near and  dear to me. I am proud of the fact that I have been entrusted  with the command of the Air Forces of a nation, in whose annals  are inscribed in golden letters the names of scientists,  designers and pilots who were trailblazers of the skies and  space: Nikolay Kibalchich and Yuriy Kondratyuk, Igor Sikorskiy  and Aleksandr Mozhayskiy, Sergey Zhukovskiy and Sergey Korolev,  Arkhip Lyulka and Oleg Antonov... I believe that this feeling of  participation in the cause of all generations of countrymen is  shared by all fliers who have sworn their loyalty to Ukraine,  holding to its policy of independent development within the  framework of conciliar statehood."    The economic crisis and other negative phenomena of our  times  have undoubtedly had an impact on military reform in Ukraine as  well. A particularly difficult situation has taken shape in the  Air Forces--the most technically sophisticated branch of the  armed forces.    This is, first and foremost, the problems with logistical  support for the combat training of fliers as expressed in  shortages of fuel, spare parts and assemblies. It would be  erroneous to explain, as some politicians are attempting to do,  that all of these needs are from the very fact of the  proclamation of its independence by Ukraine and difficulties in  relations with the countries of the so-called near abroad. The  author, who has visited many of the units, sees the reasons in  the disruption of economic ties among enterprises and the  overall decline in production. I can say, knowing the situation  in other regions of the former Union, that things are no  better--if not worse-- there as well.    What is the way out of this situation? We must obviously be  realists. The leadership of the Air Forces of Ukraine have  intentionally reduced the pace of flight training, taking into  account not only the amounts of reserves of material resources,  but also changes in the international situation and the  lessening of military confrontation in Europe. They are  striving, that is, to provide a level of combat readiness  thereby that diplomats have defined as precisely the level of  defensive sufficiency. The struggle to raise the efficiency of  combat training has also been called upon to play its role in  the cause of providing a climate of economy.    The level of proficiency of the Ukrainian aviators makes it  possible to hope for a rapid transition of the national Air  Forces to a new rhythm of combat training. They do not conceal  the fact, however, that the personnel issue is quite acute. The  taking of the military oath of loyalty to Ukraine, after all,  forced every serviceman to make an unequivocal choice of  citizenship right from the start. Whatever may be said, the very  necessity of deciding was unexpected and was perceived quite  painfully for many. And it is entirely natural that some fliers  announced their desire to return to their native lands, to other  republics of the CIS. Quite a few vacant positions appeared as a  result, especially squadron commanders. That is why the careful  screening of candidates for the open positions is underway  everywhere in the regiments even today. The results will not be  long in coming. We are thus talking about temporary  difficulties, and in no way a hopeless situation. If we look to  the more distant future, then with a certain reconfiguration of  some of the aviation schools located on the territory of Ukraine  they will be able, to all appearances, to train their own  national cadres for all the branches of aviation.    I will say, anticipating the readers' question, that the  personnel problems in the local areas are being considered,  wherever possible, through the lens of ensuring social  protections for the personnel. The officers believe that a  series of pieces of legislation will soon make it possible to  provide all families of servicemen with housing and all- round  incentives for their martial labors.    Quite a bit of work really does lie ahead if we are talking  about the strategic tasks of military reform. A conceptual model  for the creation of a qualitatively new branch of the armed  forces of Ukraine--the Air Defense Troops--is being considered  in earnest in Ukraine; they will include the larger units and  formations of PVO [Air Defense], the Air Forces and space units  in an organizational regard. It is difficult to predict the  results of such an experiment, and it has both many advocates  and many opponents. The latter, judging by an appearance at the  January session of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, could include  General V. Vasilyev to a certain extent as well. Time will tell  all. It will be necessary in any case to talk about a  fundamental review of the tasks and aims of military reform of  the Air Forces of Ukraine in accordance with its peaceloving  foreign policy and the rationalization of the standard  organizational structures of the armed forces.    Yes, Ukraine has proclaimed that it is a non-aligned nation,  that it will not maintain, produce or employ nuclear weapons,  and that it sees no neighboring country as a potential  adversary. But this stance in no way propagates the euphoria of  pacifism. The military in Ukraine have not forgotten their main  task--to maintain proper combat readiness. They like to refer  here to the experience of local wars, testifying to the decisive  role of aviation in the attainment of victory in contemporary  battle.    A separate question pertains to improving the structure of  the Air Forces. The projected program envisages, in particular,  gradual cutbacks in administrative structures through the  disbanding of the divisional echelon. Calculations show that  this measure, under the prevailing conditions in the republic,  would make it possible to increase markedly the combat potential  of the aviation forces.    A body for the centralized command and control of the Air  Forces has already been created on the basis of the former  headquarters of the air army in Vinnitsa, to which are  subordinate the operational command-and- control groups in the  Western (Lvov) and Southwestern (Odessa) sectors, as well as  groups for the command-and-control of military-transport  aviation, reserves and personnel training.    They are also not getting by in Ukraine without cutbacks in  the size of the troops. The cutbacks in personnel will be  insignificant in the first and second stages of the military  reform, up to 1995. This will affect officers who have served  out their stipulated terms first of all. The directive issued by  the Supreme Soviet and the President of the republic on the  discharge only of servicemen with the right to a pension and  provided with housing, as a rule, is being unswervingly  fulfilled. But there are plenty of aggrieved people, since it is  it simply impossible to take all living situations into account.    More significant later cutbacks in the administrative  structures, support subunits, storage bases and, partly, the  aviation regiments, from 1995 through 1999, will once again be  through dischargees who have served out their terms or some  other circumstances. This process may also be carried out in a  less painful manner for peoples' fates by regulating the  entering classes at the military schools.    Meetings with the army community last year revealed yet  another problem, of a morale nature, connected with the  re-organization of the armed forces of Ukraine. The officers  were concerned at the time about whether their honorary name  designations would be retained after the reformation of the  units, with a right to the legacy of combat history and  traditions. This question has now been resolved, I was told at  the socio-psychological service of one of the Kiev headquarters,  and the honorary names of the storied units and formations will  be retained under the new conditions as well. Someone sensibly  reasoned that the memory of heroic deeds of older generations  could be a powerful factor in the indoctrination of draft youth  and the soldiers of today.    The problem of the state symbol on the aircraft of the Air  Forces of Ukraine has also been cleared from the agenda. A  statute on distinguishing marks (emblems) for aviation units is  being considered in parallel with it.    Suitable variations of samples of these unique military  crests will have to be selected on a competitive basis and  discussed publicly in the military collectives. A colleague of  mine, ARMIYA UKRAINY newspaper staff correspondent for the  Vinnitsa garrison Nikifor Lisitsa, related this to me.    I would note that the distinguishing marks of the Ukrainian  Air Forces appeared for the first time on the MiG-29 aircraft  that took part in air shows in the United States and Canada in  the summer of 1992. That visit, by the way, was described in  detail in the last issue of AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA, which  immediately became a bibliographical collector's item among the  local aviators, since not all of them subscribe to it. Most of  them have now understood that the contemporary specialist cannot  get by without a professional periodical. Both Vasilyev and his  deputies, as was reported at the secretariat of the commander of  the Air Forces of Ukraine, are permanent subscribers to the  journal. It has become much more substantive and interesting in  the last two years, in their opinion. Such a review obligates us  to a great deal. Most importantly, it forces us to believe that  the collaboration between the fliers of the CIS countries in the  skies and on the groud will serve the cause of peace and the  preservation of friendly relations between our peoples in the  future as well.

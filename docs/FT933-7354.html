			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Sport: Troubling the scorers - Cricket THIS YEAR our most traditional sport is trying out some modern machinery. The Test and County Cricket Board hopes that this will make management of the game easier and perhaps help to earn, or at least save, money. The least I could do was try to understand. As an admirer of those treasure-houses of information known as scorebooks, I headed for the new computerised scoring system which has replaced scorebooks in first-class cricket this season. I can see the logic behind using a third umpire, with access to television re-plays, to help with difficult run-out decisions. I think it has drawbacks and dangers, but there is a logic. The motive for computerised scoring is less obvious, except the unworthy one of centralising scores, which are fed directly and instantly into a score-bank throughout play. This central bank, not the county ground, is now the axis of county cricket scoring. Depressed by this thought, I asked various cricket officials about the change, but the reasons they gave me seemed curiously unreal, part of a mythological culture of progress. At Chelmsford last weekend, where Essex were battling the Australians, a friendly gentleman from the secretary's office was more than happy that I should go and look at their new scoring machine because, he said: 'It's progress, isn't it? We have to keep up with the times, don't we?' 'Why?' 'Everyone does.' 'Why?' Apparently the answer in this case is statistics, which is a worthwhile cause in cricket. Because cricket is what John Nyren described 160 years ago as 'an elegant and scientific game', its statistics are both entertaining and important. They are more than mere facts. They elucidate the game. The Association of Cricket Statisticians is a collection of individuals who delight in this. They study cricketing statistics of every kind - historical, contemporary, personal, national, aesthetic. The association is devoted to accuracy and was one of the first bodies to voice doubts about the value of computerised scoring, in February, soon after the scheme was announced. Naturally enough, the TCCB had no such doubts. It joined forces with a news agency and a computer company to install the scoring computers and feed a mass of statistics into the mainframe in Yorkshire. From here statistical information is instantly available to the media. The TCCB, keen to keep cricket up to date, thinks this marks the end of slow and inaccurate match scores in evening papers. I was glad to see the statisticians' association a as sceptical as I am about this. It has found very few mistakes, almost all insignificant, in years of intensive reading of papers' cricket pages. The news agency, the Press Association, is keen to get the latest match news without having to telephone reporters at grounds. It simply taps into the mainframe. I am doubtful about that too. Scores alone are not enough for readers, who would always prefer a write-up, if only a small one, to the latest score in solitary splendour. The computer company is the third party paying for the innovation. Among the star statistics dominating the computer system are each bowler's and batsman's averages, adjusted ball by ball, together with how many balls the batsman has faced, in how many minutes - the list is huge. So huge, in fact, that it was too much for the computers, which broke down under the pressure. It takes more than standard software to soak up the glories of cricket. The computer company has found its first season in the game a long, hard struggle and company politics have inclined towards the Attila the Hun mode. But with a new chairman and two new managers, it is hoping next year will be better. It could hardly be worse, given that the machines were sent to England by sea, not air, so they arrived late and the operators were late getting the hang of them. When they did, the machines were not up to the job. Among the mechanical teething troubles has been the failure to produce print-outs, so there is no open-page display of the details of play, such as a scorebook presents. Instantaneous scoring stores facts but does not show them as items in the game's development. Next season the computers are expected to produce print-outs, which counties can consult, collect, bind and store with their score-books or copy into their scorebooks. Essex is one of the counties most proud of its rich written inheritance, including treasures like scorebooks recording Charles Kortright's noblest matches for his county. There is an irony in the computerised production of match scores on paper to continue a hand-written tradition. At Chelmsford the scorebox was not letting the latest changes get in its way. It had a scoring computer and operator who, though busy, was very friendly and tried to explain to me some of the machine's tangled undergrowth of technology. To the ignorant onlooker, the most obvious feature is a large circle which, under instruction, can represent the ground and show where on the ground each shot is hit. The screen also has a scattering of numbers, some still, some changing, and a mass of hidden numbers. 'You have to know what it's doing,' the operator told me with a rueful smile, 'It's 90 per cent for the media, not for the club.' 'Which is why I'm sitting here doing a record for the club,' said a lady scorer, raising her hand to acknowledge the tired umpire's uplifted arms as visiting opener Matthew Hayden warmed to his task. 'I'm doing one for Australia,' said the Australian scorer. Australian reporters dropped in from the press-box several times while I was there, to check or get details of the score. They always went to a scorebook, which they studied carefully, 'reading the game, lady.' At times reflection is gentler than direct sight; at times, especially when looking back, it can be more useful. Cricket scoreboxes offer both ways of watching cricket. 'Reading the game' from score-books is too valuable a reflective way of watching to be sacrificed to an empty cause like the one which the TCCB spokesman described to me as 'taking the game into the 22nd century.'</p>

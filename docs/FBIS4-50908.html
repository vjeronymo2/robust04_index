			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By LIEN HO PAO's Mainland News Center: "The Strike of </F> 20,000 Workers Shocks Jiang Zemin, Dalian Will Enact the  Mainland's First Regulations on Strikes"]    [Text] The coming issue of ASIAWEEK, to be published soon,  will carry a report about the recent labor unrest in mainland  China. A strike of 20,000 workers has shocked the mainland  authorities. In an important speech, CPC General Secretary  Jiang Zemin listed eight hidden perils on the mainland, the  first of which was worker strikes.    The eight hidden perils enumerated by Jiang Zemin were: 1)  The serious decline in the business results of state-owned  enterprises has resulted in unemployment among the workers and  has led to strikes in Wuhan and Shenyang. 2) There were poor  harvests of grain and cotton; a large area of farmland was left  uncultivated; and many young peasants left the countryside. 3)  Foreign trade was set back by several foreign countries'  antidumping policies. 4) The inflow of large quantities of  foreign goods caused domestic trade to shrink. 5) The masses  are very unhappy about the corruption within the CPC. 6) The  relationship between the central and local authorities is not  harmonious. 7) The tense situation on the Korean Peninsula,  which is on the verge of breaking out, is threatening China's  security. 8) The United States and other western countries are  using human rights to pressure the mainland authorities.    As far as worker strikes are concerned, approximately 20,000  coal miners in Shuangyashan and Jiamusi of Heilongjiang have  reportedly staged a strike. As instructed by the higher  authorities, some large enterprises in Harbin set up special  leading groups to prevent and deal with possible labor unrest,  which could break out suddenly.    In addition, more than 2,000 workers in a Zhuhai factory  staged a three-day strike to protest against the management's  attempt to lower their wages. In Dalian, more than 6,900  workers in a company went on strike for four to five days in a  bid to obtain a pay rise and improved working conditions.    Strikes occurred successively in state-owned enterprises in  Shenyang and Wuhan and shocked Zhongnanhai, forcing the mainland  authorities to adopt some emergency measures. In his speech,  Jiang Zemin acknowledged that strikes had occurred in Wuhan and  Shenyang. He reiterated the need to serve the working class  wholeheartedly, called for prudent arrangements in the adoption  of reform measures, and warned that "workers must not be driven  to the streets."    At the same time, Jiang Zemin also expressed concern over  the  failures of grain crops and cotton and the exodus of the rural  population.    The situation for workers in state-owned enterprises has  been  getting worse. More and more state-owned enterprises are going  to be closed down or sold, and this will mean that workers will  lose their jobs as well as their basic means of livelihood.</p>

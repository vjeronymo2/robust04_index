When asked if the replacement is in the preparatory stages,  Yun Ho-chin, councilor of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna,  stated that the replacement work has progressed to the point  that quite a few of its nuclear fuel rods have been replaced  after being unsealed.    The North Korean councilor stressed that North Korea had  emphasized the inevitability of the replacement to the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and had requested that  IAEA inspectors observe the replacement of nuclear fuel rods on  several occasions.</p>

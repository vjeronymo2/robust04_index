Hesse  Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Greens) had previously  announced in the afternoon that he would order the  Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Electrizitaetswerk (RWE) operating  company temporarily to close the nuclear plant, which was put  into service in 1974.    In the morning, Fischer had obtained the support of the  red-green land government. The Hesse supervisory authorities  have serious doubts about the plant's safety, since RWE did not  put additional safety equipment into Biblis A within the  three-year period, as ordered by former Hesse Environment  Minister Karlheinz Weimar (CDU) in 1992, and meanwhile has filed  a complaint against this order. Biblis A is the oldest reactor  in all of Germany with a capacity of more than 1,000 megawatts.  The reactor is currently switched off for routine checks and,  according to RWE plans, it is to be put into operation again  next Tuesday.    If Hesse gets its way, this would be the first time that a  German land closed down a nuclear power plant for an extended  period against the will of the operating company because of a  marked need for equipment on several counts. RWE would then have  to undertake major reconstruction work before the plant is put  into service again -- among other things, for improved fire  protection and an earthquake-safe cooling system. Toepfer also  thinks this equipment is necessary "within an appropriate  period," but he no longer gives a definite deadline.    According to the Bonn order, Fischer is now forced to keep  still -- for the time being -- until a "federal supervisory  talk" at civil servant level takes place on Thursday.</p>

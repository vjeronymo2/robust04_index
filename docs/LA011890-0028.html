			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: SOONER OR LATER, LONGHORNS WILL MAKE THEM NOTICE PUNCH  </P> <P> Basketball player Joey Wright of the University of Texas didn't know what hit  him in the opening moments of a 103-84 loss to Oklahoma in Norman, Okla., last  weekend.  </P> <P> Wright says he took a blow to the mouth, but thought it was merely the result  of an inadvertent elbow. But a tape of the game shows Oklahoma's Terry Evans  punching Wright. Officials didn't see the punch, either.  </P> <P> "If I knew what happened, we would have cleared the benches," Wright said. "I  never saw the punch until I looked at the tape. But I felt it. I thought he  slipped in an elbow, but it was an outright punch in the mouth."  </P> <P> Asked if there is any action that could be taken, Jamie Ciampaglio, a Texas  assistant coach, said, "Not until next year."  </P> <P> The Sooners the Longhorns will play in Austin, Tex., next season.  </P> <P> "If it was the NBA, the tape would be reviewed and the player would be fined  and suspended," Texas Coach Tom Penders said. "Here, there is no one to send it  to."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Whose interception on the last play of the game Jan. 18, 1976,  ensured the Pittsburgh Steelers' 21-17 Super Bowl victory over the Dallas  Cowboys?  </P> <P> Nothing to prove: The Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan, on plans for a  pay-per-view one-on-one game against the Lakers' Magic Johnson, an idea the NBA  has vetoed: "Who cares who can beat another player one on one? Magic's been  known as an all-around player his whole career. I've been labeled a little bit  as a one-on-one player and I'm trying to shed that label as much as possible.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of fans would love to see it mainly because of the status we  carry in the NBA. But I don't know if that's a fair match. Me against Dominique  (Wilkins) would probably be more fair. But I'm not trying to start anything  else, now."  </P> <P> Add NBA: The Celtics' Kevin McHale, denying that he is the source of  unattributed criticism of teammate Larry Bird, told the Boston Herald:  "Harmony, scharmony. I'm not a symphony director. Life is too short to say  anything negative about anyone. I've never been a person to say anything  negative about a teammate or anyone else."  </P> <P> Lethal weapon: Dale Brown, basketball coach at Louisiana State, and Kentucky  counterpart Rick Pitino nearly came to blows during Saturday night's game at  Baton Rouge, La. Pitino said a couple of days later that he was not concerned  about squaring off with Brown -- "unless he wanted to fight me with his mouth."  </P> <P> Add LSU: Vanderbilt's first-year coach, Eddie Fogler, on the LSU lineup that  includes 7-footers Shaquille O'Neal and Stanley Roberts and high-scoring point  guard Chris Jackson: "They have three (NBA draft) lottery picks. Do you know  any other team in the country that has three lottery picks? I don't know if  there's another team in America that has two."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Glen Edwards.  </P> <P> Quotebook: John McEnroe on why many other tennis stars are skipping the  once-prestigious Australian Open: "It's silly. You're playing in, like, your  first tournament of the year, and already it's a Grand Slam." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

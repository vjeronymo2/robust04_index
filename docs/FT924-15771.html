			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets had a relatively quiet session but, despite the fall in the pound, continued to give a good lead to the underlying equity prices, writes Terry Byland. In the stock index sector, the December contract on the FT-SE Index made a firm start, brushing off political uncertainties prompted by calls in the press for the resignation of the UK chancellor of the exchequer. The contract struggled when it approached the 2,640 mark and lost impetus in the afternoon when volume drifted away to return a final total for the session of only 9,547 contracts. By the close, the contract had settled to around 2,619, still a comfortable premium over the cash market. Traders reported hints that German interest rates might be cut today. In traded options, volume increased to 35,032 contracts from Wednesday's 23,653, with the sector led by the increased interest in Trafalgar House as Hongkong Land built a stake. Trafalgar headed the actives list with 6,388 contracts, followed by the Euro FT-SE with 4,377 contracts and Asda, the food supermarket, with 2,290. There was active trading in the British Airways contracts (1,568) and in Ladbroke (1,116). The FT-SE contract had a less active session, returning volume of 6,810 contracts.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Canada's Trade Minister  Thursday [7 April] criticized U.S. calls to introduce "numerical  targets" to measure foreign access to Japanese markets, Foreign  Ministry officials said Thursday. Canadian Minister for  International Trade Roy MacLaren voiced the concern in separate  meetings with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata, the officials said.    MacLaren told Hosokawa and Hata that Canada considers it  important to promote trade under multilateral rules, they said.    He expressed appreciation for Hata's remarks that Japan  intends to report the results of bilateral discussions to other  nations, and added that Canada opposes U.S. calls on Japan for  numerical targets or to introduce managed trade because such  moves affect third parties, they said. Canada has repeatedly  told Washington of its opposition, MacLaren was quoted as saying.    Hata, during an hour-long meeting with MacLaren, said he has  told U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that agreements  between the United States and Japan should not affect other  nations, so Japan disagrees with numerical targets, the  officials said.    He also referred to the successful Uruguay Round of  multilateral trade talks and said managed trade should be  avoided.    MacLaren voiced expectations that Japan continue to promote  deregulation, they said, and Hosokawa and Hata told MacLaren  that Japan is trying to do so.    The trade minister, who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday after  visiting Fukuoka in western Japan, told the Japanese leaders  that Canada wants to strengthen ties not only with the Tokyo  area but also with local economies, they said.    MacLaren invited Hosokawa and Hata to visit Canada, they  said.    MacLaren has been in Japan since Tuesday on the last leg of  a  three-nation Asian tour that also took him to China and South  Korea. He is scheduled to leave Japan on Saturday.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: American Barrick to lift dividend AMERICAN Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has shrugged off the lacklustre prospects for the yellow metal by raising its dividend and announcing a two-for-one share split. The semi-annual dividend is being increased to 4 US cents a share after the share split, compared with 6.5 cents prior to the split. The share split will take place by means of a special stock dividend, with each holder of a common share on February 19 receiving another share on March 1. Barrick defied the prevailing gloom in the gold industry last week by announcing an 89 per cent jump in 1992 earnings, thanks largely to rising production from its flagship Goldstrike mine in Nevada. An active hedging programme has protected its earnings from the sliding gold price. Barrick's entire output until the end of 1994 is locked in at an average price of more than USDollars 400 an ounce, compared with the current price of USDollars 328. Canadian Tires has reported that heavy price discounting, especially in the fourth quarter, brought a 43 per cent drop in 1992 net profits, though turnover rose by 8 per cent, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Other negative factors for the national hardware, sports goods and car parts retailer, Canada's biggest franchise business, included losses on petrol retailing and a CDollars 15m loss at its new US subsidiary. Net profits for 1992 totalled CDollars 72.3m or 87 cents a share against CDollars 127.1m or CDollars 1.41m a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 3.2bn against CDollars 2.9bn. Fourth-quarter profits equalled 3 cents a share, down from 29 cents a year earlier. Mitel, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker formerly controlled by British Telecom, earned a small third-quarter profit but lost CDollars 9.3m or 15 cents a share on turnover of CDollars 305m for the first nine months, writes Robert Gibbens. A year earlier the nine-month loss was CDollars 10.7m on revenues of CDollars 285m. US sales improved and a lower Canadian dollar is helping. Dominion Textile, Canada's integrated textile group, plans to invest CDollars 20m (USDollars 15.8m) including working capital in its Swift Textiles denim manufacturing unit in Columbus, Georgia, Reuter reports from Montreal. The capital expenditure includes the addition of new looms and equipment modifications, the company said.</p>

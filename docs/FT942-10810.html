			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Continental Airlines cuts fares to Europe Continental Airlines has announced new one-way fares from the US to Europe. According to the airline, these will reduce the price of some tickets by up to 67 per cent. The fully-refundable, unrestricted fares are available on every seat on every flight and do not need to be purchased in advance. A flight to London will cost between Dollars 349 and Dollars 499 each way. Fares to Paris range from Dollars 399 to Dollars 499, and those to Frankfurt, Munich and Madrid will cost from Dollars 349 to Dollars 549. Fares for weekend travel are Dollars 50 higher. American Airlines says it will match Continental's fares, but only on a round-trip basis until September 15. Trans World Airlines says it will respond with fully-refunable, one-way fares in certain international markets. Delta Airlines is looking at the new fare structure but is not sure it will follow suit.</p>

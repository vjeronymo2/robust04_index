			<p>BFN     [Text] New York (A.A.)--UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali submitted a new report to the UN Security Council  today, asking for an extension of the UN Peacekeeping Forces'  mandate in Cyprus until the end of 1994. However, his report  also repeats accusations against the Turkish Cypriot side.    It will be recalled that Butrus-Ghali, in his report dated  30  May, accused TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]  President Rauf Denktas of being politically reluctant regarding  the implementation of the "package of confidence-building  measures" [CBM]. In his new report, he has selected the Turkish  Armed Forces as his target. In his report on the extension of  the UN Peacekeeping Forces' mandate, Butrus-Ghali expresses  regret that "the Turkish military forces' approach has blocked  the effort to have the sides withdraw from the buffer zone and  to ban arms and ammunition in that area." He also claims that  the problems related to access to Maras [Varosha] continue to  exist for the same reason. Butrus-Ghali also notes that "the  Turkish Armed Forces have refused to hold talks with officials  of the UN Peacekeeping Forces on the withdrawal from the buffer  zone, claiming that the matter should be resolved with the TRNC  Government because of its political nature."    Butrus-Ghali's report, which has an incriminating tone,  further says: "The failure to achieve progress on reducing  troops on the island has caused serious anxiety. The situation  becomes even more grave when that matter is considered together  with the lack of political will to implement the CBM's."    Butrus-Ghali also refers to the rearming of the Greek  Cypriot  National Guard since 1988. He notes that the 1994 budget  allocations for the purchase of arms totalled 205 million Cyprus  pounds.    Regarding the extension of the UN Peacekeeping Forces'  mandate, Butrus-Ghali says: "The presence of the UN  Peacekeeping Forces is required for the maintenance of peace on  the island. As far as the achievement of the targets that have  been established by the UN Security Council is concerned, I deem  the presence of the UN Peacekeeping Forces on the island  essential." Explaining that he has contacts with the sides  concerned on the matter, Butrus-Ghali says that he will inform  the UN Security Council on the outcome of his contacts.    The UN Peacekeeping Forces in Cyprus are composed 1,218 men,  1,184 of whom are military personnel. The force is made up of  contingents from Argentina, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland,  Hungary, Ireland, Britain, and Australia.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: ICI ICI is getting into the habit of pulling off tidy deals. Yesterday's tie-up gives its Tioxide subsidiary a share in existing production capacity in North America and access to valuable technology which can be deployed elsewhere. Competitors in the overcrowded titanium dioxide market may also be pleased, since ICI shelved plans to build its own plant in Canada. That underlines the dilemma for ICI chemicals after the demerger of the pharmaceuticals side. Maintaining a presence is expensive: a Dollars 200m cash outlay in this instance. But thanks in part to over-capacity, Tioxide's operating margins are probably less than half the 30 per cent achieved in 1989. Unlike pharmaceuticals, ICI chemicals will not enjoy a fancy rating. Funding its ambitions with paper will be far from easy.</p>

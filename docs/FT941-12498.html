			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / What's up doc?: They're tired, worn out, stressed and depressed. Round-the-clock working is to blame, says Dr Julia Riley, who argues that patients need a disincentive to make out-of-hours calls on their doctors When I came to Britain seven years ago, I was very sceptical about the grumbles of doctors in general practice. Having trained and worked abroad before becoming a GP in the UK, I found little for them to complain about. Consider: The intended average net annual income for a GP in Britain is Pounds 40,600. A principal receiving this salary is expected to be available to patients for 26 hours a week. An average GP spends about 15 hours consulting and 10-11 hours visiting each week. The rest of the time is supposed to be spent on administration. Doctors may also offer clinics (such as baby clinics), but these are not compulsory. In a well organised practice, therefore, the work is not onerous. In addition: The Cost Rent Scheme provides an interest-free loan towards the cost of new premises of adequate standard. These premises eventually become a capital asset for the partnership. The job of a general practitioner is very secure compared with those of other professionals. I could not believe that GPs had it so easy - until I became one. Then I found there is one big exception to all these advantages - and it clouded my whole life: the GP's 24-hour commitment to visiting patients in their homes. This is much the greatest, and I believe, a most unnecessary stress faced by the GP. It requires the GP to offer home visits at night, every night, 365 nights of the year. Night visits and out-of-hours calls became the bane of my life. I was not alone, as a recent survey of GPs showed. When I worked in general practice outside the UK, the doctor was called at night when the problem could not wait until the morning. The person calling the doctor had to decide whether the cost of a night visit was justified. I do not remember an unnecessary call being made. On a recent visit to the US, I was fascinated to observe the process from a parent's point of view. Shortly after midnight, the baby in the home in which I was staying became unwell. He had a fever, was miserable and cried incessantly. His parents became alarmed and equally distressed. They had tried pain-killers several times but the baby screamed all the louder. I was asked to have a look at him. I said the child was teething and that he would eventually settle. Despite this reassurance and having a doctor in the house, his parents called the doctor. But in the US, doctors do not routinely make night calls: if medical treatment is required, the patient goes to the surgery. A dialogue followed between the parents and the doctor. Was the call necessary? Was it urgent? Could it wait for the morning? It was cold, was it fair to take the baby all the way down town in the foul weather? It would cost Pounds 70: was this necessary? What else could be done? It was decided to wait and see. The baby took his time but finally slept soundly. This little scene would have had developed quite differently in the UK. The parents would have gone straight to the telephone and called the doctor. The doctor would perhaps have written a prescription to justify the visit, and an angry, frustrated doctor would have left knowing he had made a night visit for 'teething'. The US family was certainly distressed, but the wisdom of calling the doctor as a first resort must be questioned. If there is no disincentive to calling the doctor, why should patients think about whether a doctor is really needed? Home visiting in Britain has increased fivefold over 25 years. In 1992-3, there were about 164,000 night visits in England at a cost of Pounds 70m. Dr John Chisholm, deputy chairman of the General Medical Services Council said recently: 'There is no underlying clinical explanation for the rise in demand, and the system has reached a point of collapse.' My reply is that the NHS has removed the responsibility of personal health and first aid from the patient and landed it in the lap of the GPs. This results in increased demand and abuse of the system which could ultimately cause its collapse. As soon as a doctor receives a call he takes on a professional responsibility: a simple fever could be meningitis; the person explaining the problem over the telephone may be far from accurate; the patient may insist on a visit (which they have a right to do). This leaves the GPs in a dilemma: do they give advice on the phone and worry that all will be well; or do they make what is usually an unnecessary visit. During a year as a GP in London I found very few out-of-hours calls that were, in my opinion, justified. No doctor objects to visiting patients in need - not a doctor in the land would object to arriving at a home where a diabetic is uncontrolled, an asthmatic is short of breath, or a patient with angina has crushing chest pain. Indeed, it is very satisfying to be able to help in such cases. The average GP is on a one-in-four rota, which means he is on call one in four nights and one in four weekends. But only a third of British doctors have access to a deputising service, which means most work all day and then take on further responsibilities at night. The night calls then become a constant frustration: the patient has power to demand a visit, without the responsibility of assessing the need. Employing a deputising service is not a satisfactory answer, however, as the GP then has to pay for the visits requested by the patients of that practice. And the deputising service system is open to abuse. A friend of mine was recently a locum for a deputising agency in order to supplement his income. On one visit, the door was answered by a woman who said: 'I am so glad you have come. The pipe burst and the water is everywhere.' Bemused, he replied, 'I think you are mistaken, I am the doctor, and I think you need a plumber.' 'Oh, I know you are the doctor, but the plumber would not come and I knew that you would.' In true British spirit, he mended the pipe. I left general practice 15 months ago, so for an up-to-date assessment of how badly the system is working, I called a friend and former colleague at about 8.30 on a Sunday evening: 'How are you?' I asked. 'Don't ask,' came an instant reply. 'I am on call, the weekend is not over, and I have already had 45 calls.' 'How many of the calls were necessary?' I asked. 'Well that is a matter of opinion. The patients thought 45 calls were necessary. If you want my opinion . . . I admitted one patient to hospital, and another five were reasonable calls.' What is the solution? Education might help, but is a slow process. Nothing will educate the public faster than a disincentive, such as mention of the word 'payment'. Unfortunately, the word is anathema to those working in the health service. Magnanimously, they will proclaim that it should provide 'free' care to all. So what about emergency centres? These are to be introduced from April and could bring about big changes. Patients will be asked to go to these centres, staffed by GPs and nurses, rather than have the doctor visit them in their homes. No charge will be made. This is an excellent idea, combining care, free service and a disincentive for unnecessary use. The patient rather than the doctor must decide whether a trip to the emergency centre is needed. Emergency centre pilot schemes indicate that the number of home visits can be halved, since home visits are made only to those who cannot get to the centre. But the idea still has its detractors. One common argument is that people want care from their own doctors, which is fine in principle. But an emergency is an emergency. In such circumstances all that is needed is a competent doctor to take care of the acute episode. Aftercare can be taken over the following morning by the patient's own GP, who will have enjoyed an undisturbed night, be less stressed, less grumpy and better able to deal with the continuation of care from the night's emergencies as well as treatment of the other patients due to see him that day. The introduction of the emergency service will not exclude all home visits. According to Dr Ian Bogle, chairman of the GMSC, home visits will be made when the patient would be harmed by travel, for example. Having left general practice, I now work full time in Palliative Medicine (terminal care). We make home visits all the time and the pleasure is ours: home visits will continue to be a central theme of our care in the community. It is surprising, however, how seldom the elderly or seriously ill request a visit. They are all too often heard saying 'I did not want to disturb the doctor'. In a nationwide GMSC survey, 84 per cent of GPs supported the concept of primary emergency centres. There are plenty of reasons for these centres to succeed: in educating patients; in making patients responsible for decisions on their own care; in reducing patients' expectation of an overburdened health service; and in decreasing stress for doctors. After the patients' charters, this could be the first step towards a Doctors Charter - and they could certainly do with one as I believe them to easily exploited. Doctors for generations have worked ridiculous hours, given their all, survived - and even enjoyed it. I applaud the emergency service scheme, because it attends to the needs of the partnership between GPs and their patients. Health care, the link in this partnership, is now seen as a commodity and like any other commodity it has a value. It needs to be perceived as such by patients and professionals. When I first came to the UK seven years ago, I remember how surprised I was to experience a 'cost free' service. No one asked the cost of a drug, an investigation, an ambulance trip . . . I could go on all day. What we prescribed was never questioned, it was simply given. It was utopia. The bubble had to burst. Awareness of costs is the first step to efficient use of a limited resource, even if attaching price tags to health care is disagreeable. Today, doctors have a new perception of the cost of the service which gives a new meaning to ideas of quality and value. Now, patients' perception of the cost of the service also needs to change. Patients need to respect it, value it, take responsibility for their own health and use the service only when appropriate. This is a true basic that we should get back to.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Francisco Mercado: "Gonzalez Divides Interior </F> Ministry Between Asuncion and Garzon"]    [Text] Madrid -- Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion  announced yesterday that Rafael Vera, current secretary of state  for security, will leave the Ministry at the end of the month,  and will not fill that post. With the departure of this  architect of the Socialist antiterrorist policy--he was  appointed director of state security in 1982--Asuncion holds all  the reins in the area held by the outgoing official, while  assigning "all necessary powers" with respect to drug  trafficking to Baltasar Garzon, [government] representative for  the National Drug Plan [Office] [PNSD]. This body, Asuncion  recalled yesterday, has been attached to the Interior Ministry  "on the government's decision," in accordance with reports  recommending this allocation submitted by the former judge to  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez over the past few months.    Asuncion said that, apart from some dismissals pending in  his  office, the reform of the ministry had been completed with the  changes formalized yesterday. In addition to Fernando Puig de  la Bellacasa's inauguration as deputy secretary, there was that  of Director General of Aliens and Asylum Jaime Axel Ruiz  Baudrihaye, Director General of Interior Policy Carlos Perez  Anadon, government representative in Aragon Rafael Garcia de la  Riva y Sanchiz, and Civil Governor of Castellon Juan Ignacio  Subias.    Vera's departure, which has even been accelerated, according  to government sources, is a logical consequence of two facts.  The policy of Asuncion, who as interior minister has toughened  his language on ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] and has  emphatically ruled out any negotiation, is at odds with Vera's  line of constant messages to ETA leaders to achieve a dialogue  with the terrorist gang. Moreover, Asuncion--although he has  not publicly mentioned this fact--likes to control all the  intelligence reins.    It was not for nothing that Vera centralized all  intelligence  concerning terrorism, and only former Civil Guard Director Luis  Roldan occasionally bypassed that "filter" and went directly to  the minister. Judging by this decision, Asuncion did not wish  to be caught unawares by any subordinate's initiatives to sound  out ETA leaders, as happened to his predecessor.    Second, Garzon's arrival at the Interior Ministry has been  interpreted as a political slap in the face by not a few top  officials of that ministry, with whom he has had disputes in  matters such as the investigation of the Antiterrorist  Liberation Groups or the dismantling of the Civil Guard's UCIFA  (Central Antidrug Fiscal Investigation Unit). In addition,  Garzon comes, as Asuncion said, with "all the powers he needs"  to combat drug trafficking--previously clearly disparaged police  tasks of the state secretaryship still headed by Vera, who was  absent from the ceremony yesterday "because he was on vacation."  Currently, only Police Director Carlos Conde Duque remains out  of the previous Interior Ministry leadership team with  antiterrorist responsibilities.    Asuncion pointed out yesterday that the National Drug Plan's  inclusion in the Interior Ministry is "an aim of the  government," in light of the reports submitted by Garzon to  Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, with whom the former judge has  met on several occasions over the past few months.    Although Garzon's main task will be drug trafficking,  Asuncion yesterday made clear his idea of work: "This is a  team. We will work shoulder to shoulder. I will directly take  charge of what I must do in all areas, but I will also expect my  team to take charge of everything." In fact, a very high  percentage of anticrime activities are connected with drug  trafficking, and will therefore be overseen by Garzon.    Asuncion emphasized that he maintains the same aims as his  predecessor in charge of the ministry, but stressed that he will  use different methods. "The ETA prisoners should become more  involved and should express more openly what they tell us in  private, and not allow themselves to be manipulated." This idea  stems from his philosophy that the price of rehabilitation  should be higher than hitherto, and this could take the form of  demanding more active cooperation in informing on their former  comrades, or at least publicly condemning them. The minister  has even privately shown himself in favor of setting a limit to  rehabilitation and of ETA members serving their sentences in  full after a certain point. Asuncion described as forged the  letters published by EGIN yesterday as having been written by  ETA prisoners stating that the solution to the conflict "does  not lie in the prisons."    Both Asuncion and Garzon strongly emphasized that the  National Drug Plan will not relinquish its responsibilities for  prevention and rehabilitation.    One of the most significant novelties of their exposition is  the government's intention to set up independent central courts  to combat drug trafficking, with the aim of relieving the  National High Court of work. The aim of this initiative is for  those detained for drug trafficking to be tried as quickly as  possible, since time acts as an enemy in these cases and  promotes plots to change testimonies and destroy evidence.  These courts could have jurisdiction over more than one  community, and only indictments with international or national  ramifications would come before the National High Court.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Performance varies in emerging markets There were wide swings last week in the world's emerging markets, ranging from another strong gain in dollar terms in Turkey to a sharp fall in Portugal. Elsewhere among the indices compiled by the IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, significant positive movements were recorded in Jordan, Brazil, the Philippines and India, while other declining markets included Mexico, Colombia and Greece. In Asia, Pakistan has seen a subdued performance recently ahead of the general elections next month. BMA Capital Management in Karachi commented that last week's performance was supported by favourable August trade data, which showed an increase in exports to Dollars 538m from July's Dollars 451m. The brokerage also noted that the market is now likely to remain subdued until the elections on October 6. Among Latin American markets, Mexico suffered a setback as Nafta worries unsettled investors. The market drifted lower during the week as the realisation took hold that Nafta faces a difficult passage through the US congress, particularly as Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, said he would vote against the deal. The market was moderately firmer yesterday amid speculative buying. Baring Securities also noted further privatisation developments, with the award of two more port concessions: 'Between 1993 and 1994 total investment in ports is expected to reach Dollars 700m, most of which will be spent in the construction and improvement of terminals.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Dollar terms                           No. of     Sep 17    % Change     % Change Market                    stocks       1993    over week   on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina                   (11)     729.79      +0.1        +25.8 Brazil                      (44)     243.60      +4.4        +94.9 Chile                       (20)     436.53      +0.3         +4.3 Colombia1                    (8)     466.76      -3.6         +9.8 Mexico                      (58)     701.52      -4.1         +3.8 Venezuela2                   (8)     480.59      +1.0         -7.5 East Asia South Korea3               (130)      94.15      -1.4         -4.1 Philippines                 (11)     195.13      +2.8        +46.1 Taiwan, China4              (76)      82.04      +1.5        +11.2 South Asia India5                      (61)      93.67      +2.5         -0.0 Indonesia6                  (31)      97.04      -0.3        +65.3 Malaysia                    (61)     234.70      -0.2        +43.5 Pakistan7                    (8)     220.18      +0.3        +10.0 Thailand                    (52)     277.07      +0.0        +20.3 Euro/Mid East Greece                      (17)     218.30      -3.5        +11.8 Jordan                       (5)     172.66      +8.2        +47.8 Portugal                    (16)     107.65      -6.0        +39.6 Turkey8                     (31)     168.04      +8.5       +151.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Local currency terms                           Sep 17    % Change   % Change Market                      1993   over week  on Dec '92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina             447,818.16        +0.1       +26.1 Brazil             37,223,736.05       +12.1    +1,684.9 Chile                     711.63        +0.3       +11.0 Colombia1                 671.05        -3.3        +9.8 Mexico                    940.43        -4.2        +3.6 Venezuela2              1,052.11        +1.8       +12.7 East Asia South Korea3              100.11        -1.2        -1.6 Philippines               261.59        +3.2       +61.8 Taiwan, China4             82.14        +1.5       +17.8 South Asia India5                    103.58        +2.5        +8.5 Indonesia6                110.77        -0.4       +68.4 Malaysia                  220.80        -0.0       +39.9 Pakistan7                 297.77        +0.4       +28.5 Thailand                  276.68        -0.0       +18.7 Euro/Mid East Greece                    343.22        -2.6       +20.5 Jordan                    245.05        +8.2       +47.8 Portugal                  122.25        -4.9       +56.8 Turkey8                   927.05        +9.6      +245.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

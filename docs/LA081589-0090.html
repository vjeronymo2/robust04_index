			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ENCINO BEATS RIALTO FOR PONY TITLE  </P> <P> Encino earned its first trip to the Pony League World Series with an 11-5  thumping of Rialto in the championship game of the U. S. West Zone Pony League  championship Monday night in Camarillo.  </P> <P> Encino used the strong relief pitching of Chris Ferebee, who picked up the win,  to shut down an early Rialto threat, and then rallied in the fourth inning to  put the game out of reach.  </P> <P> Encino will open World Series play Friday against host Washington, Pa.  </P> <P> Encino took a 3-0 lead in the top of the first inning on a bases-loaded walk to  Justin Paperny, an run-scoring single by Jesus Perez and a steal of home by  Kevin Deitch.  </P> <P> Rialto scored a run in the bottom of the inning, however, and had the bases  loaded with just one out when Ferebee relieved starter Matt Ward. Ferebee  struck out the next batter and then got a ground ball to second to kill the  threat.  </P></p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Volatility in futures EUROPEAN interest rate futures had a volatile day yesterday as dealers tried to track the changing political situation in Russia, writes James Blitz. At the start of the day, short-term interest rate markets lost a little ground in the wake of a downturn in bond prices. The December Euromark contract declined one basis point to 93.88 and Dec-ember sterling lost the same amount to 94.28. But as signs grew that chaos was not taking place in Moscow, these markets rallied. They may also have gained from the 'flight into quality' that tends to accompany any uncertainty: dealers often move assets down to the short end of the money market curve in times of change so as to be able to respond immediately to any new situation. The December Euromark contract closed a net 2 basis points higher at 93.91, while December short sterling ended at 93.32, up 3 basis points on balance. December French francs finished 4 basis points ahead on the day at 93.67. In the German cash market, the Bundesbank helped to ease conditions by adding some DM5.2bn of liquidity. However, this did not bring call money any lower than 6.85 per cent, still some 15 basis points above the established repo rate. Dealers are not expecting any cut in the discount rate at today's Bundesbank council meeting, which is due to be Mr Helmut Schlesinger's last as president of the central bank. The Bundesbank said there would be no press conference after today's meeting, although its ability to take the market by surprise can never be underestimated. In sterling markets, there was little change to interest rates along the curve. Three-month money again closed at 5 7/8 per cent, with the bid rate at 5 15/16 per cent and the offered side showing 5 13/16 per cent. There were difficulties removing the Bank of England's shortage, which was forecast at the start of trading at Pounds 1.2bn. The Bank did not operate in the early round, and a mere Pounds 11m was removed before lunchtime. In the afternoon, only Pounds 590m was removed and there was late assistance of Pounds 570m, which could be rolled over today. The overnight cost of borrowing sterling peaked at 7 1/2 per cent. As one London dealer said: 'Trying to forecast the overnight in sterling these days is like trying to forecast the British weather.'</p>

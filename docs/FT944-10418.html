			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Lawsuits may force ruling on interest rate futures - Derivatives Two large commercial end-users of derivatives, Gibson Greetings Company and Ohio-based Procter and Gamble, are suing their long-time financial adviser, saying in separate cases that Bankers Trust failed to disclose fully the risks and terms of interest rate swaps that turned into significant loss-makers when US rates turned higher early this year. This by now is old news. However, the cases have the potential to be landmarks in the debate over derivatives regulation for at least two reasons. First, if the suits are not settled and progress to trial, the world will be treated to its first intimate glimpse of how the massive private bank market in swaps really operates. In spite of numerous authoritative studies of over-the-counter derivatives markets during the past 18 months, none has actually dissected the mechanics of an individual trade nor described the confidential courtship and consumating exchanges that occur between counterparties. Investment banks, who serve as adviser, designer and counterparty in these tailored trades, and often also calculate the price base for the cash streams they generate, may as an industry find themselves uncomfortable with the detailed disclosure the judicial fact-finding process requires. Swaps dealers contend that they act in the best interest of their clients, and value the long-term relationship. However, potential conflicts of interest can only be highlighted by the discovery process. Second, both Procter and Gamble and Gibson Greetings have brought their suits to the federal courts under the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, the body of law that governs US futures and options on futures. To be successful in this pursuit, the companies will have to prove that the interest rate swaps in question are futures, and as such, are subject to oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator. Many derivatives players sniff at this strategy, saying it is generally accepted that OTC swaps are not futures. The CFTC contributed to this perception in 1992, when it exempted OTC swaps transactions from most of its oversight authority. In fact, US law has no clear definition of what a 'future' is, and the CFTC avoided the issue when granting its swaps exemption. US law does require that anything judged a futures contract be traded on a listed exchange. Thus, as the swaps industry developed, it hung at the edge of legitimacy. If a disgruntled counterparty sued, and proved in court that a swap was a future, the contract could immediately be deemed illegal, because it was traded off-exchange. The CFTC's 1992 exemption lifted that judicial jeopardy, effectively saying: 'If a swap is found to be a future, it doesn't have to be exchange-traded to be legal.' However, that swap would still have to comply with the agency's anti-fraud rules. Ms Mary Schapiro, the CFTC's new chairperson, may actually be supporting a new view that swaps could be futures, by saying she wants to review the suitability requirements for institutional counterparties that is currently contained in the exemption. She is also considering creating an office within her agency that deals solely with OTC derivatives, and reports directly to her. Further, she has indicated that she would like to write stand-alone anti-fraud provisions for swaps, since the existing ones for listed futures do not transfer sensibly to OTC markets. Ms Schapiro, who has bi-partisan support in Washington and comes to the CFTC from a seat on the Securities and Exchange Commission, may in fact be jockeying to fill in a regulatory void in Washington. The older and larger SEC only has jurisdiction over swaps that can be proved to have securities components, while the CFTC can govern swaps only if they can be proved to be futures, which to date has not happened. Taking a leadership role and assuming the OTC derivatives turf for her agency might be a politically astute move for Ms Schapiro, who, unlike her predecessors, enjoys unusual support from the SEC. In doing so, she is aware she will have to shed her agency's reputation as a limp regulator. Industry attorneys point out that the recent spate of derivatives lawsuits in itself proves an industry contention that additional regulation is not needed for swaps: that big, sophisticated companies entering into derivatives contracts have the resources to fight out their disagreements through the courts, and do not need special government protection. 'I can't think of any federal regulation that could have been written that would have kept Procter and Gamble from losing what it alleges it lost,' says one Washington lawyer.</p>

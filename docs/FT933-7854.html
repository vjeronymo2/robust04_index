			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / MP hears tales of hard times: David Owen takes the political temperature of Hereford's constituents THE ELDERLY countryman fishes a scrap of buff envelope out of his jacket pocket and consults the list scribbled on the back. 'Now then, set-aside,' he says. 'That could be used to help wildlife a lot.' He laments the declining number of redstarts, nightjars and nightingales in his rural patch. It is the seventh topic he has broached in just 25 minutes at Mr Colin Shepherd's Monday morning surgery. The clubbable Tory MP's Hereford seat, which he has held for 19 years, is a typical English shire constituency encompassing an ancient market town and an extensive rural hinterland. Comparatively prosperous but not unmarked by recession, its agriculture-based industries such as chicken-processing and cider making are supplemented by light engineering and high-tech enterprises. As a place to take a snapshot of what is on voters' minds since parliament began the summer recess, a visit to this week's surgery reveals that it is not Maastricht, nor indeed Bosnia, that is most worrying people. Rather it is how to make ends meet when money is tight. A finely balanced argument over whether to build a Hereford bypass continues to raise hackles after six years high on the agenda - the sort of tussle between the environment and economic development that is familiar all over the country. The issue of the bypass has gained national significance after being chosen as one of two schemes to be subjected to a form of 'round-table' consultation as part of the government's plans to speed up the roadbuilding programme. The other old chestnut, which has returned to the front of people's minds since the government embarked on its review of local government structures in the English shires, is the strong local desire for Herefordshire to be resurrected. The county was grafted on to Worcestershire in the reorganisation of the 1970s, triggering widespread and lasting resentment. But Hereford and Worcester is in only the fourth tranche of councils due for review under the schedule designed by the government to give priority to areas with 'a history of dissatisfaction' with existing arrangements. Of the seven constituents who made the trip to the Conservative association office - above a busy car dealership and across the road from a tombstone engraver - most were seeking assistance with personal and specific problems. There is a minimum of political point-scoring. The MP, diligently jotting details into a carbon-papered notebook, acts essentially as a consultant with the experience and standing to identify and secure the full attention of those with the power to put matters right. Three of the morning's appointees have housing problems, one has a query on the eligibility of certain individuals for the social fund - which provides loans and grants to the needy - and one is incensed about being refused access to her place of birth by a foreign government. A television dealer complains on his sheep-farming father's behalf about a missing form from the Ministry of Agriculture. It turns out he has much to get off his chest about 'useless' government paperwork in general. His strength of feeling suggests that the government's initiative to cut red tape may be popular if it can make significant headway. Then there is the elderly countryman. His copious list includes the Herefordshire county issue, the extent to which the National Health Service may be being 'bled' by high-charging suppliers, a proposal to tax caravans and trailers, and several points about 'this bypass lark'. He concludes by urging Mr Shepherd to 'export' British animal-rights activists to discourage songbird hunters in southern Europe. 'I always think it is a miracle when my housmartins come back every year on April 17,' the MP patiently replies. In spite of presiding over one of the Liberal Democrats' prime targets in England, and a majority of less than 3,500, Mr Shepherd will probably be in reasonably good spirits when Conservatives regroup for their party conference in October, although he agrees that he would not want an election tomorrow. 'The association in Hereford is in very good heart: money is coming in, people are attending functions and support for John Major is good,' he says. 'If people don't like me, they are inclined to avert their eyes and walk past me fairly smartly. There are times in every parliament when this happens. The mood at the moment is not like that. It was a few months ago.'</p>

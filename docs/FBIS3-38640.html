			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare and Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] The Government is considering the use of air strikes  in Bosnia, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said today. But he  warned it was a double-edged sword, with air strikes carrying  benefits and risks. Mr Rifkind spoke in Bosnia as Britain was  expected to face overwhelming pressure at European Union talks  in Brussels to support the use of air strikes against the  Bosnian Serbs.    UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali yesterday asked  NATO  to prepare for possible air strikes against artillery positions  in and around Sarajevo after Saturday's [5 February] mortar  attack in the city which left 68 civilians dead. British Jaguar  jets stationed on the Italian Adriatic coast could be among  those involved in any strike.    But Mr Rifkind warned that humanitarian aid convoys guarded  by British troops could be jeopardised by air strikes.    Mr Butrus-Ghali sent a letter to NATO Secretary-Seneral  Manfred Woerner asking him to "take action" to obtain, as soon  as possible, authorisation for the NATO Council to launch air  strikes "against artillery positions in or around Sarajevo,  which are responsible for attacks on civilians targets."  Representatives of NATO's 16 members will meet in Brussels,  possibly today, to discuss the call. NATO, which must carry out  any air strikes, previously authorised only close air cover in  case UN troops were attacked.    Foreign ministers of European members of NATO gather  separately today at the European Union's Foreign Affairs  Committee in Brussels in a meeting that will test Western  determination to intervene after the worst tragedy since the  siege of the Bosnian capital began 22 months ago.    Among other options, the subsequent NATO council meeting  will  consider delivering an ultimatum to the warring factions which  could involve a deadline to the Serbs to lift the siege of  Sarajevo or face air strikes.    European Union governments are aware that the massacre has  renewed criticism of their inaction in the Bosnian crisis. But  any decision on military action would need agreement between the  NATO nations, while the EU will concentrate on keeping  humanitarian aid flowing.    Mr Rifkind said he would support some specific military  action if it could prevent atrocities such as the weekend  shelling of the market place in Sarajevo. "There may be a  powerful case for air strikes" and if military action was needed  to defend UN troops from attack then it would be taken, he said.  But he added: "It is no use trying to hide the fact that there  would be real dangers to the aid programme which is saving tens  of thousands of Bosnian lives."    The Bosnian prime minister had told him during his current  visit that without the aid programme, helped by RAF Hercules  flights, the people of Sarajevo would have starved. Mr Rifkind  was keen for Britain not to be portrayed as at odds with nations  such as France and the United States who look more favourably on  the option of air strikes. A discussion over the use of air  strikes was currently going on in Britain, he said. "We also  are trying to establish whether there is a sensible use of air  power that would actually achieve the objective we all seek, or  whether the net effect would be damaging rather than helpful,"  he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.    Labour's defence spokesman Dr David Clark told the same  programme: "We have got to recognise at the end of the day there  cannot be a military solution in Bosnia but the military might  help to bring about a solution."    Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, arriving in  Brussels for talks, backed calls for air strikes -- provided  they do "more good than harm." He said: "Anything that is done  has to be forward looking. It has to improve the situation and  not simply react to the brutalities of the past." He said such  caution did not rule out the use of air power because the  principle of such action had already been accepted as long ago  as last August. "I think after all that has happened the case  for air action is very strong provided we can find a means for  doing it in a way which produces more good than harm. That is  really what NATO has to work out urgently in the next few days,"  Mr Hurd added.

			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> "The city never looked that good," a middle-aged man said enthusiastically the  other day as he gazed at Larry Cohen's gently idealized paintings of Los  Angeles. If Cohen's subjects were panoramas of Cincinnati or Passaic you can  bet local interest would be a good deal milder. What he does, after all, is not  terribly remarkable. It is a question of organizing familiar topography into  views -- the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway, the visible  area from the top of Westridge, downtown L.A. as seen from Micheltorena. To  perform this act of local homage, as every landscape painter knows, you divide  your canvas into horizontal zones of alternately dark and light areas and  generalize the details.  </P> <P> Things perk up a bit when a specific light effect dominates a scene. In "View  of Bay/Pacific Palisades," the shadow that creeps inexorably across waves, the  strip of sand, the street and the hills have the majestic effect of a  visitation from a Supreme Being. But for the most part, these paintings seem  little different in spirit from those turned out generations ago by the first  sun-struck visitors to our shores.  </P> <P> If Cohen is obliged by modern-day realities to include signs of the  congestedness of urban life, he doesn't seem to have an opinion about it. Nor  does he (like Wayne Thiebaud in San Francisco) invent new ways of painting the  same old sights. Attractive, familiar, unthreatening, his paintings don't  recreate Los Angeles; they just copy it according to time-tested formulas. It's  too late in the day to be satisfied with that.

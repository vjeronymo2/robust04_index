In an interim report on the government's activities to  ensure Germany's attractiveness as an economic base, published  on Tuesday [28 December], Rexrodt expressed confidence that the  process of recovery will continue and intensify next year.  However, a rise in unemployment and "considerable employment  problems" are to be expected.    It became increasingly clear at the end of the year that the  economy has bottomed out, the minister stressed when he  presented the report. A growth of 0.5 to 1 percent is possible  in west Germany next year, and a growth of 7.5 percent is  possible in east Germany. Yet employment will certainly drop in  the old laender. Even once the recession is overcome, a  relatively high level of unemployment is to be expected, in  particular because of the structural problems.    Germany's economic policy will concentrate on these problems  in 1994. Profitable new jobs be created in Germany only by  overcoming the structural difficulties. An efficient labor  market policy continues to be absolutely necessary. It must  accompany the "tremendous structural changes" in the new laender  and ease the impact of the economic stagnation on the western  labor market. Rexrodt vehemently rejected initiatives to shorten  working hours. Efforts to solve the employment problem by  redistributing the existing work are the "wrong economic  concept."    The program of action to fight structural unemployment,  adopted by the cabinet in September, will be given "absolute  priority" in the next few years. The Federal Government alone  will implement about 80 measures in this legislative period.  One-third of the work has already been completed. Substantial  progress has been achieved in numerous spheres. To create a  broad social basis for further measures designed to ensure  Germany's attractiveness as an economic location, Rexrodt plans  to organize a "location forum" in Bonn on 8 and 9 February to  "overcome the prevailing thinking in terms of old rights and  group interests."    Hans Peter Stihl, president of the Federation of German  Chambers of Industry and Commerce, strongly criticized the  initiatives that the Federal Government has taken so far. He  demanded "clearer signals of the world economy" for next year.  The super election year must not become a "year of economic  rhetorics but a year of deeds." If the government's report on  efforts to ensure Germany's attractiveness as an industrial  location remains pure theory, the enterprises will not receive  stimuli and become frustrated. A reversal of the current  economic trend will only take place if the readiness for  investments increases in the economy. However, so far there can  be no talk of a reversal. The government must not shy away from  "very painful cutbacks," particularly in the sphere of social  benefits.    The German Association of Savings Banks has rejected general  economic pessimism. The opportunities for a recovery in the  middle of 1994 have improved, but the recovery will not be very  strong. It is decisive for Germany to become internationally  more competitive again as far as costs and products are  concerned. Over the short term, a moderate wage policy is also  necessary. A policy aimed at ensuring the level of real wages  in 1994 would certainly endanger jobs in the industry and have a  negative impact on investments at home, the association stressed.</p>

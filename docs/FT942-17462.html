			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Fears as Indian inflation hits 9.9% India's inflation has risen to an annual rate of 9.9 per cent, prompting fears that it could climb above the politically sensitive 10 per cent level and provoke attacks on the government's economic liberalisation policies. The data, released on Sunday, refer to the rate of increase in wholesale prices for the week ending March 19, the latest period for which figures are available. Inflation has risen sharply in the past year from a recent low of 6.7 per cent, due partly to increases in government administered prices of basic commodities such as food and fuels and partly by a rapid rise in the money supply. The increases in administered prices from artificially low levels are a central element of economic reform, which includes decontrolling prices and reducing subsidies. The rise in the money supply has two principal causes - larger-than-planned government borrowing and the inflow of foreign exchange into India. According to officials at the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, the money supply has risen by about 17 per cent in the year to the end of March 1994, compared with a target of 12 per cent. The government has said it could drive down prices by releasing low-priced food from its official stocks and by spending some of its Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10.2bn) of foreign exchange reserves to import essential commodities. Such policies could help the poor, who are most vulnerable to prices increases, but they may not hold down inflation in prices of industrial goods. Also, the increase in the inflation rate could force the postponement of future interest rate cuts. Officials are concerned that the inflation rate is hovering at about 10 per cent when the general climate for prices in India is favourable. International oil prices and interest rates are low and India's farmers have had six good monsoons in succession. An unexpected deterioration in this price climate could well raise the inflation rate further. Another worry is that the economy is growing at only a moderate pace - an estimated 3.8 per cent for the year ending March 1994. If growth accelerates, as the government hopes, the upward pressure on prices could also increase.</p>

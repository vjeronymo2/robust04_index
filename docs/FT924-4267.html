			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Arms software for Iraq 'was approved' ICL, THE UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, confirmed this week that three government departments approved a 1989 move to supply an advanced computerised defence system to the Iraq Ministry of Defence prior to the invasion of Kuwait. The attempted sale, details of which are published today in the trade newspaper Computer Weekly, is further evidence of relaxed government attitudes towards the sale of military equipment to Iraq during the late 1980s. ICL said yesterday that the deal, involving the ICL-developed Air Staff Management Aid (Asma) command-and-control system - used by the allies during the Gulf war - fell through for 'ordinary business reasons' long before the onset of hostilities. ICL obtained export licences for the Asma software in 1989 after detailed discussions with the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

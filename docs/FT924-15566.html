			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House In the light of Hongkong Land's opportunistic move to grab a 30 per cent stake in Trafalgar this week, investors will doubtless be scratching around for other asset rich companies apparently undervalued by the UK stock market. It is hard to find targets, though, which are dogged by such a rich combination of uncertainties. Bids there will be at the first sniff of real recovery, but it is still much too early for corporate financiers to be licking their lips. The tussle for Trafalgar thus looks set to be the more intriguing for being waged in isolation. But one wonders whether those who sold out to the Far Eastern raiders on Thursday will not regret their haste. Given the company's clutch of largely late cycle businesses - and the worrying build-up of debt  -there is obviously some downside risk. This is surely one reason for Land to stick with a minority stake for the moment. With boardroom representation it will presumably have a clearer idea of what it has bought in 12 months' time. Already, though, one must assume that the Keswicks have a shrewd idea of the sort of value they can extract. Whether this can be done by galvanising existing management, injecting new boardroom blood, or ultimately assuming control via a full takeover is scarcely relevant for shareholders. All are reasons for sitting tight. Keen students of Trafalgar, meanwhile, will be looking forward to the role that results for the year to September will play in the defence. A temptation must be to limit the dividend cut and take a Barratt-style write down on housing land, clearing the way for earnings growth next year.</p>

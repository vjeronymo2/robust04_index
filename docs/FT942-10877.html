			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / EU backs Gulf tariff plans The European Union backs plans by Gulf Arab states gradually to unify tariffs, paving the way for a free-trade accord, the Greek foreign minister, Mr Karolos Papoulias, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Riyadh. 'These positive developments undoubtedly lay the basis for significant progress towards the completion of our co-operation framework. . . the aim being to conclude a free-trade agreement,' Mr Papoulias said at the opening session of talks in Riyadh between the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) and the EU. Greece holds the EU rotating presidency. The GCC, which groups Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar, agreed last month to unify tariffs for one group of products at a time as a move towards an overall free-trade accord. Mr Papoulias also urged the oil-rich states to support environmental protection - apparently a reference to a European plan for new energy taxes to reduce fuel usage. 'The European Union and other industrialised countries have undertaken commitments concerning the protection of the environment. On the other hand, our partners in the GCC have not,' Mr Papoulias said. 'We consider this vacuum could be filled through continuous, sincere and constructive dialogue.' GCC states have so far objected to proposed EU energy taxes as discriminating against oil exporters and of dubious value in limiting damage to the environment. The economic and political talks were attended by GCC ministers and officials from 12 EC countries, including six government ministers.</p>

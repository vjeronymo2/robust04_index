			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUIT WASTED  </P> <P> I can't believe what I'm hearing. Members of Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa  are complaining that the noise levels around the Pacific Amphitheatre are  excessive during concerts.  </P> <P> What do they expect -- they live near an outdoor amphitheater! Should tens of  thousands of music fans be forced to drive to Los Angeles to see a decent  concert because a few hundred local residents find the occasional noise  "annoying"? It seems equally absurd that tax dollars are being spent on a long,  drawn-out lawsuit, and to dispatch expensive noise-monitoring equipment every  time there's a concert at the Pacific.  </P> <P> A little more tolerance on the part of the residents in the interest of  cultural diversity in Orange County seems in order. If all else fails, the  county might consider supplying each of the aggrieved residents with a free  pair of earplugs. Regardless of the solution, we need to stop wasting tax  dollars on this frivolous lawsuit and start worrying about Orange County's real  problems.  </P> <P> JAMES MATTHEWS  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

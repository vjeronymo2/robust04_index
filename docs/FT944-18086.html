			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Observer: Hezza on guard Imagine what would happen if Michael Heseltine had been taken hostage by angry French airport baggage handlers. It may be a far-fetched thought. But why else did Britain's president of the board of trade apparently put pressure on the Department of Transport to delay the announcement that it was taking the European Commission to court over the extravagant subsidies for Air France? It went out only after he had caught his plane back to London. Heseltine, on a trip to promote Anglo-French industrial collaboration, was in no mood to take any chances. Even at dinner on Monday night when one of the guests, a former Air France board member, discussed Air France subsidies, Hezza made a point of saying he had never brought up the subject. Chicken.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Observer: Cold turkey for Tories Sad day tomorrow for Glaxo's shareholders as Sir Paul Girolami finally steps down from the helm of the UK drugs giant. Tory treasurer Lord Hambro could also be forgiven for feeling a mite upset since Girolami's going will almost certainly leave a gaping hole in the Tories' bank account. Under Sir Paul, Glaxo has been a substantial donor to the Conservatives, giving Pounds 550,000 since 1985 when he became chairman. He justified the largesse as being in the best interests of shareholders. But Sir Colin Corness, the part-time Bank of England director who will take the Glaxo chair, begs to differ. An outspoken critic of corporate donations, he has not yet had a chance to discuss the issue with Glaxo's other directors. He doesn't take over till May. But the Tories are bracing themselves for the worst unless Lord Howe, a Glaxo new boy, can save the day.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Employers sweeten pensions - Measures being taken to keep workers loyal A PENSION often is described as the most valuable but least-valued benefit that employers provide. Such a contradiction has been a source of increasing concern to employers who, with their pension costs spiralling upwards, watch with increasing frustration as their staff opt out of handsome benefits packages for personal pension plans that are patently less attractive. Now, pension consultants say, employers are examining ways to restructure their packages to make them more attractive to a broader mix of employees. Kevin Spring, director at the Wyatt Company, a firm of consulting actuaries, says the advent of personal pensions has made employers aware that the generous provisions they are making for their workers' retirement are not fully appreciated. Furthermore, they are often not the most attractive for younger or part-time workers who will not stay long enough to enjoy the benefits fully. Spring says the challenge is for employers to provide for workers' retirement in a way that most will appreciate. And because workforces are diverse, the classic final salary scheme awarded after 30 years of continuous employment is attractive to only some of the employees. Under such a scheme, a full pension allows a retiring worker to receive two-thirds of his final salary for as long as he lives, with the likely guarantee of periodic inflation adjustments besides. But while such benefits are enough to guarantee the loyalty of older workers, younger transient workforces are often unimpressed. 'Personal pensions are simple to understand, flexible, provide investment choice and are perceived to be portable,' Spring says. 'All of this makes them extremely attractive for younger people, even though these perceptions often prove to be invalid in practice.' According to Paul Greenwood, research actuary at consulting actuary Mercer Fraser and Co: 'What has changed things has been the availability of voluntary scheme membership and the growth of personal pensions. Employers are spending 10 to 15 per cent of total payrolls on pension benefits and they want to get better value for money out of it.' The fact that this spending is not necessarily appreciated by workers has prompted the redesign of pension benefits. But while this issue is deeply troubling to the pensions industry, a relatively small proportion has tried to address it so far. Mike Brown, director of communications for the National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, says: 'Flexibility is one of those things which everyone is in favour of but which can give you lots of trouble.' He pointed out that in a survey of members, only five per cent had moved to introduce some element of flexibility. For those which have, a number of options are available. Spring outlined several which employers are building into their schemes. One, a so-called 'nursery scheme,' allowed employees under the age of say, 35, to join only a so-called money purchase scheme which would give them a portable lump sum. At the trigger age, the employee was then allowed either to stay with the money purchase scheme or opt into the final salary scheme most attractive to older workers. Another option would be to give all employees the choice of taking part either in a defined contribution plan, where they paid in an agreed portion of their salary, or a defined benefit scheme where the final return was known. The defined contribution scheme would not be as attractive as the package received by those in the defined benefit scheme after a full working career. But people who stayed in for a shorter period of time - say, five years - would receive proportionate benefits which would certainly be better than the benefits received by those who had elected a defined benefit scheme. Greenwood says some employers have offered the option of accruing a smaller portion of a final salary scheme in any given year in exchange for either a lower annual employee contribution or the availability of some other inducement, such as a company car. While employees typically accrue 1/60th of their final pension each year, some have opted to accrue only 1/80th. Flexibility has its attractions but cost savings are not one of them, Greenwood says. Overall, flexibility increases costs slightly by making administration more expensive. 'But the trade-off is a greater appreciation of benefits.' Thus, spending on pensions engenders employee loyalty rather than producing a yawn - precisely the view that prompted companies to offer pensions in the first place.</p>

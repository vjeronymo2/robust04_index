			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / A world of difference in a grain of rice: Japan thinks its rice is nicest, even when scarce Don't worry, it's Japanese rice.' The sushi chef behind the white cedar counter gave a reassuring smile as he placed a slice of tuna on a small ball of rice. 'We've stocked up so we won't have to use foreign rice for a while,' he said. Japan is in the middle of a rice crisis. Last year's unusually cold summer and a spate of typhoons resulted in the worst harvest in postwar history. Japan is not due officially to open its rice market to imports, as agreed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, until next year. But the government estimates 2.2m tonnes will have to be imported this year. Bureaucratic delays have meant stores have yet to receive such emergency supplies. But although bags of grain have gone from the supermarket shelves, many restaurateurs and retailers have managed to squirrel away rice supplies. The sushi chef looked affronted at the suggestion that the balls of rice he put on an assorted raw fish platter were made from a blend of emergency imports and home grown rice. 'Some sushi shops without domestic supply routes like mine have closed,' he said. It would be impossible to make sushi with a blend of Californian and Thai rice, he said, because rice accounts for 70 per cent of the dish's taste. Such is Japan's sensitivity about rice that Mr Eijiro Hata, the agricultural minister, had to apologise to the public this month for the breakdown in the state-controlled rice market. He announced the government would speed up the sale of an additional 30,000 tonnes of domestic rice to wholesalers. But he risked exacerbating the ire of the Japanese by trying to force retailers and wholesalers to blend all rice with at least some foreign imports. In parliament, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has been blamed by the opposition Liberal Democratic party for failing to avert the shortage. The political row has highlighted the sanctity of home-grown rice, the cultivation and harvesting of which remain at the roots of Japanese traditions and rituals. Whereas aircraft have long been used to sow rice seeds in the US, until recently rice seedlings in Japan were hand planted. Rice-planting festivals are still held in June, including at the imperial palace in Tokyo, where a barefooted Emperor Akihito plants seedlings in his private rice paddy. In autumn, harvested rice is offered to the gods, and sushi chefs refer to their rice as 'shari', a shortened version of Sanskrit sarira, meaning, 'the bones of Buddha'. But the attachment to home-grown rice is not just spiritual. Consumers prefer Japanese rice because it is regarded as better tasting and stickier than foreign imports. The Japanese like a sweeter and heavier grain that can, for instance, be moulded into balls. Some are put off by the sight of long foreign grains. 'I know I shouldn't be prejudiced and at least I should try it, but I feel more comfortable buying and eating domestic rice,' said Mrs Mieko Ichikawa, a 40-year-old housewife. Among the old, with wartime memories, the latest shortages have revived a hoarding instinct: 'Everyone who has experienced the war keeps extra bags of rice just in case,' said 78-year-old Mrs Kyoko Kimura. At the same time, some consumer groups have claimed foreign rice may be unsafe because of the use of post-harvest fungicides and pesticides. Press reports of dead mice, cockroaches, or cigarette butts found in foreign rice have added to such fears. The high demand for home-grown rice together with the restricted supply have opened opportunities for retailers - as well as racketeers - to increase profit margins. Of the 7.8m tonnes of rice harvested last autumn, some 2m to 3m tonnes are estimated to have flowed in to the black market's complicated distribution web and to have been hoarded by wholesalers and retailers. A black market in rice is not new, but this year it has been particularly buoyant. A 10 kilogramme bag of prime grade rice which cost Y6,000 on the black market last year, has nearly doubled in price while some retailers are only selling to favoured customers. The government is belatedly trying to calm the market. Leading cabinet members, many of whom had belonged to the lobby that opposed the opening of the Japanese rice market during the Uruguay Round of trade talks, recently tucked into foreign rice in front of television cameras to try to persuade the country that it was at least edible. But emergency imports of blended rice have been hard to obtain in recent weeks. Much has been delayed in the ports due to vigorous and time-consuming customs inspections by officials unused to rice being imported. Consumers may have to wait another month for a steady flow of blended rice to hit the shops. Even then it is far from clear if many will eat it. Domestic farmers have tried to take advantage of the public debate over rice imports to stress the superiority of the home grown product and re-emphasise their role as keepers of Japanese culture. However, such attempts to instil in the younger generation the rice culture revered by their forebears may have fallen on deaf ears. Tastes are changing and for many modern Japanese, rice has become just another commodity amid the diversity of foods available. Sitting along the sushi counter, a mother tried to urge her sulking son to eat the morsels of raw prawns and rice in front of him. 'I want McDonald's,' he wailed.</p>

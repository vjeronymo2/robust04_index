			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> BOYS 3-AA;  </P> <P> ESTANCIA STOPS SERVITE IN OVERTIME, 51-49  </P> <P> Estancia High School's Agustin Heredia plays basketball as if he owns the game.  </P> <P> Wednesday night, the 5-foot-10 senior guard made a huge investment in  Estancia's 51-49 overtime victory over Servite in the Southern Section 3-AA  Division boys' basketball championship game in front of 4,428 fans in UC  Irvine's Bren Center.  </P> <P> First, Heredia made a 12-foot baseline shot with three seconds remaining in  regulation, tying the score, 46-46. Then he made five free throws to account  for all of his team's points in the three-minute overtime, giving Estancia  (20-5) its first Southern Section title.  </P> <P> Servite (17-11) had taken a 46-44 lead when guard Paul Stapleton made a free  throw with 13 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Estancia called a timeout with nine seconds remaining and set up a play for  Heredia, who finished with 32 points. Heredia hit nothing but net.  </P> <P> "You know what he asked me during the timeout?" said Tim O'Brien, Estancia  coach. " 'Do you want a two or a three?' There was no doubt he was going to  make the shot and tie the game."  </P> <P> Servite struggled to make its free throws, sinking only 13 of 27. At one point,  Servite was 7 of 17 at the line.  </P></p>

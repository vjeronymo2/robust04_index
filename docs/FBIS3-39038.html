In a  few days' time, the small aircraft carrier will be off the coast  of Mogadishu at the head of the naval task force responsible for  protecting and supporting the withdrawal of the Italian troops  from Somalia.    "Operation Garibaldi," which was decided on by Defense  Minister Fabio Fabbri, was planned under the supervision of  Admiral Guido Venturoni, chief of defense staff. The navy had  little choice whether or not to use the Garibaldi: The cruiser  Vittorio Veneto, an aging flag ship, despite its glorious past,  is too old a ship and has a smaller flight deck than the  Giuseppe Garibaldi.    The Garibaldi can carry AV-SB vertical-takeoff fighter  aircraft (the American version of the British Sea Harrier), but  the aircraft cannot be used in Somalia: None of the aircraft is  operational yet. "However, we do not believe that aircraft are  indispensable in the type of operation that we are preparing to  carry out in Somalia," says a naval general staff source: "The  protection and transport capability provided by the helicopters  are sufficient guarantee of effective cover."    The Garibaldi will be accompanied off Mogadishu by a  frigate,  the San Marco battalion's two amphibious ships, which will  accommodate most of the army's bersaglieri [riflemen] returning  to Italy, and a supply ship.    Italy has also reached additional agreements with the  government of Kenya guaranteeing access to the runways at  Nairobi airport: The air force's C-130 and G-222 aircraft whose  job it will be to bring the last soldiers in Somalia back to  Italy will land in the Kenyan capital.    The operation that is planned is a massive one, confirming  the fears prevailing at the Italian Defense Ministry.  Yesterday, Minister Fabbri confirmed, discreetly, that the  intelligence services' information channels have been put into  top gear. The information received indicates that the Somali  irregular militias are preparing to fill the "vacuum" left by  the Western blue berets as soon as the latter withdraw. Many  sources expect fighting, and fighting requires weapons: If  necessary, the Somalis will not hesitate to attack the military  convoys as they withdraw.</p>

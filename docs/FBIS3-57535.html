The leader of the Belarusian Popular  Movement parliamentary opposition, Zyanon Paznyak, stated that  the main reason for dismissing them were the facts that they  knew about corruption and the involvement of government  officials and leaders in that corruption; moreover, they were  uncompromising on this issue. Second, there are political  forces at work which have close connections with imperial  Russian circles, including special services and the Russian  counterintelligence service, according to KGB Chairman Eduard  Shirkovskiy's statement during the behind-closed-door  proceedings. Zyanon Paznyak also touched upon the personal  qualities of the dismissed officials. Thus, according to the  oppositional leader, thanks to Vladimir Yegorov, there was no  bloodshed in Belarus over the last four years. Both Vladimir  Yegorov and Eduard Shirkovskiy have been trying, while adhering  to the law, to act in line with Belarusian interests, which was  much to the dismay of the Council of Ministers.</p>

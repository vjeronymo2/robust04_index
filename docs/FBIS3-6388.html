			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Foot-Dragging Tactic Aimed </F> at Attaining Sinister Purpose"]    [Text] The South side's maneuvers to use the issue of  exchanging special envoys as a means to attain its sinister  political aims are all the more viciously carried out.    As it has already been known, our side resumed the  working-level contact for the exchange of North-South special  envoys in accordance with the agreements reached at the  DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, and thus made a series of  progress in realizing the envoy exchange.    Out of the position to realize the exchange of North-South  special envoys at the earliest possible date in a good  atmosphere, our side took a magnanimous and momentous step at  the sixth working- level contact, taking note of the fact that  the South side has expressed understanding of the feasibility of  the four just demands our side raised, even though on the whole  is short of our expectations. As a result, a bright prospect  for the exchange of special envoys was opened for the North and  South.    Since then, our side again called on the South side at the  recent contact to return to the position of reconciliation and  unity and accept our side's just proposal on announcing a joint  communique. In addition, our side urged that the two sides  should wind up the discussion of working procedures and conclude  an agreement on the basis of the North-tabled agreement on the  exchange of North-South presidential envoys.    The reason we insisted on announcing the joint communique is  because it would be a chance for the two sides to confirm that  special envoys would certainly be exchanged. Thus, this would  give hope to the fellow countrymen and mark a turning point for  North-South relations. Announcing the joint communique would  give an opportunity for the two sides to wind up the discussion  of working procedures on the envoy exchange at an early date.    At a time when people at home and abroad express concern  over  the prospect for the envoy exchange, the fact that the North and  South, the parties concerned, reaffirm their will for the envoy  exchange and agree to exchange special envoys at the earliest  possible date would be a good thing, seen from every point of  view.    If the South side truly wants to exchange special envoys  with  us, it is reasonable to show its intention by welcoming and  responding to our claim on announcing a joint communique  regarding the issue of the exchange of special envoys.  Nevertheless, the South side repeatedly made the same old  remarks again and opposed our side's proposal.    It recklessly failed to agree with our proposal without a  reasonable basis. This proves that it has no will for the  exchange of special envoys, and that for it to come forth to the  working-level delegates' contact for the exchange of special  envoys is only to give the impression it is holding talks with  the North.    Even in the discussion of the working procedures, the South  side insisted on an unreasonable position, and did not accept  principle and important issues such as the issue of defending  the principle of national independence, of concluding the method  for the fatherland's reunification, and of promoting great  national unity, which is related to the duties of the special  envoys.    The principle and important issues that our side put forth  in  connection with the duties of the special envoys of both sides  all embody the three principles of the fatherland's  reunification and guarantee the improvement of North-South  relations.    The fact the South side did not accept the issue of  defending  the national independence shows that it will continue to prevent  the fatherland's reunification by currying favor with outside  forces. Also, not accepting the issue of concluding the method  for the fatherland's reunification means to continue division.  Moreover, opposing the issue of promoting great national unity  is to continue to move toward the road of confrontation, not  national reconciliation and unity.    On 15 March, a fellow called the puppet minister of the  National Unification Board officially babbled that the  working-level delegates' contact would end in failure. This is  by no means a coincidence.    Ultimately, this clearly shows that the South Korean  authorities do not have the intention to exchange special envoys  nor the will to resolve the fatherland's reunification issue  through the method of dialogue and negotiations.    The dark intention of the South side not accepting our  principle issue was to delay the exchange of special envoys so  as to cast a shadow in the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and  plot to harm the fellow countrymen.    The people of the world came to correctly know who wants to  achieve the exchange of special envoys and who opposes it,  through the betrayal act of the South side, which is moving  backward when the exchange of special envoys is at an important  occasion of being realized.    It will be good for the South side to contemplate over the  grave consequence the maneuver to delay the exchange of special  envoys will bring about. Having regrets is always too late.    The South side must not play a double game to prevent the  exchange of special envoys, but should sincerely come forth at  the next contact. We will carefully watch over the South side's  attitude.</p>

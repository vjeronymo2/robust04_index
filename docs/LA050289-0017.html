			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE'S THE PASSION NOW FOR IRAN-CONTRA REFORMS?  </P> <P> Once upon a time the American public was told that the Iran-Contra affair was  an aberration. "Never again," was the assurance by the President, the  independent review board chaired by former Sen. John Tower and the joint  congressional committee investigating the scandal.  </P> <P> There were some of us who disagreed with this finding and believed that strong  action was required to regulate and oversee the use of covert action and secret  diplomacy. However, as public concern about the scandal waned -- Ronald Reagan  was fond of saying that it didn't matter at all to the folks living beyond the  Washington Beltway -- the pressure for reform lost much of its momentum.  </P> <P> The most far-reaching and significant reform was the proposed amendment to the  National Security Act requiring that the congressional intelligence oversight  committees be given prior notice of virtually all covert actions. In  fast-breaking and rare circumstances in which the President determines that  Congress cannot be informed in advance, the change in the law would require  that Congress be notified no later than 48 hours after an operation had been  approved.  </P> <P> Vigorously opposed by the CIA, these requirements would have assured that  Congress received the timely notice of planned covert action operations that  was missing in the Iran-Contra affair. After passing the Senate by a vote of  71-19 in March, 1988, and being favorably reported out of the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence in June, the amendment was taken off the  calendar for a vote in the House in September and -- as a gesture of  bipartisanship by the leadership of the House -- shelved when Congress  reconvened in January  </P> <P> Speaker Jim Wright's reasons for doing so were political. He apparently thought  that he lacked the votes to pass the amendment over a presidential veto and  that his own alleged breach of security in discussing U.S. covert actions in  Central America at a press conference last in September had weakened the  argument that Congress could be trusted to keep secrets.  </P> <P> But whatever motivated the Speaker's decision, the fact remains that under  present laws and executive orders, Congress still has no way to make sure that  it is kept fully and currently informed of covert action plans.  </P> <P> Another cause of the Iran-Contra affair was the tendency of the President's  assistant for national security affairs and the assistants to that official  (i.e., the NSC staff) to implement and manage policy.  </P> <P> The Tower Commission recommended that these tendencies should be vigorously  resisted. But the commission also recommended that the national security  adviser, and not the secretaries of state or defense, should chair the  top-level interdepartment committees that formulate and decide national  security policy. President Bush's national security adviser, Gen. Brent  Scowcroft, was a member of the Tower Commission and has done precisely what was  recommended.  </P> <P> The problem is that the line between chairing such committees and advocating  policy is easy to breach. Moreover, such advocacy often leads to a desire to at  least manage, if not implement, the course of action selected.  </P> <P> By putting the national security adviser in charge of the meeting, President  Bush virtually invites Scowcroft to take over when the inevitable disputes  between the secretaries of state and defense threaten to stymie U.S. policy.  </P> <P> Of course, it can be argued that any system for making decisions in any  organization can be flawed if the people who participate in it lack integrity.  The principal finding of both the Tower Commission and the joint congressional  committee was that the Iran-Contra affair resulted from the failure of  individuals to observe the law.  </P> <P> True, Oliver L. North is awaiting a jury's verdict, and former National  Security Adviser John M. Poindexter is soon to go to trial. But the government  has had to drop the most serious charges against North due to the fear that to  prove its case, sensitive national security information might have to be  revealed.  </P> <P> The government also opposed the right of North's defense attorneys to require  former President Reagan to testify. Consequently, the public will never really  know if North was acting alone and without the approval of higher authority. So  even if North is found guilty of the charges against him, he will be seen by  many as a scapegoat.  </P> <P> Thus, it is highly questionable that the North trial will act as a deterrent to  gung-ho officials in the future bent on using covert action as an alternative  means of conducting U.S. foreign policy.  </P></p>

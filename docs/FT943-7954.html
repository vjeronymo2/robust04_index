			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool prices have continued to advanced on a broad front, and as auctions have been resumed in the new selling season the pace has tended to accelerate. There are variations between sectors. Finer merinos are in short supply, and remaining stocks held in the official Australian stockpile are low. Demand meanwhile is building up with fashion one factor, and anticipation of shortages to come another. The world crossbred wool situation is also obviously firmer with supplies and stocks seen as liable to fall short of demand. Only with middle micron merinos is the Australian stockpile seen as a holding factor, and this is not enough to prevent price rises here also. Wool international's Eastern states market indicator closed 706 cents yesterday, compared with 693 a week ago.</p>

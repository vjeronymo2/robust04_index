			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Sun Alliance launches bond Sun Alliance has launched a single premium investment bond with a capital back guarantee in the first four years. No income can be taken during those initial years; after that, the normal 5 per cent rules apply. There are withdrawal penalties during the first four years; after four years, the guarantee does not apply. The guarantee is provided by putting 10 per cent of the sum invested into 'protector units'; the effect will be to reduce the growth of the bond in the first four years if the stock market surges ahead. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000, and the offer is open only between March 18 and May 13.</p>

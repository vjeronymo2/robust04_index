			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Tomas Borge, chairman of the Sandinist National </F> Liberation Front, FSLN, Congress Directorate Board, at the  opening session of the FSLN Special Congress at the Olof Palme  Convention Center in Managua -- live]    [Text] Dear delegates to the FSLN; Congress; dearest  brothers of the FSLN National Directorate, dear fellow members  of the board of directors of the special session of the Augusto  Sandino Congress of Unity:    This is a special session of the Sandinist Congress. A total  of 566 delegates and 170 guests were invited. There are 150  international representatives from 80 countries here. [applause]  Present here are delegates from Germany, Argentina, Austria,  Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Chile, Colombia,  Korea, Costa Rica, the Republic of Cuba, Spain, the United  States, France, the UK, Greece, Guatemala, The Netherlands, our  neighboring Republic of Honduras, the Islamic Republic of Iran,  our dearest republic of Mexico, representatives of solidarity  organizations here in Nicaragua, Norway, Palestine, the now  democratic Republic of Panama, Portugal, Puerto Rico -- whose  representatives are struggling for their country's independence,  our friends in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Sweden,  Switzerland, the always fraternal Uruguay, and the Republic of  Vietnam. [applause follows the naming of each country; Cuba  rfeceives a standing ovation]    My dear brothers, in addition to being a special session of  the Congress, this is a special congress for political reasons.  On very few occasions has a political event in this country  raised so much expectation. I wonder what the reason is for so  much expectation and interest. Nicaragua -- poor little  Nicaragua -- is agonizing in a surrealistic crisis of  unemployment, backwardness, poverty, lack of health, and  something we never had before: hunger. We are now one of the  poorest countries in the world. What this special congress  decides can contribute to maintaining this poverty, endlessly,  in a circle of hell. What this congress decides can also be the  beginning of a national resurrection. All of you who are  participating in this congress -- all of us and no one else --  have this tremendous historical responsibility. If the FSLN  comes out deteriorated or divided, it will not be easy for us to  defeat the enemies of the people. If we end up divided and  deteriorated -- despite the earnest calls for unity we have  heard here -- it will be impossible [to defeat our enemies].  We, the congress delegates and no one else, have this  historical responsibility. Will personal greed prevail among  us? Will the useless confrontations, the fireworks of  selfishness prevail? Will the temptation of bending our knees  before the enemy prevail? Will the arrogance, exclusion,  self-idolatry, messianism prevail? Will anyone -- any one of us  -- believe he is anointed by the Holy Spirit to destroy the  FSLN? Or, on the contrary, will good sense, equity,  selflessness, the fraternal embrace, love for our fatherland,  identification with our sacred revolutionary roots, loyalty  toward the copious rivers of blood of our glorious martyrs  prevail? Will we Sandinists love each other more, or will we  love our enemies more?    Someone once said one cannot love the people without hating  their enemies. As of this moment, I urge you not to hate  anyone, not even our enemies. If this call can serve any  purpose, it should first encourage love among Sandinists.    And after the Congress, what? Let us all agree that this  is a special congress, that this congress will delimit a border  between the past and the future. After this congress, the only  acceptable conclusion is an audacious and renewed political  line; a political line that will have to reflect wisdom,  flexibility, and firmness. We are forced to examine with  telescopes and microscopes the possibilities of alliance, the  prospects for a definitive national agreement. That  flexibility, possible alliances, the search for national  consensus which must [words indistinct] with the revolutionary  principles.    After the congress is over, our agenda will give preeminence  to the popular struggle against injustice, economic repression,  administrative corruption, banditry, [word indistinct], and  rancor.    After this congress -- I hope -- we will be richer in  national dignity and more severe in resolutely demanding respect  for our sovereignty; we will promote international friendship,  strengthening the FSLN's relations with all political forces:  the Socialist International, the Conference of Latin American  Political Parties, the Sao Paolo Group. We will intensity our  friendship with our historical friends. I am talking about  Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Brazil, to  mention just a few of our dear Latin American friends. I am  talking about Europe, Asia, and Africa, now represented here.    After this congress we will be more enthusiastic in  defending  the just causes, not only in this forum, but in all forums. As  a matter of principle, we are and will continue to be faithful  to the cause of the fraternal and glorious people of Cuba. From  this forum we joyfully greet the victory of the South African  people and their great leader Nelson Mandela. [applause] From  this rostrum, we extend our dignified and friendly hand -- with  the pride of being Sandino's heirs and Carlos Fonseca's brothers  -- to the U.S. Government, demanding respect, which when  evident, will be fully shared.    After this congress, we will give our attention to peasants  and will give youths a dignified and qualitative position.  After this congress we will be even more staunch defenders of  the struggles of the Indian peoples for respect of their  legitimate rights; we will be more active in defending the  struggle for equality between men and women, [applause] we will  be more enthusiastic in the struggle for the unity of the Latin  American peoples.    After this congress, we will vigorously seek a solution or  will contribute to finding a solution to the distressing  property problem. After this congress, as you shouted at the  beginning, we will be more coherent, and will raise very high  and seriously, and forever the indestructible unity of the FSLN.  [applause]    My dear brothers, as the highest authority of the FSLN at  this moment, I declare this FSLN Special Congress open.  [applause]</p>

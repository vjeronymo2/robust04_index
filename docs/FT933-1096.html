			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Thorn chairman answers Rent-A-Center critics WHEN SIR Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, got out of his New York hotel bed at 6 am last Wednesday morning, he noticed that a fax from his London office had been slipped under the door. It was a copy of an article from that day's Wall Street Journal, alleging that employees of Thorn's Rent-A-Center business in the US had used guns, gangs of Hell's Angels and other unorthodox methods to deal with customers who had fallen behind on rental payments. It ruined Sir Colin's day. Yesterday, back in London after several days of previously-arranged US meetings, Sir Colin launched an emotional defence of Rent-A-Center, which rents out anything from televisions to necklaces. 'I don't recognise our business from this article,' he said. 'I'm sure that out of 7,000 people we employ we're bound to have a few who don't work to the standards we expect.' But Rent-A-Center customers, he added, 'get treated like kings and queens. These people get treated normally in 99,999 cases out of 100,000.' The City was concerned enough to mark Thorn's shares down on three successive days. Yesterday they closed at 922p, down 66p on their Wednesday morning opening. Foremost in the minds of London analysts was the fear that the article would result in US federal legislation limiting the profits of the rental subsidiary. But there was also a mood of distaste for what Rent-A-Center was alleged to have done. An internal note on Thorn circulated at one London stockbroker yesterday noted in shocked tones that the article had claimed that 'Rent-A-Center employees have taken sexual favours in lieu of cash.' Sir Colin said Rent-A-Center management were investigating every allegation in the article. If he was dissatisfied with the outcome, Thorn would send in its own investigators. But he could already say that the Hell's Angels allegation was 'nonsense'; so was the story about the guns. The article had been based on the word of former employees who had been dismissed by the company. Many of those named, he alleged, had taken jobs elsewhere in the rental business. The idea that their consciences had provoked them to speak out was 'balderdash'. It was unfair to say Rent-A-Center made excessive profits, Sir Colin said. The article was wrong in saying the business had a 23 per cent operating margin in 1992-93, he said. This failed to take into account central marketing and other overhead costs. The true margin was about 12 per cent. Sir Colin did not deny that 25 per cent of Rent-A-Center customers continued their payments until they gained ownership of goods and ended up paying far more than if they had bought them outright at the start. The average rental item passed through 2.2 hands, he said. This meant there were times when the goods were in Rent-A-Center shops earning nothing. The business was also renting to people with no credit rating and was entitled to some financial compensation for taking on that risk. No one else was prepared to extend credit to the typical Rent-a-Center customer, he said. He strongly doubted there would be federal legislation defining rent-to-own as a credit transaction. This could lead to limits on the interest Rent-A-Center could charge. If, as Sir Colin alleged, the article contained false allegations, would Thorn be suing the Wall Street Journal for defamation, either in the UK or the US? 'No,' he said. 'We can't believe there's any point in a UK company chasing a US paper like the Wall Street Journal.' See Lex</p>

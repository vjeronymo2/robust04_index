			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / OECD Annual Report: Yen's rise means slow recovery The steep appreciation of the yen since mid-1992 is a shock which will have far-reaching effects on the Japanese economy and elsewhere for many years, the OECD report says. The yen's effective appreciation of nearly 30 per cent since the first half of last year, coming on top of over-investment and asset price inflation, means any recovery in Japanese economic activity is expected to be slow 'with 1994 likely to register, at best, very weak growth'. In the longer term, the OECD believes the yen's rise could reduce the level of Japan's current account surplus by nearly Dollars 60bn or 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1997. The OECD says the US current account could benefit to the tune of Dollars 18bn a year by 1997 from Japan's loss of competitiveness and market share, while the current account position of the four largest European economies could improve by Dollars 24bn altogether. The OECD says the yen's rise is likely to hit production in Japan next year so that output by late 1995 could be 2 per cent lower than it would have been with an unchanged exchange rate. Competitive pressures on wages and profit margins could lower domestic prices by 5 per cent during this period. The OECD expects a 0.7 per cent drop in Japan's merchandise export volumes next year. It reports that many businesses are finding it unattractive to supply customers with products made in Japan.</p>

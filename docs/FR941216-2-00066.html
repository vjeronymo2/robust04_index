			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Response: EPA concurs with FDEP reason No. 1 above which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows short-term 8 hour pump tests at sites which have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified petroleum contamination, to be covered upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the NOI by the Permit Issuing Authority. Only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-term pump tests, 8 hours in duration or less, designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to obtain information on aquifer characteristics, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically covered upon receipt of the permittee's NOI,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the permittee will be responsible or meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge limitations of Part A.1 or A.2. General Permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers will be assigned to these sites and DMR's sent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a copy of the general permit and a letter acknowledging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the Notice of Intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA responds to reasons  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  2 and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  3 as proposed by the FDEP,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would allow coverage by simply submitting an NOI for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local departments dewatering projects or scheduled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dewatering during gasoline tank replacements. It is EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding that the construction activities described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 2 and No. 3 are planned well in advance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initiation of the dewatering process. For this reason, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sees no reason to exempt these sites from NOI requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unless preliminary groundwater assessments have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed along the right-of-way project prior to startup,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even the local departments may be unaware of an contaminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plume that may be encountered during the road widening, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excavation projects. The potential problem EPA expects in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiving NOI requirements for these activities, is the lack  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of sufficient data to cover these operations. The better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach would be for the permittee to survey potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problem areas well in advance of the dewatering startup,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify the type of contamination and seek discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage under the NPDES general permit using the NOI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, for those potentially contaminated groundwater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 3: FDEP also questioned whether the indicator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria values listed under Part I.A.3, should be analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using untreated groundwater or treated groundwater. FDEP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also stated that if the intent of Part I.A.3 is to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short term discharges from sites contaminated with petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only, then the indicators should be applied to treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovered groundwater, because if these indicators were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to untreated groundwater, this would preclude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharges from sites contaminated with petroleum only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, FDEP stated that applying these indicator values to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treated effluent may allow treatment alternatives that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are capable of removing the metals listed and become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible to discharge under the general permit, since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicator values were not exceeded (even if the source of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination was not petroleum in nature).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: EPA notes that the indicator values apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> untreated representative groundwater samples from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vicinity of the proposed produced groundwater discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These could be tests from monitoring wells, recovery wells,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or samples of produced groundwater taken prior to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment and would not allow treatment alternatives capable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of removing metals to be covered by this general permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be emphasized that the intent of Part I.A.3 is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow the discharge of produced groundwater from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncontaminated site activity. If the site is contaminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with petroleum fuels, the permit refers back to Parts I.A.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or I.A.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 4: FDEP requested EPA's determination on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular issue before the finalization of the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit. FDEP stated that many petroleum sites are located  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in urban areas, and other possible sources of contamination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be located in the vicinity of the petroleum site. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these situations commingling of plumes from non-petroleum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites may occur. It was noted that many sites performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contamination Assessment Reports (CARs) had detected low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of TCE or PCE for many sites which had a dry cleaner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the vicinity. FDEP stated that since these solvents had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar characteristics and were volatile, most treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system designs based on permit effluent requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum compounds will easily remove the PCE or TCE to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-detectable levels without any oversizing of equipment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional treatment processes. FDEP stated that other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds in relatively low concentrations from off site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources should not preclude eligibility of the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit for the overall cleanup, which is to remediate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum plume and requested EPA's determination on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response: EPA in it's initial conception of the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit, only made specific reference to contamination from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum fuels and referenced gasoline, aviation gas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diesel and jet-fuel. The intent in issuing this general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit was to provide general permit coverage for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge of treated petroleum contaminated groundwater. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover other sources of contamination will require additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research and public participation. Because the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit expired on July 16, 1994, EPA sees an urgency to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reissue this permit; therefore, EPA may consider this issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the future through a permit modification. EPA, after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collecting sufficient information, may consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inclusion of other chemicals associated with dry cleaners in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the near future, but due to the lack of sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, will not address it at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

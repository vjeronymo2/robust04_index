			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Burn Stewart drops to Pounds 8.12m SHARES IN Burn Stewart Distillers fell a further 3p to close at 108p yesterday, continuing a steady decline since peaking at 160p in May last year, as the company announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 8.12m in the 12 months to June 30. The company, which floated its shares at 140p in 1991, showed sales down to Pounds 38m (Pounds 42m). Mr Campbell Stirrat, finance director, said Burn Stewart was changing its mix of business away from the quasi-commodity bulk sales and attempting to replace these with higher margin sales of cased bottles, some branded and some 'own label'. Mr Stirrat added that 'there was a bit of a decline in our export bulk shipments with the balance being pressure on the cased business'. He said trading would continue to be tough next year. Bulk exports had fallen 23 per cent with average prices falling 34 per cent. Cased sales rose 21 per cent and average prices fell 7 per cent. Operating profits fell to Pounds 9.66m (Pounds 12.5m). Interest charges fell from Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 1.54m reflecting the funds raised from the flotation which hit the balance sheet part way through the comparative period. Gearing now stood at 72 per cent (36 per cent) a slight increase since the year end when it was 70 per cent. There was a cash outflow from operating activities of Pounds 4.8m, compared with an inflow of Pounds 3.71m last time, as Burn Stewart increased stocks to Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 41.8m). On an annualised basis the total dividend is virtually maintained with a final of 3.3p (3.33p) to give a total for the year of 5p. Earnings per share fell to 9.53p (13.16p).</p>

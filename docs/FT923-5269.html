			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Dollar Sterling, the franc and the lira may all be under pressure, but it is the dollar which is suffering most against the D-Mark. In deciding whether the current difficulty is one of dollar weakness or D-Mark strength, the Americans can with some justice point the finger at the Germans, not least because the dollar's recent fall against a basket of currencies has been modest. Those who enjoy historical irony might see present circumstances as a German reprise of Reaganomics; a large economy has high government spending but its independent central bank follows a tight monetary policy. The result is upward pressure on interest rates everywhere. Thus conventional wisdom has the gap between US and German rates as a primary cause of the weak dollar. To the extent that this is true, it is difficult to see what the Americans can do about it. Raising interest rates by 1 per cent would probably kill the stunted US recovery, but it would do little to narrow the interest differential with Germany and intervention is at best a tactical tool. At any rate, the interest gap is largely priced into the market. What may be more important for the foreign exchanges at the moment are renewed worries about the health of some American banks given sluggish economic growth, and the age-old rationalisation of political uncertainty as a bearish force. Of course, as some economists never tire of saying, the dollar is cheap when purchasing powers are compared. Unfortunately, that situation can persist for a very long time. A market perception that the momentum of interest rates had altered might do the trick, but it is a little too early for that. Though it is unlikely, the Federal Reserve might even cut rates if recovery falters further. By contrast, the threat of higher German rates still exists. Eventually, it may be the resolution of the electoral struggle which gives speculators an excuse to take the dollar higher.</p>

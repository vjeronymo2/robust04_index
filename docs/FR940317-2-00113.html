The recipient will develop programs which serve to familiarize international students with Washington's complex cultural, political, and ethnic structures and provide a bridge between the campus environment and the community. It will also provide off-campus services to international students visiting Washington, DC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The recipient will also provide support for Fulbright enrichment programs for foreign grantees in the Washington, DC area.

USIA anticipates awarding up to $70,000 for the implementation and coordination of both these programs. This support is not intended to replace private efforts in this field but rather to supplement such efforts with financial assistance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All communications with USIA concerning this announcement should refer to the above title and reference number E/ASA&hyph;94&hyph;01. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Deadline for proposals: All proposals must be received at the U.S. Information Agency by close of business (5 p.m., Eastern Standard Time) Friday, April 22, 1994.

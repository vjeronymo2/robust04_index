			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Dividend payments or distributions on the Preferred Securities will be made monthly, will be cumulative and must be made to the extent that funds are legally available. However, each Operating Company will have the right to defer payment of interest on its Notes for up to five years, provided that if dividends or distributions on the Preferred Securities of any series are not paid for up to 18 consecutive months, then the holders of the Preferred Securities of such series may have the right to appoint a trustee, special general partner or other special representative to enforce the Special Purpose Subsidiary's rights under the related Note and Guaranty. Each Special Purpose Subsidiary will have the parallel right to defer dividend payments or distributions on the related series of Preferred Securities for up to five years. The dividend or distribution rates, payment dates, redemption and other similar provisions of each series of Preferred Securities will be substantially identical to the interest rates, payment dates, redemption and other provisions of the related Note issued by the Operating Company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Notes and related Guaranties of each Operating Company will be subordinate to all other existing and future indebtedness for borrowed money of such Operating Company and will have no cross-default provisions with respect to their indebtedness of the Operating Company. However, each Operating company may not declare and pay dividends on its outstanding preferred or common stock unless all payments due under its Notes and Guaranties have been made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that each Operating Company's interest payments on the Notes issued by it will be deductible for federal income tax purposes and that its Special Purpose Subsidiary will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Consequently, holders of the Preferred Securities will be deemed to have received partnership distributions in respect of their dividends or distributions from the respective Special Purpose Subsidiary and will not be entitled to any ``dividends received deduction'' under the Internal Revenue Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Preferred Securities are optionally redeemable by the Special Purpose Subsidiary at a price equal to their par or stated value or liquidation preference, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends or distributions, at any time after a specified date not later than 10 years from their date of issuance or upon the occurrence of certain events. The Preferred Securities of any series may also be subject to mandatory redemption upon the occurrence of certain events. Each Operating Company also may have the right in certain cases to exchange the Preferred Securities of its Special Purpose Subsidiary for the Notes or other junior subordinated debt of the Operating Company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event that any Special Purpose Subsidiary is required to withhold or deduct certain amounts in connection with dividend distribution or other payments, it may also have the obligation to ``gross up'' such payments so that the holders of the Preferred Securities will receive the same payment after such withholding or deduction as they would have received if no such withholding or deduction were required. In such event, the related Operating Company's obligations under its Note and Guaranty may also cover such ``gross up'' obligation. In addition, if any Special Purpose Subsidiary is required to pay taxes on income derived from interest payments on the Notes, the related Operating Company may be required to pay additional interest equal to the tax payment. Each Operating Company, individually, expects to apply the net proceeds of the Loans to the repayment of outstanding short-term debt, for construction purposes, and for other general corporate purposes, including the redemption or other retirement of outstanding senior securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Columbus Southern Power Co, et al.

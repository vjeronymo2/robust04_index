			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The first electric guitar that surf-rock pioneer Dick Dale ever picked has been  stolen from the Surf Museum in Huntington Beach. "I'm still numb," says Dale,  who lives in Huntington Beach. The thief "couldn't have been a real surfer.  Real surfers don't do that. It's got to be some misguided fool." Dale bought  the white guitar with a rosewood neck at a Los Angeles pawn shop for $200 in  1955. He gave it to the museum when it opened July 30, and had hoped to use it  this fall at a concert for the U.S. Air Force at the Berlin Wall in West  Germany. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

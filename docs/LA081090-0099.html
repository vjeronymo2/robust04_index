			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE / REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Sales by the Seashore: If you've got surf, sand 'n' sea breezes, then there  ain't no housing slump.  </P> <P> That's what the developers of Pier Colony have discovered.  </P> <P> The 130-unit condominium project, at 2nd Street and Pacific Coast Highway  across from the Huntington Beach Pier, is 40% sold after less than three weeks  on the market.  </P> <P> And 15 of the units were bought sight unseen. Those buyers, all from Japan --  where Haseko Group, Pier Colony's co-developer, has its headquarters -- plunked  down deposits after seeing renderings of the project, according to a project  spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The condominiums range from 861 to 1,492 square feet and are priced from  $190,000 to $610,000.  </P> <P> California Resorts International is the Huntington Beach builder developing the  project with Haseko (California) Inc. of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A nearby project by Mola Development of Newport Beach sold even faster.  </P> <P> The 89-unit Townsquare -- an unusual mix of condos and town homes over retail  shops that is situated about four blocks from the beach at 5th Street and  Orange Avenue -- sold all 73 of the condo units the day sales opened in March.  </P> <P> Prices ranging from $140,000 to $209,000 helped make up for the extra distance  from the water.  </P> <P> As of last week, a dozen of the 16 townhouses in the development had been sold,  at prices in the low to mid-$400,000s.  </P></p>

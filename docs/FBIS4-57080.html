			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ruben G. Abelenda] </F>   [Text] Pretoria, 10 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President  Fidel Castro praised the Angolan people and leadership's  historical recognition of the cooperation given by the Caribbean  nation to that state in southern Africa.    During an interview with the media that have accompanied him  on his visit to the Republic of South Africa, Fidel Castro said  Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos sincerely expressed  with "heartfelt words that came from the bottom of his soul"  what the aid given by Cuba represented for his country.    Today, the two leaders held a meeting following the  inauguration of antiapartheid leader Nelson Mandela as South  African president, an event that shook the world on 10 May.  Referring to the meeting, the Cuban head of state said dos  Santos also told him that Cuban cooperation was important not  only for Angola but also for South Africa and the rest of that  vast continent. He added that dos Santos' words shook him when  he referred to the unselfish aid given by the Cuban people to  that region of the planet.    Today, Fidel Castro talked with a dozen African heads of  state and government who attended Mandela's inauguration,  including Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Namibian President  San Nujoma, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, and Mozambican  President Joaquim Chissano.    He also talked with Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat,  Israeli  President Ezer Weizman, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,  and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, among other  personalities invited to Mandela's inauguration, which was  attended by 150,000 guests, including 42 leaders.    PRENSA LATINA learned that the Cuban leader met with the new  South African president, with whom he will hold official talks  tomorrow.</p>

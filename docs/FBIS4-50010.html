			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin today stressed the importance of stability, saying China's  stability is not only requisite for its own development, but  will also benefit the stability and prosperity of Asia and the  world in general.    Jiang made the remark in meeting with Malaysian Prime  Minister Mohamed Mahathir here this afternoon.    Jiang, quoting Mahathir's remarks made during a visit to  China last year, said political stability is an important factor  for economic development. "This makes a lot of sense and we  have good knowledge of that," he said. "China needs stability,  and so do Asia and the world in general. This is a crucially  important issue," he added.    Referring to the political disturbance in June 1989, Jiang  said that without the resolute measures taken then, China would  not have enjoyed today's stability. "A bad thing has been  turned into a good thing, and as a result, our reform and  opening program has forged ahead with steadier, better and even  quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought into fuller  play," he said.    "History shows that anything conducive to our national  stability is good," Jiang said. "In the past five years, China  has enjoyed economic development, social stability and improved  livelihood of the people, thanks to our consistent efforts to  take stability as an overriding priority. Facts prove this is  absolutely correct."    Stability forms a prerequisite and reform serves as a  driving  force, while development represents the goal, Jiang said, adding  that the three factors interact to promote each other.    The importance of ensuring lasting national stability has  become a common understanding of all the Chinese people, Jiang  said. "The stability of China is not only needed for China's  own development, but will also benefit the stability and  prosperity of Asia and the world in general."    That is because the stability of China, which has a  close-to-1.2-billion population, is of international  significance, he said, noting that in the past decade and more,  the stability and development of China have not only brought  benefits to the Chinese people, but contributed to world peace  and development as well.    On the regional situation, Jiang noted that the situation in  Asia is developing in a good direction in general, with  sustained economic development and constantly improving regional  security.    Further efforts to safeguard regional peace and development  reflect an issue that has won attention from leaders of Asian  nations, he noted. "We are ready to work with Malaysia and  other Asian countries towards peace and development in Asia."    In the meeting, Jiang noted that Mahathir's visit coincides  with the 20th anniversary of Sino-Malaysian diplomatic  relations, saying such ties have gained overall expansion in the  past two decades, with fruitful cooperation in the political,  economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields.    The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Malaysian  peoples continues to expand, while vast potential exists for  bilateral cooperation, Jiang said.    Continuous expansion of such relations will not only promote  common prosperity of the two countries, but also will serve to  enhance regional economic cooperation, he added.    Mahathir said that since last year, he has been encouraging  Malaysian businessmen to invest in and expand trade with China.  Malaysia is satisfied with the steady growth of economic and  trade ties with China, he said.    Referring to his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton  shortly before he came to China, Mahathir said he had stressed  his opposition to imposing one's own views upon others and to  using the MFN [most-favored nation] issue to exert pressure on  China, according to a Chinese official.    After the meeting, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of  Mahathir and his party.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, the  president of the Republic, has stressed the Sudanese Government  and people's preference for a constitutionally legitimate  government in Yemen, which calls for the preservation of Yemeni  unity.    His excellency, while receiving the credentials of the  Yemeni  ambassador to Khartoum today at the Republican palace, said a  strong and unified Yemen represents strength and support for the  Arab homeland and the Islamic nation, which urgently requires  efforts toward unity and cohesion. He emphasized that the sons  of one Yemen in their wisdom and faith are capable of seeking  the arbitration of the voice of reason, and of taking the  interests of Yemen into consideration. He pointed out Sudan's  desire to support and consolidate bilateral relations in all  spheres, and to push it to a level where all efforts and  capacities would be integrated in achieving the aspirations of  the two fraternal peoples.</p>

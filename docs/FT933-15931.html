			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Romanian PM urged to quit Leaders of eight Romanian opposition parties yesterday demanded the resignation of Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu's left-wing minority government, Reuter reports from Bucharest. 'The government is incompetent, it does not function properly and therefore it must go,' said Mr Corneliu Coposu, leader of the opposition National Peasant Party. The demand was a response to a statement by the government last week praising the way it had governed the country since taking office last September. It accused the opposition of mounting a 'furious campaign against the government, aimed at creating social tension'. The government also denounced opposition attempts last week to call a session of parliament to discuss a report on corruption and to introduce a no-confidence motion. It accused the opposition of wanting to stage a coup to remove the cabinet.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: STILL REIGNING SPECTACULARLY  </P> <P> About 1,000 fans gathered in the cosmetics department of the Broadway in  Glendale to greet the woman who for nearly a decade played TV's queen of mean,  Alexis Carrington Colby on the canceled classic, "Dynasty." Anxious to attract  the same fans who were glued to the weekly soap, Joan Collins took the  Bloomingdale's -- Macy's -- Broadway route to market Spectacular, the $150  perfume and $38.50 eau de toilette she describes as an"old-fashioned,  glamourous floral." No newcomer to the retail scene, the actress has signed her  name to jewelry and lingerie collections that she says are a hit in London,  while her signature eyeglass collection continues to sell here. She's already  planning a skin-care line that will debut sometime next year. And Listen  predicts Collins may be the first celebrity to create a collection of  signature-scents in the not-too-distant future. Although she's married to  Spectacular now, she admits, "I've never been faithful to one fragrance."  </P> <P> Foundation of a Career  </P> <P> Long before Zsa Zsa got into her recent, er, trouble with the law, she was an  upstanding member of the acting community. Part of what provided the foundation  for her career will be featured in the new Lingerie Museum, opening Nov. 8 in  Frederick's of Hollywood's landmark store on Hollywood Boulevard. Gabor has  donated the black lace bra and matching panty that she wore in the 1953 film  "Lili," in which she played a carnival magician's assistant. Also featured will  be Ava Gardner's petticoat from "Show Boat"; a white chiffon peignoir trimmed  with white ostrich feathers worn by Mae West in a 1952 Life magazine spread,  and a tasseled bustier sported by Madonna. The lingerie display, a permanent  replacement for Frederick's short-lived Bra Museum, will feature vintage  undergarments made by the 43-year-old company as well as celebrities' donations  and items purchased from estates and private collections. Special guest at the  opening will be Milton Berle, "because he's a Hollywood legend just like we  are," a Frederick's spokeswoman told Listen. Uncle Miltie, after all, donned  many an interesting underthing back in those early days of TV. ()  </P> <P> A Stone's Throw Into Fashion  </P> <P> When the Stones rolled out of town after their recent concerts here, they had  plenty of Los Angeles fashion labels in their luggage, thanks to a preconcert  tour shopping spree by phone and fax machine. Mick Jagger placed an order with  designers Maggie Barry and Stephen Walker of Van Buren, who made him two pair  of Spandex leggings, one with a leather overlay of the tour's Steel Wheel logo  on the leg, the other with a cobalt-blue racing stripe. For guitarist Ron Wood,  Los Angeles jewelry and metal accessories designer Michael Schmidt custom-made  a pair of chain-mail suspenders covered with colorful plastic to avoid  scratching Wood's guitar. And Los Angeles menswear designer Henry Duarte for  Sqwear says he did fashion fittings by Federal Express when he made two  checkered vests with matching pants for Charlie Watts, the drummer.  </P></p>

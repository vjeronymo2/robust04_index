			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Trinidad wages warning angers state workers THE government of Trinidad and Tobago is facing a public protest over its inability to make payments to public sector workers while attempting to meet foreign debt obligations. Thousands of government workers have been protesting in Port of Spain, capital of the English-speaking Caribbean republic, and unions are threatening further action which could cripple the economy. The actions follow statements by the finance minister that retrenchment in the public sector was inevitable. Union leaders have said more protests are likely this week. The protests started when Mr Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, said that falling international oil prices, the external debt and a high wage bill meant that the government could no longer postpone retrenchment in inefficient public companies. 'Inevitably, the painful matter of separation of a significant number of workers will arise. It is an issue that we just cannot postpone further,' Mr Mottley said. He said foreign debt obligations and the government's commitments on wages and salaries could not both be met at the same time. The government has said it would have to take 'tough decisions' on whether it could afford payment of TTDollars 3bn (USDollars 705m) in arrears due to government workers. Union leaders have been incensed by plans to cut thousands of jobs from three public companies - the port authority, the water authority and the transport company. Mr Mottley said the port authority's monthly revenue was TTDollars 5.7m, while pensions and wages cost TTDollars 10.2m per month. The transport company earned TTDollars 30m last year while paying TTDollars 86m in wages and the water authority last year paid wages of TTDollars 157m while earning TTDollars 134m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcement by David Hunt, secretary of state for </F> employment, on UK "Formal Challenge" to the EU Working Time  Directive on 7 March: "Britain Challenges Brussels in European  Court Over Working Hours"]    [Text] "I have today issued the Government's challenge to  the Working Time Directive in the European Court. The UK  strongly opposes any attempt to tell people that they can no  longer work the hours they want. This measure is not about  health and not about safety, it is a flagrant abuse of Community  rules. It has been brought forward as such simply to allow  majority voting -- a ploy to smuggle through part of the Social  Chapter by the back door.    ``We have a very strong case. The rules in the Directive on  annual holidays, working on Sunday, the 48-hour week, and the  rest are totally irrelevant to the proper control of health and  safety at work. The European Court should throw out the  Directive lock, stock and barrel.    ``Although in long and hard negotiations we won very  substantial concessions on all our key concerns, the Directive  would still introduce bureaucratic rules and restrictions where  none are needed.    ``There can be no question of us implementing any part of  the  Directive in advance of our case being decided.    ``The United Kingdom has one of the best health and safety  records in Europe. We have never considered it necessary to  place arbitrary limits on working hours on health and safety or  any other grounds.    ``Europe must turn its back on unnecessary and unjustified  regulations. The real problem is unemployment; getting people  back to work. We won't create jobs with more red tape or by  introducing rigidities into the world of work. There is only  one way to get unemployment down and that is to free up the  labour market and discard unnecessary controls.''  <H5>  Notes To Editors: </H5>   The Working Time Directive was proposed by the European  Commission in 1990 under Article 118a of the Treaty of Rome as a  health and safety measure, which means that unlike other  Directives dealing with employment terms and conditions it is  subject to Qualified Majority Voting.    The Directive includes measures for minimum daily and weekly  rest periods (which are to include Sunday "in principle"), 4  weeks annual paid holidays, a limit on the working week to 48  hours except by voluntary agreement, and restrictions on night  work. It excludes transport, work at sea and doctors in training  from scope and allows for derogations from its requirements in  certain circumstances, for example under collective agreement  arrangements, or when there is a need for continuity of service  or production.    During negotiations, the UK achieved major changes: Member  States may now follow a voluntary approach to the 48 hour week,  and can decide whether to include Sunday in the weekly rest  period. Derogations would also be allowed for local or  enterprise level collective agreements as well as national level  agreements.    The Directive was formally adopted by the Commission in  November 1993 and Member States have three years from that date  to implement it. The government has made it clear that there is  no question of implementing the Directive in advance of the  legal challenge being decided.</p>

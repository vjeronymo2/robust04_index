			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Truckers speed-kings of the road TRUCK DRIVERS are by far the worst offenders when it comes to breaking speed limits on roads other than motorways, according to figures published by the Department of Transport yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes. Spot checks using electronic detectors showed 78 per cent of the heaviest trucks exceeding the 50 mph limit on dual carriageways and 72 per cent exceeding the 40 mph limit on single carriageways. On motorways, 45 per cent of the heaviest trucks exceeded their 60 mph limit. But car drivers were worse offenders, with 60 per cent breaking the 70 mph limit. The most law-abiding were drivers of buses and coaches, 19 per cent of whom broke their 70 mph limit on motorways and 29 per cent of whom broke their 60 mph limit on dual carriageways. The Scottish Office yesterday approved Pounds 330m worth of construction starts for major roads projects in Scotland. They include further work on upgrading the A74 Glasgow-Carlisle route to motorway and improvements to the M8.

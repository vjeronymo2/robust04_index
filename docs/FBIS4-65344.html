			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [DPA report: "Defense Ministry Wants To Shed 1,900 Jobs"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 15 May -- Defense Minister Ruehe (Christian  Democratic Union--CDU) must reduce the number of his employees  in the Defense Ministry from the present 5,500 to 3,300 in the  long term, said a Defense Ministry spokesman during the weekend.  Ruehe wants to eliminate these posts by means of transfers and  early retirements. There should be no dismissals, said the  spokesman. Even when Stoltenberg (CDU) was defense minister,  ways of reducing the number of employees were considered. BILD  AM SONNTAG has reported on these economization plans, referring  to a confidential letter Ruehe sent to the Bundestag Defense  Committee, announcing the personnel reduction. Ten  subcommittees are to be abolished.</p>

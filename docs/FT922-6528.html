			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Letter: Not enough consideration of support for beatification Sir, Robert Graham's article on the founder of Opus Dei raises more questions than it answers ('The rush to beatify an impatient saint', May 16). He reproduces a long list of defamatory statements against Msgr Escriva, most of them in reported speech, while giving little consideration to the opposite arguments. The criticisms about Msgr Escriva and Opus Dei have repeatedly been denied not only by Opus Dei spokesmen, but also by many other people. If these accusations were true, it would be difficult to explain why so many people profess devotion towards Msgr Escriva and claim to have obtained graces through his intercession. It would be particularly difficult to explain why more than 200,000 pilgrims travelled to Rome from many parts of the world to spend, peacefully and cheerfully, several hours under a hot sun to attend his beatification. If the criticisms were accurate, it would be all the more difficult to explain how the complex procedural hurdles - including the proof of a miracle - to beatify Msgr Escriva could have been overcome, since procedural decisions are adopted in different steps by majority vote by committees of diverse composition, and those criticisms were already known. There are two different views of Msgr Escriva: that of a man of dubious standing, and that of a saint. One of them is wrong. Should the benefit of the doubt be in favour of the massive evidence and testimonies without which Msgr Escriva's beatification could not be accomplished, or in favour of critical statements coming from limited sources? In my view, the answer is clear - unless, of course, one believes in the conspiracy theory: an almost unlimited capacity by Opus Dei not only to manipulate the Vatican, but also grossly to deceive its own members and sympathisers.

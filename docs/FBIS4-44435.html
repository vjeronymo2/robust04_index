			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nan Sheng (5589 4563): "Retired Servicemen Hold </F> Up Military Train for `Self-Salvation'"]    [Text] An official of the Beijing Municipal Civil  Affairs Bureau said with heavy heart that given today's city and  countryside employment difficulties, it is simply impossible to  place millions of retired servicemen, and that this adds another  "element of instability" in society.  <H5>  Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps Attacks </H5>   On the night of 5 January, a train headed from Xuzhou in  Jiangsu Province to Hefei in Anhui Province entered Guzhen near  Bengbu at high speed. Its markings showed it to be a military  train that had to be given the right of way. Just then, the  people's armed police escorting the train discovered that  something was wrong up ahead. Two hundred people had suddenly  appeared from out of nowhere, most of them young and strong  lads. Each of them seemed to have been trained well. Within a  very short time they took control of the military train.  Carrying weapons, they engaged the people's armed police train  escorts in a fire fight. These "train robbers" were completely  fearless amidst the intense sound of rifle fire. While fighting,  they organized others to haul away from the train light  industrial products, household electrical appliances,  motorcycles, etc. on trucks and horse carts.    The fire fight continued until 5:00 the next morning.  Surprisingly, the people's armed police were unable to quell the  disorderly band. The fight continued until the Bengbu garrison  army received word and hurried to the scene where it encircled  the gang and shouted in a loud voice: "Anyone who does not put  his hands up will be shot on the spot!" After brief hand-to-hand  combat, the army gained control of the situation. Only during  the interrogation of the captured train robbers was it found  that they were retired servicemen!    These retired servicemen and nearby villagers had long been  eyeing the military trains that passed through the area. They  carried out this robbery only after careful planning. After the  event, it was learned from the Anhui Military Region that six  cars of freight had been stolen, the losses running to more than  1.8 million yuan. Three people's armed police had been killed,  and 11 demobilized servicemen, who had taken part in the  robbery, had also been killed.    Now the authorities are worried because these demobilized  servicemen are not just a gang of desperadoes. In the winter of  1992 they organized the "Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation  Commando Corps consisting of more than 400 men divided into four  groups for the purpose of intercepting military and civilian  freight trains. They are active along railroad lines in Henan  and Anhui provinces, and they have built temporary warehouses in  mountainous areas along railroad lines. Each time they strike,  they have a small contingent guard the base camp.  <H5>  Retired Servicemen Add an Element of Social Instability </H5>   These demobilized servicemen were once members of a favored  group who have sunk into brigandage. Why did such a tremendous  change occur? Official data show that more and more PLA  personnel cannot be placed following discharge. In 1993 alone,  500,000 people retired or were demobilized. This was the largest  year for discharges since Deng Xiaoping decided on a 5 million  force reduction in 1985. This retired army of 500,000, in  addition to the number from previous years, produces no small  pressure. An official in the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs  Bureau said with heavy heart that given the current city and  countryside employment difficulties, there is simply no way to  place them. This adds an "element of instability" to society.    This is truly the case. By regulation, soldiers may return  to  the place at which they entered service, but the government is  not responsible for providing them jobs. Many peasant lads who  joined the armed forces to escape from farming find themselves  back in their hometown "repairing the earth," so naturally they  are unhappy. The term "self-salvation" in the name of the  demobilized serviceman organization that robbed military trains,  the "Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps" should  be underlined.    The local authorities are very concerned about this nasty  case that has not yet been revealed in the media, fearing that  "a single spark can light a prairie fire." Reportedly, the Anhui  and Henan military sub-districts have assigned two battalions to  work with the people's armed police on an investigation. They  have issued a final ultimatum: All members of the "Anhui-Henan  Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps" must surrender their  weapons and pilfered goods to the nearest garrison army or  public security unit before 20 January. Those who fail to turn  themselves in by that time, or who continue nefarious  activities, shall be strictly punished according to law.  Positively no mercy will be shown.  <H5>  Retired Deputy Commander Also Takes Party </H5>   One should not suppose that only ordinary soldiers take part  in "self-salvation." Actually, military officers are involved.  On 2 January, a train carrying military cargo from Guangzhou to  Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, was completely looted  and set afire by more than 160 local demobilized servicemen near  Ziyang, more than 100 kilometers from Chengdu. The Chengdu  Military District dispatched a battalion of quick reaction  troops to the scene. More than 140 demobilized servicemen were  arrested, and 21 who refused to hand over their weapons and  surrender were killed.    Astonishingly, interrogation found that the leader of the  demobilized servicemen, a certain Zhou, had been deputy  commander of the Zibo Municipal Garrison District in the  Shandong Provincial Military District, holding the rank of  lieutenant colonel. Zhou had been ordered to retire from  military service and urged to resign from the Party in the  autumn of 1992 for complicity in smuggling and corruption. After  retirement, he become a section chief in the Ziyang County  government. In former years, when a military officer transferred  to a government organization in civilian life, he retained his  former rank, salary, and special benefits. Nowadays, however,  when government agencies everywhere have too many personnel,  military officers have also become a burden that everyone pushes  and shoves around. Since he had a lackluster military career,  naturally Zhou had no standing. Disgruntled, he simply gathered  together some colleagues from the old days for "self-salvation,"  styling himself as the "commander." Since disturbances organized  by military personnel are more threatening than those organized  by workers, peasants, or students, the Chinese Communists have  resorted to strict repressive measures regarding this "element  of instability." Reportedly, in the wake of the 2 January train  robbery incident, Ziyang County and Neijiang Prefecture set up a  special court, which quickly and severely tried and sentenced to  death seven of the ringleaders.  <H5>  "Serious Situation" on Nine Railroad Trunklines </H5>   Nevertheless, the "quick and severe" sentencing to death of  a  number of ringleaders cannot solve the problem. Reportedly, the  PLA is to cut 250,000 personnel. If so, tens of thousands of  servicemen will take off their uniforms during the next two  years to become individuals in the great army of the retired.  They become another group that does not fit into the frenzied  world of "everyone doing business."    In fact, "highwaymen" have become a plague on the mainland.  The following figures illustrate the problem: During the  second half of December 1993, the railroads termed the situation  as "serious" on nine trunk line railroads and "fairly serious"  on 35 branch line railroads. The nine trunk lines named as  having a "serious situation" were the Beijing-Baotou,  Xiangyang-Chongqing, Sichuan-Guizhou, Chengdu-Kunming,  Lanzhou-Qinghai, Xinjiang-Taiyuan, Guizhou-Kunming,  Lanzhou-Xinjiang, and Longhai lines</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The DEIS/DEIR considers the effects of renewing the Cachuma Project Contract under which water service has been provided to the member units. The existing Cachuma Project Contract (No. I75r-1802) was executed on September 12, 1949, for irrigation, and municipal and industrial purposes under the provisions of section 9(c)(2) and 9(e) of the 1939 Reclamation Project Act. The authority for contract renewal is pursuant to the Act of July 2, 1956, 70 Stat. 483, and the Act of June 21, 1963, 77 Stat. 68, requiring the Secretary of the Interior, upon request, to renew long-term contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Cachuma Project has been the principal water supply for the majority of the member units since initial deliveries began in 1955. These member units include the City of Santa Barbara, Goleta Water District, Montecito Water District, Summerland Water District, Carpinteria County Water District, and the Santa Ynez River Water Conservation District, Improvement District No. 1. The original Cachuma Project Contract has a term of 40 years, and will expire on May 14, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A preferred alternative has not yet been identified for the DEIS/DEIR. Several alternatives, including the ``no action'' alternative, are evaluated in the DEIS/DEIR, and also describe the existing environment and environmental consequences of contract renewal. They consider the following issues: environmental improvement and restoration with respect to biological resources, including fisheries, wildlife, and riparian vegetation, surface water hydrology, ground-water hydrology, flood control, water supply and demand, water pricing and delivery practices, increased operational efficiency, increased conservation, conjunctive use, water exchanges and transfers, recreational enhancement and land use policies, agriculture, socioeconomic conditions, cultural resources, and Indian Trust Assets. Mitigation of impacts, where necessary, is also identified in the document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Santa Ynez Indian Reservation (Reservation), the Southern California Area Office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Sacramento Area Office of the BIA have been contacted by Reclamation regarding Indian Trust Assets (ITAs) that may be affected by the proposed action. No potentially affected ITAs have been identified by the BIA. Under certain alternatives, reduced ground-water levels in the Santa Ynez River Riparian Basin could affect streamflow in the Zanja de Cota Creek, to which the Reservation Indians have certain water diversion rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Hearing Process Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those wishing to request in advance a time to make comments prior to the hearing dates should write or call the Cachuma Project Authority, Santa Barbara, California.

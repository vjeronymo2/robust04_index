			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SPRING OF OUR DISCONTENT  </P> <P> The scene is increasingly common in Southern California. Flowers stand not full  and robust but drooped over and shriveled. The roses for display on the dining  table are so distorted from their natural shape that they look more like  doilies for the place settings. Outside dead bees line the patio; crickets  aren't chirping. If it is not quite a silent spring around here right now, it  is certainly a disquieted one.  </P> <P> The problem now is aphids, those parasitic insects that huddle together on new  shoots, buds and leaves. They are invading local gardens in distressingly high  numbers. The natural predators that usually keep aphids under control --  ladybugs, lacewings and tiny wasps -- have been destroyed in some 400 square  miles of Southern California. So have wild honeybees, which pollinate fruit  trees. All this, plus the lack of chirping crickets, have been attributed to  aerial malathion spraying that has descended upon many local areas during the  last nine months.  </P> <P> The state has sprayed the pesticide in a campaign to rid the region of the  crop-destroying Mediterranean fruit fly. That pest continues to pop up in  unexpected places, giving farmers fits, local residents sleepless nights and  state officials heartburn. But one of the certain unfortunate side effects of  malathion spraying is that it is extraordinarily efficient in eliminating some  "good" bugs.  </P> <P> Without them, the natural controls crucial to a linked ecosystem begin to break  down. And so, we are all robbed of one of the great joys of spring -- a lovely  and healthy garden. The negative effects were expected, say entomologists, and  the bad news in the back yard is nothing compared to the damage the Medfly  could cause to the food supply.  </P> <P> Maybe. We can only hope that Rachel Carson's words from 1962 don't return to  ring in our ears: "It is ironic to think that man might determine his own  future by something so seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray.  </P> <P> "All this has been risked -- for what? Future historians may well be amazed by  our distorted sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control  a few unwanted species by a method that contaminated the entire environment and  brought the threat of disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is  precisely what we have done. All this is not to say there is no insect problem  and no need of control. I am saying, rather, that control must be geared to  realities, not to mythical situations, and that the methods employed must be  such that they do not destroy us along with the insects."  </P></p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: UAP breaks cover UAP has again cast its shadow across the boardrooms of UK insurers and set pulses racing in the equity market. Last week's comments by Mr Jacques Friedmann, UAP's new chairman, were not the first to spell out the company's ambition. A slice of the UK non-life insurance market would be a strategic fit with interests in continental Europe. While it is difficult to believe that UAP would be willing to launch a bid before its privatisation in the spring, an acquisition thereafter cannot be ruled out. The small stake in Sun Alliance acquired last summer by TransAtlantic, the investment company which UAP jointly controls with Liberty Life of South Africa, could provide a toe-hold. The remarkable performance of TransAtlantic's shares in recent weeks - up from 320p to 440p since early December - would be a promising foundation from which to raise additional capital. That said, UAP's partnership with TransAtlantic was a convenient way of settling an uncomfortable rivalry with Liberty Life over the ownership of Sun Life. In the long term it might prefer full control of its investments. Neither is it clear that UAP would be getting good value by making a hostile bid for Sun Alliance, which is already trading at a substantial premium to net assets. A smaller, agreed deal might offer better value. Since UAP does not have to worry about upsetting UK insurance brokers, buying into the fast-growing direct insurance sector must be a tempting option. It is less clear that the owners of the three largest direct writers - Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal Insurance and Winterthur - would want to sell.</p>

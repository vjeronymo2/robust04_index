			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dietrich Zwaetz commentary: "Clinton, the New Interest </F> Rate Guru"]    [Text] One of a head of state's most important jobs is to  keep his people in a good mood, which is beneficial to the  further efforts of the country. At any rate, this is how Bill  Clinton assesses his duties. It cannot be denied that the  president's economic optimism has given a major impetus to the  economy for well over a year. Sometimes, however, he also does  the job of other experts and strains his abilities.    The dramatic price falls on Wall Street are certainly  getting  under the skin of the average U.S. citizen. To prevent a  further collapse of prices, which might endanger economic  recovery, Clinton felt compelled to make his view of the  situation known.    As the President decreed, the long-term interest rates are  "lower than during the preceding recession." But then he posed  like a real interest rate guru: "Nevertheless, I believe that  interest rates are too high. I think they will come down  again." The stock exchange has "overreacted."    The most important thing is "to get through it now." This  will be managed "if everyone keeps calm and the markets find a  way out of it themselves." For: "We basically have a very solid  economy."    Thus, why are the markets nervous? The President cannot  understand it: "A lot of investments go to the economy, there  is no inflation, and we are creating new jobs." One could  examine the President's statements one by one. The markets will  have to decide whether the interest rates are again too high.  However, the decisive thing will be that the investors adhere  to Clinton's appeal in view of such facts.</p>

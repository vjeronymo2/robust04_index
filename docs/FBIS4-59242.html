			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Mu'ayyad 'Abd-al-Zahrah: "The Others </F> and the Brunt of the Blockade"]    [Text] When we look at the international stands on the  unfair blockade against our country and people, we find that the  picture today is different from what it was yesterday. What  once looked ike international unanimity is now nothing more than  deception and a ploy Washington imposed on everyone by  temptation and intimidation.    Therefore, it is not strange to see Turkey lamenting its  poor  economic conditions and calling for help, and to watch Bulgaria  speaking bitterly and cynically about the over-rich who no  longer dig into their pockets. On the other hand, France is not  hiding its bitterness about the so-called U.S. "reward" and the  loss of its markets and friendships. Russia has not ceased  complaining about the brunt of the damage it has sustained due  to its support for the blockade. The same can be said about  conditions in Germany, Greece, and many other nations. The  unfair blockade imposed on our people by U.S. domination and  influence in international decisions has become a cause for  resentment and a source of great economic pressure in many  nations due to the political stands they once adopted.    Those who went along with the blockade and abided by its  policy did not, in the worst or best conditions, realize it  would take such a long time, and that the "booty" they had  expected would not be worth their blessing or silence, instead  of their objection or protest, especially since they had already  been paid for their stands in advance and were compensated by  both the Saudi and Kuwaiti treasuries for some time and later  threatened by the United States if they tried to breach or  ignore the unfair resolutions.    Iraq's steadfastness and endurance, thanks to its  leadership's ability and wisdom and its people's awareness,  cohesiveness, and will power, have been and still are the main  decisive factors in exposing and unveiling U.S. policies. This  legendary steadfastness was the potent weapon that eroded and  mutilated the logic of domination and made many countries  reconsider their stands on the basis of their national  interests. Their unjustifiable drift behind Washington's policy  all those years has led to incalculable negative results, the  least of which are the closure of factories, the bankruptcy of  companies, increasing unemployment, mounting economic losses,  and the loss of many markets in the area.    If a number of French officials have admitted the enormous  losses France has incurred as a result of drifting behind  Washington's policy, Russia's losses are even greater in the  economic and the political spheres.    Turkey, whose foreign debts in 1990 were less than $13.6  billion, is now facing debts of $70 billion. Turkish Prime  Minister Ciller admits the blockade has caused her country  losses of more than $20 billion and has greatly affected its  commercial dealings and economic situation. She calls for the  need to end this blockade due to its disastrous results on her  country. The Bulgarian Government has also demanded through its  Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Matinchev the need to lift the  blockade on Iraq, which has caused damages to Bulgaria amounting  to $3.5 billion. The Bulgarian deputy prime minister admits all  attempts to resolve this problem have failed since the countries  imposing this blockade "no longer dig into their pockets to  compensate those who suffered damages."    The increasing world outcry against the unfair blockade has  established a tangible reality that accurately reflects the  degree of its disintegration and erosion and the demand for its  termination and burial. In as much as it showed the grave sin  committed against Iraq and its people, the blockade revealed the  great damage it has caused the world, and therefore fully  exposed the logic of domination and the policy of monopolization  being exercised by Washington.    Thus, the mounting outcry to lift the unfair blockade  against  our country has convinced us of our sound policy, strong will  power, cohesiveness, and spirit of patience, endurance, and  firmness. Were it not for this legendary steadfastness, we  would not have been able to defeat the logic of aggression and  to expose the faces of the aggressors with all their ugliness.    Indeed, it is now only a question of time, and all  indications are time is in favor of steadfast Iraq.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / De Benedetti under house arrest: Charge sheet describes Olivetti chairman as 'socially dangerous' MR Carlo De Benedetti, one of Europe's best-known and wealthiest businessmen, was placed under house arrest shortly before midnight after being interrogated in prison by Rome magistrates investigating political corruption. Earlier, a visibly shaken Mr De Benedetti was driven to the capital's Regina Coeli prison after giving himself up to police in Milan. The detention followed the issue of a warrant at the weekend by Rome magistrates against the Olivetti chairman, who has been implicated in Italy's 18-month political corruption scandal. After two rounds of questioning lasting until late last night, Mr De Benedetti was allowed to leave jail for house arrest. In the formal charge sheet prepared by Ms Maria Cordova, the investigating magistrate in charge of the case, Mr De Benedetti was described as 'socially dangerous' and accused of corrupting public officials for the past 10 years. Until now, Mr De Benedetti has taken the line used by many other senior businessmen caught up in the corruption scandal: that kickbacks were paid only after repeated demands by public-sector officials and politicians, and were essential for their companies to win business from the state. That line of defence satisfied Milan magistrates, who interrogated Mr De Benedetti in May. At that time, in a highly embarrassing admission just days after asserting the opposite to Olivetti shareholders at its annual meeting, Mr De Benedetti disclosed to Milan magistrates investigating post office corruption that Olivetti had paid bribes. The case is now being led by magistrates in Rome, who, contrary to the decision of their Milan colleagues, have sought Mr De Benedetti's arrest. The Rome magistrates say new evidence has come to light, suggesting that Mr De Benedetti has held back information. According to widely leaked comments in the press, the Rome judges argue that Mr De Benedetti himself sought to corrupt officials. They claim to have unearthed new evidence that the kickbacks stretch back much further than Mr De Benedetti has admitted. Olivetti and Mr De Benedetti's lawyers have strenuously denied such claims. However, his incarceration has once again highlighted differences between Milan and Rome magistrates in handling the political corruption scandal. Some observers have suggested that the Rome magistrates, previously attacked for dragging their feet compared with their northern counterparts, are now trying to show their commitment. It has even been suggested that politically motivated magistrates in Rome have used a leading businessman such as Mr De Benedetti as a scapegoat to get back at Milanese colleagues.

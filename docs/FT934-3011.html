			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hiscox launches new Lloyd's investment trust Hiscox Syndicates, the Lloyd's managing agents, yesterday announced that it had raised Pounds 11.2m to form a new Lloyd's investment trust, Hiscox Dedicated. Applications under an offer for subscription were received for 2,240,600 units. Accordingly 11,203,000 partly paid ordinary shares and 2,240,600 warrants have been allotted. Hiscox Dedicated had been seeking to raise up to Pounds 25m, but Mr Robert Hiscox, a director of the new trust, said he was 'pleased to have achieved an application level significantly in excess of the minimum, because Hiscox Dedicated was launched after a large number of other Lloyd's funds had already approached the capital market for investment.' The Roberts &amp; Hiscox members agency raised Pounds 30m for the Hiscox Select Insurance Fund in October. The trust is one of the most popular of the 11 Lloyd's investment vehicles currently listed on the stock exchange and is trading at a premium to its net asset value. Charterhouse Tilney Securities, which placed the issue, has informed Hiscox Dedicated that it expects a matched bargain facility to be available for the investment trust under the stock exchange rule 535(2).</p>

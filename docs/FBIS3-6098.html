			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 10 March, a top official at the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry commented on a package of  external economic measures which the government plans to compile  in two stages -- in late March, and before the July summit  meeting of the major industrialized nations. The official  stated: "Macroeconomic measures should be included in a  market-opening package to be compiled in late March." He  stressed that the ruling coalition parties need to make a quick  decision on the tax system reform which is currently under  discussion.    With regard to macroeconomic measures, the idea of  increasing  the amount of public works spending has now cropped up.  However, a U.S. Government official previously said: "Even if  the public works program is revised, the U.S. Government will  not highly appreciate it." It appears that this U.S. view has  been conveyed to the Japanese Government. For this reason, the  major point at issue is how the government will spell out its  direction in tax system reform.    Referring to the possibility of Japan offering to implement  [income] tax reductions of 6 trillion yen a year for three  consecutive years without deciding on revenue sources to fill in  shortfalls therefrom, the senior official insisted the revenue  source question should be decided at the same time, saying:  "Otherwise, that is tantamount to announcing a plan to issue  18-trillion-yen worth of deficit-covering public bonds." He  then added, "Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura who is  in charge of finalizing the package, and the Social Democratic  Party of Japan should come up with responsible proposals on  this," thus serving warning to the two who are reluctant about  resolving the two issues at the same time.</p>

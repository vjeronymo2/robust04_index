			<p>BFN     [Text] Units of the 3d Armored Brigad continue to  courageously and steadfastly resist the forces of treachery and  treason -- the murderous and (?terroristic) gang raised under  the protection of the ruling authority in Sanaa. Brigade  soldiers, together with the inhabitants of 'Imran, taught the  adventurist gang a serious lesson. They proved that the people's  resolve was invincible, and that the person who plays with fire  will be the first one burned. This gang, which brags of  imaginary victories achieved through its hired mercenaries, is  ashamed to tell the truth, which is known by the sons of valiant  'Imran, who saw how the 3d Armored Brigade confronted the forces  of defeatism and made them taste their evil in broad daylight.  While we are saddened and regret the human and material losses  suffered by the two sides, at the same time we hold those hired  commanders of the ruling gang in Sanaa responsible, before our  people and their armed forces, and before local, Arab and world  public opinion, for the crimes they have perpetrated, as well as  for any conflagration -- in which the greatest losers will be  the Yemeni people, who have been patient for a long time.  However, there are limits to patience. The Defense Ministry,  which strove and is striving to prevent the situation from  exploding, renews its appeal for an end to all criminal acts of  combat against the units of the 3d Armored Brigade and innocent  citizens, and for an end to the siege against these units as  well, which would guarantee an evacuation of the wounded and the  delivery of supplies.    In this context, we call on international bodies and  organizations, particularly those concerned with defending human  rights, including the Yemeni Red Crescent, the Arab Red Crescent  organizations and the International Red Cross, to carry out  their humanitarian duties towards our brothers and sons in the  3d Armored Brigade, who are in danger of being annihilated by  the ruling gang and its myrmidons.    The Defense Ministry again warns against the consequences of  continuing to play with fire and fanning the flames of a  crushing civil war throughout the homeland. We are confident  that our people and their Armed Forces, and all the honorable  nationalist forces for whom the homeland and its sons are dear,  will not stand aside as onlookers in the face of the danger that  threatens the homeland and its unity.</p>

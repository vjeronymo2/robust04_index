			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Technology: Haunted by Britain's industrial heritage - A new report which proposes ways of cleaning up contaminated land The twin issues of environmental liability and contaminated land are fast becoming some of the most contentious for the business community in the UK. Yesterday's proposals from the Confederation of British Industry are part of an increasingly concerted effort by business, banking, insurance and the property sector to fend off what they fear could be crippling bills. 'Business interest in this issue is strong and rising,' said Howard Davies, the director general. The government is currently conducting a review of the problem after being forced by industry pressure to drop a plan for a contaminated land register earlier this year. This could lead to fresh proposals, possibly a green paper, next year. The 32-page CBI report is blunt about the problem: 'Liability for remedying environmental damage may well become the key environmental challenge facing business in the 1990s,' it begins, making clear that the fundamental question is who pays for it. The report was assembled by a working party of CBI members headed by John Wybrew, the director of public affairs and planning at Shell. As the CBI sees it, the UK has an exceptionally long industrial heritage and this has left it with more contaminated land than probably any other country. But the business community does not accept that it should bear the cost of cleaning it all up, or that every hectare of it even needs to be cleaned up to the same pristine standard. The report is particularly critical of the legal and regulatory uncertainties that surround environmental liability, and specially an EC green paper issued last May that would try to harmonise it across the whole community on the basis of strict liability. Wybrew warns that these uncertainties are causing land to be left derelict and deflecting demand for industrial sites into greenfield areas. 'We want to harness the wealth creation process to environmental improvement,' he said yesterday. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has already denounced the proposal as 'unfair and unpractical'. There are also side issues about the extent to which banks would be liable to foot the bill for contaminated land owned by clients they lend money to and the role of pollution insurance. The CBI accepts that business should pay for any environmental damage incurred in the future, provided there is a clear and fair legal framework. But the real problem lies with past damage affecting as much as 200,000ha, which would cost up to Pounds 1m per hectare to put right, or a total bill of Pounds 20bn. A lot of the pollution is historic: no one knows who was responsible, the land may have changed hands many times. Much of it was also legal when it occurred. Here, the CBI makes a number of proposals. First, the government should establish priorities for cleaning up contaminated land. Perhaps only 1 to 3 per cent of land needs urgent action. It should also set standards because the requirements for different types of land can vary widely. Dutch soil standards are widely used but these were designed for a particular set of national circumstances and also require land to be improved to a point where it can be put to any use, however sensitive. The CBI thinks that is going too far. Second, the government can help by linking remedial action to the planning process and by encouraging development of new technology for measuring contamination and carrying out remedial action. Third, the government and the EC should explore grants as a way of paying for clean-ups. 'Mixtures of public- and private-sector funding will be the most effective way to bring land back into use where it is most needed,' the report says. But having made this statement, the report is strikingly vague about how the private sector should play its part. It offers no estimates of how big a contribution business might make, how it could be made and by whom, although the report lists in detail the government agencies who might be able to offer money and also gives a run-down of the amount of public money available for land reclamation. The CBI has rejected the idea of a compensation fund. John Cridland, the environment director, said yesterday: 'The past is the consequence of our industrial heritage, therefore the only appropriate way to pay for it is through the exchequer. I cannot envisage any compensation arrangements that would be fair and equitable.' This weakness in the report was quickly seized on yesterday by environmental campaigners who accused the CBI of trying to wriggle out of its responsibilities and push the cost on to the taxpayer. They also said that industry was effectively trying to secure a competitive advantage in Europe at the expense of the public and the environment. Friends of the Earth said that a tax should be levied on all potentially polluting industries to create a fund to clean up land where the polluter cannot be found. It also favours a contaminated land register and strict liability. But the picture is less clear cut than that. Local authorities, who are very close to the problem, have had difficulty forging a common position on who should pay. 'There are no easy answers' said an official at the Association of Metropolitan Authorities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "Top Official Urges Revamp of </F> Light Industry"]    [Text] Light industries should review production this year  to better meet market demands, a top industry official said  yesterday.    For the Chinese people's improved standard of living has  prompted greater demand for varied, high quality products, Yu  Zhen, Chairman of China National Council of Light Industry, said  in Beijing.    When China re-enters the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), light industries will have to make more and better  products to meet the challenge of the world market, Yu said.    He also called for increased growth to secure supplies of  daily consumer goods.    Yu vowed to seek further overseas technology and capital to  help the industry meet its targets.    And he predicted increased demand for wallpaper, paint and  household fittings, air conditioners, health-care products and  food, particularly new products in fancy packages.    Yu also pledged to grant import and export licences to more  companies likely to make money from foreign trade.    But he stressed that quality products rather than access to  the market would make firms successful.    Yu expected output from light industries would rise 15  percent this year to 506 billion yuan ($58 blllion), compared to  397.1 billion yuan ($46 billion) in the first 11 months of 1992.    The industry plans to develop more than 800 new products  this  year which Yu hoped would make up 20 percent of the industry's  total output.    He also called for a 15 percent increase in exports this  year  taking them over $34.5 billion. Exports from January to  November last year were $20.1 billion.    This goal should be easier to attain following the  unification of the foreign exchange rate.    Yu urged the industry to cut debt ridden enterprises by 5  percent and ensure 90 percent of its surveyed consumer goods  meet quality standards.    Last year, a third of the country's light industrial  enterprises were running in the red, a proportion similar to the  country's overall industrial situation.    The industry's production-sales rate should reach 96 percent  this year compared with 95.08 percent a year ago, Yu added.    The China National Council of Light Industry will double its  effort this year to co-ordinate and guide enterprise's  production without direct involvement in their management and  daily operations, he said.</p>

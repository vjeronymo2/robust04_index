			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Bonds: Year starts with flurry of deals The international bond market kicked off the new year with a burst of activity as issuers launched a flurry of new deals in a broad range of currencies. The Euroyen sector saw several new issues and dealers expect more over the next few days. In particular, the market is awaiting the previously-announced Y300bn deal from the Republic of Italy, which is likely to come next week. At Y300bn, it will be the largest yen-denominated deal outside Japan. The bonds are expected to have a term of between seven and 10 years to take advantage of interest in these maturities. They are likely to yield between 3.4 and 3.5 per cent, about 35 - 45 basis points over the relevant government benchmark. Daiwa and J. P. Morgan have won the mandate. The Japanese finance minister abolished the 'lock-up' period for Euroyen bonds issued by sovereign borrowers with effect from January 1. As a result, dealers expect to see greater interest by Japanese investors in Euroyen issues. In the past, the ministry had prohibited Euroyen bonds from entering the country for the first 90 days of issuance. Instead, Japanese securities houses agreed to 'warehouse' the bonds for three months before selling the paper to Japanese investors. The Euroyen issues announced yesterday - which included deals from the Kingdom of Sweden and Finnish Export Kredit - were mainly targeted at specific investors, predominantly Japanese, syndicate officials said. The European currency sectors saw plenty of new issuance as well, with deals denominated in D-Marks and lire. Depfa Finance announced a DM1.5bn 10-year issue with a 6 per cent coupon, yielding 45 basis points over the 2003 bund issue. Proceeds will be used for both public sector and mortgage financing. Qwinzy Capital Group, a Hong Kong-based broker, said it is hoping to place Dollars 600m of bonds issued by Republique du Congo among emerging market investors. The zero-coupon bonds are priced at Dollars 82 and are expected to yield between 9 and 11 per cent, according to Qwinzy, which has bought the deal. The bond proceeds will be redeemed by royalty payments from Agip, the Italian oil company, which has drilling rights in the republic.</p>

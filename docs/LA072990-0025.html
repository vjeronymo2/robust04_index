			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER REPORT: TRAVELERS USING AGENTS HAVE ENTERED A BRAVE NEW WORLD OF  SERVICE FEES;  </P> <P> BOOKINGS: THOSE DAYS OF ALWAYS GETTING SOMETHING FOR NOTHING FROM AGENTS IS  CHANGING. CHARGES FOR SOME SERVICES ARE BECOMING MORE COMMONPLACE.  </P> <P> Some consumers are discovering that a growing number of travel agencies are  likely to charge for some types of services that were once "free."  </P> <P> Travel agents derive their income from commissions -- usually from airlines,  cruise lines, hotels and car-rental companies.  </P> <P> But they don't make money from reissuing airline tickets, handling  frequent-flier coupons and delivering tickets. Since these activities represent  no income or low earnings, agents may assess service fees to cover the time  spent in performing such work.  </P> <P> In some cases, service fees are applied to the cost of the travel arrangements  booked. Agents may also waive service fees in various situations and for good  clients.  </P> <P> The subject of service fees is a controversial one among agencies. And as  agents clash over marketing philosophy, consumers can expect to face a service  fee for assorted agency activities.  </P> <P> "Travel agencies with street-front locations are the ones most likely to assess  service fees because of the tremendous amount of walk-in traffic they get,"  said Linda Hutson, owner of Ferguson Gates Travel in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "The key to a service charge is to compensate ourselves for labor on  nonprofitable items," Martha Scott, manager of Glendale Travel, said. "While  travel agencies are in a service business, we're not nonprofit organizations."  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based Larchmont Travel is an agency that has held off levying fees  in the past, but has now instituted a service fee of $5 for processing airline  promotional coupons that clients bring in.  </P> <P> "Handling these coupons is time-consuming and they mean less income for the  agency since the value of the ticket is less and so is our commission from the  airline," said general manager Sam Gentz.  </P> <P> Gentz predicted more travel agencies will likely institute some service fees in  the future. "It's basic economics. This is one business in which the harder you  work the less you make. You can spend hours looking for the lowest fares, which  then mean less income. Agencies are taking a realistic look at imposing more  service fees."  </P> <P> All About Travel in Northridge has just instituted a $25-per-hour nonrefundable  service fee for arranging customized itineraries.  </P> <P> "In the past we had a nonrefundable $100 deposit that could be applied to the  trip," said Pat Campbell, manager of the agency and former chairperson of the  Association of Retail Travel Agencies, a major trade group. "But too much time  can be taken with these arrangements and we have to cover our costs."  </P> <P> Potential clients are advised up front of the hourly charge for this service,  and given an estimate of the likely amount of time needed.  </P> <P> Campbell, for one, doesn't believe in assessing a service fee for handling  promotional coupons. "The fee is insignificant and it could scare people away,"  he said.  </P> <P> Campbell also predicted that more travel agencies would implement some kind of  service fees in the future.  </P> <P> "Travel agents are more business-oriented today than in the past, and they tend  to look more at the bottom line. If they don't get paid enough by the suppliers  to cover their costs, they'll pass the cost on to the consumer. It's a natural  evolution."  </P> <P> Glendale Travel has a brochure on each desk explaining its fees. Some examples:  $10 for handling frequent-flier and other promotional coupons, and reissuing  airline tickets.  </P> <P> "We might sell someone a ticket for $300, the fare goes down to $200 and the  client comes back to us to reissue the ticket," Scott said. "Whether we reissue  the ticket or the airline does it, we still lose some of our commission from  the airline. But if we do the work, we may charge a $10 service fee to cover  our time."  </P> <P> Similarly, Glendale Travel may assess $10 for a hotel booking, if there is no  airline booking with it.  </P> <P> "That's because the chance of our getting a commission from some hotels is  slim," Scott said.  </P> <P> "If we book a cruise or a tour, we ask for a nonrefundable service fee of $25.  This amount is applied to the final payment of the client. Then if the person  changes their mind, we still have something to show for our work."  </P> <P> Sometimes the delivery of tickets, visas or other documents to the client's  home or office will incur a fee. "We have free delivery within our normal  marketing area, but we might charge $25 to $50 for a staff member to drive  farther afield," Scott said.  </P> <P> A $50 fee is also charged for hard-to-make holiday bookings and reservations  for special bargain offerings that require a good deal of phone calls and staff  time. "Of this amount, $25 is applied to the cost of the arrangements and we  keep $25 as our fee for the special work," she said.  </P> <P> On the upper end of the scale, for clients seeking a customized tour, Glendale  Travel charges a $100 nonrefundable service fee that is applied to the trip.  Clients are charged the actual cost of any telexes and other communications,  with no mark-up.  </P> <P> Glendale Travel also charges service fees of $10 for all air fares sold for  under $100, and for any record search in agency files. "It's very seldom that  we actually ask for the air-fare fee," she said. "We figure if the fare is that  low, we'll get lots of business through it."  </P> <P> Sounds like plenty of potential service fees, but when it comes down to it,  Scott says, the agency generally waives fees for repeat clients.  </P> <P> "It's always a judgment call," she said. "We're much more likely to charge a  fee to someone who walks in off the street who we haven't dealt with before. We  can also tell when someone is just shopping around and not really ready to go  ahead with specific travel arrangements."  </P> <P> Does the agency lose business by charging such service fees?  </P> <P> "We debated this issue but decided that while we might lose some people, they  were the kind worth losing," Scott said.  </P> <P> "Our experience is that people tend to respect our professionalism more when  they understand that our time represents money, too. I think travel agents who  are afraid to charge service fees don't respect their own professionalism."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, consumers should understand that not all agencies are the same. Some  agencies are full-service, others may specialize in low-cost travel and not  offer a full range of services. And some are cruise-only agencies.  </P> <P> Don't assume that you'll get every service just because you give your business  to an agency. For example, a full-service agency is much more likely to contact  you about changes in flight schedules after you've purchased a ticket than will  a "low-frill" agency.  </P> <P> Agencies should alert you right away about any service fees they might charge,  either verbally or in writing. Make sure that you understand when such fees are  applied to the bookings you actually make.  </P></p>

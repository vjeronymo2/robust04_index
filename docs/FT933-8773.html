			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Fresh flare-up expected at Hoskins The next flash point in the row between the board of Hoskins Brewery and rebel shareholders who have requisitioned an extraordinary meeting is likely to be today, when full year results from the USM-traded brewer are scheduled for release. The rebels, led by Mr Richard Holman who has a 7.4 per cent holding, plan to call for the removal from the board of Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, and his brother, Robert, on grounds of their management record. The company has not yet responded to the rebels and no date has been fixed for the EGM. The move means the directors are facing their second hostile EGM in two years, soon after last month's formal lapse and apparent collapse of a plan to inject into Hoskins some assets and businesses owned by Mr Adam Page, founder of Midsummer Leisure.</p>

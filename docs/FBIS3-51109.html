			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Message to the nation by Guatemalan President Ramiro de </F> Leon Carpio in Guatemala City -- live or recorded]    [Text] Guatemalan people: Today, the government of the  Republic and the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity]  formally pledged, in a written document, to sign a peace  agreement in 1994. Guatemala is making history. Today, 10  January 1994, should signal to all Guatemalans that there is a  new light in the process to consolidate our democracy. Today a  new opportunity emerges. We must not and will not lose this  opportunity because our government is determined to show its  political willingness to achieve peace.    Because of the importance of what occurred in Mexico today,  I  wish to tell you that the agreement to renew the peace  negotiations has been signed by the government peace commission  and the URNG General Command, as witnessed by the UN secretary  general's representative. Following intense work during the  period 6-10 January, the two delegations agreed on a framework  to foster the resumption of an in-depth and dynamic negotiation  process that will open the door to a prompt solution of the  armed conflict.    The signed agreement covers the main aspects of the  negotiation mechanism and in it the parties sought to design  innovative mechanisms, bearing in mind the previous accords and  achievements. Within the framework of bilateral negotiations,  the parties agreed to ask the UN secretary general to appoint a  moderator to promote the reaching of agreements on the entire  negotiation agenda, which was approved in Mexico in 1991. The  parties have expressed their commitment to reaching a firm and  lasting peace agreement in the briefest possible time during  1994.    They also agreed to promote the creation of an assembly that  will promote reciprocal contributions from civilian society and  the participants in the negotiation process. Therefore, they  agreed to ask the Guatemalan Bishops Conference to appoint the  president of an assembly of civilian sectors, bearing in mind  for this position Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno who would  have the special mission of promoting, here in Guatemala, a  consensus among civilian society regarding the essential topics  on the negotiation agenda. He would subsequently foster the  approval of the agreements signed by the parties, so they can  become great national commitments.    To strengthen the negotiation process, the parties also  agreed to ask the Governments of Colombia, the United States,  Spain, Mexico, Norway, and Venezuela to form a group of friends  of the Guatemalan peace process, so they can be honor witnesses  to the agreements reached by the parties. The parties  reiterated that verification is a fundamental element to  guaranteeing the fulfillment of the agreements. Therefore, they  should be accompanied by appropriate national and international  verification mechanisms. For this reason they will ask the  United Nations to undertake the international verification of  the agreements.    It is truly satisfactory to confirm today, with the approval  of the framework for the resumption of the negotiations, that  the parties are demonstrating their willingness to reach the  goals established in the agreement. There is still difficult  work to be done to make this new framework bear fruit with  specific achievements in the discussion of the general agenda of  the negotiations.    The next round of negotiations will be held in the second  half of February. It will be devoted to the discussion of the  agreement on human rights and the setting of a timetable for the  negotiation agenda. It is an ambitious but essential program to  conclude, with the flexibility being demonstrated now,  successful negotiations.    I wish to express thanks for the constant interest shown and  the support provided by the international community and my  appreciation of the hospitality shown by Mexico, which has  always supported the peace efforts in Guatemala. In particular,  I wish to thank the United Nations, which has permitted the  setting for this successful meeting.    Fellow countrymen: Guatemala has begun to build peace,  working simultaneously for the two focal points of the peace  plan that our government proposed to the Guatemalan people --  national reconciliation and the fight against poverty, as a  means to building a firm and lasting peace. We Guatemalans  should jointly build peace. Today, we have taken a great step  by beginning the end of the domestic armed conflict, above all  bearing in mind that there are human lives at stake. But this  is not enough to achieve overall peace. It is here in  Guatemala, with productive work and attention to the people's  most heartfelt needs, that unitedly we should build peace with  social justice for all Guatemalans. Thank you very much and  good night.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAUNCHING AN ANTI-NUKE CRUSADE;  </P> <P> DEL MAR ACTIVIST SEES SMALL TOWNS AS STARTING POINT  </P> <P> Martha Kaye laughs at the thought that, of all things to be doing, she was  making the bed at her Del Mar home the day inspiration struck like some  well-guided missile.  </P> <P> She had tuned the television to her favorite evening show -- the "McNeil-Lehrer  News Hour" -- just for some company. That's when she saw him. That's when the  55-year-old Kaye sat on the edge of the bed in awed silence.  </P> <P> "There he was, New Zealand's ex-prime minister, David Lange, talking about his  role in making his country nuclear-free," recalled the mother of three grown  sons.  </P> <P> "He just sounded so bright and so together, and his solution sounded so  wonderful, I said, 'There's my guy, and there's my issue.' After the show  ended, I just sat there on the bed for a while. Then I decided to do something  about it."  </P> <P> The experience launched Kaye on a self-described one-woman crusade to persuade  her City Council to follow Lange's lead, to pass a law that would make Del Mar  the first nuclear-free zone in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Her idea to ban the possession, testing, storage or repair of nuclear weapons  and their components -- things such as warheads and other strategic weapons  systems -- would add Del Mar to an elite group of 24 nuclear-free cities in  California and another 139 communities nationwide.  </P> <P> With the help of a nonprofit environmental group in Baltimore, she studied  sample nuclear-free zoning ordinances, along with pamphlets on how to approach  communities on such difficult issues.  </P> <P> She also sought advice from a friend in Washington state who had helped  initiate a similar ordinance there several years ago.  </P> <P> Then, like a well-rehearsed veteran of small-town politics, Kaye personally  presented her idea to Del Mar's five council members -- several of whom she had  helped put in office with long hours on their election staffs.  </P> <P> She made telephone calls. She visited homes. She even scouted down one council  member on the street. Then she officially proposed her idea before a recent  council session.  </P> <P> But, wait, this is Del Mar -- land of tourists and trifectas, not Trident  missiles and nuclear triggers. Can she be serious?  </P> <P> The Del Mar City Council apparently thinks so. Later this month, Kaye hopes to  bear the fruits of her anti-nuclear labor when the council approves her  suggested ordinance, which has been called a symbolic gesture to "just say no"  to nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> Kaye insists that it's time to take such a stand, that she's not  </P> <P> just some wealthy housewife with a little too much time on her hands.  </P> <P> "It's just a zoning ordinance, really, like where do you put the sewer plant or  how high do you allow your buildings to be built," she said. "One day, I hope  the whole world can become a nuclear-free zone.  </P> <P> "The way I see it, laws in places like Del Mar are just the beginning. This  ordinance is just my teeny-weeny contribution to all of this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Little Opposition  </P> <P> Curiously, in a city where nasty political battles rock the town as regularly  as the ocean tide, Kaye's idea has met with little resistance. The Del Mar  Surfcomber, the local paper, even wrote an editorial supporting her position.  </P> <P> Of course, the absence of much resistance may reflect the fact that Del Mar is  not exactly a center of the nuclear weapons industry. Neither Kaye nor any city  official was aware of any business that might be affected by such an ordinance.  </P> <P> Although the council still must hear public response before the ordinance is  adopted, officials expect little opposition.  </P> <P> "It's obviously symbolic," said Michael Williams, managing editor of the  Surfcomber. "But, as Kaye argues, somebody could start up a small nuclear  industry here. I just thought it was a good idea from a symbolic standpoint of  promoting peace."  </P> <P> Del Mar Mayor Brooke Eisenberg was another of those won over by Kaye's  argument. "The city is taking a moral stand," she said. "And I'm proud that  we're doing it."  </P> <P> But there have been doubters. Former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock recently  called Eisenberg during his morning radio talk show.  </P> <P> "He wasn't real keen on the idea," she recalled. "He asked what would happen if  San Diego decided not to defend Del Mar in the case of a nuclear war. Actually,  his argument didn't make a whole lot of sense to me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heated Confrontations  </P> <P> Albert Donnay, director of Baltimore's Nuclear Free America, described as a  nonprofit resource center for nuclear-free zones, said opposition is common --  even in liberal areas.  </P> <P> "There's been some heated confrontations in some real liberal places like Palo  Alto and Sonoma (Calif.), where the issue has been defeated," he said. "When  you're outspent 20 to 1 by the opposition, you don't stand much chance."  </P> <P> Japan was the first country to declare a nuclear-free status, in 1958, Donnay  said. In the United States, Hawaii County took such a stand in 1981, leading  the way for scores of other communities.  </P> <P> Today, in addition to the current 163 nuclear-free zones, another 50 are under  consideration, including Del Mar.  </P> <P> "The fact that the idea is slowly seeping into California suggests that you may  finally be ready for it out there," Donnay said.  </P> <P> Many communities such as Del Mar are home to companies with military contracts  that are doing work in the area of the strategic defense initiative, quite  possibly nuclear-related, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Incredulous at Suggestion  </P> <P> Oved Zucker, president of Energy Compression Research Corp., one of two such  local companies mentioned by Donnay, was incredulous at the suggestion of  conducting nuclear experiments at the firm's Del Mar offices.  </P> <P> "We're not involved in nuclear materials or components or anything of the  like," he said of his research and development company, which now has two  SDI-related military contracts, including one exploring the use of lasers and  other electrooptics.  </P> <P> "Such nuclear research is done in large facilities, far away from populations,  not tucked away in little Del Mar."  </P> <P> Martha Kaye is undeterred by the fact that the ordinance would have no direct  effect on the nuclear weapons industry.  </P> <P> "She's pure dynamite," Washington state resident Lee Sturdivant said of her  friend. "I have a picture of Marty on my refrigerator, standing on top of Mt.  Whitney with her hands on her hips, looking like she's sassing God. That's  her."  </P> <P> Kaye and Sturdivant, both Sierra Club members, have traded notes on evoking  public support for their anti-nuclear cause, which Sturdivant helped champion  in her home on San Juan Island several years ago.  </P> <P> "A lot of people initially said, 'Why waste your time trying to prevent nuclear  war?' " she recalled. "Because we really have no say whatsoever in big things  like the F-16, the Stealth bomber and the defense budget.  </P> <P> "So when something like this comes off locally, everyone can stand up and  raspberry the big government. Because that's what it is -- a raspberry."  </P> <P> Kaye didn't waste any time wondering whether other local activists would  approve of her idea.  </P> <P> "Del Mar is a place that always has its back hairs up about something, so you  continually have to call up the forces," she said. "Often it's just wasted time  starting up committees, calling people on the phone.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Golly, I can do this by myself.' "  </P> <P> But only in small-town politics, she acknowledged.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Idea for Everywhere  </P> <P> Kaye said she will assist anyone who wants to start such a movement in San  Diego.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't take on San Diego myself. I think people should do such things for  their own community. But being nuclear-free is an idea that can be carried  anywhere -- to a neighborhood, a school, a Kiwanis Club. You could even make  your own home or office nuclear-free.  </P> <P> "Because winning each little piece of ground is a baby step toward a better  whole.  </P> <P> "I'm nuts about grass-roots politics. It's such a breath of fresh air not to  have to deal with stuffy politicians on a state or federal level. I think the  local level is where politicking is most effective."  </P> <P> Kaye has been there before. Besides working behind the scenes on the campaigns  of several local council members, she has staged battles of her own. She's  president of the board of Del Mar's farmer's market, which she successfully  fought developers to establish after the older market closed.  </P> <P> The wife of San Diego Union Associate Editor Peter Kaye, she's one of those  old-line Del Mar residents who would like to see change come slowly. And she  doesn't want to see developers' checkbooks do all the talking.  </P> <P> An amateur sculptor, she displays several of her works around her one-story  house, which looks as if it would have evolved into the landscape by itself if  given the chance.  </P> <P> But, on this day, the talk isn't of art or the raising of her three sons. It's  about nuclear holocaust.  </P> <P> "Three Mile Island and Chernobyl have been enough to show us that these systems  are not infallible," she said. "Too many people feel that nuclear weapons are  protecting us.  </P> <P> "Like many others, I believe they're out to destroy us. It's just an  ill-thought-out means of defense, a weapon we will one day turn on ourselves."  </P></p>

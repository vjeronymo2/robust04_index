			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (3): Balancing the cost against performance - How to read the tables Tables 1 and 2 show the impact of charges on a managed unit-linked fund for a typical 20-year plan, where Pounds 200 a month or Pounds 2,400 a year is paid first under a regular-premium arrangement, and second as a recurring single-premiums plan. Bear in mind that, where your premiums are higher or lower than this amount, the impact of charges will be different. In Table 1, the first column shows what your investments might be worth if annual growth is 9 per cent over the 20-year period and the provider's real charges are deducted. Under a theoretical nil-charge regular-premium (annual) plan, the final fund would be Pounds 133,835, yet Pearl provides a final fund of just Pounds 98,494, Confederation Life Pounds 98,700, Barclays Pounds 100,000, Royal Life Pounds 101,000, Save &amp; Prosper Pounds 101,362, and Sun Life of Canada Pounds 102,000. Conventional wisdom dismisses high charges on the grounds that good performance will more than compensate. This may be true in some cases, but Barclays, Confederation Life and Royal Life also failed all the performance tests, while Pearl only passed the first screening. Column two shows exactly how much is deducted from your premiums over the entire course of the contract. This figure assumes 9 per cent growth, so the charges are shown in real terms and can be related to the final fund. Professional Life shows the lowest deductions at Pounds 9,287, although this is a nil-commission figure, so you would have to pay your adviser an agreed commission or fee on top. Other low chargers include Foreign &amp; Colonial, at Pounds 11,627; Framlington (the latest unit-trust group in the market) at Pounds 13,957; and Leeds Life (also a recent entrant) at Pounds 14,200. Compare the figures with those of the high chargers: Royal Life Pounds 32,000, Pearl Pounds 30,197, Barclays Pounds 27,900, Crown Financial Pounds 27,184, J. Rothschild Pounds 26,586, M&amp;G Pounds 27,869, Prudential Pounds 28,072, Axa Pounds 27,100 and Standard Life at Pounds 27,650. Column three shows how the deductions reduce the annual growth from 9 per cent to as low as 6.7 per cent in the case of Pearl and Confederation Life. Barclays is close behind with 6.9 per cent. The corresponding figure for Professional Life, the lowest charger in this survey, is 8.4 per cent. Column four highlights one of the most damning criticisms of the traditional regular-premium plan, where most of the charges and sales commissions are deducted in the early years. Inland Revenue rules do not allow you to get your hands on personal pension money until age 50 at the earliest, so the column does not show what you would get back. Instead it shows the transfer value - the cash value you can take out and put into another approved pension arrangement. This column shows what your transfer value would be after five years, again assuming that growth is 9 per cent and the provider's actual charges are deducted. At this point you would have paid in Pounds 12,000, and in most cases your transfer value will be worth less than your contributions. Britannia Life, for example, returns just Pounds 9,605. Laurentian Life, one of the lower chargers over the full 20 years, appears to make its heaviest deductions in these first five years and offers a transfer value of just Pounds 9,230. Royal Life and Scottish Equitable also offer transfers of less than Pounds 10,000. Under a single-premium or recurring single premium (RSP) contract, where the charges are spread evenly throughout the investment period, you see a completely different picture. All but one provider had a positive return after five years. Under Hambro Guardian's RSP contracts, you would still get a negative return, which might indicate that the charging structure retains some elements of front-end loading. However, under most RSP contracts the final fund values are higher than the regular plan for the same contributions. Given that most five-year transfers are also higher, it is hard to see how advisers will be able to justify recommending regular-premium plans once all the RSP contracts are launched. There are exceptions where, clearly, the provider has improved the returns to early leavers at the expense of those who stay put. Allied Dunbar, for example, deducts reasonable charges in the first five years of its RSP contract, but total charges after 20 years are lower on its traditional regular-premium plan. The same is true of Axa and Laurentian, among others. Equitable Life, an early pioneer of RSP plans, only sells these contracts, so its figures for regular and RSP are identical. An analysis of the details on regular premium charges, together with the performance star rating in the final column, reveals some interesting details. Several lower chargers - Albany and Laurentian, for example - are also poor performers. Other providers combine high charges with good performance. Then there are the high chargers and poor performers. This category includes Axa Equity &amp; Law, Barclays Life, Confederation Life, Crown Financial, Manulife, Provident Mutual, Prudential, Save &amp; Prosper and Royal Life, among others. Table 2 shows the impact of charges at various stages throughout the contract period. Again, note what happens in the early years. In some cases, you will have little or nothing to show for your Pounds 2400 if you cancel after the first year. This is the case with British Life Office (nil) Crown Life (nil), Guardian Financial (Pounds 177), Hambro Guardian (nil), Irish Life (nil), Lifetime (nil) and NatWest Life (Pounds 42). The truth, the whole truth? Not quite, according to Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of partnership pensions at Bacon &amp; Woodrow. B&amp;W's research into personal pensions raised a serious concern about the details financial institutions provide on their charges. Warwick-Thompson said: 'The annual management charge, bid/offer spread (the initial charge) on the purchase of units and administration fees are not the only costs passed on to policyholders. In most cases, unit-linked funds bear additional costs which are reflected in the unit price; for example, audit fees, dealing commissions, trusteeship fees, custody fees and stamp duty.' These costs can add up to the equivalent of an extra 0.5 per cent on the annual management charge, and are most likely to occur where the stated annual charge appears low, he explained. Warwick-Thompson pointed out that these hidden charges will not be revealed under the post-January 1 1995 disclosure rules - an oversight the regulators should have spotted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [E. Ya. Ryskin, G. M. Kholodilin, D. V. Tsirlin, Yu. D. </F> Shavdiya; UDC 621.396.621.33]    [Abstract] Application of a standard demodulator with a  two- beam filter (TBF) at the input, synthesized by a delay  line, is examined in this article. Devices with a negative  frequency feedback (NFFB) are normally employed as noise immune  demodulators of frequency modulated (FM) signals. The examined  device is just as effective as the NFFB, but its construction is  much simpler. With a particular selection of delay, the noise  band of this filter can reduce the noise band at the demodulator  input by a factor of two. The phase characteristic of the filter  between the AFC zeros is linear. With application of linear  pre-distortions, changes introduced by the TBF into differential  gain and phase keep them within a norm. A block diagram of the  device, is provided and its functioning is discussed.  Computations of differential phase and differential gain  produced by using the TBF were performed with the assumption  that a linear pre-distortion filter of TV signals was used at  the transmitter side. Noise immunity of FM TV signals with a TBF  at the input was computed and numerical modeling was carried  out. Efficiency of employing non-linear pre-distortions is also  examined. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that  application of the TBF with reception of FM TV signals and  employment of non- linear pre-distortions is effective.

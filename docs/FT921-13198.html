			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar focus in nervous trading THE dollar remained the focus of a nervous day in the foreign exchange markets yesterday, falling sharply against the yen late in London on rumours that the US and Japanese authorities would intervene to support the Japanese currency, writes Simon London. The US currency traded within very tight ranges overnight in the Far East, barely moving from New York closing levels. The dollar ended the Tokyo day at Y123.34 and DM1.5885, from Y123.43 and DM1.5887 in New York. In European trading the cautious tone continued through the morning, although the dollar gradually appreciated against both the yen and the D-Mark during the session. The US currency hit a high of Y123.85 and DM1.5950 before falling back. In late afternoon the US unit was subjected to a spell of extreme volatility following reports that the US Federal Reserve was checking market rates with dealers at commercial banks. Rate-checking can be a precursor of intervention and dealers speculated that the US authorities were about to sell dollars for yen on behalf of the Bank of Japan - a repeat of intervention which knocked the dollar down from Y127.45 to Y124.45 late on Friday. Fears of renewed intervention sent the dollar spinning down to Y122.55 before it sta-bilised. Dealers said there was no sign of intervention by the close in London and the dollar regained some poise. However, analysts noted that the US authorities might have been waiting until European markets had closed before operating in the market. Intervention is likely to make more impact when trading volume is low. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5830 from DM1.5970; Y123.10 from Y123.65; Pounds 1.8065 from Pounds 1.7910; and FFr5.3975 from FFr5.4450. In New York it ended at DM1.5865, Y123.60, Dollars 1.8050 and FFr5.4085. Today, US housing construction figures for December, the only significant US indicator due for release this week, will be watched for signs of an upturn in economic activity. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the D-Mark continued to soften. Analysts said worries over inflationary wage demands by German trade unions continued to undermine the D-Mark. The Spanish peseta, already the strongest currency in the system, appreciated in line with other currencies. Against the D-Mark it reached a high of Pta63.12, from Pta63.21 at the opening, raising sterling's floor within the system to DM2.8587. However, by the close the Spanish currency had fallen back to Pta63.21, relieving some of the pressure on sterling, which closed comfortably above its ERM floor at DM2.86, unchanged from Monday. Today, the Bank of Spain is due to operate in the money market through its regular repurchase agreements. Traders will be watching the rate at which the authorities supply liquidity to the money markets for signs of any change in monetary conditions.</p>

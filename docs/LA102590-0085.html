			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: PROMOTION IS SECOND TO NONE  </P> <P> It all began with Tex Rickard. He took the fight game off the barges and put it  on Park Avenue. He made it as In as polo with the upper classes. Unlettered,  uneducated, he hunted for his gold in the Klondike with a deck of marked cards  and the nerves of a guy who would bet it all on the color of the next cow.  </P> <P> He made his fortune in the fight game, but there's no evidence he was otherwise  interested in it one way or the other. He landed the biggest attraction of his  day -- Jack Johnson and Jim Jeffries -- by the simple expedient of buying Mrs.  Johnson a fur coat when no one else would even speak to her. He put a  half-million dollars in gold in a store window in Goldfield, Nev., to promote  his fight and he put the first million-dollar gate together in New Jersey  because New York was too squeamish to permit it (Dempsey-Carpentier) in 1919.  </P> <P> He was a hayseed, a rube, but he beat New York at its own game. He was the  first to print gold-backed tickets and make a fight seem like an invitation to  a palace. He was 50 years ahead of his time in hiring press agents and selling  movie rights. His stock comment was, "I never seed anything like it!" He never  got rich because he kept pushing the chips back out onto the table.  </P> <P> He made Jack Dempsey and vice versa. In 1927, Gene Tunney got the unheard-of  purse of $990,000, and he gave Rickard $10,000 so he could make out and  photograph for posterity the boxing world's first million-dollar check. Rickard  rolled high. He won or lost with a shrug.  </P> <P> He was a private man in a flamboyant business, and he fretted a lot. He was  particularly frightened when he matched Luis Angel Firpo with Dempsey. He  thought Dempsey might kill him, maybe literally, and cause a riot at the box  office of fans wanting their money back. He went to the champ and asked him to  take it easy. Dempsey went flying out of the ring in the first round, but  Rickard needn't have worried -- the fight mob never squawks at a knockout. It's  the 15-round bloodless gavottes that get them to throwing chairs.  </P> <P> After Rickard and Dempsey, the fight game went into a decline. There was a  series of boring artisans until Joe Louis and Mike Jacobs came along. Joe was  the wrong color for those racist times, but boxing had been integrated long  before the railroads were. Long before there was a Jackie Robinson, there was a  Joe Gans and a Peter Godfrey.  </P> <P> Mike Jacobs, like Rickard, wasn't a sportsman, either. He was a ticket  speculator. And he knew a Broadway attraction when he saw one, and he knew Joe  Louis was to sports what Bernhardt was to theater or Valentino to the movies: a  sure-fire seat-filler. Jacobs didn't care for the fight game all that much. He  interfered with the normal order of things only once: when Max Schmeling was  entitled to a title shot at the champion James Braddock. Jacobs maneuvered him  out of it and Louis into it. Jacobs did not want the heavyweight championship  going to Adolf Hitler.  </P> <P> In spite of their groundbreaking, it's unlikely either Tex Rickard or Mike  Jacobs could have foreseen what their sport has turned into: a money pit that  makes Tunney's million dollars look like a tip for the hatcheck girl.  </P> <P> Tonight at the Mirage hotel here in this improbable metropolis, two  prizefighters who probably could not have warmed up Dempsey or Louis as  sparring partners will divvy up more than $32 million for 36 minutes -- or less  -- of fist-fighting. Buster Douglas, whom no one ever mixed up with Gene  Tunney, will get more than $24 million. His opponent, Evander Holyfield, whom  no one ever mixed up with even Floyd Patterson, will get in excess of $8  million.  </P> <P> That's what it has come to. Two guys who might be fighting the semi-main 25  years ago -- one guy's too little, the other guy's too fat -- are going to get  more money in half an hour than John Jacob Astor probably got out of furs in  his lifetime.  </P> <P> The successor to the Rickards and the Jacobses is an equally improbable  character -- a brash, aggressive young casino operator who ignores a  catastrophic eye condition, retinitis pigmentosa, to put on a fight that, for  sheer weight of numbers, makes the Rickards and Jacobses look like tinhorns.  </P> <P> Steve Wynn has hypothecated $40 million on this extravaganza. Rivals say he was  crazy, that Wynn's nickname should be "No." Thirty-two million dollars was too  much to ante up for these fighters. But Wynn points out the rival offer was $29  million, adding: "And they have no casino to promote."  </P> <P> Like Rickard and Jacobs before him, Wynn is not interested in promoting a sport  -- just a casino. Numbers such as these boggle the mind, but Wynn says he saw  money begin flying around because of a simple accident of fate, the one that  saw Buster Douglas knock out Mike Tyson in Tokyo last February. "When I saw  Buster knock out Tyson in Tokyo," Wynn says, "I came right up out of my chair.  I thought, 'Holy geez! We've got a whole new ballgame here! This busts things  wide open!' "  </P> <P> Wynn saw the opportunities for his casino. This is what bigtime pugilism has  become, a shill for a crap game.  </P> <P> But if 10% of the nearly 15 million homes wired up for pay television in this  country pony up $35-40 for Douglas-Holyfield, Wynn not only hypes the crap  tables, he meets the nut. "I make the Mirage the most famous hotel in America,"  he says. "The fight is one day. We're open 365."  </P> <P> Apart from that, Buster Douglas-Evander Holyfield, even though it's for the  title, is just a kind of complicated elimination bout. Mike Tyson is the  promoter's dream today, the logical successor to Rickard's Dempsey and Jacobs'  Louis. At first blush, it would seem as if the two guys tonight were contesting  for a stateroom on the Titanic. Because whoever wins here is going to run into  the iceberg -- Tyson.  </P> <P> "This will be a big fight because nobody knows who's going to win," says Steve  Wynn.  </P> <P> In a sense, he's right. You go to a fight for the same reason you go to the  opera -- you know how it's going to come out, but you go to hear Caruso sing or  Toscanini conduct. A Muhammad Ali or Joe Louis fight is a case in point. Or you  go because you can't decide who's the better man.  </P> <P> This may be a contest to see who is worse. Buster Douglas, at 246 pounds,  appears to be about as ready for a 12-round ordeal as Orson Welles would have  been. Still, Holyfield may not have enough sense to stay away from him till he  melts.  </P> <P> Either way, it's as American as pie a la mode, which Buster slightly resembles.  It's a slice of Americana. Rickard and Jacobs would understand perfectly. So  would P.T. Barnum and any guy with a tent and a wagon load of snake oil. You  used to have to own steel mills to pull down this kind of one-day money. As  Rickard would say, "I never seed anything like it."  </P></p>

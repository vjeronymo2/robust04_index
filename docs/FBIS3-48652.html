			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by So Myong-suk] </F>   [Text] President Kim Yong-sam has faced most difficult  time since he took the office. Skepticism and criticism for the  directions and the methods of the reforms are slowly coming out.  "Does President Kim's government has any solid  `core-reform-power team' to carry out the reform?" seemed to be  the most concerned and realistic questions over Kim and his  government. In political language, the `core-reform-power'  means President Kim's power-base.    President Kim started his presidency with a strong command  of  leadership, but series of situations which occured recently has  caused reason enough to raise questions. Representive You  Song-hwan, who belongs to the Democratic faction [President  Kim's faction of the Democratic Liberal Party], raised a  question about past political involvement of Representive Kim  Yun-hwan, who is from the Democratic Justice [DJ] faction of the  same party and it triggered the burst of the factional feuds.  And, it led the DJ faction to casts the "angry votes" during a  bill passing process on the 25th [October]--recommanding the  release of National Assembly members, Pak Chol-on and Kim  Chong-in was the bill they were trying to pass. In addition,  the cabinet is unable to break through the thick wall of the  bureaucrats and is vacillating.    The opposition party has started to irritate President Kim  and his administration not to miss this opportunity. On 28  October, the first day of the National Assembly Hearing against  the government on the political affairs, the members of the  opposition party concentrated on attacking the ruling party's  internal feud. Representive Yim Chae-chong, Democratic Party  [DP], accused the Kim's Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] for  taking an ambiguous position and ridiculed that the DLP is not a  `core-reform-power' of Kim that can lead the reforms, but a  political body which has interest only in pursuing its own  faction's gains, thus it should be a reform target. Yim's  criticism continued and he accued President Kim for keeping  unstable coalition with the old establishment ever since the  three parties merged. Yim asked "what happened to his [Kim]  going into the tiger's den to catch a tiger?"    Representive Chang Ki-uk, who also participiated in the  attack, made a statement that the bold punishment should be  carried out for the DLP, a political party born of the 12  December and the 17 May Coups, members who were connected with  the anti-people and anti-democracy actions, and charged for  corruptions.    Why is the opposition party demanding the ruling party to  reorganize the `coer-reform-power,' and making it a political  issue? It is obvious that the DP wants to reveal the political  limitation of the DLP by irritaing the weakness of President  Kim's `three in one' party.    But, it is difficult to treat the opposition's attacks  merely  as a politcal game play because these points are shared by the  most of the public. Although the DLP's DJ faction and the  Democratic faction do not and will not acknowledge the feud  among factions and the hetrogeneity in public. But, the  heterogenity and the factional feud of the DLP does exist and  it's a real thing, and no one will deny the facts in private.  After all, each faction's have their own root, different  experiences of history, different evaluations and understandings  of the past governments. And the difference of the two  factions' appriciation and motive for creating the Kim Yong-sam  government is wide apart.    The DJ faction's reaction to Representive Yu's "past  political involvement" issue clearly showed the fundamwntal  difference of the two factions. During the National Assembly's  audit and inspection of the government, Representive Yu made a  suggestion, "how about the traing institute of government  employees invite the persons like Chon Tu-hwan, No Tae-u, Choe  Hyong-u, Pak Sok-mu, Yi Chol and Kim Yu-hwan as the guest  lecturers, who can lecture them contemporary Korean histories  from thier vivid experiences and give them the benefit of real  history lessons, rather than inviting those scholars who have  been educated abroad?" Yu's that suggestion created a big  ripple.    In other words, Yu is saying that Representive Choe Hyong-u  can cover the lecture on the dictatorial military governments  and the toture and Representive Kim Yun-hwan could speak on the  Yusin government since he has been a member of the Yujonghoe.  And the DJ faction's response to that was "how quickly they  forget, it hasn't been that long ago they asked for our help to  get Kim yong-sam elected. But now, they want to hurt us." The  Dmocratic faction's reponse to that is "it's only an  individual's private opinion, besides,it's certainly a  discussible subjectd." A telephone interview on 26 [October]  just before he left the country, Representive Yu responded with  "I have mentioned lot more names than what the media printed and  that caused the misunderstandings. In fact, in my opinion, the  Yusin cannot be 100 percent bad and the regrets and repenting of  the past could be a good lessons for the history."    At a TV talk show on 23 October, Representive Choe spoke  about the "qualification need to become DLP's executive  chairman," which also caused a stir. Choe explained that "I was  not prepared to give an answer when I was unexpectedly asked  about it, so I gave a very basic answer that it must be a person  who can be able to lead the reform." But for the DJ and NDR  [New Democratic Reperblican] factions have taken it as the  Democratic factions act to shake up the Ececutive Chairman Kim  Chong-pil's position prior to the May DLP convention.    Despite their long co-existance as a part of same political  party, the DLP's factional power struggle has hurt the party and  its unity and harmony. However, on 27 [October], President Kim  invited the DLP key leaders and the members of the special  committee for political affairs to Blue House for dinner and  that seemed to bring a temporary peace, at least an appearance  wise. But, the deep seeded feud will not go away easily--the  Blue House is pushing to pass a bill, the Reform Law--the  revised law related to political affairs--during the regular  National Assembly seesion, but the DLP majority, the DJ faction,  considers that as an action to destroy them. Another example  for the discord is that recently Executive Chairman Kim  Chong-pil excluded the chairman of the Planning and Managing  Committee, Paek Nam-chi of the Democratic faction, from the DLP  high level members meeting.    Nevertheless, there is a view agreed by the majority that  President Kim will not purposely carry out an action to  dismentle the DLP, or the DJ faction to leave the DLP to have  its own party before the 15th General Election. The majority  believes that President Kim, who knows the nature of the DJ  faction better than anyone, will embrace those DJ faction  members, who share his political reform direction, and lead the  party effectively until the election in 1996.    President Kim's more pressing problem is on the fact that  his  administration has not been able to break through the thick  walls of the bureaucrats, who are the front line workers of the  government administration. Although the cabinet, which consist  of a few from the DJ faction, who were part of the Fifth and  Sixth Republics and who knows Kim personally, and some of the  Democratic faction members appears to have a united front, they  have no clear picture nor understandings of the reform and its  directions. So, the cabinet merely maintains the vertical  relationship with the president.    Thus, the prevailing atmosphere among the bureaucrats are  "self protectionism and the peace-at-any price-ism," do best to  escape from the corruption probes, and the attitute of "wait and  see" towards the new government. In fact, they have a new term  saying, "the bureaucrats are here and will be here but the  government power can go anytime." The passive ruling party,  do-nothing bureaucrats, the directionless cabinet, etc. show how  weak the President Kim's power base is.    Can President Kim over come these obscles and build a firm  foundation for his leadership? There are pleanty of rumors  addressing to that subject, such as, the cabinet reshuffle  before the year's end and the party leadership changes at the  May convention, etc. Also, Presidential pardon of former law  maker, So Sok-chae, before the year's end and appoint him to a  cabinet post, name the DJ faction's Kim Yun-hwan and Yi Han-tong  to cabinet, and who will be replaced, etc. are a part of the  rumors.    However, these are merely a part of a transitional measure.  A long range out look for building a firm foundation for his  leadership is likely to be in the plan. In that respect, paying  a special attention to the upcoming 1995 elections for the local  government legislatures and governers is necessary. Recently,  while working on a proposal for the unified, overall election  law, the DLP's Special Committee for Political Affairs confirmed  its proposition on the 1995 election schedule for the local  government system (the elections for legislature members, heads  of cities, counties, districts in February; city counsils and  representives for the provinces aand governers in May,etc.) All  four elections are pushed into 1995, and it also included  applying the party nomination system for the basic legislature  [kicho uihoe] candidates.    If this unifed election law passes, in 1995, President Kim  will have the nomination rights to all candidates--for mayors,  county and district heads and provincial governers. What an  opportunity for Kim Yong-sam to have his people at the every  coners of the country! Series of recent appointments of the PK  [Pusan/Kyongnam] persons to various government posts, government  owned companies, banking industries, etc. are good indications  for the direction of nomination process for the local government  election candidates. It seems that the ruling party has  conducted a survey on the current and propective mayors and  provincial governers already. A rumor about Secrtary General of  the Blue House, Pak Kwan-yong, is interested in running for the  Pusan mayor's seat is another indication how much the weight the  ruling party is putting onto the local election.    The Blue House is pushing hard for the unified election law  to pass before the year's end. The Blue House's reason for  pushing it is that since the public demand for the political  reforms is very high, government needs not to loose the  oppotunity to fullfill the public desire. Also, it is necessary  for government to have a time to prepare for a clean election  for the local election, which takes place before the general  election.    If President Kim's priority is on the local election, where  he can establish a concrete power base, rather than the the  General Election in 1996, passing the unified election law in  1993 is must. In that respect, a remark by a Blue House high  official is a meaningful one, he said "there are lots of rumors  spreading about the cabinet reshuffle and other affairs to take  a place before the year's end, but they are all speculations.  The real issue that needs to be done within this year is  paasing this Political Reform Law. It will be the beginning of  every debate and will be a starting point of everything. The  driving force of political power and the directions will appear  after the bill.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Afrikaner National Front co-leader Gen. </F> Constand Viljoen by SABC presenter Freek Robinson in the  Johannesburg studio on the "Agenda" program -- live]    [Text] [Robinson] First, I want to congratulate you for  being selected as one of the news personalities for Agenda 1993.  We made the announcement last night, but I want to say welcome,  you are here, and we are going to use this whole program to  focus on this critical point in the history of the country, when  negotiations have reached a real difficult stage.    First, you have already been involved in the talks. You  spoke over the weekend, and you were involved in negotiation  last week. What is the present situation now in the  negotiations, specifically with your endeavor to reach a  settlement with the ANC [African National Congress] and with the  government?    [Viljoen] Freek, we have two sets of negotiations going  on--those of the Freedom Alliance and the Afrikaner National  Front [AVF] is also engaged with the ANC regarding the issue of  the Afrikaner.    [Robinson] Only with the ANC and not with the government?    [Viljoen] The government is part of it. In other words, it  is what they call trilateral discussions on both levels--that of  the alliance and that of the subcommittee.    [Robinson] Let's just speak in general terms. Today's  discussions--how did they go? In fact, as we are talking here,  they are still going on. How are they progressing?    [Viljoen] The problem that we have is the so-called time  limits that have been introduced. We got together this morning,  and, in ight of what happened over the weekend, we...    [Robinson, interrupting] Who met?    [Viljoen] The negotiating teams of the National Front, the  ANC, and that of the government. We met. We discussed the  matter, and we came to the conclusion that the tension that came  about over the weekend, particularly the rejection of the  strategic alternative -- that of war, which we discussed on  Saturday. This matter was discussed, and we concluded that we  need more time. We then reported back....    [Robinson, interrupting] Were you all unanimous in the  conclusion?    [Viljoen] Yes. We arrived at the conclusion that, if we are  trying to force what we have been discussing during the last 10  days as an alternative, it would not work. Now we are trying to  look at the matter from a fresh perspective. This morning, we  told the people that there is no way in which we can reach part  of an agreement by Thursday because the moment one changes the  key aspects, then the ANC has to go back to its principals and  we have to go back to ours. In other words, we are not  authorized to fully make all the decisions ourselves. At a  certain stage, we have to report back to our principals.    [Robinson] Has it been accepted that Thursday is the new  deadline?    [Viljoen] It has not necessarily been accepted, but it is  something that cannot be ignored. The ANC usually meets with  its Executive Council on Wednesdays, and they will have to look  at what our proposed amendments to the plans so that we will be  able to get feedback from them on Thursday. In addition, our  own people must get together on Wednesday so that we can also  give feedback and, in my opinion, Thursday--or even Friday--is  the earliest that we can wind up.    [Robinson] But you interpretation would be then that the  deadline should get postponed effectively?    [Viljoen] Yes, you know, the government has too many  deadlines. If the one is not suitable then we go on to the next  one, and it is not very clear when the deadline really is. It  is a sign of pressure.    [Robinson] Today had been set as one?    [Viljoen] Today had been set as one. As far back as the  24th, we started with deadlines. And we get a new one each  time. It is also good that way as we have a big, responsible  task to carry out. The differences between a peaceful election  or a violent one, or the difference between war or greater  violence and peace in the country....[pauses] That is why it's  important that we should get enough time. You know, a lady from  Bosnia recently said to me that rather a thousand days of  negotiations than one day of civil war. And I think that should  be our approach. We have to negotiate the matter thoroughly.  We have to look each other squarely in the eye, and we have to  reach a conclusion. And if we have progressed to a certain  level, and we report back to our people as we did on Saturday,  and we can see that the people are not happy, then it's no good  to just ignore that and carry on. You have to go back and  present something new at the table and see if you can't solve  the problem.    [Robinson] We will get to all the things that could be  brought to the table. I just want to get some clarity about  this: Thursday is another deadline, and there is time until  then or even until Friday.    [Viljoen] That is as far as the National Front is concerned.  The Freedom Alliance had a plenary discussion today--I'm not  sure how far they progressed, but it doesn't look too  encouraging.    [Robinson] Why?    [Viljoen] Progress today was very disappointing. There was  too much arguing among themselves on constitutional issues, and  it seemed to me that there was no wish from both sides to make  any breakthroughs. It was as though the people were just trying  to provoke each other.    [Robinson] Just to confirm again, General, in other words,  can we assume that you are going to negotiate until Thursday or  Friday?    [Viljoen] Look, if one asked what the limitation was, one  would then say that the constitutional limitation is that the  election be promulgated 60 to 90 days before election day. If  one takes 60 days, then one finds oneself well into February.  And one has to consider that there are certain amendments, in  other words, Parliament will have to be convened. It is not  within my sphere of interests to know how long it takes to  convene Parliament, but I would say that it can be done within a  week. As far as I'm concerned, if we really want to become  serious about a negotiated settlement, then we ought to make  ourselves available to carry on until the 10th -- if we are  serious about finding a solution.    [Robinson] Let's refer now to what happened on Saturday. You  are saying that your strategic alternative was rejected just  before the meeting itself. How did you read it? Did you see it  as an insult to you, personally, and a rejection of your  leadership?    [Viljoen] I want to start by saying that this strategic  alternative is not an alternative proposed by me. I reported  our stance back to the meeting, and I gave them an overview  right from the establishment of the National Front. I said that  we have reached a stage where there are two alternatives. One  is war -- if we want our homeland by the 27th of April. The  other is a strategic alternative that can continue after 27  April--that is to say, we accept that we will not get our  homeland by 27 April. Those are the two alternatives I proposed.    [Robinson] Take part, and then negotiate thereafter?    [Viljoen] Yes, that was the idea....[pauses] Look, the  problem was that we have always been accused of not wanting to  prove our support base despite all the requests we directed at  the government -- that we wanted to hold our own election to  prove that the Afrikaner wants a homeland -- the government  blocked us effectively all the way from doing this. Now that we  are nearing the end of the negotiation process, both the ANC and  the government are saying to us we must prove our support base.  Then they suggested that this proof cannot take place before 27  April because the department that will be working on that is too  busy. It is preparing for the election. In any case, you know  very well that the National Party is busy with an election  campaign, and I don't think it suits the National Party right  now -- through an Afrikaner election -- to be made aware that  the Afrikaner really needs a homeland.    [Robinson] Are you saying that the National Party or the  government are trying not to find a settlement so that you must  not take part?    [Viljoen] No, it is possible. But I am saying that it suits  the government that no such election is held. It could happen  that the election could prove to be in favor of the homeland  idea and the government has always been against it. It would  put the government in an election dilemma. In any case, the  government does not want fights from both sides. It doesn't  want to fight the ANC and the Afrikaner National Front. But the  point that I'm making is that we are going into an election  campaign, and all the utterances and decisions being made on a  political level are colored by the interests of political  parties in the election.    [Robinson] General, the question I have just asked you --  there are two questions still waiting. The first one is  specifically--that the strategic alternative is--voting must  take place on 27 April in a people's election, as you would put  it to the voters. [sentence as heard]    [Viljoen] The whole idea was that on 27 April you vote for  the Afrikaner National Front and that all those votes would be  counted as a vote for the Afrikaner homeland. So if there were  1 million votes for the Afrikaner National Front, then it would  be accepted that the support base would be 1 million people.    [Robinson] Now back to my original question: When you  announced this alternative -- whether it was your own or not --  the crowd booed you. How do you explain that? Was it a  rejection of your leadership? That's what some people are  saying.    [Viljoen] Let me put it this way. At the moment, I am the  coordinator of the directorate. We generals were asked to give  strategic leadership in this struggle. Strategic leadership  does not only mean warfare. It means coordinating other forms  of pressure, be it political, economic, and even military. I am  there to give advice. I give it as I see it. On Saturday, I  was not giving advice, I was simply summarizing the situation.  I had not even gotten to the advice yet, to say what we felt  about the situation, whether it was acceptable or not. But the  crowd was already very angry. That is a sign of how the  Afrikaner really feels today. Saturday's meeting must not be  seen as a demonstration against me as a person. They shouted  and went wild because I had dared to go against their wishes.  There was an unmistakable indication from among the people, who  had come from all over the country....    [Robinson, interrupting] General, can we determine who those  people were? I was unfortunately not present, but I have tried  to make inquiries, and it would appear that some of those who  shouted the loudest were uniformed people, members of the AWB,  the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Am I correct? Do they  speak on behalf of the Afrikaner people?    [Viljoen] Mr. Robinson, you know the AWB. You know they are  people who make themselves heard. They are people who express  their feelings at a meeting. That is what one could see on the  surface. But beyond that, there are the farmers. Today a group  of farmers called on me and discussed this issue. And let me  tell you, if there was noise at the meeting, among the farmers  there is a rumbling. There is a lot of impatience, a lot of  rejection of what is going to take place. What have the  Afrikaners gained to date? Absolutely nothing. At the end of  the bilateral process it was beginning to look as though a  settlement might be possible. Then in early January, somewhere  around the 8th, Mr. Mandela, in one speech after another, said  things which were completely at odds with the spirit of the  negotiations. Where we had been so serious about reaching an  agreement, we could now barely get together an ANC team to go  ahead with the talks. We had hoped to complete the process by  20 January, but....    [Robinson, interrupting] General, you have covered that  already. But today you were again involved in more talks with  the ANC. On Saturday, there was talk of war. You have yourself  referred to war or some other form of action, possibly economic,  as one of the possible alternatives. You have used the term  minimum violence. What exactly do you mean by that?    [Viljoen] Look, Freek, what has the ANC done with the  negotiations? They have always backed the talks with violence.  They used mass action and economic violence, boycotts, so-called  stayaways. They used these to put pressure on the process. The  Afrikaners have reached the point where they shout for joy when  one mentions war, and boo when one mentions a peaceful solution.  That is the situation. The Afrikaners are now putting on the  pressure.    [Robinson] What form will it take?    [Viljoen] A very dangerous situation is developing. In the  near future we are going to reach a point where not even I will  be able to control the situation.    [Robinson] What makes you say that? What have you observed?    [Viljoen] The anger of the people, because they have  nothing.  All along we have told our people that our goal is a homeland by  27 April. Now we must stop, because the government and the ANC  say it is not possible. The government says there is no time  for a referendum before that date. The ANC says it does not  suit them. So once again it involves the election. These two  organizations do not want to agree to a homeland.    [Robinson] Gen. Viljoen, we have dealt with that point. My  question is, what form will the violence take? The weekend  newspapers reported that the generals have warned President de  Klerk of a threatened uprising among the right wing. You have  said you know the people are angry. Is it a fact that the  uprising is being planned, and that it will involve weapons,  targets, and that kind of thing?    [Viljoen] Freek, that an uprising is coming, there can be no  doubt. I think it is unavoidable. At Saturday's meeting I did  not expect such a violent reaction. I can spell out the  signs....    [Robinson] But do you know as a fact that people are busy  organizing with weapons and selecting targets?    [Viljoen] No, we have not yet started selecting targets.  What I can say is that I warned on Saturday, and I repeat, we  have the potential to start a war. Since our first meeting at  Potchefstroom, I have been warning people to believe me when I  say that the Afrikaner's freedom is priceless, and that we will  not be satisfied with anything less than a homeland.    [Robinson] Could you....    [Viljoen, interrupting] Believe me when I say it is a matter  of peace. The Afrikaner wants a peaceful solution if it is at  all possible. If that is not possible, if the Afrikaners are  ignored, if we ignore the Zulus, if we ignore the Tswanas, then  there is going to be an uprising in this country.    [Robinson] I have already asked you about that uprising. Do  you know whether it will involve hidden caches of weapons?    [Viljoen] Weapons are freely available. We do not need to  hide weapons in caches. Our people have their weapons. We are  not hiding tanks and armored vehicles in bushes in preparation  for war. We already have weapons. But one must not give the  impression that the Afrikaner sees that as the only solution.  There are those who say, as they did on Saturday, that we must  shoot, and shoot right away. But let me assure you that the  vast majority of Afrikaners are responsible people, in the sense  that they would much rather choose an alternative to armed  violence.    [Robinson] What is that alternative which you have on the  table, and which you are at present discussing with the various  parties like the ANC and the government, and which you hope to  have resolved by Thursday?    [Viljoen] Freek, we will have to get the ANC and the  government to reconsider the possibility of a homeland by 27  April. We reject the story that it is not possible to hold a  referendum before that date. We believe that is merely a means  of preventing Afrikaners from demonstrating their power base.    [Robinson] What is the minimum that you would accept? As  they say in English, what is your bottom line? [preceeding two  words in English]    [Viljoen] Our bottom line [preceeding two words in English]  is a referendum, or a plebiscite, call it what you will, in  February to prove our support. Then we are prepared to  establish a homeland council and to inaugurate that homeland by  27 April. That is what our people demand. It is not what I  demand.    [Robinson] That is your bottom line. What happens if you do  not get it? An uprising?    [Viljoen] I assure you, that is the minimum. If we do not  get that, much as I regret having to say it, there is going to  be trouble. Nothing will stop the Afrikaner. I am not issuing  threats. I merely want to give you the facts. I must give you  the facts. And let me add that I believe the first thing to be  affected will be the election. If the Afrikaner is not allowed  that basic right, we cannot see how the election can go ahead.  It will not be a deliberate act. The violence factor in the  country is already so high, and if we add this issue, that  violence will go through the ceiling.    [Robinson] General Viljoen, thank you for taking part in the  program tonight. The negotiations are continuing this week. I  am not choosing sides. I opt for peace, and I am not ashamed of  that. I hope all goes well.    [Viljoen] I agree. Thank you.</p>

The main objection was that the social  action offered in the package was small while the armed presence  was very strong.    The political leader, who is a member of the president's  official entourage currently touring Ecuador and Peru, said  Ambassador Jon Glassman's offer on 10 January "was not laid out  very well and probably will have to be brought up again or will  be rejected."    What was laid out wrong?    It was really a request for social action, but a very small  one, with very strong participation by U.S. armed personnel to  carry out exercises, but not joint exercises with our troops but  with Ministry of Public Work forces. We think the proposal was  badly laid out because the promised social action is small. They  propose building eight schools, a program that any parents  association can undertake, and some eight artesian wells, all  with a large military detachment. Their presence could create  problems at a time we are consolidating our democracy. It is not  convenient for the U.S. image as a leading democratic country  and it is not convenient for the image we, Paraguayans, must  have of ourselves.    Montaner said that as a result of a meeting at the  presidential residence, "President Wasmosy has taken up the  responsibility with a lot of integrity and without involving  anyone. He has assumed the responsibility. I think the offer  must be rejected. On the other hand, we can tell the Americans  that we really need help fighting drug trafficking and  implementing social action programs, but not with the proposed  political style."    Asked if the president will reject the U.S. offer, Montaner  said: "The proposal was made to the president of the Republic  and he will be responsible for rejecting it."</p>

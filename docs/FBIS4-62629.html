			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Voropayev] </F>   [Text] Moscow may 17 TASS -- "You can be optimistic,  because the reforms, which took the other countries several  decades to accomplish, are proceeding at a much faster pace in  your country," Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs Guido di  Tella, currently paying an official visit to the Russian  capital, told ITAR-TASS.    "Much is being written in the Western press about the  catastrophic situation in Russia," he said. "However, I got  quite a different impression. I am witnessing a country which  is attaining its goals in spite of huge difficulties. The  situation in Russia is difficult, indeed, but it should not be  gauged by the same yardsticks as in Western Europe. They must  be different for Russia. In my opinion, Russia is today enjoying  great respect on the international arena," the minister stated.    Touching on his talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, Guido di Tella described them as frank and friendly,  conducive to the raising of mutual relations to a qualitatively  new level.    Assessing the present state of the Argentine-Russian  relations, the minister said that they were unquestionably  better than at any other past period, because "it is very  difficult to be on friendly terms with communists". It is  possible to promote friendly business relations with Russia  today, "because we speak the same language, think in like terms,  adhere to principles of tolerance and constructive relations".    The minister believes that Russia has a great future.  "Naturally," he said, "development never runs smoothly. There  are always ups and downs." Noting that Russia was using  different means to promote its reforms, the minister stressed  that it was achieving successes in spite of all the existing  difficulties. In his opinion, the only thing that Russia needed  today was "some order in the country. It must not invent any  new social systems".</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major fights off Maastricht rebel MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, emerged unscathed in the Commons yesterday from a preliminary skirmish with one of the prominent Tory backbench opponents of the bill giving effect to the Maastricht treaty on European Union. Mr Christopher Gill (C Ludlow) - one of the two dozen or so Tory backbenchers expected to refuse to support the bill's second reading in the Commons tomorrow night - called for ratification of the treaty to be delayed until outstanding differences on a number of key policy issues had been resolved. He said the prime minister would never be in a stronger bargaining position to secure assurances on immigration, the retention of border controls and limiting Britain's contribution to the European Community Budget. Mr Gill argued that all those issues and the controversy over the EC's working time directive should be settled before the treaty was ratified. The prime minister replied that Mr Gill had raised a number of important - and in many ways, 'tendentious' - issues relating to the existing provisions of the Treaty of Rome - which established the EC - and not directly to the Maastricht treaty. He assured the House: 'In all these matters we will fight to preserve British interests up to, during and after ratification of the Maastricht treaty.' Another leading opponent of the bill, Mr Nigel Spearing (Lab Newham South), also sought to delay its passage by arguing that it should not be debated until the government had provided MPs with a consolidated version of the Treaty of Rome that reflected the changes resulting from the Maastricht treaty. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, said the bill was perfectly in order. It was for the House to decide whether or not it should be passed. THE US Defence Department stated yesterday it considered the case 'closed', Jurek Martin writes from Washington. Mr Pete Williams, the spokesman, said: 'For our part, the US government has gone to extraordinary lengths to co-operate with the British investigation.' He insisted that what happened was an accident, stemming from 'a difference of interpretation' in communications between US pilots and British troops. But two US Congressmen said yesterday they had directed the House armed services investigations subcommittee to open a preliminary inquiry into the deaths of the nine British soldiers. 'We are not sure how much we can do to resolve the discrepancies between the American and British accounts of the events,' said Representative Nicholas Mavroules, a Democrat from Massachusetts who chairs the subcommittee. Mr Mavroules said that if there was a 'reasonable chance' of answering questions about the incident, the subcommittee could conduct a full inquiry.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- The chairman of the Japan  Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) said Thursday the next  general election for the House of Representatives may have to be  held under the existing electoral system based on multiseat  constituencies.    Kosaku Inaba told reporters that an election under the  current system is a possibility, although it should preferably  be held after the introduction of a new system combining  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation.    Top leaders of other major Japanese business organizations,  including the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren),  have said the lower house should be dissolved for a general  election only after a new electoral system is introduced.</p>

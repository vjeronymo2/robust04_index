			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Ukraine MPs refuse to take IMF medicine UKRAINE'S parliament yesterday jibbed at the IMF prescription for its economy, objecting to proposed pay curbs and threatening to reintroduce price controls - a big step back to central planning. Ukraine reluctantly freed prices in January, acting only when radical Russian reforms forced it to follow suit, and has yet to produce a comprehensive economic reform programme of its own. The parliament's move came after the radical labour minister introduced a bill to cap the amount enterprises can spend on wages. This proposal, recommended by the International Monetary Fund to stop an inflationary spiral, provoked the deputies' anger. Although there has been no brake on rising wages in the dominant state sector despite a fall in production, political considerations outweighed economic logic. MPs rejected the proposal and instead demanded that any cap on wages be matched by reintroduction of price controls. The cabinet of Prime Minister Vitold Fokin, the former head of the Ukrainian central planning committee under communist rule, is likely to welcome a return to price regulation. Popular discontent has been aroused by price liberalisation. Monopoly enterprises have raised prices of many goods, including food, beyond the reach of most consumers. The IMF is likely to be disappointed. Ironically, the parliament is today due to vote on a radical privatisation package, which, together with freed prices, would lay the foundations for a true market. If state controls are reintroduced now it will be politically difficult to free prices a second time. Meanwhile, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, French treasury director representing the Paris Club of western creditor governments, yesterday met Mr Fokin to discuss payment of Ukraine's 16.37 per cent share of Soviet debt. There have been signs that Ukraine, which wants to pay independently, and the Paris Club, which wants the former Soviet republics to assume collective responsibility for the debt, might reach a compromise whereby Ukraine would take responsibility for the debt of some smaller republics but pay separately from Russia.</p>

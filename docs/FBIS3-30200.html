			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On behalf of the Croatian Government, Mate Granic,  deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, has  signed a memorandum of understanding between the Republic of  Croatia, the European Union [EU] and the CSCE. The memorandum  is linked with the EU and CSCE missions in Croatia, whose task  is to support the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro.    On behalf of the EU the memorandum was signed by Danish  Ambassador to Croatia Eric Skov, and on behalf of the CSCE --  currently chaired by Italy -- by Italian Ambassador to Croatia  Salvatore Cilento.    The memorandum regulates the ways of working and the methods  of activity of the two international missions -- the EU and the  CSCE -- active in Croatia since January 1993. The missions'  task is to ensure that the sanctions are fully implemented. The  Croatian authorities, especially the customs and financial  bodies, are called on to help supervize the implementation of  measures envisaged by the sanctions against Serbia and  Montenegro. The memorandum also regulates the status of the  missions' members, in keeping with the Vienna Convention.    A memorandum with the same content was also signed by all  other countries bordering Serbia and Montenegro.</p>

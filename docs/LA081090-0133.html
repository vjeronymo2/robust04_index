			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL RAPS LOAN POLICIES OF BANK REGULATORS  </P> <P> Federal banking regulators came under sharp criticism in Congress on Thursday  for allowing banks to make too many risky loans to high-flying borrowers such  as Donald J. Trump while squeezing small businesses out of the credit market.  </P> <P> At a House Banking Committee hearing, lawmakers expressed concern that a  growing proportion of commercial bank assets are either not earning money or  are invested in questionable real estate holdings.  </P> <P> The criticism reflects increasing concern that the same factors responsible for  the collapse of the savings and loan industry could cause similar problems for  the nation's commercial banks.  </P> <P> Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) criticized federal  regulators for not being frank about current practices.  </P></p>

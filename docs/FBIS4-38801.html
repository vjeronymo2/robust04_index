			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anna Streltsova report: "Press Conference at the St. </F> Petersburg FCS. Counterintelligence To Busy Itself With Vetting  Officials' Incomes"]    [Text] The St. Petersburg directorate of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS] held a press conference  devoted to "National Security and Fighting Crime." In it,  directorate chief Viktor Cherkasov revealed the contents of a  closed discussion Boris Yeltsin had with FCS chiefs on 26 May.  It was also intimated at the press conference that several  draft laws have been prepared by the State Duma providing for a  stronger control on officials' incomes, something that will be  done by the FCS among other agencies.    As KOMMERSANT-DAILY has already written, following an  extensive report read out to the FCS staffers Boris Yeltsin held  a discussion with chiefs of the service whose contents were not  made public. Viktor Cherkasov briefly expounded its main points  at yesterday's press conference. In his words, Boris Yeltsin  assured the FCS chiefs that the large-scale reorganization of  its subdivisions was basically over, while the investigation  apparatus as well as special subdivisions to combat crime, which  are not yet on its payroll, would revert to the FCS. All these  things are envisioned in the draft of a new law "On The Organs  of the Russian Federation Counterintelligence Service."    According to Mr. Cherkasov, Boris Yeltsin explained to the  counterintelligence service staff that from now on they will  also have to work against the special services of the "near  abroad" countries which have grown more active. The FCS is also  supposed to supply the top organs of power of Russia with  information on the current processes in the economy. On the  basis of this information, the president promised "to take the  most resolute actions in the sphere of governing the state."    Aleksandr Aleksandrov, State Duma deputy elected in St.  Petersburg and chairman of the Duma national security  subcommittee, stated at the press conference that "interaction  in matters of juridical policy" was finally achieved by the  government and the president. Several draft laws developed by  the subcommittee aim at improving the material status of  officials while simultaneously at stepping up the fight against  abuse of office and graft, for which purpose FCS officers may be  pressed into service. The authors of the drafts think it  necessary that all officials should be obliged to declare their  incomes, while they should be from time to time "vetted as to  being susceptible to taking bribes," something regarded as a  provocation by opponents of these innovations.    In connection with the president's proposals, some officers  of the FCS directorate voiced to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY  correspondent the fear that at this stage the objectives set  cannot be reached effectively because the repeated  reorganization of the service did not serve to retain its  personnel. It is possible, for example, that not all former  members of the FCS investigation apparatus would want to resume  their former positions after receiving more attractive offers in  other subdivisions of the counterintelligence service.</p>

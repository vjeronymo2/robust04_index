			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> UMW FINED $4.5 MILLION FOR 'TERROR'  </P> <P> A judge fined the United Mine Workers nearly $4.5 million today for what he  called "acts of terror" in the coal fields.  </P> <P> Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin Jr., who earlier fined the UMW  nearly $3 million for violating orders limiting strike activities, blasted the  union for assaulting and threatening people during the nearly 4-month-long  strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc.  </P> <P> "There has been a feeling of terror throughout much of this area," the judge  said.  </P> <P> McGlothlin ordered that $2 million of the fines be paid to the state, $1  million to Dickenson County and almost $1.5 million to Russell County. He also  ordered that all UMW members be restrained from impeding traffic around  entrances to Pittston property and from interfering with local traffic.  </P> <P> Many of the fines stemmed from McGlothlin's finding that the union failed to  stop its members or supporters from forming convoys of slow-driving vehicles  that have delayed the hauling of Pittston coal.  </P> <P> UMW attorney Mike Passino said he expected the union will appeal.  </P></p>

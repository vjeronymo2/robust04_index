			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY EARNINGS: HUNTWAY REPORTS 52% DIP IN 2ND-QUARTER PROFIT  </P> <P> Huntway Partners, a Valencia-based producer of liquid asphalt, said its  second-quarter profit tumbled 52% from a year earlier, to $1.13 million from  $2.34 million.  </P> <P> Huntway's revenue in the quarter that ended June 30 rose to $24.1 million from  $22.6 million. For the first half of 1989, Huntway's profit fell 22% to $2.55  million from $3.27 million, and its revenue was virtually unchanged at $42  million.  </P> <P> Huntway went public in November and used the proceeds in part to reduce its  debt. Its year-earlier financial results are on a pro forma basis, that is,  they reflect what Huntway's results would have been had Huntway gone public and  reduced its debt in early 1988 instead of later that year.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASKETBALL REGIONALS;  </P> <P> DIVISION IV BOYS;  </P> <P> LANCERS LOSE REMATCH TO SANTA CLARA  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran High School missed the front ends of three one-and-one free  throw opportunities in the final 40 seconds and lost to Santa Clara, 71-70, in  a Southern California Regionals Division IV semifinal in front of 2,500  Thursday night at Ventura College.  </P> <P> It was the second loss for Orange Lutheran (24-5) in less than a week to the  state's top-ranked Division IV team. Five days ago, the Lancers were blown out  by Santa Clara, 78-54, in the Southern Section 2-A Division title game at the  Los Angeles Sports Arena.  </P> <P> This time, Orange Lutheran held a 70-69 lead with 1 minute 5 seconds to play,  but then the game slipped away when it failed to make pressure free throws.  Santa Clara (25-3) will advance to the division's title game against Washington  High Saturday at Cal State Dominguez Hills.  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran had missed just one free throw in 22 previous attempts before  misfiring in the final 47 seconds. Santa Clara's Shon Tarver, who scored 24 of  the Saints' 36 points in the second half, sealed the victory by making two free  throws with 9 seconds left to play.  </P> <P> "We had three chances and failed," Orange Lutheran Coach Jerry Simmons said. "I  felt we should have beat them but you can't win a close ballgame if you don't  make your free throws at the end."  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran's misfortune began with 47 seconds left when freshman point  guard Luke Aucoin missed a free throw with his team leading, 70-69. Tarver  answered with two free throws 15 seconds later to give Santa Clara the lead for  good, 71-70.  </P> <P> Still Orange Lutheran had two more chances.  </P> <P> First, reserve Brian Bedord missed a free throw with 16 seconds remaining but  teammate Jason Neben managed to force a jump ball with Santa Clara center Bubba  Burrage with 13 seconds left and the Lancers got possession.  </P> <P> Next, it was Kent Dowding's turn at the line, but he missed.  </P> <P> "It was a combination of being good and lucky," said Lou Cvijanovich, Santa  Clara's Coach. "They showed they are a good free-throw shooting team . . .  until it counted. This is a crazy game, but that's what makes it the greatest.  I told everyone at the Sports Arena that if we played Orange Lutheran again, it  would be different.  </P> <P> "They caught us on a good day the last time, and we got them on a bad day."  </P> <P> Orange Lutheran was a different team in the rematch. The Lancers opened a 40-35  lead at the half by making 15 of 16 free throw but the momentum slowly shifted  in Santa Clara's favor with Tarver taking control.  </P> <P> He scored 13 of the Saints' 19 points in the third quarter and score was tied,  54-54, going into the final quarter. He pushed Santa Clara ahead, 58-54, early  in the period and the Saints remained in the lead.  </P> <P> But Dowding's free throws with 2:31 remaining tied it, 64-64, and then the game  became a free throw contest.  </P> <P> Daryl Cole led Orange Lutheran with 21 points and center Pat Bagatourian added  17 points before fouling out with 4:37 left. Tarver finished with 37 points,  making 16 of 18 from the field.  </P></p>

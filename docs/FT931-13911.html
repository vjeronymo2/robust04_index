			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Commercial lease provisions criticised by Bank THE Bank of England yesterday criticised the structure of commercial property leases as being inconsistent with the government's anti-inflation policies. Clauses that provide only for increases in rents 'seem designed for a world which had the certainty of an upwards-only pattern of property values,' it said. 'This pattern is not in the interest of the economy as a whole and the thrust of our anti-inflationary policy is intended to make it obsolete.' The comments were made in a speech prepared by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank's governor, for a conference organised by the British Property Federation. The speech was delivered by Mr Pen Kent, an associate director, because Mr Leigh-Pemberton was ill. The Bank also criticised 'privity of contract', whereby tenants who assign their leases may be obliged to pay rent if a subsequent tenant defaults, as having 'apparently absurd outcomes'. The possibility of a change to 'privity of contract', which was included in the last Conservative manifesto, is being examined by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor. Mr Leigh-Pemberton's speech warned that the attraction of property as an investment could be further diminished. 'If, as I suspect, we are to see further erosion of the institutional lease sector as the balance of power moves back in favour of the tenant, we could see the gap between property and gilt yields widen still further.' However, he said the liquidity in the commercial property market would improve as demand responded to lower prices and a wider economic recovery. 'Bleakness will not endure,' he said. 'But we must not allow inflation to be the route by which values are restored.'</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Faxes on the move Busy people computing on the move can now send the results by fax. Psion of the UK has launched 3Fax to plug into its Series 3a pocket computer. It says the device - half the size of the 3a palmtop - gives access to E-mail and on-line services as well as sending faxes with logos and signatures. Faxes can be created in advance and sent, queued or deferred for sending at different times when the user reaches a socket. 'There's no difficult software to get your head around,' says Psion director Peter Norman. The 3Fax can pull information from the database for faxing and send to any number in the computerised address list. Price Pounds 199.95 Psion: UK, 071 262 5580.</p>

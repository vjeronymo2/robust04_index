			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Swiss braced for scandals Law-abiding Swiss are bracing themselves for further news of corruption. Mr Hansrudi Muller, the Zurich prosecutor, said in an interview in the Sunday newspaper Sonntags Zeitung that he was 'almost certain' at least one more case would be uncovered this year. Two new cases of public sector wrongdoing emerged last week. Five Swiss government internal auditors are under investigation on suspicion of taking money in return for favours to government suppliers. Meanwhile, three Zurich motor vehicle bureau officers are under arrest for having taken small bribes to issue incomplete vehicle registration papers. These papers enabled the recipients to falsify documents on used cars exported to Africa. Two weeks ago, formal charges were laid against eight people, including a prominent magazine publisher, for allegedly bribing Mr Raphael Huber, Zurich canton's former restaurant and bar inspector. Two weeks ago, the head of a corruption ring in Fribourg who had bribed the canton's finance director and police chief was sentenced to 27 months' jail.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Lloyd's launches reforms in bid to reassure Names REFORMS designed to defuse tension at Lloyd's of London were announced yesterday by the insurance market's authorities. The changes aim to give more information to the 26,500 Names who back underwriting with their personal wealth and to prevent disputes going to court. The measures come as the market faces the prospect of at least two years of overall losses and as an increasing number of Names are resorting to the courts to avert bankruptcy. Mr Alan Lord, the Lloyd's chief executive, said the 'overall purpose of the package is to reassure Names and ensure that the consequences of losses are dealt with within the family of Lloyd's rather than in a public forum.' Names should benefit from three separate measures: A procedure to review 'major' insurance losses by any of the market's 354 syndicates is to be introduced next month. Where a syndicate's net loss at the end of the market's three-year accounting period amounts to 150 per cent or more of the syndicate's allocated capacity - the amount of premium it is permitted to write according to market regulations - the governing body of Lloyd's will review the 'commercial circumstances' of the loss. Committees, possibly comprising former Lloyd's underwriters and chaired by an independent outsider, will conduct the reviews. Mr Lord said the reviews would not be published but they would generally be made available to Names via their members' agents. Mr Lord insisted that the reviews would be 'quite distinct' from investigations relating to matters of potential misconduct. The investigation 'is not designed to point the finger at anyone', he said. Conciliation and arbitration procedures will be revised in an attempt to resolve disputes between members of Lloyd's and their agents before they go to court. 'Before litigation there is a role for conciliation,' Mr Lord said. A conciliation scheme for settling disputes between Names and their agents will be developed, while arbitration procedures, established in 1987, will be streamlined to reduce delays. Syndicates are to be obliged to disclose the salaries paid to underwriters in published annual reports from 1990. This follows criticism that the rise in Lloyd's underwriters' salaries - who can expect to earn Pounds 75,000-Pounds 300,000 a year - has depressed syndicates' profitability.</p>

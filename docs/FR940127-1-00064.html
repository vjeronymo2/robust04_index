			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 13. Bigleaf Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> American mahogany, the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Swietenia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is native to the neotropics (56 FR 33898&hyph;33899, July 24, 1991). Two of the three species in this genus are listed in CITES Appendix II:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Swietenia humilis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Pacific Coast mahogany) including its parts and derivatives, which occurs in Mexico and Central America; and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Swietenia mahagoni  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Caribbean mahogany) including only its logs, sawn wood, and veneer, which occurs on some Caribbean islands and extends to southern Florida. The unlisted species,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Swietenia macrophylla  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (bigleaf mahogany), occurs from South America to Mexico; it apparently forms hybrids naturally with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. humilis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in Costa Rica. In the Carribean,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. mahagoni <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  seems to have crossed spontaneously with introduced  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. macrophylla  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to form hybrids that have been called  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. aubrevilleana. Swietenia  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> species and hybrids also are in cultivation (and may be locally naturalized); some are grown ornamentally and/or silviculturally.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Swietenia macrophylla  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. mahagoni  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are grown with limited success in plantations in the tropics of the New and Old Worlds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At COP8, Costa Rica and the United States proposed to include  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Swietenia macrophylla  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and its natural hybrid in Appendix II; the U.S. proposal excluded the Old World populations and secondary and final products (e.g., finished products and derivatives). In a preliminary meeting during COP8, all the range States except three (Bolivia, Peru and Honduras) tentatively supported the listing. Costa Rica decided to support the U.S. proposal. However, because of lack of sufficient consensus, the United States withdrew its proposal (cf. 57 FR 20443, May 13, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the July 15, 1993, notice (58 FR 38112) that initiated listing preparations for COP9, the Natural Resources Defense Council provided a new extensive draft proposal to include the neotropical populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Swietenia macrophylla <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and its natural hybrid in Appendix II, including only the timber and wood processed to the first stage of transformation (i.e., primary products), such as logs, wood in the rough, sawn wood, veneer sheets, and plywood. The September 1993 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee favored submission of a proposal for this species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service regards the available information and data sufficient to support reproposing this species and its natural hybrid, and believes that there is increasing understanding of the consequences and value of its regulation under CITES Appendix II. The United States has become the main importer of this species, and the Service plans to provide a draft proposal to the range States for their comments. Information is desired particularly on populations that are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 14. African Mahoganies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society provided draft proposals to list the African mahoganies in Appendix II. African mahoganies include the genera  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Entandrophragma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (about 11 species) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Khaya  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (about 6 species), which are native to the tropics of Africa, with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Khaya  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> extending to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Some of the 17 species are in cultivation, including some silvicultural plantations. The majority of the species have some legal protection in one or more countries, generally with respect to their export. All of the species have been declining due to habitat conversion and selectively varied commercial exploitation, and nearly all of them have been reported to be threatened in various countries and significant portions of their ranges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has recognized the need to conserve most  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Khaya  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and some  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Entandrophragma  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> species, being concerned with their genetic erosion. The September 1993 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee reviewed draft proposals for these genera, and favored the circulation of these drafts for their possible submission. In November 1993, Germany circulated them to the range States for their views. The Service may join with Germany's initiative, or provide draft proposals to the range States by April 1994 for their comments. Information is desired particularly on populations of each species that are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Technology: Companies stick by green credentials - Worth Watching Companies wishing to promote their environmental awareness can now buy stickers featuring a reusable monitor which shows the level of acidity in rain by changing colour. Invented by Anthony Maxwell and available through his company Maxwell-Paitch, the stickers can be customised with text and corporate logos. Alternatively companies can buy packets of six special fund-raising acid rain monitor stickers promoting the up-coming United Nations Earth Summit to be held in Rio de Janeiro at the start of June. More than two-thirds of the Dollars 2 sticker purchase price will go to supporting the Earth Summit. Maxwell-Paitch: UK, 071 355 1096.</p>

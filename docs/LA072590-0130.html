			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN EXPECTS TO BE INDICTED ON CHARGES OF FALSIFYING SAFETY DATA;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: SOME OF ITS EXECUTIVES MAY BE ACCUSED OF IRREGULARITIES IN  MAINTENANCE RECORDS. ITS BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE SAYS VIOLATIONS TOOK PLACE BEFORE  LAST YEAR'S STRIKE.  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines, already in deep financial trouble, said Tuesday that the  company and some of its executives will be indicted on charges of falsifying  maintenance and safety records.  </P> <P> It would be the first time that an airline has been criminally charged with  violating safety regulations.  </P> <P> The indictment, which is expected to be disclosed officially today, was  announced to reporters by Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the airline's court-appointed  trustee in bankruptcy. He said he did not know which of Eastern's managers  would be indicted.  </P> <P> Late Tuesday, NBC News said it had learned that a federal grand jury had  returned a 60-count indictment against Eastern and nine employees.  </P> <P> NBC's report Tuesday said the indictment would name Edward Upton, the airline's  former senior vice president of maintenance; Joseph Moser, a former maintenance  manager; Thomas Lewis, a regional director, and six supervisors.  </P> <P> Such an indictment would be another major blow for Miami-based Eastern, which  filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy  Code in March, 1989. The filing was prompted by a strike five days earlier by  the airline's machinists, pilots and flight attendants.  </P> <P> Since then, partly as a result of continuing bad publicity, Eastern has been  forced to sell many of its assets, including lucrative Caribbean and Latin  American routes, which were bought recently by American Airlines. Eastern says  it is losing about $2 million a day, in large part because it is attracting so  few business travelers.  </P> <P> Shugrue was appointed as trustee three months ago to run Eastern when the  bankruptcy court in New York took control of the airline out of the hands of  its owner, financier Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp. The parent company, which  also owns Continental Airlines, has since changed its name to Continental  Airlines Holdings Inc.  </P> <P> Shugrue told reporters Tuesday that safety violations occurred at several  Eastern maintenance facilities before last year's strike and bankruptcy filing.  </P> <P> Shugrue said a federal grand jury had conducted a 10-month investigation of the  airline. The indictment comes after the airline was unable to reach a plea  bargain agreement with prosecutors.  </P> <P> The government sought to have Eastern plead guilty to a conspiracy charge,  Shugrue said, but the airline refused because it might appear to the public  that the safety violations were "systemic." The executive insisted that there  are no systemwide safety problems at Eastern, arguing that the airline now  ranks as the world's safest because it has been so closely scrutinized by  government agencies.  </P> <P> Shugrue said prosecutors' demand for a guilty plea to a conspiracy charge  "would have called into question this entire airline's present, superior  maintenance program and all employees and managers involved in it. We cannot  plead guilty to violations of the law for which we find no evidence. The U.S.  attorney's office has offered us no evidence of systemic wrongdoing."  </P> <P> The indictment reportedly will include allegations of wire fraud, obstruction  of justice and making false statements.  </P> <P> Shugrue said that in recent days Eastern's attorneys and the U.S. attorney for  the eastern district of New York, Andrew J. Maloney, have conducted discussions  "to attempt to put this investigation and these matters to rest." Such efforts  failed, he said.  </P> <P> "Where wrongdoing occurred, particularly at our JFK (New York's John F. Kennedy  International Airport) maintenance facility, employees were terminated and or  resigned," Shugrue said. "And the Federal Aviation Administration levied  substantial civil penalties.  </P> <P> "Accordingly, the company was prepared to acknowledge to the U.S. attorney in  the form of a guilty plea that certain irregularities occurred during the  pre-strike period, up until March of 1989, with respect to our record-keeping  at Kennedy and perhaps other stations."  </P> <P> Last September, Eastern paid $2.9 million to settle FAA allegations of safety  violations. As in most such settlements with the FAA, the airline did not admit  to violating safety requirements. Eastern has since closed its maintenance  facilities at Kennedy.  </P> <P> News reports earlier this month said the grand jury investigating Eastern was  expected to indict more than seven current and former employees, including vice  presidents of the company. In addition to Kennedy International, violations  were said to have taken place at New York's LaGuardia Airport and Hartsfield  Airport in Atlanta.  </P> <P> According to those reports, employees were expected to be accused of falsifying  maintenance records. They were said to have approved repairs that were  improperly performed and, in some cases, not performed at all.  </P> <P> Shugrue repeatedly emphasized that the violations occurred several years ago.  </P> <P> "We will not countenance violations of our maintenance policies," he said.  Since the past violations, he said, "the airline has undergone a rigorous  inspection by the FAA, by the Department of Defense and (has undergone) our own  internal audit."  </P></p>

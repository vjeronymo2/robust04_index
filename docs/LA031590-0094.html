			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARKS WORKER ARRESTED OVER THEFT OF CITY PAVING BLOCKS  </P> <P> A veteran Glendale parks worker accused of stealing nine tons of paving blocks  from a city yard was arrested Monday and ordered to stay home from work this  week pending disciplinary action.  </P> <P> Thomas J. Bowman, 46, a 21-year city employee, surrendered to police after  grand theft charges were filed against him in Glendale Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Arraignment is scheduled March 26.  </P> <P> According to a police report, 1,327 concrete paving blocks missing from a city  yard were found in the rear of Bowman's home in Glendale, laid out to form a  20-by-30-foot parking area. The hexagonal-shaped blocks are valued at more than  $2,000.  </P> <P> City officials said police are continuing to investigate the disappearance of  more than 400 other blocks also taken over a period of several weeks from a  locked maintenance yard at the Scholl Canyon baseball fields. Officials said  more than 100 employees have keys to the yard.  </P> <P> The investigation began in January after police and city officials received an  anonymous phone call and a letter from a tipster who reported witnessing two  employees loading blocks into their private vans at the city yard. No other  arrests have been made.  </P> <P> Nello Iacono, director of parks, recreation and community services, said the  theft of city-owned materials by an employee is the first incidence of its kind  that he can recall in his 12 years with the city.  </P></p>

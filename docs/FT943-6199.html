			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Deal may trigger extra US cash White House officials are now at 'not much less than fever pitch', say Washington diplomats, over the improved prospects for peace in Northern Ireland, and members of the US Congress are confident of an IRA ceasefire. The administration of President Bill Clinton is also considering an aid package to help buttress a ceasefire, although no details have yet been worked out. 'There are a number of options to provide aid to Ireland already. We won't make any decision on what to do until we see exactly what the terms of the ceasefire are,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, who was accompanying Mr Clinton on his holiday in the Massachusetts coastal resort of Martha's Vineyard. Congressional aides said any request for more money to accompany a peace agreement would probably receive considerable support, but that no specific package was yet circulating for discussion. The US currently gives Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m) a year to the International Fund for Ireland, which is jointly administered by the UK and Ireland. Some members of Congress criticised the appropriation each year, on the grounds that the fund seemed less deserving than some developing countries whose aid has been cut. But no substantial opposition is expected, even for a much larger sum, if there seems a real prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. The US also allowed a veteran Irish republican activist into the country yesterday on a special visa as hopes for a breakthrough rose. Mr Joe Cahill, a founding member of the Irish Republican Army who was reprieved in 1942 after being sentenced to death for killing a policeman, arrived in New York yesterday after Mr Clinton personally approved a request for a waiver from immigration laws that would otherwise have excluded him because of past terrorist activities. The visa is the first the Clinton administration has granted to an Irish republican since the row over the visit in February of Mr Gerry Adams. US officials were disappointed then by Mr Adams's failure to renounce violence. Hopes for a ceasefire have risen in the US after the visit to Ireland last week of a delegation headed by Mr Bruce Morrison, a former congressman with close ties to the Clinton administration. Mr Morrison, although expected to report to the White House, stressed he was not an official representative of Mr Clinton.</p>

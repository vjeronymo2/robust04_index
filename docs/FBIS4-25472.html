			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, 7 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Guangdong  is continuing its macrocontrol over the real estate industry.  From now on, the provincial government will not grant approval  for the establishment of property development companies or the  requisition of land for real estate projects.    State macrocontrol, through controlling the total volume of  credit over the last year, has brought thousands of property  development companies across the province to understand a grim  fact: Property development companies which have an ample supply  of capital and whose projects meet market needs can gain the  initiative in market competition, while those which rely only on  bank loans for their existence and are interested in building  luxury villas or residential units will just go bust.    Statistics provided by the provincial construction  commission  show that property investment increased by 230 percent in 1992  over the previous year, the 1993 figure was 1.3 times that of  1992, and that property investment across the province in 1993  accounted for 37.5 percent of total infrastructure investment,  clearly indicating the excessive scale of property development.  Experts say, after analysis, that even if new projects are not  undertaken, it will take the market several years to absorb  existing real estate projects.    Guangdong will not undertake any real estate projects this  year. Those property development enterprises which are suffering  from stockpiles of land will be required to transfer some of  their land to property development companies which have abundant  capital but no land, projects under construction will be  continued or suspended depending on market requirements, and  completed houses should be sold as soon as possible to recover  capital for new development projects.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Mongols study a Japanese model HAVING emerged from seven decades of communism, Mongolia has sent a group of parliamentarians to Tokyo to study whether the scandal-prone Japanese political system should be copied by a country whose voters are mostly nomadic herders. The timing of the Mongolians' study tour has let its 10 members witness the indictment for tax evasion of Mr Shin Kanemaru, fallen from grace as the all-powerful fixer of Japanese politics and now in a Tokyo detention centre. Mr Kanemaru's plight and the durability of the ruling Liberal Democratic party have fascinated officials from the Mongolian People's Revolutionary party, which recently renounced its communist past and likes to see itself as Mongolia's LDP. Playing to a pastoral audience during a recent election campaign, the MPRP promised '104 calves for every 100 cows'. 'We are very interested in the contradictions that created such widespread corruption,' said Mr Batsuuri, the party secretary. 'We are also very interested in the cleansing process that allows the Japanese political machine to go on working.' Mongolian officials have taken note of the US political system and are interested in British and German traditions of democracy, but Mr Batsuuri said that Japan holds special appeal because it is an economic and democratic success story in an Asian setting. The Revolutionary party describes itself as a 'social democratic' party and is one of 'nine or ten parties' in Mongolia: the number has fluctuated with short-lived coalitions and even shorter-lived parties sprouting each month since the country's democratisation began three years ago. Mr Hulan, international secretary of the Mongolian National Democratic party, the largest opposition group in the Great Khural, the Mongolian parliament, said the delegation wants to examine privatisation methods and the Japanese tax system. The interest in tax has more to do with sliding scales than the alleged evasion of Mr Kanemaru. 'We have found Japanese politicians and bureaucrats to be very open about their problems,' Mr Hulan said. The Mongolians are intrigued by the LDP's factions but amused that their disputes have nothing much to do with ideology. According to Mr Batsuuri, the Revolutionary party has factions but they have 'an ideological base' whereas, in Japan, 'factions are more tied to political personalities'. Mr Batsuuri said that the Japanese experience does show the advantage of 'consensus-style politics'. The English word 'consensus' has recently entered the Mongolian vocabulary, as there was not much need for the concept after the country's communist revolution in 1921.</p>

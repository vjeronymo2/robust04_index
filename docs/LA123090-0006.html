			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THRIFT STORE PAINTINGS, EDITED BY JIM SHAW (HEAVY INDUSTRY PUBLICATIONS, P.O.  BOX 85428, HOLLYWOOD, CA 90072; $29.95, CLOTH, $19.95, PAPER).  </P> <P> As nothing is more bizarre than the ordinary artifact closely observed, this  full-color catalogue of 201 paintings by amateurs and hobbyists shoots to the  top of the charts of estimably odd coffee-table art books. Conceived and  designed by artist Jim Shaw and published by artist Edward Ruscha, the riveting  volume is all pictures, no text -- save for the purely descriptive titles given  to the paintings.  </P> <P> "Indian Maidens Frolic in Bikinis," "Man and Woman Emerge From Egg in Seascape"  and the ever-popular "Wolves Attacking Steer Carcass on Snowy Night" are among  the subjects these vernacular artists felt they simply had to paint; these  pictures were then snapped up by Shaw and other collectors at the salon des  refuses of suburban American culture -- the neighborhood thrift store. And you  thought modern art was strange. Christopher Knight  </P></p>

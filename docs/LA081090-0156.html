			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS GROWING PAINS ARE HIS MOVIE NOW;  </P> <P> FILM: WHIT STILLMAN'S 'METROPOLITAN' LOOKS AT THE LIVES OF YOUNG NEW YORK  SOCIALITES. IT'S HIS LIFE, TOO.  </P> <P> For the first few days of filming his movie, "Metropolitan," freshman  writer-director Whit Stillman clutched his security blanket, a copy of a book  called "How to Direct a Movie."  </P> <P> Maybe Stillman was uncomfortable with the logistics of directing, but he was  right at home with the scene he set: lush Manhattan apartments filled with  elegantly dressed young debs and their dates gabbing intensely about love and  life at "after-parties." The independent romantic comedy, opening today, about  the growing pains of a gang of young New York socialites was right out of  Stillman's own experience with that crowd in New York circa 1970.  </P> <P> The 38-year-old Stillman spent many a tuxedoed night with the billowy dresses  and white gloves and velvety furniture talking about sociology, literature, sex  and romance. "So the subject for the film just sort of fell into my lap," said  the Harvard graduate whose film career followed years of dabbling in book  publishing, journalism and film distribution. "I tried writing about that world  in college, trying to be F. Scott Fitzgerald. It never worked. I was too close  to the material."  </P> <P> With time and distance, he was ready to approach it. "For 10 years I was  totally estranged and not involved in that scene, so I could go back to it with  this distance and humorous take on it, and it really worked."  </P> <P> "Metropolitan" first grabbed the attention of critics at the U.S. Film Festival  in Park City, Utah, last winter, then at the New York New Films/New Directors  series and the Directors Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival.  </P> <P> Yet, Stillman is overwhelmed that it's really happening to him.  </P> <P> "Can you believe this? I'm in the director's suite," he said, looking out  French doors to the sun-splashed Hollywood Hills from his room at the Ma Maison  Sofitel, where he was staying during a recent promotional stop. At Cannes, he  stayed in a hotel he described dryly as "very normal, less than normal, sort of  awful." At the time, he was counting every penny for a film that he says came  in for less than $1 million.  </P> <P> In his preppy blue blazer, white shirt and pants, and Kelly green tie, Stillman  looks ready for the yacht club. He looks like a grown-up version of the  characters in his movie, which he said became a breeze to direct. "After a  while I felt like a duck in water directing -- it was just what I wanted to do.  It was a incredible sense of exhilaration."  </P> <P> Despite the distance in years from his nights dancing by the fountain at the  Plaza Hotel, his vision of the film was clear. "I felt really close to it," he  said. "I wanted to tell a story about the past. I wanted to sort of treat it  ironically and make fun of the obsessions of those years."  </P> <P> For Stillman, those obsessions included being lost in the world of Fitzgerald  novels, the sociological theories of Charles Fourier and daydreams of one  charming New York socialite girl.  </P> <P> "It's amazing how you fool yourself when you have a crush," he said. "I  practically never saw her, but I convinced myself that she was my girlfriend."  </P> <P> Stillman explained that this girl was his entree into the world of the young  socialites. "Getting to know that world better was a way to get to know her  better."  </P> <P> Although his family took part in the socialite scene, "they were hostile to it  at the same time." His father was a lawyer with the Kennedy Administration.  </P> <P> In "Metropolitan," the character Tom is smitten just as Stillman says he was.  And like Stillman, he could play both sides when it came to the deb set. A  socialist thinker with one tuxedo to his name, one thin raincoat and a divorced  set of parents, he was at once an outsider and an insider.  </P> <P> Stillman spread himself around in the film, he said other characters in the  so-called "Sally Fowler Rat Pack" were parts of him: Audrey, the naive Jane  Austen-loving heroine; Nick, the aggressive fast talker, and Charlie, who is  stuck on the doomed condition of his social class.  </P> <P> When you meet Stillman, it's hard not to hear his characters when he talks. His  speech is fast, ideas pop out suddenly and the satirical wit from his Harvard  Hasty Pudding days is thrown in. " 'There's a lot of Whit up there,' my friends  say when they see it."  </P> <P> As Carolyn Farina, a first-time feature actress who plays Audrey, put it, "He  knew those characters back and forth; he definitely knew what he wanted from  us."  </P> <P> The cast was made up of unknowns, because Stillman could not afford established  stars. "I was looking for happy campers, because we were going to be camping  out."  </P> <P> Stillman was a well-groomed camper in the blazer and fedora he often wore to  the filming. "We were in these very fancy places, and I thought it was a good  idea not to look too filmic."  </P> <P> Although for a long time, filmic was exactly what Stillman wanted to be: "But I  didn't have the guts."  </P> <P> Instead, he went through a mini-identity crisis. He could not find his true  vocational calling. He even took an aptitude test that said he should be an  architect, but after devouring architecture books, he decided it was not for  him.  </P> <P> His ideas about failure are woven through his film. Stillman invented a word in  the film for the group plagued by the sense of doom he shares -- UHB -- which  stands for Urban Haute Bourgeoisie.  </P> <P> What's an UHBie? Not a preppy or a WASP but a member of a group that because of  its social status has no where to go but down. The original tag line of  "Metropolitan" was "Doomed. Bourgeois. In Love." Because he thought it was too  depressing for a comedy, Stillman changed it to "A story of the downwardly  mobile." He hopes the term UHB will start a craze. "It seems to me a perfect  term to describe that condition."  </P> <P> "There are a lot of illusions and attitude problems when talking about people  in the UHB background." He had firsthand experience: "Before I made a film I  wasn't a terrible failure, but I was succeeding OK at something I had no  identification with at all."  </P> <P> He eventually became involved in the film business as a sales agent for Spanish  films. In that role, he went to Cannes annually for several years.  </P> <P> One Cannes night in 1985 at a cheap restaurant, the urge to write his own film  finally became compelling. He started scribbling away.  </P> <P> Stillman went through a four-year process of writing the film late at night.  While writing, it never seemed real. "You sort of feel you're in a dreamland."  </P> <P> He made it real by approaching some of his friends, "who had some spare change  they could afford to lose on a friend's film."  </P> <P> Will people not from the background understand the New York-centric milieu and  get the jokes? "I think people will enjoy the fact that the film has texture.  They will sense that there is a joke there, even if they don't get it."  </P> <P> As he awaits the film's opening, Stillman the doomsayer is wary that things are  going too well. But he worries about the fate of his next script, the story of  two American men who become involved in the youth culture in Spain.  </P> <P> "I am comfortable with everyday anxiety. I was happy in my failure," he said.  </P></p>

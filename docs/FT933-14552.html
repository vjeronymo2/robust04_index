			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Water debate flows into government's domain: Dispute is raging over who should foot the bill for rising costs in meeting European directives on quality MR IAN Byatt, the water regulator, has thrust the issue of rising water bills firmly into the government's lap. In essence his discussion paper published yesterday says the cost of cleaning up Britain's water has become unacceptable, and it is up to the government to reduce it by renegotiating or relaxing water quality standards. He has deliberately stirred up what is likely to be a fierce debate about how much Britons are prepared to pay for pure water and clean rivers and beaches. The price row has been brewing ever since the UK embarked on its clean-up programme in the 1980s and privatised the water industry in England and Wales. A year ago Mr Byatt produced his first paper on the subject, The Cost of Quality in which he laid out various scenarios for the water clean-up. A typical household paying Pounds 185 a year for water in 1994-95 could be paying Pounds 245 to Pounds 345 a year by 2004-05 depending on how fast the clean-up was done, he said. His paper infuriated water quality regulators, particularly the National Rivers Authority which accused him of exaggerating the problem and providing misleading analyses of the issues. Environmentalists also attacked him for trying to undermine quality standards and ignoring consumers demands for high-class water and sewage systems. There were even suggestions that Mr Byatt, who sets controls for water prices, was trying to duck his responsibilities. The timing of this paper, Paying For Quality, is particularly sensitive because he has to decide on the next set of five-yearly controls by next summer. The pricing formula makes a special allowance for water companies to pass on the cost of service and he is therefore in a position to sanction large price increases. The water industry, usually on the receiving end of complaints about rising water costs, this time supports what it sees as Mr Byatt's efforts to strike a balance between benefits and costs. Ms Janet Langdon, the director of the Water Services Association, said: 'The industry wants stability.' Mr Byatt makes two points in reinforcing his case for a softer approach. One is that considerable improvements are already being made, so it is a question of slowing the rate of improvement rather than reducing standards. Water companies are already spending Pounds 3.5bn a year, but full implementation of the regulations, particularly the European Community's Urban Waste Water Directive, would increase that to Pounds 5bn. The second is that customers have not been given the chance to say whether they are prepared to bear the soaring costs. When Britain signed up for the waste water directive the cost of implementation was put at Pounds 2bn. It is now thought to be Pounds 10bn. 'I don't believe that increases of that kind are what people want or what they are prepared to pay for,' he says. Mr Byatt received support for that view yesterday from Mr Jim Gardner, chairman of the Ofwat National Consumer Council. 'It's too much too quickly,' he said. But Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, has accused him of again trying to postpone improvements. One factor in this debate is whether customers should bear all the costs of improvements. Through price controls Mr Byatt can limit the costs passed on, in which case water company profits would suffer and shareholders would bear some of the cost. But Mr Byatt also has a statutory duty to ensure water companies can finance capital investments - if he squeezes prices too tight the companies could exercise their right to complain to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The government will be watching the debate closely. Ministers are sensitive to the furore about water bills, but the shape of public opinion is far from clear cut. All 10 regional water companies in England and Wales have conducted a survey of their customers to enable Mr Byatt to assess whether they are prepared to pay more for quality. Three of them, Anglian, Wessex and Southern, have received the answer yes. But even if a consensus emerges for holding down costs the government will have to weigh the wider implications of seeking to renegotiate the EC directives. Mr Byatt, who is urging them to do just that, says the UK is not the only country with these concerns. 'I sense an increasing interest in costs in other parts of Europe,' he says. Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, said yesterday he wanted to see 'whether other countries are coming to the same conclusion.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Chilean Government has indicated that it is  fully prepared to begin a "new era" of relations with Bolivia by  evaluating positively Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de  Lozada's most recent remarks about not tying any future step  toward the resumption of diplomatic relations to the beginning  of talks on Bolivia's lack of a sea outlet.    It has been explained, however, that the positive reaction  of  the Chilean Government does not imply that diplomatic relations  will be resumed immediately.    Chilean politicians stated that Sanchez de Lozada's  statement  was "very positive" and praised the president's modern and  daring approach.    Both government and political circles, however, agree that  the remarks of the Bolivian president should be taken prudently  bearing in mind that there are people in Bolivia whose position  toward Chile and what they call "Bolivia's landlocked situation"  is very hard and inflexible. [passage omitted]    Foreign Relations Under Secretary Rodrigo Diaz Albonico  said:  "We were very happy to hear what Bolivian President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Lozada had to say."    Jorge Pizarro, speaker for the foreign relations committee  of  the Chamber of Deputies, believes that Sanchez de Lozada's  remarks "are extraordinarily positive and reflect that the  Bolivian president has a modern and daring approach to what  relations between the states should be as far as the process of  integration is concerned, in order to further the social and  economic development of our peoples."    Experts in Bolivian-Chilean relations believe that rather  than a change in Bolivia's foreign policy, there is a new and  promising approach, confirmed by the fact the Sanchez de Lozada  attended the Rio Group presidential summit in Santiago last year.    "After what Sanchez de Lozada said, it is assumed that this  so-called `new approach' will lead Bolivia to begin talks aimed  at reestablishing diplomatic relations in the not too distant  future," the experts said.    Despite the remarks of the Bolivian president, the sources  are not sure whether Bolivia's strategy is to resume relations  and immediately tackle the sea outlet issue or to deal with both  issues simultaneously.    Chile does not acknowledge any pending issues between the  two  countries on the grounds that there are treaties in effect,  especially the 1904 treaty, which establish the current border  between the two countries. Thus, Chile did not accept any  conditions when the resumption of ties was proposed in the past.    The Foreign Ministry under secretary pointed out that the  Bolivian president used the expression "new era" which is the  same one Diaz Albonico used when he went to La Paz last year.  The under secretary said that this was highly significant.    As to Bolivia's new willingness to approach the resumption  of  diplomatic ties without first tackling its so-called "landlocked  situation," Albonico said that Sanchez de Lozada's words should  be studied carefully.    He added, however, that the remarks of the Bolivian  president  augur a change in the political relations between the two  countries, that may free them from past problems.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Sights set on a wider world: The imperatives guiding America's hesitant foreign policy At 11.30 this morning, New York time, Bill Clinton will become the 10th US president to take the rostrum in the UN General Assembly. Like his predecessors, he will use the occasion to explain his administration's policies to the world but, even more, his words will be aimed at public opinion within the US. The US has made abundant use of the UN as an instrument of its foreign policy in recent years, and the Clinton administration is committed to the UN ideologically in a way that its Republican predecessors were not. Yet at the same time the UN is suffering an acute financial crisis, caused in large part by the fact that the US is falling further and further behind with its contributions. For the fiscal year that starts this Friday, the Clinton administration requested funding based on the UN budget as it stood last January, since when UN peacekeeping commitments have expanded dramatically. Congress, however, has cut the appropriation by 5 per cent. Severely embarrassed by this, the US delegation is hoping today's speech will mark the start of an intensive lobbying effort to get Congress to take the UN more seriously. But any such effort will have to be part of a much broader campaign to explain the connection between the US's foreign policy commitments and the interests of individual US citizens. The speech comes as the climax of a series given by Mr Clinton's senior foreign policy advisers last week, in which they showed themselves well aware of the need for such a campaign. On Monday the secretary of state, Warren Christopher, kicked off with a speech devoted mainly to the Middle East, seeking to exploit the remarkable windfall of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement which had dropped on to the White House lawn a week earlier. He was followed on Tuesday by Tony Lake, the national security adviser, who attempted a broader definition of the administration's goals, stressing that cold war 'containment' of communism had now been replaced by 'enlargement' of the 'community of market democracies'. Finally on Thursday Madeleine Albright, ambassador to the UN and a cabinet member, sought to reassure an audience at the US National War College that future UN peacekeeping or 'peacemaking' operations would be subject to strict criteria, and that the president was still prepared to use US forces unilaterally when necessary 'to protect America and Americans'. The common thread running through these speeches was an argument on two fronts. All three speakers showed themselves acutely aware that their most articulate critics at the moment are not isolationists but foreign policy specialists, mostly associated with previous Republican administrations. These people fully accept that the US retains important interests abroad, but worry that Mr Clinton is jeopardising those interests by subordinating his freedom of action to multilateral structures, the most important being Nato and the UN. Bosnia is at the centre of the argument. Differences over Bosnia have put Nato under considerable strain, as any European diplomat will tell you. But not enough strain to satisfy William Safire, the former Nixon speechwriter turned New York Times columnist, who thinks Mr Clinton should have reminded Europeans 'that rejection of American leadership on Bosnia has consequences for Nato'. The UN comes in for even more stick. Among the factors inhibiting US policy on Bosnia have been the fear of Russian or Chinese vetoes in the Security Council, and the presence of UN forces on the ground which are engaged in a humanitarian mission but unable (or unwilling) to halt military operations and genocidal 'ethnic cleansing'. The final straw for many commentators came in early August when the UN secretary-general, Boutros Boutros Ghali, appeared to claim a right of veto over air strikes which Nato, under strong US pressure, had at last agreed to threaten. Such criticisms are echoed by some career diplomats within the state department, and they have clearly got under the administration's skin. Last week's speeches were notably defensive about 'multilateralism', and designed to rebut any accusation of wimpishness. (Ms Albright recalled, for instance, that in June the president ordered a unilateral attack on Baghdad in response to Iraq's attempt on the life of his predecessor.) But they were also a clarion call to all who favour an active foreign policy, seeking to rally them under the banner of internationalism. The argument between unilateralists and multilateralists, Mr Lake suggested, is really a false quarrel, or at most a dispute about tactics. Both sides agreed that the US had important interests abroad, he said, and in its defence of them it should be pragmatic about the choice of unilateral or multilateral instruments. But, he went on, 'there is a more fundamental foreign policy challenge brewing . . . over whether we will be significantly engaged abroad at all'. Mr Clinton likes to compare the present period of international relations with that which followed 1945, when his Democratic predecessor, Harry S Truman, responded to an entirely new strategic context by forging a fresh set of alliances and multilateral institutions under US leadership. To do so he had to overcome resistance from both Democrats and Republicans who wanted to keep the US free from peacetime 'entanglements', as it had traditionally been. 'The internationalists,' recalled Mr Lake, 'won those debates, in part because they could point to a unitary threat to America's interests and because the nation was entering a period of economic security. Today's supporters of engagement abroad have neither of those advantages. The threats and opportunities are diffuse, and our people are deeply anxious about their economic fate.' The irony is, of course, that this public mood was one of the main factors that brought Mr Clinton to power in the first place. The most widely echoed criticism of George Bush was that he appeared obsessed with foreign affairs and neglected the economy, while Mr Clinton's campaign workers constantly reminded themselves that the issue which mattered was 'the economy, stupid'  -and the third candidate, Mr Ross Perot, who played a significant role in Mr Bush's defeat, was even more outspoken in urging that the time had come for America to put its own interests first. Mr Clinton himself was never an isolationist. He never suggested that foreign policy was unimportant, or that the US should abandon its overseas commitments. Rather his theme was that domestic economic problems now could and should be given top priority, and that in a complex and interdependent world foreign policy could no longer be treated as a specialist's topic. Domestic and foreign, geopolitical and economic issues: all were now inextricably intertwined, and what was needed was an integrated approach in which foreign policy would take its place as part of an overall strategy for guaranteeing the security of present and future generations of Americans. Put like that, the proposition is hard to dispute, and Mr Clinton the 'policy wonk', with his formidable grasp of detail across a broad range of issues, was well placed to put this approach into practice. He is described, by a foreign ambassador who has been able to observe him at close quarters, as 'one of the most intelligent current political leaders' on the world stage; and he has brought with him into government a formidable array of intellectuals who have been honing their brains and refining their ideas in think-tanks and universities during the long years of opposition. The effort to rethink issues and produce coherent strategies for new situations is real, and impressive. Great trouble has been taken to co-ordinate the thinking and activities of different departments, and the turf battles which produced so much incoherence in both the Carter and Reagan administrations (less so under Mr Bush) have up to now been largely avoided. Mr Gordon Adams, for instance, at the Office of Management and Budget, makes no distinction between the budgets for defence, energy, peacekeeping (which comes under the state department), or the Agency for International Development. To him this is all money spent on security. The 'bottom-up review' of US defence needs, published by defence secretary Les Aspin on September 1, is generally regarded as rather conservative but is also given credit for being intellectually honest - 'as our defence reviews never are', in the words of one rueful British observer. That is to say, it is genuinely 'bottom-up', in the sense that it first defines the tasks and then argues from them to the force levels required, rather than being designed to justify a particular level of expenditure. Whether the money to sustain those force levels will actually be found, especially when the full costs of the proposed healthcare reform are recognised, is another matter, on which Mr Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, has serious doubts. What no one disputes is that this is a serious administration which takes foreign policy seriously. A comment heard repeatedly in Washington earlier this month was that it performs well when working to a deadline. It set itself to produce a package of aid for reform in Russia before the Clinton-Yeltsin summit in April; to articulate a China policy before June 3, when China's most favoured nation status had to be renewed by Congress; to produce a broader Asian policy; and a negotiating strategy for the Uruguay Round, before the Tokyo summit. It has now got its act together on the North American Free Trade Agreement - although many fear this will prove to be too late, since Mr Perot and the labour unions have achieved such a grip on public opinion in the meantime. And the hope is that by January 10, when Mr Clinton comes to Europe for a Nato summit convened by himself, it will also have produced a clear blueprint for the future of the Atlantic alliance. This poses a real dilemma. It is widely argued in Washington that Nato will lose its relevance unless it is seen to extend security eastwards into central Europe; yet many fear that to enlarge Nato's membership would mean giving unfulfillable guarantees to unstable new democracies, and in the process offer a propaganda boon to paranoid anti-western forces in Russia. One senior administration official admitted to me, however, that 'what really matters is Bosnia'. If by January 10 Nato was 'there, and doing something', the summit would be a success. But if 'Sarajevo has gone down the tubes', it would be a failure. No doubt it will depend on some other unforeseeable events, too, such as the outcome of the power struggle in Russia. The weakness of the administration's 'think-tank' approach to policy-making is, precisely, that it does not facilitate quick or decisive reactions to uexpected events. A problem like Bosnia, and perhaps still less Russia, cannot be relied on to sit still while six committees of brilliant political scientists hammer out a policy statement, writing incisive minutes in the margins of each other's drafts; or while the president conducts a thoughtful and well-informed debate with himself in the presence of his advisers, or sometimes of astonished journalists. Mr Clinton is devoting a great deal of his time to foreign policy - more than he likes to admit. The week before last, for instance, he telephoned almost every EC head of government to urge on them the importance of preserving the Blair House agreement on agriculture if the Uruguay Round was not to be scuppered. He is as aware as anyone that America's economic interests and national security are closely tied to the maintenance of an open trading system and a free and orderly world. But, as Mr Lake recognised, it is much harder for him to persuade the American public that this requires a big investment of American resources than it was for Harry Truman to do the same at the start of the cold war. In today's speech Mr Clinton has to find a way of making the point without seeming to betray his campaign promise to put domestic affairs first.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Observer: Sound practice Any banker who underestimates the importance of luck in making sound lending decisions should ponder why Sumitomo Bank's name has not figured in the problems of Olympia &amp; York. Sumitomo was among the Japanese institutions targeted by Paul Reichmann in 1989 as lead managers for a proposed Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan to O&amp;Y. Sumitomo even ordered kosher meals in preparation for Reichmann's visit to Tokyo to discuss its involvement. However, at the last minute, Reichmann phoned to say that he had to stay in Toronto to care for his ailing mother. The trip never materialised and, to this day, Sumitomo has no exposure to O&amp;Y. Alas, some other Japanese banks, notably Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Tokai, were not so fortunate.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Arts: Strength depends on the writing - Television We were, it seemed, slipping into another long summer of television tedium, with countless repeats and second eleven documentaries, relieved only by sport. Once again it looked as though the unpleasant duty of the television critic was to remind the broadcasters that even if top ratings do decline by about three million between February and May, top-rated programmes such as Coronation Street still attract 17m viewers even on warm June evenings. Thus, although people are beginning to get back into their gardens, there is still a vast audience for television, and no excuse for serving up warmed-over bubble and squeak. But the complaint would be absurd after a weekend which brought the eighth episode in Edgar Reitz's Second Heimat: A New Generation from BBC2, Lynda La Plante's Comics from Channel 4, and the beginning of Ken Russell's Lady Chatterley on BBC1. Of course none of the three was beyond criticism, but when a single category of programming shows such ambition, variety and achievement in such a short period it would be churlish to issue yet another blanket condemnation of the medium. Previous generations would surely think it astonishingly ungrateful to complain when such diverse entertainment is available in every British home. Predictably enough, the least satisfactory of these three dramas was the one which had attracted most fuss and hype prior to transmission: Lady Chatterley (not, you notice, 'Lady Chatterley's Lover' because Russell has used all three of DH Lawrence's versions of the story for his adaptation and they all had different titles). Fashion now insists that we should dismiss the notorious novel as a poor bit of work, but that is not why lack of satisfaction with the television version was predictable. Actually, although the book is not among Lawrence's best, it is still streets ahead of most of the stuff which becomes so famous these days via Booker and Whitbread and all the other publicity schemes. The reason for doubt was that in the past 30 years Russell never seems to have recaptured the flair that he brought to his Monitor programmes about Delius, Elgar and others at the BBC in the early 1960s. Since then he has been at his best when going wildly over the top, but it seemed unlikely the BBC would tolerate this in an adaptation which was always going to be touchy. Sure enough, we find neither the lyricism of Song Of Summer nor the outrageousness of The Devils in Lady Chatterley. There are moments of Russelliana: the black horse sequence with the naked soldiers in garlands of flowers and Connie imagining Clifford drowning; and when Connie's father - played by Russell who now seems to act, though not terribly well, in all his own films - tells her 'Yer wanna get yer axle greased, know what I mean?' But they are too few and far between, and while Russell doubtless relished the knowing anachronism of the above phrase, he did rather ruin the effect by having Clifford say 'There's something much stronger than sex between you and I'. It seems unlikely that an Edwardian baronet would make that sort of howler with a personal pronoun. If Russell had simply stuck to extremes and given us a Marvel Comics version of the story that would have been tolerable, but this Lady Chatterley feels more like one of those desperately respectful Classic Comics adaptations of Homer or Shakespeare. Too often there is the same awkwardness that you used to feel in those 'Ho, varlet]' movies from Hollywood; it is virtually impossible to suspend disbelief. Worse, Russell is now lazy and relies too much on cliches. Not only does he have Joely Richardson musingly fingering the surface of a nude in an oil painting, he also has her hugging an oak tree. Both actions are as familiar on screen yet as untrue to life as those people in films who keep saying 'Hallo? Hallo?' to a dialling tone. Thank goodness Joely Richardson (who is so beautiful undressed that it seems a pity she has to do any scenes clothed) and James Wilby, who plays Clifford, are as good as they are at their jobs. Perhaps the same can be said of Sean Bean who plays Mellors, but on that, judgment will have to be reserved. Even though Channel 4 had transmitted only the first half of Comics at the time of writing, it seems clear that this is the best television drama yet from Lynda La Plante. It has the same narrative drive as Prime Suspect and the same attention to arcane detail as we have come to expect from all her work, but, mercifully, none of the finger wagging lectures on feminism. True, the production is powerfully enhanced by the direction of Diarmuid Lawrence who manages to make locations in London's West End look so glamorous and dramatic that you begin to wonder whether they are brilliantly constructed sets. In the end, however, the strength depends upon the writing. La Plante has plaited together three strands with great skill: stand-up comedy, a murder story, and the private life of her central character, American comedian Johnny Lazar. Any one of these might make a strong drama but the combination is far more impressive. At the halfway stage there were some, presumably deliberately, baffling components - was it Lazar's mother who walked into the sea with a little girl to commit murder and suicide at the beginning? Did Lazar's flashback of the street murder really prove that Delroy was the killer and did Lazar perjure himself and swear the murderer was white because his adoptive parents were black . . . or what? It served merely to ensure that one returned the next day. Comics was an original contemporary drama in two parts written expressly for television. Lady Chatterley is a four-part adaptation of a 1928 novel. The Second Heimat: A New Generation is a 13-part serial, set in Munich in the 1960s and written, produced and directed by Edgar Reitz. Saturday brought Episode 8 and yet more proof, if any were needed, that this is just as much a television masterpiece as Reitz's original Heimat. It is conceivable that a viewer coming fresh to the work this week could have found it slow, sometimes inconsequential, and occasionally hard to understand. But for those of us who dodge dinner parties and tell lies to be sure to catch every word, each episode adds to the sum of our knowledge and increases our involvement. Regulars will have been full of trepidation this week when Hermann agreed to marry Schnusschen, however sweet and seductive she may be. We know that Clarissa, the brilliant cellist (and actress Salome Kammer really is a superb musician) is Hermann's soulmate, probably for life. When Clarissa arrived at the wedding reception, regular viewers brought to the drama a major contribution; we were as poignantly aware of how these two would be feeling as if they were our own lifelong acquaintances. Sounds like any soap fan? So be it, but you rarely find a soap opera with characters as authentic and funny as Hermann's aunts who are always keen to know the location of the nearest lavatory, or as persuasively real as Juan who this week attempted to shoot himself through the heart with a rifle. With drama as strong as this at weekends and sport as good as the First Test and Nigel Mansell's IndyCar 93 during the week - not to mention Wimbledon rapidly growing on the horizon - we may be in for a rather pleasant summer season.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Report on the Execution of Zhejiang's 1993 </F> Budget and the Draft 1994 Budget" by Weng Lihua, director of the  Zhejiang Provincial Financial Department at the Second Session  of the Eighth Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress on 26  February 1994.]    1. The Execution of the 1993 Budget    In 1993, Zhejiang was able to maintain its good momentum of  having a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth as a  result of the efforts made by governments at all levels and all  departments in following through with the instructions in  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks and the guidelines laid  down by the 14th party congress, in implementing all measures  drawn up by the party Central Committee and the State Council  for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, in  carrying out the resolution of the first session of the eighth  provincial people's congress about the report of the budget and  final account, in continuing with the mental emancipation, in  increasing the intensity of reform, and in accelerating economic  growth.    On this basis, Zhejiang's revenue grew quite rapidly, and  the  financial needs of economic construction and other development  projects were basically ensured.    Zhejiang's 1993 budgetary revenue authorized by the first  session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 13  billion yuan; but the actual amount received was 28 percent  above target, reaching 16.665 billion yuan. That was 38.6  percent higher than that of the preceding year. The revenue  included business taxes of 16.411 billion yuan, which was 38.7  percent above target and 50.6 percent higher than that a year  before.    Moreover, Zhejiang also fulfilled the quota of selling 1.223  billion yuan of treasury bonds.    While the 1993 spending budget approved by the first session  of the eighth provincial people's congress was 10.096 billion  yuan, the province actually spent 12.493 billion yuan, or 23.7  percent more than the approved budget and 26.8 percent higher  than the 1992 budget. The spending included 685 million yuan  for capital construction projects--29.3 percent higher than the  budget and 26.8 percent higher than that a year before; 1.065  billion yuan for enterprises to tap potential and upgrade  technology--63.9 percent higher than the budget and 70.2 percent  higher than the 1992 budget; 1.221 billion yuan for supporting  agricultural production and for operating expenses for  agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy projects--24.3  percent higher than the budget and 32.4 percent higher than that  of a year ago; and 3.479 billion yuan for the operating expenses  for cultural, educational, and health projects--17.3 percent  higher than the budget and 25.2 percent higher than the 1992  spending. In this last category, educational operating expenses  were 2.043 billion yuan, or 28.9 percent higher than that of a  year ago. Meanwhile, the expenditure for science and technology  was 221 million yuan--2.3 percent higher than the budget and  12.3 percent higher than that a year ago; 1.484 billion yuan for  administrative expenses--30.2 percent higher than the budget and  37.5 percent higher than that a year ago; and 571 million yuan  for law enforcement--24.1 percent higher than the budget and  32.2 percent more than that a year ago.    The provincial treasury's 1933 revenue authorized by the  first session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 650  million yuan, but the actual income amount was 902 million yuan,  or 38.8 percent higher than the authorized amount and 59 percent  higher than that a year ago. The provincial treasury's 1993  expenditure authorized by the first session of the eighth  provincial people's congress was 2.46 billion yuan, but the  amount actually spent was 2.64 billion yuan, or 7.2 percent  higher than the budget and 12.3 percent higher than the  expenditure a year ago.    It is expected that Zhejiang's revenue and expenditure in  1993 could be balanced with a little surplus. This is based on  the deduction of 4.85 billion yuan--a sum Zhejiang had to  deliver to the central treasury (including the part of export  tax refunds that had to be delivered to the central  government)-- from the amount of revenue as well as the special  subsidies of 1.03 billion yuan from the central authorities.    There were many reasons why the province's revenues and  expenditures in 1993 rose so fast and exceeded the budgeted  figures by so large a margin. On the revenue side, first, it  was because the provincial economy, after achieving a high  growth rate in the preceding year, continued its fast momentum,  thereby generating more tax revenues from the production and  circulation sectors. The province's gross domestic product  [GDP] is expected to reach 164.5 billion yuan, a 25-percent  increase over the previous year. The added value of industrial  output is expected to reach 87 billion yuan, a 40-percent  increase. Sales revenues of industrial enterprises at and above  the township level that maintain independent accounting rose 52  percent. Total retail sales reached 75.87 billion yuan, up 33.2  percent. Industrial and commercial tax revenues reached 16.411  billion yuan, a 50.6-percent increase. Of the total, 13.169  billion yuan was from three types of industrial and commercial  tax, up 59.4 percent. Second, it was because since the second  half of 1993 departments at all levels in the province have  seriously implemented the guidelines of Central Document No. 6.  They reduced fiscal deficits; corrected unauthorized exemption  and reduction of taxes, energy, transport construction, and  budget regulatory funds; halted the approval of temporary  exemption and reduction of taxes; and stopped loopholes that  caused revenue losses. As a result, revenues had increased for  the entire year. Third, it was because financial and tax  departments enforced strict management of tax collection,  strengthened tax auditing, sternly dealt with illegal acts of  evading taxes and refusing to pay taxes by fraudulent means, and  strengthened collection and management of taxes from individual  businesses. In 1993, the province collected 2.23 billion yuan  of taxes from individual businesses, a 39.5- percent increase.  On the expenditure side, it was mainly because of factors  closely related to policy implementation, such as increase in  wages and cost of living allowances for workers following the  lifting of controls on grain price, and the rapid increase of  personnel expenditures. The province's administrative budget  alone was 1.484 billion yuan, an increase of 0.41 billion yuan  or 37.5 percent. In addition, various localities also tried  their best to spend more in support of agricultural, scientific  and technological, and educational development and in support of  enterprise technological transformation and urban  infrastructural construction. According to statistics, the  province's budgetary expenditures on education last year reached  2.269 billion yuan (including education funds and urban  education surcharges), an increase of 0.549 billion, up 31.9  percent, faster than the increase in general budgetary  expenditure during the same period. Enterprises' expenditure in  tapping potentials and technological transformation grew 0.439  billion yuan, or 70.2 percent, over the previous year.    The province's 1993 revenues and expenditures budget was  generally well implemented. On the revenue side, there were no  violations discovered, such as collecting taxes excessively or  "eating next year's food." On the expenditure side, various  localities gave priority to key projects and emphasized overall  balance, thereby pushing forward economic construction and  social undertakings. Localities used increased revenues mainly  to reduce fiscal deficits, increase productive expenditures,  develop various undertakings, and cover necessary personnel  expenditures.    In the past year, under the leadership of the local party  committee and government, departments at all levels in the  province deepened reform, opened up wider to the outside world,  always gave priority to the work of accelerating economic  development, worked hard to expand financial resources, and  stepped up efforts to increase revenue and reduce expenditures.  They did a tremendous amount of work to accomplish the  province's budgetary goal and achieve balance between revenues  and expenditures.    (1) Earnestly implementing the guidelines of Central  Document No. 6 and strictly enforcing the "three covenants" to  rectify financial and taxation orders.Since the second half  of 1993, in accordance with the guidelines of Central Document  No. 6 requiring local authorities not to create deficits in  local budgets, various localities have achieved unity in  thinking and understanding and produced remarkable results in  overcoming and rectifying the erroneous idea that "deficits are  harmless" and in adopting firm measures to increase revenues and  reduce general fiscal expenditures. In the process of reducing  fiscal deficits, people's congress standing committees at all  levels strengthened supervision and guidance and performed a  tremendous amount of work. They earnestly launched inspection  of unauthorized exemptions and reductions of taxes, abolished  certain preferential policies locally formulated in violation of  rules, and corrected the erroneous practice of some localities  that wailfully exempted or reduced the energy and transport  construction funds and budget regulatory funds. They halted the  approval of temporary exemption and reduction of taxes. As a  result, the province's financial and taxation order moved  further in the right direction.  (2) Meticulously organizing forces to vigorously implement  measures to push forward reform of the financial, taxation, and  accounting systems. Since the beginning of last year,  various localities have given priority to implementing the  general rules and new financial and accounting systems for  various industries. As time was short and the task onerous,  departments at all levels assumed responsibility for themselves  and cooperated with each other to carry out in a timely fashion  the training of financial and taxation personnel in their own  departments and in enterprises. They earnestly brought about the  transition from the old accounting system to the new one and the  change of books. This has ensured the smooth implementation of  measures for reforming enterprises' accounting system.  Regarding the implementation of the "Regulations on  Transforming the Management Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial  Enterprises," (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations") and  the "Implementing Measures" adopted by the province, various  localities proceeded from reality and reformed the various  financial regulations and rules incompatible with the  "Regulations," truthfully delegating the financial  decisionmaking power to enterprises as mandated by the  "Regulations." To hold back the strong momentum in the rapid  rise of budgets for public medical service, the province  reformed the medical service system last year to reduce waste in  public medical service. On the question of pushing forward  financial and taxation system reform, first, we earnestly  carried out experiments in financial reform of the tax-revenue  sharing system. Acting in accordance with the uniform planning  of the state and province, localities actively explored and  accumulated experiences for the formal implementation of the  tax- revenue sharing financial system. Second, since the second  half of 1993, under the leadership of the local party committee  and government, departments at all levels actively carried out  preparatory work for reform in five major fields. They  earnestly studied, analyzed, and measured the financial and tax  reform and its impact on the economy, and they carried out  propaganda and training for implementing the new tax system.  Third, pursuant to the guidelines of the State Council  "Decision on Implementing the Tax- Revenue-Sharing Financial  Management System" and the principle of "standardization,  convenience, and fairness" forwarded by the provincial  government and after careful study and repeated measurement, a  program for implementing the tax-revenue-sharing financial  system at the city, prefectural, and county levels has been  formulated.    Moreover, localities have also made useful explorations,  and scored heartening progress, in the reform of the  revenue-sharing, wage, shareholding, housing, and other systems.  (3) Adopt positive measures to promote all-round  development in the economy and endeavors in all other  fields. In 1993, localities earnestly implemented relevant  state policies and measures by providing vigorous support to  development of new and high technologies and the construction of  infrastructure facilities and basic industries. We encouraged  the introduction of investment and advanced technologies from  abroad, improved management of World Bank-funded projects and  loans, and promoted the development of an open economy. We  raised funds to increase agricultural input; promoted a  high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture;  accelerated the development of a network of collectivized  services in rural areas; supported the development of village  and township enterprises; and offered assistance to economic  development in mountainous, island, and other poverty-ridden  areas. In 1993, the province spent 840 million yuan to support  agricultural production, up 39.9 percent over the previous year.  Continued efforts were made to implement the policy designed to  invigorate and improve the operations of state-owned large and  medium enterprises. State-owned industrial enterprises covered  by the budget set aside 581 million yuan from their sales income  as technology development, supplementary working, and additional  appreciation funds, up 137.1 percent over the previous year.  Meanwhile, we tried every possible way to raise funds for  enterprise technical upgrades. The provincial treasury raised  210 million yuan to help fund key technical upgrade  projects--including technical upgrading of silk mills and select  village and township enterprises-- during the Eighth Five-Year  Plan period [1991-96]. With focus on implementing the two sets  of rules [Business Accounting Standards and General Rules of  Financial Affairs for Enterprises] and the "Regulations," we  helped enterprises upgrade internal management, implement  measures aimed at making up deficits and increasing revenues,  and improve economic efficiency. We continued to implement the  policy and measures of "revitalizing the province by relying on  science and technology and education," implemented reform of the  educational and scientific and technological management systems,  and expanded funding sources. More support was given to the  development of science and technology, culture, education,  public health, and other endeavors; expenditures on these  endeavors covered in the 1993 provincial budget alone amounted  to 3.927 million yuan, up 820 million, or 26.2 percent, over the  previous year.  (4) Improving tax collection, strictly controlling  spending, and implementing well work related to increasing  revenue and reducing spending. Localities stepped up  auditing tax collection in an effort to improve tax collection  and organize revenues well. Most of the cities and counties set  up tax auditing forces and stepped up coordination among  financial, taxation, public security, industrial and commercial  administration, and judicial departments, and cracked down hard  on illegal acts, such as evading or refusing to pay taxes.  While paying close attention to collecting taxes from principal  sources of tax revenues and major tax payers, the province  conducted special tax auditing among self-employed industrial  and commercial entities and privately run enterprises,  recovering an additional 44.6 million in taxes. We stepped up  tax collection among foreign-funded enterprises and launched a  vigorous drive against tax evasion. In 1993, the province  collected 819 million yuan in industrial and commercial  consolidated taxes, up 557 million yuan, or 2.25 times, over  1992. We improved invoice administration and cracked down on  such illegal acts as illegal printing, counterfeiting, or sale  and issuance of fake invoices. To exercise strict control over  expenditures, localities improved expenditure administration and  paid special attention to bringing administrative outlay and  institutional purchase under control. A quota system that was  widely introduced in regard to administrative outlay was  effective in encouraging the departments and units to manage  their finances well and produced fairly good results.  Departments at all levels also implemented effective measures  to cut down on meetings and reduce meeting-related spending,  postal and telecommunications expenditures, and office equipment  purchases.    (5) Enforcing financial and economic discipline and  strengthening supervision and inspection of finance and  taxation. In accordance with the State Council's unified  arrangements, various localities earnestly carried out a general  checkup on taxation and finance. By the end of last December,  the province had uncovered 571 million yuan in  discipline-violation monies, traced 424 million yuan in payable  taxes, and recovered 356 million yuan in fiscal revenues. We  also investigated and dealt with a number of serious and major  cases; further strengthened state-owned property management;  appraised fixed assets and circulating funds in administrative  undertakings and units; and further strengthened supervision  over the assessment and title-registration of state-owned  property in Sino-foreign joint ventures, contractual joint  ventures, and joint-stock enterprises, thus making important  contributions to preventing the drain of state-owned property.  We paid further attention to developing the undertakings of  registered accountants and strengthened the development and  administration of registered accountants and accounting firms.  By the end of 1993, 129 accounting firms with a total of 1,220  registered accountants had been set up across the province. We  did earnest work in clearing illegal fees, particularly in  exposing illegal-fee problems that drew strong criticisms from  the masses. By the end of 1993, the province had announced the  abolition of a number of fees that were inconsistent with  stipulations by the central and provincial governments and  sorted out and refunded unreasonably collected fees amounting to  10.039 million yuan.    Of course, some problems that brook no ignorance remained in  our work. First, there was inadequate awareness of the need to  keep expenditures within the limits of income, act according to  our capability, and strike an overall balance. Some cities and  counties were very tight in disposing finances because their  income growth had failed to keep up with growing expenditures.  Second, there were a softening of budgetary restraint and lack  of effective control over spending, with some departments and  units spending money without much care or regard to cost  effectiveness, and even frequently engaging in extravagance and  waste. Individual localities still saw the diversion of funds  for aiding the poor to other purposes. Third, some enterprises  remained wanting in economic efficiency. By the end of 1993,  398 state-owned industrial enterprises covered by the budget  suffered losses totaling 450 million yuan and had net accounts  receivable topping 5.25 billion yuan. Fourth, the methods of  tax collection and administration still fell behind the needs of  developing circumstances despite some improvement, leading to  frequent occurrences of law violations such as tax evasion,  violent tax refusal, and tax fraud. All these problems call for  our great attention and earnest improvements in future work.  <H5>  2. Draft Fiscal Budget for 1994 </H5>   The year 1994 is important for continuously maintaining the  favorable momentum of economic development as well as a crucial  one for advancing the establishment of a socialist market  economic system. Determined in accordance with the economic  development strategy determined by the provincial party  committee and government and the focus of this year's provincial  economic work and in conjunction with the overall requirement of  fiscal reform, the guiding ideology for the provincial budgetary  arrangements for 1994 is:Implement in depth the guidelines  of the CPC 14th National Congress and the decision of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on issues  concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic  system; implement the guidelines of the ninth provincial party  congress; earnestly and properly carry out financial and  taxation reform; actively support all other reforms; adhere to  the principle of keeping expenditures within the limits of  income, acting according to our capability, and striking an  overall balance; strengthen fiscal management; ensure that local  finances will not run into the red; and work hard to foster  finances and increase fiscal revenues to support economic  construction and the development of various social  undertakings.    According to the guiding principle set by the Zhejiang  provincial authorities for this year's budget preparations and  the province's economic planning targets, and based on the  regulations governing the tax revenue sharing system, the  province's fixed financial revenue for 1994 is projected at 8.02  billion yuan, a 10.1-percent increase over the previous year  (calculated using similar items [tong kou jing, 0681 0656 1777];  same for the following). The budgets of major revenues are: (1)  industrial and commercial tax revenues (including the 25-percent  value-added taxes [VAT]) are set at 6.57 billion yuan, up 8.3  percent from the year before; (2) agricultural tax revenues are  set at 570 million yuan (including taxes and other revenues from  special agricultural products), a 12.1-increase percent over the  previous year; (3) enterprise income taxes are set at 1.21  billion yuan, same as the previous year; (4) revenue of energy  and transportation funds is set at 30 million yuan, 67.4 percent  less than the previous year; (5) revenue of budget regulation  funds is set at 36 million yuan, 71.7 percent less than the  previous year; (6) revenue of pollution fighting fees is set at  120 million yuan, a 2.2-percent increase over the year before;  (7) revenue of extra educational fees is set at 310 million  yuan, up 12.5 percent from the year before; and (8) subsidies to  cover state-owned enterprises' losses is set at 1.1 billion  yuan, 25.4 percent less than the previous year. The province's  fixed financial revenue for 1994 is projected at 8.02 billion  yuan. Including the projected 5.2 billion yuan (excluding the  5.06 billion yuan that is to be submitted to the central  authorities according to the system) of tax revenue return from  the central authorities and of the central authorities'  subsidies for special projects, which is computed based on the  province's 1993 revenue, the province's usable funds for 1994 is  projected at 13.22 billion yuan.    According to the principle that no deficits are allowed to  be  included in local budgets, and to ensure that there will be  sufficient funds for the province's 1994 expenditures, we plan  to set the province's 1994 expenditure at 13.22 billion yuan, a  5.9- percent increase over the previous year (calculated using  similar items; same for the following). The budgets for major  expenditures are: (1) expenditure for capital construction is  set at 620 million yuan, 9.1 percent less than the year before;  (2) expenditure for tapping enterprises' potentials and for  their technological transformation is set at 790 million yuan,  down 25.6 percent from the previous year; (3) expenditure for  science and technological development is set at 240 million  yuan, up 9.7 percent from the year before; (4) expenditure for  agricultural development is set at 1.25 billion yuan, a  9.7-percent increase from the year before, of which 830 million  yuan is for supporting agricultural production, or 10 percent  higher than the previous year; (5) expenditure for cultural,  educational, and public health purposes is set at 4 billion  yuan, 14.9 percent higher than the year before, of which 2.361  billion yuan is for educational purposes, or 15.6 percent higher  than the previous year; (6) administrative and management  expenditure is set at 1.62 billion yuan, up 9.4 percent from the  year before; (7) expenditure for public security, procuratorial,  and judicial work is set at 650 million yuan, 13.5 percent  higher than the year before; (8) expenditure for supporting  development in underdeveloped areas is set at 53 million yuan, a  5.3-percent increase over the previous year; and (9) extra  educational expenditure is set at 250 million yuan, up 12  percent from the year before.    In the draft provincial budget, provincial financial revenue  for 1994 is projected at 450 million yuan, or 2.8 percent less  than the previous year calculating using similar items.  Including the projected 2.37 billion yuan of tax revenue return  from the central authorities, of the central authorities'  subsidies for special projects, and of funds submitted and  transferred from all cities and counties, the usable provincial  funds for 1994 is projected at 2.82 billion yuan. We plan to  set provincial financial expenditure for 1994 at 2.82 billion  yuan, or 7 percent more than the previous year calculating using  similar items.    From the aforementioned budgeted financial revenues and  expenditures, revenues are budgeted in a positive manner,  expenditures are tight, and the revenues and expenditures  budgets are balanced. However, due to various factors, the  province's general financial situation in 1994 will still be  tough and contradictions between the supply and demand of funds  still will be quite prominent. The first reason is that, after  the tax revenue sharing system is implemented, 75 percent of VAT  and all consumption taxes will be submitted to the central  authorities; in addition, we have to gradually increase the  amount to be submitted, as required by the old system. The  second reason concerns expenditures. We not only have to deal  with the increased expenditures for wage adjustment, for  subsidies to cover the differences resulting from the  readjustments of coal and electricity prices, and for  subsidizing housing reform, which are all a result of new  policies adopted last year, there also will be many increased  expenditures due to new policies to be implemented this year.  Therefore, contradictions between revenue and expenditure will  be even more acute this year and it will be more difficult to  maintain a balance    In addition, since this is the first  year to carry out new financial and taxation system, some  concrete situations and problems need to be further investigated  and studied. In terms of various policies and measures that  have been or will be introduced, a process of transition and  adaptation is needed for their actual operation. The financial  and taxation work as a whole will face even more arduous tasks  because new situations and problems will keep cropping up. Of  course, we should also understand that there are quite a few  favorable conditions. Our economic development, reform, and  opening up are facing rare opportunities. First, since we have  gradually carried out the central authorities' various measures  concerning macroeconomic control, we have alleviated the  contradiction between overall demand and supply and created even  more favorable conditions for economic development. Second,  with the progress of the financial, taxation, banking,  investment, and foreign trade management systems, a socialist  market economy will be further established and improved. Third,  affected by the growth of investment, agricultural prices, and  wages as well as other factors, market demand will continue a  vigorous momentum. Zhejiang will continue to experience  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and greater  progress in reform, which in turn will provide better conditions  for the financial and taxation work. Therefore, we should  comprehensively and objectively analyze the current situation,  unify thinking, enhance understanding, boost morale, foster  faith, and strive to achieve financial balance.  <H5>  3. The Key Points of the 1994 Financial Work </H5>   To ensure that Zhejiang will have a balanced financial  budget  in 1994, we should further study and carry out the guiding  spirit of the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some  Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market  Economic Structure" and that of the ninth provincial CPC  congress, focus on the establishment of a socialist market  economy and the key points of Zhejiang's 1994 economic work, and  improve financial and taxation reform as well as reform in other  aspects. To meet the need of a socialist market economy, we  should accelerate the change of government functions, promote  the development of economic and other aspects, enhance  enterprises' economic performance, increase profits, and reduce  expenditures.  (1) Further promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  growth in Zhejiang by expanding financial resources and  improving economic policy. Improving the economy and  cultivating financial resources have always been the primary  task of financial and taxation work. We should further stabilize  the farming sector's status as the foundation of the national  economy and carry out policies and measures concerning the  promotion of agricultural production and rural economic  development. We should actively support the establishment of a  grain production risk foundation, grain reserve and control  system, and reserve system for agricultural capital goods. It  is necessary to support the readjustment of agricultural  structure and promote a high-yield, high-quality, and  high-efficiency agriculture. We should work hard to raise  special funds for water conservancy projects and strive to  enhance the economic performance of such funds. Continued  efforts should be made to support economic development in  mountain, island, and poverty-stricken areas. We should further  expand channels for pooling funds and energetically support the  construction of basic industries and infrastructure facilities,  including transportation. It is necessary to support the  construction and development of public utilities and public  affairs undertakings. We should support the development of  scientific and technological and educational undertakings by  increasing capital input. We should help enterprises accelerate  technical renovation, make up deficits and increase surpluses,  strengthen market competition capability, and enhance economic  performance. We should continue to raise funds to support the  provincial government's technical renovation plans for major  projects and the silk industry. We should strengthen the  management of World Bank loans so as to increase their economic  results. We should conscientiously carry out the state's  relevant policies and regulations concerning financial and  taxation matters and provide continued support to the economic  development of various development zones and open cities. We  should provide further support to the reform of the foreign  trade system, strengthen financial supervision of foreign trade  companies and foreign-funded enterprises, and strive to enhance  Zhejiang's export and foreign-exchange earning ability.  Meanwhile, we should take active measures to energetically  support the development of tertiary industry.    (2) We should unify our thinking and effectively  carry out various measures for reforming the financial and  taxation systems.Reform of the financial and taxation  systems is an important aspect in establishing a socialist  market economic structure. We should understand the great  significance of financial and tax reform from an overall and  strategic point of view. We should carry out the reform of the  financial and taxation systems as the central task of this  year's financial and tax work; we should carefully organize this  work, make proper arrangements for it, and conscientiously  perform it. We should earnestly study new situations and  problems arising in the course of reform and particularly study  the possible impact of the financial and tax reform on economic  development. As for problems arising in the process of  replacing the old structure with a new one, we should deal with  different problems in different ways. Problems which fall  within the powers and functions of the provincial government  should be studied and handled promptly and properly by the  provincial government. As for problems that fall within the  central authorities' powers and functions, we should report them  to higher levels to have them solved as soon as possible. We  should vigorously support reform in banking, investment, foreign  exchange, and other fields; support and participate in the  reform of the social security and urban housing systems; and  support the experiment on the establishment of a modern  enterprise system. We should continue to implement in an  all-round way the "Regulations" and the procedures the  provincial government adopted for carrying out the "Regulations."    The plan for the revenue-sharing system for the province,  cities, prefectures, and counties, which was appropriately  revised after being discussed at a provincial economic work  conference and listening to the opinions of various localities,  has been formally issued for implementation. Acting in the  spirit of seeking truth from facts and proceeding from arousing  local governments' initiative in developing the economy and  increasing financial revenues, the provincial government will  earnestly handle the interrelations between the province,  cities, prefectures, and counties to further promote a  coordinated development of the province's economy. The  provincial government will concentrate an appropriate proportion  of the increased financial revenues on certain projects -- this  is an objective requirement for the provincial government to  increase its ability to exercise macroeconomic regulation and  control and to maintain the province's coordinated economic and  social development. Conscientious efforts should be made to  perform ideological work, to promote coordinated development in  various parts of the province, to concentrate on economic  construction, and to make financial revenues steadily increase  with economic development.  (3) We should accelerate the change of functions in  finance and taxation to meet the needs of the market  economy.How to do financial and tax work well under the  socialist market economy is a new task before us. According to  the requirements of the changing situation, we should further  emancipate our minds, change our ideas, and step up our study of  the market economy theory. We should conscientiously explore  and study concepts and methods of managing money matters in the  new situation. The stress of financial and tax work should be  shifted as soon as possible to macroeconomic regulation and  control as well as supervision and management. We should open  up the field of financial investment, develop the negotiable  securities trade, strengthen the management of funds for public  housing, and further strengthen supervision and control over  extra-budgetary funds to prevent the loss of such funds. We  should quickly readjust the economic development strategy  according to the change in the distribution of financial  resources, strive to bring about economic growth, and try to  increase financial revenues for local governments. We should  quickly institute a local tax system and lose no time in  studying the levying and management of taxes on earnings from  the transfer of land leases and real estate and of inheritance  and bequest taxes. We should further strengthen the management  of state-owned assets and set up a social supervision network in  this regard. Continuous efforts should be made to appraise the  fixed assets and circulating funds, define property rights, and  check up on creditor's rights and debts and on the value of  enterprises' assets. We should do a good job in registering  state-owned assets, strengthen the management of Chinese-owned  shares of joint ventures practicing the share-holding system,  prevent the loss of state-owned assets, and effectively ensure  that state-owned assets and their rights and interests are not  infringed on. We should further step up the study, publicity,  and implementation of the "Law on Registered Accountants,"  strengthen the ranks of registered accountants and the  management of their offices, and continuously develop their work  to meet the needs of the developing socialist market economy.    (4) We must intensify tax collection and management  and make great efforts to bring in more revenue.This year  is the first for implementation of the new tax system and for  the revenue-sharing system to operate. We must collect taxes  strictly in accordance with the new tax law. We must continue  to tighten the collection of the "two funds" [fund for priority  energy and communications projects and fund for regulating the  budget] from enterprises and institutions not operated by the  state. These funds may not be deducted or exempted at will. We  must continue to reform tax collection and management and make  greater efforts in building contingents of competent tax  auditors so that the ranks of auditors can be reinforced and tax  collection and management can be strengthened. We must tighten  the work of collecting taxes from independent business  operators, private enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises  and we must audit their tax payments. We must tighten the  management of invoices and draw up the necessary regulations and  rules. Effective measures must be devised to heighten people's  awareness of paying taxes, gradually establish and improve the  system of tax payers filing taxes on their own initiative,  actively promote taxation agency services, and promote the use  of computers in tax collection and management. Harsh measures  should be taken to crack down on all types of unlawful conduct  of evading and refusing tax payments and all tax frauds. We  must stop all revenue loopholes and firmly collect what should  be collected.  (5) We must tighten expenditure and strictly control  expenses. We must continue to uphold the principle of  spending within our means and doing what is within our ability,  be stringent in earmarking funds, ensure the needs of priority  projects, and curtail allotments for ordinary projects. Budgets  for essential personnel must be ensured. Budget restraints must  be firmly enforced, projects must be carried out strictly  according to available budgets, and any casual or reckless  spending habits must be combated and corrected. The procedures  of setting administrative budget quotas should be further  reviewed and improved. This year's budget-cutting should focus  on expenses for meetings, postage, telegrams, and utilities.  Institutions should speed up the restructuring of their fiscal  management, and those that have the needed resources should be  supported to provide compensatory services within the bounds of  law so that their capacity for self-development will be stronger  as result of their efforts to bring in additional income for  themselves. The "accounting of revenues and expenditures must  be done separately" rule must be enforced, and controls over all  budgetary incomes must be consolidated. Grain-related finances  must be tightened to make sure that there will not be any new  debts incurred in this area this year. We must earnestly study  measures for tightening control over institutional purchases  under the new situation and make every effort to stop  institutional consumption from ballooning.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Bank joins CU in pioneering insurance deal: Abbey National announces joint venture alongside 41% rise in pre-tax profits Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, and Commercial Union, the UK's largest insurance company, are to create a joint venture selling general insurance to personal customers. The venture, the first of its kind, is expected to come into operation in the middle of next year. Both parties are committed to it for at least five years. The announcement accompanied Abbey's interim results, which showed a 41 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 423m (Pounds 301m). Mr Peter Birch, chief executive, said Abbey was injecting Pounds 25m initial capital into the venture - around two-thirds of the total - and expected it to yield more than Pounds 100m pre-tax profit in five years' time. It replaces Abbey's existing relationships with a panel of general insurers including CU, Royal Insurance and Legal &amp; General. Royal has been invited to take part in reinsurance for the first three years of the new operation, while any future arrangement with L&amp;G is still being discussed. L&amp;G said yesterday that in 1993 Abbey accounted for less than 30 per cent of its household insurance. It emphasised that its main business was life insurance and pensions. The new venture will be divided into two businesses. Abbey will provide 75 per cent of the initial capital for the operations business unit which will deal with premium collection, product design and claims, while CU will provide the other 25 per cent. Abbey will receive the profits and give CU an agreed rate of return on its investment. By contrast, CU will own 85 per cent of the underwriting company with Abbey holding the remaining 15 per cent. Mr John Carter, CU chief executive, said the venture offered 'attractive but not excessive margins for both companies'. It would be efficient and have the capacity to deal with an expanding volume of business. It did not hamper CU's ability to work with any other organisation. The Treasury announced last month that building societies would be allowed to wholly own a general insurance company dealing in some housing-related lines of personal insurance. But the spring is probably the earliest that any society will adopt this power, and so even a society ready to launch an operation using its new freedom would find it hard to match the planned timing of this venture. Abbey's earnings per share rose to 20.8p, from 12.5p, and the interim dividend goes up by 37 per cent to 5.7p (4.15p). The shares finished the day 12p down at 385p.

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: ING lifts stake in BBL to 10.03% BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian bank, yesterday came under renewed pressure to choose Internationale Nederlanden (ING) as a strategic partner when the Dutch banking and insurance group revealed it had increased its stake in BBL to 10.03 per cent. The BBL board will meet today to discuss whether it should link up with ING or with Credit Communal, the publicly-owned Belgian credit institution. ING said yesterday it had added a further percentage point to its BBL stake in order to demonstrate its determination to co-operate further with the bank. BBL is unlikely to make a firm decision today. The boardroom debate is likely to revolve around the vexed question of whether Belgian companies should be allowed to fall under the influence of non-Belgian partners. According to opponents of such deals, that has been the fate of Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, since France's Compagnie de Suez bought a majority stake. But Brussels stockbrokers and the BBL's own management believe it would be short-sighted of the bank to ally itself with a strictly domestic institution like Credit Communal, which is jointly-owned by all the municipalities and provinces of Belgium. 'If BBL wants to grow on the European level it would be a little unhelpful to link up with a Belgian bank,' said one BBL official yesterday. Pressure from the Credit Communal camp is also being stepped up. Last week, Banque Internationale a Luxembourg bought a 5.7 per cent stake in BBL from Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company which is the bank's largest shareholder. Credit Communal is the Luxembourg bank's main shareholder, and Mr Albert Frere, who heads GBL, is believed to favour a Belgian future for BBL. ING said in April that it was interested in buying all or part of the GBL stake.</p>

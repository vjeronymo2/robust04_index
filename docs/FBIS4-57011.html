			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, who actively  supported the African National Congress in its struggle against  the policy of apartheid, held a friendly talk with outgoing  South African President Frederik de Klerk during the luncheon  that followed black leader Nelson Mandela's inauguration. Castro  was introduced to de Klerk by Mandela. Welcome to South Africa,  de Klerk said to Castro; and through an interpreter Castro  responded: I wish you success. Mandela then introduced Castro to  General Georg Meiring, chief of the South African Army, and the  two men shook hands. In 1987, South African troops confronted  Angolan and Cuban troops in Angolan territory. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS WITHIN ONE GAME OF CLINCHING PLAYOFF SPOT  </P> <P> No, you'd never call this one easy -- at least, not as easy as the 4-0 score  would indicate.  </P> <P> But the Sockers whittled their magic number for clinching a Major Indoor Soccer  League playoff berth to one and for clinching second to two by that margin  Friday night before a noisy Tacoma Dome crowd of 6,716.  </P> <P> The Sockers can accomplish both tonight by winning at Wichita, if Dallas loses  in Baltimore.  </P> <P> "I felt if we could win tonight -- and we had every right to win -- we would be  in a good position," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "Everything pointed that we  had to win unless we did something (badly) drastic."  </P> <P> They didn't.  </P> <P> The hard-rock defense gets the credit for this one, beginning with goalkeeper  Victor Nogueira, who notched his second shutout of the season.  </P> <P> In truth, Noguiera almost could have paid to get in: He made only four saves,  but three of the were tough.  </P> <P> "I can't single out anyone," Noguiera said. But then he added, "George  Fernandez was unbelievable. He was just diving all over the place.  </P> <P> "Now that he's finished his real estate course, he's thinking about soccer  again. He's unbelievable again. Everybody else was, too.  </P> <P> "A shutout doesn't take one person. At the beginning of the game, I didn't feel  that great. My legs were heavy. But the defense was great."  </P> <P> Fernandez, with his first game-winning goal and a picture-perfect assist, was  in the middle of it at both ends: He also had six blocked shots.  </P> <P> "We played awesome defense," Fernandez said. "Everybody got back. As a team we  played very well. Our defenders stuck it to them."  </P> <P> The Stars stretched their scoreless minutes to 91:50 and, as Newman said, "They  missed a lot of opportunities they usually put away."  </P> <P> In an intense first half, characterized by the teams barking at each other and  three penalties on the Sockers, San Diego finally got on the board at 10:38  with what turned out to be the game-winner.  </P> <P> Fernandez, who has never made a living at the far post, volleyed in a Steve  Zungul corner kick from left wing that was nicely threaded through traffic.  </P> <P> "I was pretty shocked the ball got through," Fernandez said. "There wasn't that  much space. He just put it on my foot."  </P> <P> The Sockers stretched their lead to 2-0 at 2:23 of the third quarter. Branko  Segota arched a free kick from the top of the circle to Kevin Crow, who headed  it through Tacoma keeper Mike Dowler's hands.  </P> <P> The Sockers made it 3-0 at 13:46 of the third on a nice collaboration between  Fernandez and Cacho. Fernandez chipped a lob pass to Cacho on the run behind  the Stars defense, and the Cacho volleyed it inside the right post.  </P> <P> The Sockers' fourth goal, by Waad Hirmez from Segota, came at 10:32 with Tacoma  trying the sixth attacker.  </P> <P> On one, Socker Zoran Karic banged a shot off the crossbar that rocketed down  right on the line. On the the other, Tacoma's Preki did the same, surprising  Nogueira with a right-footed shot.  </P></p>

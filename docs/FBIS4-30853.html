			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "J.S.": "European Transportation Market -- A </F> Door Left Ajar"]    [Text] The countries of the European Communities  deliberately protect their own carriers. Practically anyone can  enter our country, and without paying attention to legal  provisions -- said Transportation and Maritime Economy Minister  Boguslaw Liberadzki.    According to the minister, the countries of the European  Union [EU] should express a political will -- followed by  practical steps -- aimed at eliminating any form of  discrimination of carriers from Central and East Europe.    Transportation is regarded as a major source of revenue for  the budgets of Western countries and that is why it is well  organized while shipping companies have excellent canvassing  networks at their disposal. Foreign TIR [International Road  Transport] cars which bring merchandise into Poland, also carry  goods on their way back in 85 percent of the cases, which makes  the entire operation cost-effective. Our drivers on the other  hand, carry just air on their way back, as a general rule. A  small number of strong shipping companies has assured a  dominating position for themselves in the European market. They  themselves set prices which they all adhere to, while leaving a  small space for small, local carriers. The Western shipping  market is protected -- among other things -- by EU legal  requirements concerning shipping companies' financial resources  -- which are different than our legal provisions -- and by high  technical standards concerning the vehicles' construction and  equipment.    We cannot agree to this kind of terms. We stressed these  issues strongly during a European Conference of Transportation  Ministers in Annecy, France which took place in the last days of  May -- said the chief of our ministry. During the conference,  the Polish representatives supported an initiative aimed at a  gradual liberalization of legal provisions concerning  international transportation. We need a few years to adapt to  those provisions.</p>

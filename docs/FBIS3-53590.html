			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>   [Text] Amman--Iraq has agreed to continue supplying oil to  Jordan under an exemption granted by the U.N. Security Council  during talks in Baghdad last week between Jordan's energy and  natural resources minister and Iraqi officials, informed sources  said.    They said Minister Walid 'Asfur held a series of talks  starting with Iraqi Oil Minister Safa' Hadi Jawad and other  ministers as well as Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khuddayir.    Dr. 'Asfur also met with presidential adviser Ja'far Dhiya'  Ja'far, reports from Baghdad said.    "During the talks, Iraq agreed to renew the annual agreement  on oil supplies to Jordan and the accord could be formalised  soon," said one source. No details of the agreement were  immediately available; nor was it known whether it differed much  from the 1993 accord.    Under a tacit exemption granted by the U.N. Security  Council,  which imposed a sweeping international embargo against Iraq  following Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Iraq is  allowed to export oil to Jordan.    Jordan gets an average of 50,000 barrels of crude oil and  20,000 barrels of fuel oil from Iraq trucked overland daily to  the Kingdom's refinery in al-Zarqa'.    No cash is changing hands in the deal since the oil is  supplied partly free and partly in settlement of Iraqi debts to  Jordan.    The sources said the main purpose of Mr. 'Asfur's visit to  Baghdad, where he arrived Wednesday, was to renew the oil  agreeent and that he also held general discussions on  Jordanian-Iraqi ties and prospects of cooperation after the  expected lifting of sanctions.    "The (Iraqi) government is highly hopeful that the sanctions  could be lifted before April, although U.N. officials have said  that it could not be done before June," said a diplomatic source.    According to the source, the Iraqi government, which  accepted  long-term monitoring of its weapons programme late last year  after a protracted stand-off with the U.N., was focusing on the  work of U.N. inspectors in Iraq with a view to getting a clean  certificate from them before March.    "Iraqi officials have been holding extensive discussions  with  representatives of major international oil companies on  post-sanctions cooperation," said a highly-informed diplomat.  "These included American as well European, particularly French  and Italian firms."    Also expected to be raised during Dr. 'Asfur's visit to  Baghdad was Jordanian concern over the impact of the reopening  of Iraq's Umm Qasr Port on the flow of Iraq-bound cargo through  al-'Aqabah.    In talks in Amman in late November, Iraqi officials assured  Jordan that the flow of Iraqi imports, which has dwindled to 20  per cent of pre-crisis levels, would continue and that Umm Qasr,  Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf, would be used to accommodate  small freighters with cargo from the far east.    The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday to  decide  whether to maintain the international embargo against Iraq.    The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported late Saturday that  Jordan and Iraq signed an agreement in which they agreed to  cooperate in 'all key oil industries, including excavating and  digging."    The agreement covers bilateral cooperation in all the  sectors  of the oil industry, including drilling and exploration, along  with Iraqi technical assistance for the Jordanian oil industry  and training for Jordanian oil workers, INA said.</p>

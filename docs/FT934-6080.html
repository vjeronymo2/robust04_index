			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Not so slick as the market: Robert Corzine detects a steep decline in Opec's influence After storming onto the world's economic stage about 25 years ago, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries this week bowed out, at least temporarily, of its increasingly taxing role as an influence on the short-term price of oil. The decision on Wednesday night by the 12 delegations meeting in Vienna to brush aside market demands for an immediate cut in Opec's 24.52m barrel-a-day production ceiling may not herald the demise of the organisation. But it does move it into a new era in which the emphasis is likely to be on market share rather than on price. This is despite the fact that all Opec states, including Saudi Arabia, the dominant producer, are reeling from falling revenues. The decision was a clear signal that Opec would not sacrifice volume for higher prices. It was also tantamount to an admission that in a period of plentiful supplies and weak demand in the main industrialised western countries, Opec could no longer fine-tune the price in a way which would be politically acceptable to its member governments. 'A small cut might not be enough to move the price,' said one delegate, adding that such an outcome would be difficult for oil ministers to justify on their return home. This means that market forces alone will dictate the short-term price, which they did with a vengeance yesterday, when the benchmark Brent blend fell to Dollars 14.57 a barrel in late London trading. Opec officials said they had fully expected 'the price to fall for a day or two', as the market digested their view that the longer-term outlook for balance between supply and demand were 'not that bad'. But Mr Mehdi Varzi, research director of Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, yesterday wondered 'where the rot would stop'. He saw many similarities between current market conditions and those which led to the oil price collapse in 1986, when prices fell below Dollars 10 a barrel. Not all industry observers shared such an apocalyptic view, but most agreed that Opec's 12 member states have put at risk billions of dollars in potential revenues in order to ensure that they maintain market share. The alternative under discussion in Vienna - a modest cut of 2 per cent shared between all members - carried with it an even higher political risk, that of 'cutting back and ceding market share to non-Opec competitors and not having the price recover', according to Mr Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of the independent Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris. The 'free ride' which non-Opec producers might be enjoying at the expense of the organisation has been a recurrent theme in official statements this week. The end of the conference communique noted that Opec alone should not 'have to bear the burden of balancing supply and demand'. But appeals for restraint on the part of independent producers are unlikely to be heeded. Opec is particularly vexed by a surge in North Sea production by the UK and Norway, whose combined output could rise by as much as 1m barrels a day in 1994, the equivalent of a medium-sized Opec producer. Some analysts say, however, that Opec's focus on independent producers merely serves to camouflage the deep distrust within the organisation itself. 'When they say that others might simply move in to take over their market share, they mean their own members,' said one US-based oil industry expert. An Opec delegate confirmed that uncertainty over whether a cut would have resulted in full compliance was a factor in Wednesday's decision. 'Some countries might not have abided by it,' he said. 'So a 500,000 barrel-a-day cut might have been only 200,000 or so in reality' - a level unlikely to have any lasting impact on bearish market psychology. Opec's chronic weakness of large-scale cheating on quotas by some members such as Iran and Nigeria meant that a 1m barrel-a-day cut was not put forward. One delegate conceded, however, that it would have had a positive effect on the markets. 'No one was in favour of it,' he said. That left Opec with no other recourse than to stick to its September output agreement, which set quotas close to most members' capacity in order to minimise cheating. That agreement appears to be holding, and the conference communique said it 'should be given necessary time to achieve its goals'. It is a prospect which some experts say may be achievable. Dr Leonidas Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies set up by Sheikh Yamani, former Saudi oil minister, believes an estimated quarterly demand for Opec oil of 24.6m barrels a day in both the present period and in the first three months of 1994 is likely to match Opec output. He predicts that a shortfall could emerge as early as the second quarter of 1994, when excess stocks built up earlier this year because of Opec over-production should be eliminated. And that, he says, would imply a Dollars 16.60 price for Opec's basket of six crude oils, well below its Dollars 21 target price but well above the Dollars 14.70 level recorded on Monday. But many wonder whether Opec can wait that long or have full confidence in demand forecasts which have been consistently trimmed in recent months. Although all countries are suffering from what Mr Stanislaw describes as 'revenue deprivation', not all are hurting to the same degree. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, for example, differ markedly from heavily populated countries such as Nigeria and Iran, both of whose poorly-performing domestic economies are propped up by hard currency oil revenues. Mr Varzi says the political implications of low oil prices could come to dominate government thinking in such vulnerable countries in the months ahead, especially if lower revenues threaten to trigger off widespread social unrest. The scale of Opec's possible problem is highlighted by the fact that for every Dollars 1 fall in the annualised oil price, member states lose a combined Dollars 5bn in revenue. Perhaps the only optimistic note which greeted oil ministers as they trooped into their limousines yesterday en route to the airport and home was the unseasonally early blanket of snow which covered Vienna and showed no signs of melting. No doubt thoughts from their mainly desert and tropical capitals will increasingly turn to hopes for a white and exceedingly cold Christmas in the northern hemisphere.</p>

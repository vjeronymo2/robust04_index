			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (12): Products before geography - Profile, The derivatives operation at Bankers Trust AT 38, Mr Brian Walsh may seem a bit young to be running the global capital markets group of Bankers Trust, but as the executive in charge of the bank's derivatives business, he is operating in a market that is itself remarkably precocious. Mr Walsh estimates that the over-the-counter derivatives business is no more than eight or nine years old - 'not yet in adolescence'. In a short space of time, the market has experienced extraordinary growth, as has Bankers Trust's own operations - and those of any other big bank or securities house involved in the market. When Mr Walsh joined the company seven years ago, the derivatives group was still in its infancy and employed no more than 70 professionals. Today, more than 300 derivatives specialists occupy the front office, supported by almost twice as many back-office staff who handle the processing, accounting and reporting of the transactions booked by the bank. At Bankers Trust, its derivatives operations are organised globally and managed out of the bank's Manhattan head office. Mr Walsh says: 'I'm here in New York, but I could be in London, I could be in Tokyo - it makes no difference.' This is because the business is not divided up geographically, but by product lines, so that there is an interest-rate or a currency-swap book that is passed around the bank's international offices, and kept entirely separate from the cash businesses that underly the derivatives. Bankers Trust's derivatives group serves about 500 clients, of whom roughly 200 have especially active accounts. The clients are split into three groupings: financial institutions, corporations and investors. Whereas, four years ago, financial institutions took up the bulk of the business, today the bank does more business with investors (such as pension funds, money managers, mutual funds and insurance companies) than with any other category. Mr Walsh says that the vast bulk - about 80 per cent - of his department's business is client-related, which means that Bankers Trust relies less on proprietary derivatives trading than many of its rivals. The bank does not break down its earnings from derivatives in its quarterly and annual reports, but people familiar with Bankers Trust estimate that the derivatives group produces about 25 per cent of the bank's total non-interest revenues, which last year reached Dollars 2.5bn. In terms of the size of its business, according to ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's, Bankers Trust has the fourth biggest exposure to derivatives among US banks. The notional amount of outstanding contracts in its portfolio at the end of June was Dollars 958bn. Their market value - the cost to Bankers Trust of replacing those contracts in the event of a counterparty default - was Dollars 21.6bn, a relatively high risk profile for the bank's size, says S &amp; P, because it is more involved than most in riskier commodity and equity contracts. Like the rest of the market, Bankers Trust came to derivatives in the early and mid-1980s, beginning with interest rate, and then currency swaps, which at the time seemed complex and daring financial instruments to both bankers and their clients. After initially concentrating on 'back-to-back' transactions, and playing the role of the intermediary bringing both sides of the deal together, it was not long before Bankers Trust began acting as a principal. This was a significant change, because it gave birth to a new era of risk management within firms - the hedging and managing of the derivatives book. During the 1980s, the bank followed a growth path that was familiar throughout the industry. After swaps came interest-rate and currency options, instruments that, because of their complexity, says Mr Walsh, attracted many bright mathematicians and physicists to the business - the 'rocket scientists' of financial folklore - and 'bred a culture of innovation'. By mid-1987, Bankers Trust and other players had begun searching for new asset forms upon which to build new derivatives business. At the time, the bank was taking a long, hard look at the traditional equities markets. The financial deregulation of Big Bang in London was barely a year old, and US banks and securities houses were eagerly snapping up UK jobbing and broking firms, or opening big offices in the City. At home, US houses were earning enormous profits from their basic equities broking and trading businesses. Bankers Trust, however, decided to 'focus on something we knew', in equities, says Mr Walsh. What it knew was derivatives, and the new business 'took off like a rocket,' enabling the bank to make money from the first day from products such as Japanese warrants and Japanese convertibles. One of Bankers Trust' most successful innovations in this area has been the Equity Protected Note, a zero-coupon index-linked note that protects investors' downside but offers a lot of upside potential. The banks has sold billions of dollars of the notes all over the world, not just to institutions but to small individual investors. The market soon turned its attention to commodities. Here, however, regulatory constraints held back development, although the start of the Gulf crisis in 1990 persuaded many corporate clients that commodity derivatives had a role to play in risk management. Bankers Trust is currently doing a lot of work in the energy field with oil company clients. Credit derivatives is another new field that Bankers Trust is eagerly ploughing. So far, it has completed about 15 transactions, employing a handful of products, and it is also working on insurance derivatives to help insurers manage their risk more effectively. While much of the action today is concentrated on such 'esoteric instruments' as equity, commodity and credit derivatives, companies like Bankers Trust continue to work on the more traditional 'plain-vanilla' products, re-engineering interest rate and currency swaps to fit clients' needs. Over the past decade, Bankers Trust has had its share of misses alongside the hits, including one-off ideas that never worked. Some of the bank's established lines of business have also run into hard times - the commodity derivatives market, for example, is currently plagued by a lack of volatility in the underlying cash products. Overall, however, Mr Walsh is proud to say that Bankers Trust has so far never withdrawn from a new initiative or market because of losses.</p>

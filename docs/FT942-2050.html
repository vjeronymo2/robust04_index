			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Cautious steps in a new direction - Andrew Hill outlines Cariplo's plans to come to the stock market Cariplo, Italy's contender for the title of the world's largest savings bank, looks the part. Its headquarters is one of the most imposing buildings in central Milan and its chairman, Mr Sandro Molinari, is of equally solid construction. This is just as well, because from July 11, Cariplo is hoping that investors will stump up as much as L1,650bn (Dollars 1bn) for new shares in the bank, taking it on to the stock market for the first time since its foundation in 1823. However, Mr Molinari, who launches a European investment roadshow to promote the issue this Thursday, knows he will need to offer more than a firm handshake and a century and a half of history to get potential investors to open their cheque books. He took over as chairman in April after his predecessor stepped down facing corruption charges. That allowed Mr Molinari, 61, to become the first fully-fledged banker-chairman of the Milan-based group. He joined Cariplo in 1954 and rose through the ranks. All his predecessors and their deputies were political appointees, mainly Christian Democrats. What is more, Mr Molinari knows that if his sales pitch falls flat this time, it will be particularly difficult to push through the sale of a second tranche of shares, in the form of a convertible bond issue expected before the end of this year. Cariplo is the latest bank to take advantage of 1990 legislation which allows public-sector banks - many owned by charitable foundations - to restructure and float up to 49 per cent of the capital of their banking operations. The two-stage issue should raise well over L2,500bn and reduce the Cariplo foundation's stake in the bank to about 78 per cent. With total assets of L150,893bn, and deposits of L122,536bn, the Cariplo group is bigger than the next five biggest Italian savings banks put together. But analysts stress that it is a high-quality bank. In the fast-changing Italian banking field it can no longer be compared only with small savings banks, they say, but counts as a full-service universal bank, competing with, for example, the newly privatised Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano. Geographically, Cariplo - short for Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde - is dependent on the wealthy Lombardy region, which accounts for some 70 per cent of the bank's 700 or so branches. But it has taken advantage of its knowledge of the savings bank sector to build strategic alliances with its counterparts in other regions. By buying minority stakes in about 15 savings banks throughout the country, Cariplo has gained access to a further 700 branches. Through these it can sell its insurance, fund management and mortgage products nationwide. The group has bought a stake in Imi, the recently privatised financial services group, raising expectations that the two companies might link up in due course to offer home-grown competition to Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank. For now, analysts prefer to compare Cariplo with conservative counterparts such as Lloyds Bank in the UK - which has also concentrated on retail business, and links between banking and insurance - or Credit Agricole in France, which has a similar mix of businesses. They underline Cariplo's cautious lending policy. The Milan bank was one of the first into the Italian personal loan market, picking its risks very carefully, while certain competitors launched themselves into business lending with abandon, and are over-exposed to big, bad corporate loans. Although unknown on international equity markets, Cariplo is recognised outside Italy as an issuer of high-quality debt, and has one of the best credit ratings among Italian banks, equal to that of the Italian republic. 'We never looked for results at all costs, but gradual growth,' says Mr Molinari, about the strategy he has supervised since 1983 as deputy chief executive, chief executive and chairman. It is a strategy, which has brought results - group net profit last year rose 4.2 per cent to L323bn - and the admiration of analysts for the straight-forward approach. 'They're very plain vanilla about their market,' says one. The bank is clearly upset, therefore, that its plain vanilla attitude should have got mixed up with the rather more exotic flavours of Italy's widespread corruption scandals. Mr Roberto Mazzotta, Mr Molinari's predecessor, stepped down in February after Milan magistrates deepened their investigation into allegations of phoney property transactions involving the Cariplo pension fund. He has suspended himself from chairmanship of the bank's controlling foundation, and is awaiting a decision on whether he will stand trial. His successor firmly rejects any suggestion that the affair will have knock-on effects on the bank or the fund. It is a personal, rather than corporate problem, says Mr Molinari. Moreover, he points out that Cariplo's internal investigation, aided by outside experts, produced no evidence that procedures for valuing property had been infringed, or that the bank or pension fund had suffered any damage. As for the legacy of political control, Mr Molinari is adamant that 'the structure of the bank and the staff of the bank were never politicised'. To underline his desire that the bank should remain apolitical, the new chairman has rebuffed Mr Umberto Bossi, the strident northern politician, who has suggested that his federalist Northern League could now step into the shoes of the Christian Democrats and adopt Cariplo as the pet financial institution of a more autonomous northern Italy. In theory, the League could achieve this ambition, if it were to consolidate political power in its northern heartland, because directors of Cariplo's controlling foundation are appointed by local and regional Lombard authorities. These rules used to allow local parties to reward the faithful with boardroom seats, and direct the foundation's statutory charitable contributions towards clubs and associations with party links. In practice, the League's support is wavering in the north, and in any case, local authorities have tended in recent years to nominate neutral directors, such as professors. If that means a Cariplo chairman is free to manage the bank, then Mr Molinari's satisfaction at rising from branch level to the top job will be complete.</p>

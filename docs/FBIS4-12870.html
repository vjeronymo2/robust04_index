			<p>BFN     [Text] Veteran Algerian opposition figure Hocine Ait Ahmed  held a news conference in Paris this afternoon. Ait Ahmed is  president of the Front of Socialist Forces, a very influential  party in the region of Kabylia. Mr. Ait Ahmed appealed for  dialogue. Farida Ayari asked him why he is making such an  appeal:    [Begin recording] [Ahmed] Because civil war is the worst  thing that can happen to our country. I refuse this possibility  because a civil war is an insult to intelligence and to reason.    [Ayari] One is tempted to ask why dialogue, since the only  two real forces in Algeria today are the army and the Islamists.  If those two talk, might one not end up with an alliance  between the army and the Islamists, as has happened in Iran or  in Sudan?    [Ahmed] You speak of dialogue between two protagonists. This  is the very problem. You still know nothing about Algeria,  unknown Algeria, with its population which refuses to side  either with the authorities or with the Islamists, and which  just suffers. We do not have one section of the Algerian people  taking up arms against another section. This is why I say that  there is not a civil war. So dialogue yes, between the  protagonists, but especially between the representatives of the  most representative political parties. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGER NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> GRIFFIN BEGINS TO COMPLAIN OF SHARP PAINS IN HIS BACK  </P> <P> The Dodgers' injury problems, once confined to any number of outfielders, are  moving closer to home.  </P> <P> Shortstop Alfredo Griffin has begun complaining of sharp pain in his back, a  pain which he says is worse than the shoulder and hand pain he has endured  through the past few seasons.  </P> <P> "If the pain is steady, and I know what it is going to be, I can handle it," he  said. "But this pain, you don't know when it is going to come, and how bad it  is going to be. And if I finally can't take it, we will have to figure  something out."  </P> <P> Said therapist Pat Screnar: "He does have stiffness, but he is able to do all  the work, and it seems to be getting better."  </P> <P> Griffin confirmed his back has been examined, and no problems have been found.  </P> <P> "I will keep playing for as long as I can stand it," said Griffin, 33. He will  miss today's opening exhibition game against Minnesota. Lenny Harris is  scheduled as his replacement.  </P> <P> Griffin won't be the only projected opening day starter left behind. Kal  Daniels, Willie Randolph, Jeff Hamilton and Mike Scioscia also will not make  the trip to Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> The probable starting lineup will be Rick Dempsey at catcher, Eddie Murray at  first base, Mike Sharperson at second base, Harris at shortstop, Dave Hansen at  third, Hubie Brooks in right field, Juan Samuel in center field, and Chris  Gwynn, Jose Gonzalez or John Shelby in left.  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson took batting practice off a tee for the first time since inflaming  his knee by taking 150 swings last Tuesday. He took just 50 swings and said he  felt good. "The main thing we're working on now is his hands," said Ben Hines,  whose skills as one of baseball's best hitting instructors will be needed this  season as he works with several hitters coming off injuries -- Gibson, Daniels,  Gwynn and Franklin Stubbs.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Pitcher Don Aase joined the pregame meeting for the first time, another hint  that he will be one of three extra players with the Dodgers for the first three  weeks of the season. He will go to Orlando along with two other contenders for  the extra spots, pitchers Steve Davis and Mike Munoz.  </P> <P> An NCAA basketball championship could mess up the Dodgers' pitching rotation.  Mike Morgan, who will probably begin the season as one of six starters, claimed  he has told the Dodgers that he will return to his hometown and ride in the  UNLV victory parade April 3 if the Rebels win. That may be a joke, but Morgan's  intentions are serious. His family still lives in Las Vegas, and he has been  attending UNLV games since age 3. "I've waited many, many years for this,"  Morgan said with a smile while walking through the clubhouse wearing a hat  shaped like a shark. "I will not be denied."  </P></p>

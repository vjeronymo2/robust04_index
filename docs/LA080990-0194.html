			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THRIFTY'S PRESIDENT RESIGNS; UP TO 100 STORES TO BE CLOSED  </P> <P> Thrifty Corp.'s longtime president has resigned, and 50 to 100 of the company's  ailing drugstores and sporting goods outlets will be closed over the next two  years.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based owner of Thrifty, Pacific Enterprises, also announced  Wednesday that, as expected, it lost $229 million during its second quarter.  The loss stemmed largely from a one-time accounting charge of $275 million that  analysts said will translate into higher earnings for the energy and retailing  company in future quarters.  </P> <P> Departing as president of Thrifty is Richard G. Eils, 52, the company's  president for 10 years and its chief executive since February. The company said  Eils, who began his career with Thrifty 25 years ago as an industrial engineer,  will "pursue other interests."  </P> <P> He was replaced as president by Daniel Seigel, a lawyer who had no retailing  experience before joining Thrifty in March as executive vice president and  chief financial officer. Seigel started in Pacific Enterprises' legal  department in 1974, and worked his way up to president of the company's  alternative energy and leasing businesses before going to Thrifty.  </P> <P> The job of chief executive at Thrifty -- whose seven chains include Thrifty,  Thrifty Jr. and Big 5 sporting goods -- was left vacant. The company said it is  conducting a nationwide search for senior executives with retailing experience,  but that no decision was made on whether it will fill the chief executive's  job.  </P> <P> Seigel, for at least the time being, will be in charge of Thrifty's day-to-day  operations, and Leonard H. Straus is continuing as the company's chairman.  </P> <P> Thrifty's 1,070 drugstores and sporting goods shops account for 29,000 of  Pacific Enterprises' 40,000 employees and close to half of its revenue, but  last year brought in only one-fifth of its after-tax operating income. They are  mainly in California, but also operate in various Western and Midwestern  states.  </P> <P> The stores have been hurt by, among other things, price-slashing by such  competitors as the Sav-On drugstore chain. Pacific Enterprises said it plans to  close "marginal" stores among Thrifty's retail chains as part of its effort to  improve earnings.  </P> <P> No decision was announced on which stores will be closed. As many as 2,000  employees could be affected by the closings, but the company said efforts will  be made to minimize dismissals by transferring workers to healthy stores.  </P> <P> Pacific Enterprises' second-quarter loss resulted from a $100-million writedown  of Thrifty's assets and a $175-million writedown of the reserves of its Pacific  Enterprises Oil unit. Analysts said the charge against the oil and gas business  was essentially an accounting fluke linked to a temporary decline in energy  prices. Now that those assets have been written down, however, it will preclude  energy depletion charges in the future.  </P> <P> In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company's stock climbed $1.125  to close at $39.75. Analysts attributed the gain to optimism about the impact  of the Persian Gulf crisis on Pacific Enterprises' oil and gas business.  </P> <P> They also cited hopes that the company's big utility business, Southern  California Gas Co., will benefit from a possible decline in interest rates. In  addition, Pacific Enterprises bolstered the confidence of investors by  announcing that its cash flow remains strong and can "readily accommodate" the  company's regular dividend payments.  </P> <P> Pacific Enterprises' $229-million quarterly loss came on operating revenue that  climbed 4% to $1.6 billion. The company earned $53 million in the year-ago  quarter.  </P></p>

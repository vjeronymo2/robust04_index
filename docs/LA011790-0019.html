			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE IS WINNING MEDFLY WAR, AGRICULTURE CHIEF SAYS  </P> <P> The state's top agriculture official, responding to concerns by some scientists  that efforts to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly infestation from Southern  California could fail, predicted Tuesday that the war against the pest will be  won, and that it should be wrapped up by June.  </P> <P> "Everything is working," said Henry J. Voss, director of the state Department  of Food and Agriculture. "We will probably find more flies, but I am confident  we have the infestation under control and will complete eradication by the  middle of the year."  </P> <P> Voss' rosy prognosis followed by one week a report in The Times that several  scientists are now concerned that the attempt to eradicate the crop-damaging  pest with aerial applications of the pesticide malathion might not be workable.  Some scientists pointed to a pattern of new infestations in the region in the  last decade and suggested that the state begin contemplating how to coexist  with the Medfly.  </P> <P> Voss, appearing Tuesday at a hearing of the state Senate's Agriculture and  Water Resource Committee, said that since the start of repeated aerial  malathion spraying in December, significantly fewer flies have been trapped in  the region.  </P> <P> He said completion of a facility for breeding sterile Medflies in Hawaii also  will help, providing as many as 500 million sterile flies a week by midyear.  The so-called "steriles" are used to breed fertile Medflies out of existence.  </P> <P> "I think we're a long way from an infestation that we can't take care of," Voss  said. "It's under control."  </P> <P> Voss' prediction of victory came just as his department announced that a  36-square-mile chunk of Orange County, covering Garden Grove and Westminster,  will be sprayed with malathion Jan. 25 as a result of the discovery of a single  fly in Garden Grove last week.  </P> <P> Committee Chairman Ruben S. Ayala (D-Chino) said the disheartening discovery of  new flies has left him skeptical that the Medfly war is going as well as Voss  believes.  </P> <P> "Something appears to be out of kilter," Ayala said to Voss and his aides. "Why  are we not getting better results? I do believe they're doing the right thing  now. But I don't believe it is fully under control. If it was, why would we be  finding all these flies now?"  </P> <P> Voss conceded that the department made a serious error last July at the start  of the infestation by underestimating its size.  </P> <P> Ayala said that, while he believes the aerial pesticide spraying is safe,  politically there is no way it can go on with no end.  </P> <P> "At what stage do you declare it is out of control?" Ayala asked. "With all due  respect, we cannot continue spraying malathion . . . forever."  </P> <P> Ayala's statements echoed the concern of several scientists who said last week  that they believe the Medfly may now be permanently settled in the state.  </P> <P> "Once you have an established population -- and I would say the evidence in  L.A. is that it is pretty well established -- it (eradication) is very  unlikely," one of the scientists, Daniel Simberloff, a professor of biological  science at Florida State University, said.  </P> <P> Ayala said he is willing to give Voss the benefit of the doubt for now.  </P> <P> "By June or July, if they don't have the infestation under control, they're  going to have to admit that spraying hasn't done the job," he said. "If we're  going to continue spraying and spraying and spraying past June, they'd better  look for a better answer."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Board of Education voted 5 to 1 Tuesday to ask  county and state officials to stop malathion spraying until effects of exposure  on children and youths can be studied.  </P> <P> The halt was proposed by board President Jackie Goldberg, who said her  constituents are "in absolute panic" over the spraying. Board member Roberta  Weintraub voted no, saying she needed more information before she would oppose  a program that could ruin California's agriculture.  </P></p>

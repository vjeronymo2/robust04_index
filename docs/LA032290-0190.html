			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SEEKS ARTS FUNDS WITHOUT CONTENT CONTROL  </P> <P> The White House, fending off demands that it limit the content of federally  supported art, Wednesday sent Congress a proposal to renew arts funding without  any restrictions on subject matter.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration proposed a five-year extension of the National  Endowment for the Arts and rejected content controls such as those that sparked  an uproar here last year and led to a one-year congressional ban on financing  of artworks thought to be obscene.  </P> <P> NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer, testifying before a House subcommittee  considering a budget authorization for the arts, said: "After much careful  thought and discussion, it is our conclusion that the legislation proposed  here, which contains no content restrictions, . . . will best serve the  American public."  </P> <P> The NEA controversy centers on objections by some conservatives to federal  support for artworks that may be offensive, sacrilegious or indecent.  </P> <P> The protests were set off last year by two photographic exhibits that received  NEA support. One, by Robert Mapplethorpe, included sadomasochistic and  homoerotic themes. The other, by Andres Serrano, depicted a crucifix in a jar  of urine.  </P> <P> Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) objected vehemently to those projects and pushed  through a measure that withheld $40,000 of the NEA's funding, the equivalent of  the money spent on those projects, and imposed the one-year restrictions. The  NEA's budget for this year is $171 million.  </P> <P> "To those who are offended, I am truly sorry," Frohnmayer said of last year's  controversy.  </P> <P> But, he told the subcommittee, "art is like research. It is trying new things,  taking risks, pushing boundaries.  </P> <P> "Not all art succeeds. To not do research is to stand still and be bypassed by  the rest of the world."  </P> <P> The NEA director also pointed out that the endowment relies heavily on reviews  by citizens' panels in issuing grants.  </P> <P> Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), chairman of the House education and labor  subcommittee, called the proposal announced by Frohnmayer "a major piece of  information and news."  </P> <P> But while the Bush proposal was welcomed by arts groups and arts supporters in  Congress, it promises to lead to more difficult congressional and public  debate.  </P> <P> Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), the leading congressional proponent of NEA  restrictions, said Thursday evening that he had not been officially notified of  the Bush proposal, but: "If the arts community has convinced the Administration  that government should keep funding things like pictures of Jesus Christ in  bottles or urine . . . then I think the Administration has been misguided."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher said he had not lobbied the White House on his call for content  restrictions, and he conceded that Bush's proposal could hinder his effort. But  he said he expects the issue to be vigorously debated.  </P> <P> "There will be a major debate in Congress," he said. "And the American people,  as they become aware that there are no restrictions on the use of their tax  dollars for live sex shows, are going to be more and more outraged."  </P> <P> The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, head of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values  Coalition, which supports content controls, said Thursday: "We're very  disappointed. I don't really understand why they've done this. . . . While it  is most unfortunate that the White House currently is being insensitive to the  values and a beliefs of those who support the President on many other issues,  we will continue to press forward with this specific issue."  </P> <P> In Raleigh, N.C., Helms announced that he had written to the General Accounting  Office, the investigative arm of Congress, demanding an investigation of the  arts endowment. In a statement, Helms contended that the arts endowment had  continued to fund pornographic artworks, despite the restrictions imposed last  year.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer, in his testimony, angrily denied that the NEA has ever had a policy  of promoting obscene artworks. He attacked right-wing groups by name --  including the Mississippi-based American Family Assn. and the fundamentalist  "700 Club" TV program -- and accused the family association of mounting an  advertising campaign "seeking to raise funds . . . at the expense of the  National Endowment for the Arts." Rep. E. Thomas Coleman (R-Mo.), the ranking  Republican on the subcommittee, complained that the controversy and debate over  the NEA reflected "a bumper sticker mentality" in which discussion "has been  simplified down to whether one supports pornography . . . or censorship."  </P> <P> But Coleman said the content of some of the photographic images that were the  initial source of the controversy that began last year remains troublesome. He  and Rep. Paul B. Henry (R-Mich.) warned Frohnmayer it may be impossible to  navigate the NEA reauthorization bill through Congress without content  restrictions being attached at some point.  </P> <P> "I will not attempt to justify artworks that offend common sense standards of  decency," Coleman said.  </P> <P> He said it may be inevitable -- even desirable -- that a political compromise  will have to be struck under which the NEA authorizing law would contain  "appropriate language that will guarantee freedom of artistic expression and  accountability" for possibly offensive content.  </P> <P> "I, for one, am deeply distressed by some of the grants funded by the NEA,"  Henry told Frohnmayer. But he was even more sharply critical of what he  characterized as "duplicity and moral posturing" by members of Congress who  have become the NEA's most effective adversaries. Though he did not mention  them by name, Henry, Williams and other subcommittee members made it clear they  were referring to Helms and Rohrabacher.  </P> <P> "Some of the political posturing on this issue is itself pornographic," the  Michigan Republican said.  </P> <P> But, he said, "please don't blind yourself to the political reality. The NEA  has some explaining to do. In order to save it, we are going to have to reform  it."  </P> <P> In his statement Wednesday, Helms said he "is deeply concerned about the NEA's  apparent indifference to enforcing the congressional ban on funding obscene  art."  </P> <P> Despite personal assertions by Frohnmayer that the endowment would not, as a  matter of policy, pay for obscene works, Helms said that "the evidence to the  contrary is so compelling that is imperative that there be an objective  investigation."  </P> <P> Helms' letter, addressed to Controller General Charles A. Bowsher, included  several examples of allegedly pornographic art. At the opening of the letter,  Helms cautioned Bowsher that "because of the nature of the enclosed material, I  urge that great care be taken to assure that your women associates are not  exposed to the material."  </P> <P> The NEA said Frohnmayer had no immediate comment on the demand for a GAO  investigation.  </P> <P> During the hearing, Coleman pressed Frohnmayer specifically to clarify remarks  he made at a subcommittee hearing two weeks ago at the J. Paul Getty Museum in  Malibu when, responding reluctantly to repeated questions by Williams,  Frohnmayer said it is appropriate for the federal government to support  artworks that may be offensive to some people.  </P> <P> "If it is artistically excellent," Frohnmayer told Coleman on Wednesday, "it  does not make it unfundable just because it is offensive. Some art is  offensive. That is not to say that (artistic) voices ought to be denied federal  funding, if it is excellent art."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Dave Lesher and Mark Pinsky contributed to this report.  </P></p>

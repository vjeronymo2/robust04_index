			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-ISRAEL BOYCOTT;  </P> <P> TAX MAN COMETH, BUT AN ARAB TOWN RESISTS  </P> <P> During almost two years of struggle against Israeli occupation, almost nothing  has been sure for Palestinians but death and taxes, although in this town at  least, residents are trying to free themselves from the tax man.  </P> <P> In Beit Sahur, which is built around the fields where the Bible says shepherds  heard angels herald Jesus' birth, everyone is refusing to pay income and sales  taxes to the Israeli government. In response, Israel has ordered the army to  escort tax collectors door-to-door and confiscate furniture, appliances,  television, pianos and anything else deemed valuable.  </P> <P> The self-styled Unified Leadership of the Uprising in the Occupied Territories  has coalesced around the tax revolt as a means of channeling the frustrations  of the intifada, as the uprising is known. They hope that support for civil  disobedience expressed in Beit Sahur will spread elsewhere in the occupied West  Bank and Gaza Strip and give them a new weapon in fighting the Israelis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Leads Nonviolent Struggle'  </P> <P> "This is the city that leads nonviolent struggle, and we must stop Israel from  crushing it," said Faisal Husseini, a public leader of the intifada.  </P> <P> For the first time in months, Israeli officials appear to be on the defensive  in the face of a Palestinian tactic. In answer to charges that they are trying  to crack peaceful protest by sacking possessions from family living rooms,  officials respond only that the confiscations are legal under Israeli law. Even  during the uprising against its rule, Israel insists that it is trying to keep  up public services and that residents must pay.  </P> <P> To limit adverse publicity, the army has sealed off Beit Sahur, just a trumpet  blast from Bethlehem, for most of the last three weeks and disconnected the  town's telephone service. When Palestinian activists called a press conference  last week in Jerusalem to complain about the tax raids, the army closed the  streets around a hotel that was hosting the conference and declared the area a  "closed military zone."  </P> <P> Last Friday, soldiers barred a delegation of seven European consuls from  entering Beit Sahur to investigate the property seizures. The commander at the  roadblock said the town was sealed off for "operational reasons."  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Not Be Magic Formula  </P> <P> It is far from clear that the Palestinians have hit on a magic formula to force  an end to Israeli occupation. For one thing, civil disobedience has failed to  gain much support anywhere but in Beit Sahur. Many grass-roots leaders in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip are calling for stepped-up violence, not campaigns of  folded arms.  </P> <P> Even Beit Sahur is torn over how far to carry the protest. As has become  commonplace in the intifada, factional disputes broke out: Communist activists  wanted to compromise with the Israelis, while members of the Popular Front for  the Liberation of Palestine called for 100% refusal to pay.  </P> <P> "If one pays, we'll all have to pay," said a street organizer and part-time  plumber in Beit Sahur. "Do we want to keep paying for the bullets used against  us?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small-Town Values  </P> <P> Among West Bank cities, Beit Sahur is viewed as a little corner of middle-class  propriety: neat, quiet and devoted to small-town values. Ozzie and Harriet  could live here.  </P> <P> Householders maintain trim gardens and olive groves, work is considered a prime  virtue and the town's population of 12,000 boasts that its schools are the  oldest in the West Bank.  </P> <P> Since the beginning of the intifada, Beit Sahur residents have been the most  dedicated of all Palestinians to peaceful protest. They set up victory gardens  to wean themselves away from dependence on Israeli foodstuffs. When schools  were closed for most of 20 months, they formed underground classes to keep  studies going. When Israeli peace activists were looking for Palestinians to  meet, Beit Sahur was an eager host.  </P> <P> Violence has been comparatively minor. The only Palestinian killed was hit on  the head by a block dropped on him by a soldier. Stone-throwing incidents here  are played like games by schoolchildren without much damage to anyone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Responded to Call  </P> <P> Last May, when the Unified Leadership reiterated a call for Arabs to stop  paying taxes, only Beit Sahur responded fully. Residents refused to pay income  tax while merchants and craftsmen also withheld value-added taxes on their  sales.  </P> <P> Municipal officials issued a statement to explain the philosophical basis for  their protest: "To the Israeli people, we say that for 20 years of occupation  you thought we were satisfied, and then came the intifada to tell you that we  want our freedom and that not paying taxes is a form of nonviolent resistance  to your occupation. The intifada tells you that by treating us as a colony of  Israel you are practicing taxation without representation."  </P> <P> So far, tax collectors have taken goods from 60 houses and stores in Beit Sahur  and the government announced plans to raid another 250 properties. A public  auction of the items has been tentatively scheduled for next week.  </P> <P> "They come in as if they own us," said Nasser abu Ayta, the owner of a video  cassette store and a nationalist activist who has been jailed on several  occasions. He said that last week, the tax man took three color televisions,  three black-and-white televisions, two video recorders and several appliances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Washer Taken in Mid-Cycle  </P> <P> "They even took a washer while the rinse cycle was on," Abu Ayta said. He  claimed that goods belonging to his brothers were taken even though only he was  wanted for tax evasion.  </P> <P> Raji Qumsiyeh, an upholsterer, said that a tax collector and nine soldiers came  and carted away a 12-piece living room set, two carpets, a table and four  chairs, a television and video recorder.  </P> <P> "Well, now we have plenty of time to sit and play cards," Qumsiyeh sighed.  </P> <P> The army has also taken the opportunity of frequent curfews, when everyone must  stay indoors, to make about 20 arrests. Among the new detainees are some  residents who have been active in meeting peace groups and presenting their  case for an independent state.  </P> <P> "Can this be a coincidence?" asked Hana Andoni, whose son Ghassan, a physics  teacher and host for Arab-Israeli meetings, was thrown in jail last week.  "Ghassan talked peace and they come and take him away."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sprits Flagging  </P> <P> The focus on the tax revolt comes at a time when leaders of the uprising are  searching for ways to revive flagging spirits in the intifada. The toll of  deaths, more than 550 Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers, has eroded  enthusiasm.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on "special" interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, </F> leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, by Moscow correspondent  Gid'on Kouts; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Here is another facet, perhaps a new one, of the  terrible Vladimir Zhirinovskiy: this time, as a conditional  lover of Israel and the Jews. At the outset of a special  interview he gave to Qol Yisra'el, I said to him: I heard that  you would like to transfer Israel elsewhere.    He replied: I said Israel was put in a region where there  are over 100 million Arabs, and there has always been a war  between Israel and the Arabs. Had an island been chosen for  Israel, such as Madagascar, Cyprus, Malta, or some other island  where there are no neighbors and where there would be 10, 20, or  30 million Jews, there would have been no problems and the whole  matter would have been over. You have been at war with the  Arabs for over 40 years, however, and this war will continue.  You signed a peace, but the war has continued and there are  casualties every day.    I asked: Do you recognize Israel's right to exist? The  State of Israel must exist, Zhirinovskiy replied soothingly, but  Russia and the United States should work together to finalize  Israel's borders. We have influence with Syria and Iraq, while  the United States has influence with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and  Egypt. We should reach a definitive agreement about Israel's  final borders and never change them again. War and extremism  would then be over. Everything possible must be done so that  life is calm for a long time, forever.    Should the Jews of Russia emigrate to Israel? Zhirinovskiy  replied: If Russian Jews want to go to Israel, let them. After  all, the communists barred them from doing so for a long time  and even threw them in jail. If they want to stay, however,  they are most welcome, seeing that the Jews have always been  highly educated people who can contribute a great deal to their  country of residence.    Are there any Jews in the Liberal Democratic Party? An  incredulous Zhirinovskiy repeated after me: Are there any Jews  in our party? Then he regained his composure and answered:  There may be one, two, or three of them. I do not know their  exact number, because when people join our party we do not ask  them to disclose their nationality.    There has been talk that you are of Jewish origin, that your  father was a Jew, I said to him. It is all propaganda,  Zhirinovskiy exclaimed. People say my father was Jewish, that I  am an anti- Semite, a Zionist, an extremist, a fascist, a  communist, and that Saddam Husayn gave me money. The latest  tale about me is that the communists in East Germany gave me 80  million German marks, but what I said was: Give me 8 marks.  These are outright lies.    So, you are not dangerous, I said. No, I am not dangerous,  Zhirinovskiy answered. The magazine BILD carried photographs of  a young girl and reported that Zhirinovskiy had a sexual liaison  with her when he was in Austria. He said: Where is that woman?  I would gladly meet her, but where is she? It is sheer  propaganda, as always.    If you are invited to Israel for a visit, will you come?  Yes, we will come, Zhirinovskiy replied resolutely.    I guess we had better start getting ready.</p>

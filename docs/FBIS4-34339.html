			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] Approximately 50,000 families in Havana depend on  manufactured gas, and current limitations of that fuel  negatively affect between 475,000 and 500,000 persons.    Two plants supply the capital, the Mario Fortuni Plant,  which  operates with French technology, and the so-called Melones  plant, which was purchased in the United States at the turn of  the century. Jointly, they produce a little bit over 400,000  cubic meters of manufactured gas, a volume far below the current  demand.    Although other factors are involved, four have essentially  caused a production deficit in that industry: a tank out of  service due to necessary repairs; lack of number 40 gas because  the Nico Lopez Refinery closed down; damage in one of the Mario  Fortuni Plant's lines; and a failure in its hydraulic system due  to low-quality rubber gaskets.    [Begin recording] [Engineer Flora Elena Mesa] Repairs  disrupt  our service because although we can manufacture gas at night, we  need to stop once the storage tanks are full -- we have nowhere  else to store the gas -- and the next day we have less gas  available to provide this service to the population.    Regarding the rubber gaskets problem, some of the gaskets  lasted three, six, and even 12 months -- for example the  (Clavier) gaskets -- yet these last only a week, 15 days,  sometimes hours. This results in constant breakdowns, and we  have to stop the plant to solve the problem.    This line should have been repaired by now. Its  effectiveness  has decreased; its efficiency is not the same and it has lower  production.    The lack of number 40 gas... [pauses] like I said, the Nino  Lopez Refinery's catalytic cracking plant, the one that produces  liquefied gas, is undergoing general repairs. Consequently, we  cannot receive the number 40 gas, which represents an important  support in our production.    [Unidentified Reporter] When do you think the gas service  can  be restored?    [Mesa] The situation cannot change in the near future  because  the gasket problem has not been solved, and the gasometer is  still out of service. The gas situation will improve next month.  [end recording]    [Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at  0000 GMT on 17 June reports in its "NTV" newscast that the  Melones Plant tank, which can store 70,000 cubic meters of  manufactured gas, has been repaired so Havana's manufactured gas  enterprise will now be able to store more gas to supply the  population.]</p>

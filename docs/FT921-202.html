			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Turkey tells Syria to cease aid to Kurds TURKEY yesterday issued a strong warning for Syria to end its support for Kurdish separatists, after a week of growing unrest in south-east Turkey where rebels of the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) are calling for a general insurrection. The broadside by Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, marks the most explicit charge of Syrian involvement in the PKK's struggle for an independent state in south-east Turkey. It comes just two weeks before a scheduled visit to Damascus by Mr Ismet Sezgin, Turkey's interior minister. The statement underlines mounting Turkish concern at what it sees as Syrian complicity, giving backing to Turkey's claim that the PKK constitutes an external threat despite growing evidence that it now enjoys broad support inside the country. Mr Demirel described Syria's action in giving the PKK a safe haven in the Bekaa valley as unacceptable. 'It should be clearly understood that our patience has a limit,' Mr Demirel warned. Turkey claims the PKK has 7,000 guerrillas outside Turkey either in northern Iraq or in the camps in Bekaa, and just 3,000 inside Turkey. 'We will do everything we can to stop this killing. I don't think this should go on for 10 or 15 years. It should be stopped,' he said. Mr Demirel's comments raise the prospect of possible Turkish military action against PKK camps in the Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley. Turkish aircraft bombed alleged PKK targets in northern Iraq last week. Mr Demirel defended the hot pursuit tactics as an act of self-defence sanctioned by the United Nations Charter. Turko-Syrian relations have long been based on mutual suspicion, a simmering dispute over Turkish control of the river Euphrates, and the outstanding Syrian claims to Hatay province - given to the Turks in the 1930s when Syria was under French administration. Turkish frustration at its failure to combat the PKK reached a new impasse last week with the deaths of more than 70 people involved in demonstrations to mark the Kurdish New Year. This frustration was compounded by German criticism on Thursday that Turkey was using German military aid equipment to put down the demonstrations - a charge denied by Mr Demirel.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATISTICS MEAN LITTLE AS COLTS BEAT PATRIOTS;  </P> <P> AFC: INDIANAPOLIS GETS ONLY FIVE FIRST DOWNS AND 155 YARDS, BUT STILL HANDS NEW  ENGLAND ITS SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE LOSS, 13-10.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jeff George completed only four of his first 22 passes and the  Indianapolis Colts had only five first downs and 155 yards.  </P> <P> Dreadful performances like those usually portend defeat -- unless, of course,  they come against New England Patriots.  </P> <P> George salvaged the day by connecting with Bill Brooks on a 26-yard touchdown  pass play with 2:05 left Sunday as the Colts beat the Patriots, 13-10.  </P> <P> "Anybody that takes consolation in a close loss is just fooling themselves,"  New England defensive end Brent Williams said. "People don't pay their money to  see football. They pay their money to see winning football."  </P> <P> Only 28,924 were in 60,794-seat Foxboro Stadium, where the Colts (3-6) ended a  three-game losing streak and handed the Patriots (1-8) their seventh  consecutive loss.  </P> <P> The Patriots are off to their worst start since 1970, when they were 1-9.  </P> <P> "It was just a big win for the team," Colt Coach Ron Meyer said, "regardless of  the way the game was perceived by outsiders."  </P> <P> George, the top pick in last year's draft, completed six of 24 passes for 106  yards. His last two completions were a 22-yarder to Albert Bentley and the  touchdown to Brooks.  </P> <P> George had a chance to put the Colts ahead on the series before Brooks scored.  But with the ball at the New England eight, his passes to a wide-open Bentley  fell incomplete on third and fourth down.  </P> <P> "It was a valiant effort by our defense," Patriot Coach Rod Rust said.  </P> <P> But on the Colts' next possession, George's pass to Bentley moved the ball to  the New England 34. After Eric Dickerson ran eight yards, George found Brooks  between defenders Ronnie Lippett and Fred Marion, giving the Colts their first  lead.  </P> <P> "George looked off the safety and made a great throw," Brooks said.  </P> <P> The Patriots had a last chance with first down at the Indianapolis 44 with 1:01  left. But Marc Wilson, who completed eight of 23 passes for 87 yards, threw two  incompletions. Those were followed by consecutive sacks, and the Colts ran out  the clock.  </P> <P> The Patriots lost despite a season-high 175 rushing yards. Their previous high  was 123 in a 16-14 victory over Indianapolis in the second game of the season.  </P></p>

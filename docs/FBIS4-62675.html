			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 13/5/1994 -- The threefold  increase in prices for utilities was made "without the  Government taking efficient measures for paying the salary  arrears and before revising the minimum salary," states the  protest signed by a group of Moldovan trade unions. The protest  demands suspension of the decision on raising utilities prices;  otherwise the trade unions "will mobilize people to protest in  front of the government building" and proceed to more energetic  protest actions such as a manifestation in the Great National  Assembly Square in Chisinau. The presidium of the Federation of  Independent Trade Unions (FITU) issued today a similar protest  saying that the increase of the utilities prices is nothing "but  a mockery." The FITU "demands immediate suspension of the  decisions on increasing these prices" and adds that "ignoring  these demands will provoke social instability." Sources from  the Federation say that the FITU Presidium had to make this  decision under the pressure of several branch trade unions.  Previously, the FITU had launched the idea of abstaining for  six month from protest actions. Today, during the press  conference of the Moldovan Agrarian Democratic Party, Moldovan  deputy speaker Dumitru Motpan stated that measures have already  been taken to suspend the implementation of the increased  tariffs.</p>

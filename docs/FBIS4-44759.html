Germany and the European Union (EU)  urgently need to take initiatives to expand information highways  for multimedia applications of the future so as not to fall  behind America and Japan in the competition. This was the  conclusion of a conference among high-level representatives of  business and science which was called by Federal Research  Minister Paul Krueger.    Information highways refer to rapid, high-volume  transmission  networks which include such applications as video conferences,  the individual ordering of movies or news, home shopping, or the  exchange of data among computers for scientific and business  purposes.    Krueger, Heinrich von Pierer (the chairman of Siemens AG),  and Mark Woessner (the chairman of Bertelsmann AG) emphasized  that Germany has good technical prerequisites for the multimedia  services of the future. The network infrastructure is very  good, Krueger said. Based on a study which his ministry  contracted, however, Krueger pointed out infrastructure  shortcomings which hamper innovations. There are gaps in the  technical and organizational integration of the systems, in the  development of specific software, and in the availability of  services which do not utilize all the existing possibilities, he  said. Krueger and von Pierer said that fees in Germany are too  high in comparison with international norms. The Siemens head  questioned whether the postal reform will change this situation.  According to the study, the level of tariffs for leased  services was three to seven times higher than in other  industrialized nations. Deutsche Telekom contested this  finding. Krueger specifically supported the demand by Professor  Eberhard Witte (University of Munich) and the industrialists  that more competition and deregulation was needed in the  telecommunications infrastructure. Only then will one obtain an  extensive array of services, low prices, rising investments, and  new jobs in the telecommunications sector, they said.    In the conversations, concern was expressed that delays  would  arise which would be difficult to overcome if the Telekom's  network monopoly were not be eliminated until 1998, as is  currently planned. Krueger said that one must reconsider this  situation in connection with the postal reform. Krueger, a CDU  member, also pointed out that the agreement of the SPD would be  needed for the reform project.    During the conversations, Krueger was urged to take an  initiative in the field of data highways during the German  chairmanship of the European Union (EU) in the second half of  1994. He agreed to do so. Von Pierer said that something  concrete must be done in this area as soon as possible on both  the German and EU level. As a first step, progress must be made  in standardization on the European level. Moreover, there should  be specific pilot projects. Thus the planned data highways  between Bonn and Berlin should be rapidly tackled, Von Pierer  said.    To open up the multimedia services, a change in the  broadcasting law is necessary, said Woessner. The previous  concept of broadcasting does not fit the new applications. When  the broadcasters' state contract is amended, one must drop the  previous limit, according to which a company may not own more  than 49 percent of the shares of a broadcaster, said Woessner.  Those participating in the conversation stressed that the large  number of future television channels, which is controversial  with the public, is only one of the new applications.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi said he was one of two hooded  hostage-takers who appeared at a Beirut news conference during the 1985  hijacking of a TWA jetliner. Hamadi, charged with air piracy and murder in the  hijacking, made the admission in court in Frankfurt, West Germany, after  officials watched a videotape of the news conference. A U.S. Navy diver was  killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days after the plane was  diverted to Beirut. Hamadi has previously admitted his part in the hijacking  but denies the murder charge.  </P></p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Tenneco goes on prowl for European acquisitions Tenneco, the diversified Houston-based industrial company, is on the prowl for acquisitions in Europe, seeking to redeploy some of the Dollars 360m in cash it raised when it spun off 29 per cent of the JI Case Corporation in June. While the company is not naming any targets, 'we're shooting to get something meaningful done by late Fall,' said Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's chairman. The company is widely believed to be looking for a deal worth Dollars 100m to Dollars 200m to bolster its business in original equipment automotive parts in Europe and supplement its significant European market for after-market components. It is in the midst of one of the biggest corporate restructurings in US history and while this deal will not be the 'defining purchase' that Wall Street analysts are clamouring for, it is important because it sets the tone for later, more significant acquisitions. 'We're being very careful, very systematic in how we go about this,' says Mr Mead, 'We want to be sure we do this one right, because what tends to happen is if you demonstrate you can make one good deal, other good deals will follow.' Mr Mead, who assumed Tenneco's chairmanship following the death of Mr Mike Walsh earlier this year, has become Tenneco's defining force. He directed the turnround in Case's operations last year which allowed Tenneco to spin off part of the farm and construction machinery subsidiary to the public this summer. Its 1985 investment in Case was an error that took Tenneco nearly a decade to recover from. Now, with the Case chapter nearly behind it, Tenneco plans to reinvest in its three remaining core businesses: automotive parts, packaging, and natural gas. Tenneco's second-quarter net income was Dollars 171m, or 93 cents per share, and the company is projected to earn Dollars 850m, or Dollars 4.60 per share, this year. As it did with Case, Tenneco's new management has improved the performances of its UK-based Albright and Wilson chemicals business and its Newport News Shipbuilding company, but is not planning any significant reinvestment in those divisions. Mr John McGinty, a research analyst with CS First Boston, believes Tenneco will sell both businesses within three years, which, combined with the sale of the remaining portions of Case, would leave it with upwards of Dollars 3bn in cash to reinvest, probably in the automotive or packaging industries. 'The big issue right now is what are they going to become?' says Mr McGinty. Mr Mead's answer is that Tenneco wants to become a world-class industrial growth company. That includes pursuing acquisitions in international markets, which often represent the highest growth potential. Mr Mead says a major acquisition outside Tenneco's three main businesses sometime in the future isn't out of the question. 'We've said all along that we're opportunistic,' he notes, 'I don't want to preclude that, but I don't think we'll do that right away.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Apr. 25, INA -- Mayor of Baghdad, Tahir  Muhammad Hassun, condemned the most brutal attack to which  Baghdad had exposed by the United States and its allies in  January 1991.    In a statement to the INA, Mr. Hassun slammed the  continuation of the blockade imposed on the people of Iraq which  had direct harmful effects on the environment and the public  health.    He dealt with suffering of the municipal units under shadow  of the blockade, saying these units were facing acute dearth in  performance after the aggression owing to poor spare parts and  other necessary equipment and the lack of cadres.    He also said that because of the harsh circumstances of the  blockade and its direct and negative impact, the Baghad  Municipality had decided to stop implementing a number of  cultural, touristic and service projects.    Mr. Hassun appealed to all peace-loving people and forces  around the world to understand Iraq's position and cooperate  with the aim of breaking the unjustifiable blockade.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Channel 4 safety net 'will cost it Pounds 500m' Channel 4 claimed yesterday that it will pay ITV companies Pounds 500m over 10 years unless the funding formula linking the two channels is removed. Sir Michael Bishop, the Channel 4 chairman, said yesterday that a funding formula 'designed as an insurance policy for Channel 4 has turned into a golden goose windfall for ITV, creating a substantial liability for the channel it was designed to protect'. The complex formula set out in the 1990 Broadcasting Act was designed to protect Channel 4's remit for innovative programming and provide a safety net when the channel started selling its advertising in competition with ITV. The act requires that all revenue earned by Channel 4 above 14 per cent of total non-satellite television advertising should be divided. Half goes to ITV to provide a safety net, 25 per cent is kept by Channel 4 and 25 per cent goes into a reserve fund. 'The mechanism was cobbled together at the last minute. We were never consulted,' Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, said yesterday. He conceded that Channel 4 had asked for some form of safety net in case of diminished advertising. Last year Channel 4 paid the ITV companies Pounds 38.2m and this year the figure is expected to be Pounds 50m. Channel 4 said Pounds 38m amounted to the channel's entire drama budget. Mr Grade said that his channel would never need the safety net so the money was going straight into ITV profits. He demands a funding change by the beginning of next year. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV Association, said yesterday that 'it would be absolutely wrong to try to unpick one part of the Broadcasting Act'. Estimates of money that would come to ITV from Channel 4 had been a factor in bids for new licences.</p>

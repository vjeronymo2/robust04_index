			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The actual U.S.  agricultural sales to China last year exceeded 500 million U.S.  dollars, although the official figure was 372 million dollars,  the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today.    The official statistics, the department's foreign  agricultural service said, "do not reveal the true level of  trade with China," and re-exports to China from Hong Kong and  informal trade should be included.    According to the department's latest agriculture trade  highlights, most of the U.S. agricultural sales to China are  bulk products such as wheat and cotton. Forest products sales  are also significant.    It estimated that in 1993, total U.S. consumer food  shipments  to China were 221.8 million dollars, six times greater than  official direct shipments, making China the 12th largest U.S.  consumer food market.    Among the most popular U.S. consumer food in China,  according  to the report, are poultry meat products, such as chicken paws  and wings, in addition to snack foods, including fruit and nuts,  and fresh fruit.</p>

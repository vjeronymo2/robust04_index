			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / World Trade News: Hopes for Congress fast-track approval A COMPROMISE proposal, introduced yesterday in the US Senate, improves the chances for congressional approval of the 'fast-track' negotiating authority necessary for an extension of the Uruguay Round trade talks. However, under the plan submitted by Senator Donald Riegle, chairman of the Senate banking committee, Congress would hold a much tighter rein on talks for a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. The fast track is a parliamentary procedure that speeds trade negotiations by allowing Congress only a single yes-or-no vote on trade pacts. Mr Riegle is proposing to grant the fast track for the Uruguay Round but to permit Congress to amend the FTA in selected areas. The senator is typical of many in both houses of Congress, supporting the Uruguay Round but concerned that an FTA would mean the loss of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. The combined opposition to both has put in jeopardy the administration's prime trade objectives. Either the House or the Senate can kill the fast track by voting against it by June 1. In a press conference yesterday, Mr Riegle accused the administration of proposing the pact for foreign policy, rather than economic policy, considerations. The US economy is getting worse, he said, not better. 'Mexico is too poor to buy most of our products, but is often willing to sacrifice its environment and worker safety to lure US companies with low-wage rates,' he said. Mexican workers earn one-tenth of that earned by US workers, and the country's work safety, child labour and environmental laws are only loosely enforced. Under Mr Riegle's proposal, Congress would be permitted to amend an FTA pact in the five areas of greatest congressional concern: labour standards; environmental protection; 'rule of origin' which would prevent other nations from funneling goods through Mexico into the US; assistance for American workers displaced by imports; and dispute resolution.</p>

Thelmo Cunanan has ordered his commanders to tighten security in  all public places in Mindanao.    Cunanan gave the order following information that the group  of terrorists responsible for the blasts at the San Pedro  Cathedral and two Muslim mosques in Davao City last month has  transferred operations to other areas.    The military and police were ordered to secure places like  churches, markets and groceries, where there are crowds.    He asked the public to bear with the inconvenience and  discomfort of checkpoints and inspections.    Meanwhile, Cunanan said police operations will continue  against criminal elements despite the cease fire with the Moro  National Liberation Front.    "We will pursue these criminal elements wherever they are.  We are already taking action against them," Cunanan said.    He said the extremist Abu Sayaf is one of the groups hunted  by the military and the police.    As this developed, former Sulu Representative Sakur Tan  confirmed that the Abu Sayaf group has increased in number and  are equipped with highpowered armament.    Tan, the principal negotiator in the release Monday of  shipyard owner Ricardo Tong after 139 days of captivity, said he  witnessed the gathering up of the Abu Sayaf group when he had a  talk with two of the group's leaders somewhere in Patikul, Sulu.</p>

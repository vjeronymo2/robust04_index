			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUNNINGHAM, EAGLES FEELING BETTER AFTER RALLY BEATS COWBOYS;  </P> <P> NFC: DESPITE PAIN, QUARTERBACK DRIVES PHILADELPHIA TO LAST-MINUTE TOUCHDOWN AND  21-20 VICTORY.  </P> <P> Randall Cunningham was battered and bruised, but not beaten.  </P> <P> Cunningham, working against the clock with a bruised hand and knee, drove the  Philadelphia Eagles 85 yards in 13 plays for the go-ahead touchdown that gave  the Eagles a 21-20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys Sunday.  </P> <P> The winning score came on Cunningham's 10-yard pass to Calvin Williams with 44  seconds left.  </P> <P> "This ranks right up there with the best of our comeback wins," said  Cunningham, who passed for 66 yards and ran for 10 on the drive. "This was a  major gut check and we pulled it off.  </P> <P> "Our two-minute drill worked great and our feeling in the huddle was we weren't  concerned. We knew we could do it."  </P> <P> The Eagles (3-4) got their first victory over an NFC Eastern Division foe in  four tries in beating the Cowboys (3-5) for the sixth consecutive time.  </P> <P> Cunningham, who also suffered a blow to the head during the game, said, "I was  close to coming out of the game because my knee hurt so bad. But I stuck it  out."  </P> <P> Cornerback Issiac Holt blocked a punt to set up Emmitt Smith's three-yard  touchdown run with 4:02 left to give Dallas a 20-14 lead.  </P> <P> "It looked like the blocked punt was going to kill us but Randall put together  one heck of a drive," Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan said. "Dallas played a  great game. We were very fortunate to pull it out at the end."  </P> <P> "That's the way we seem to do things. It was a big game for us and our season."  </P> <P> Ryan said last week there was no way Philadelphia was going to lose to Dallas  and although he was right, he refused to rub it in.  </P> <P> "I love the way that Troy Aikman plays," Ryan said. "Dallas gave us a good  game. Cunningham told me he wanted to win it and he did."  </P> <P> Dallas charged back after Cunningham's last-minute scoring pass, but Ben Smith  broke up a fourth-down pass at the Philadelphia 35 as the final gun sounded.  </P> <P> "You have to give Philadelphia credit," Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson said. "They  made the plays when it counted.  </P> <P> "This was a tough, tough loss. I just wish there was something I could say to  the team to make them feel better."  </P> <P> Reserve fullback Heath Sherman broke four tackles on a 19-yard, fourth-quarter  touchdown run to give the Eagles a 14-6 lead with 10:30 remaining.  </P> <P> But Dallas went 64 yards in four plays, with Aikman connecting with Jay Novacek  on a 19-yard touchdown pass play to narrow the Eagles' lead to 14-13 with 7:53  left.  </P> <P> The blocked punt gave the Cowboys their first lead of the game.  </P> <P> Philadelphia tight end Keith Jackson said the sellout crowd of 63,599 at Texas  Stadium was guilty of celebrating prematurely.  </P> <P> "With four minutes left the people were celebrating like the game was over or  something," Jackson said. "When you have a quarterback like Cunningham anything  is possible."  </P></p>

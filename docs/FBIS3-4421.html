Deputy Secretary Yang Zhenjie made an important speech at a  provincial meeting on work with nationalities and religions  which ended yesterday [5 March]. He said: A political  situation of solidarity and stability in areas inhabited by  minority nationalities has created fine conditions for stability  and development in our province. All the previous provincial  party committees and governments attached importance to work  with nationalities and religions. Party committees and  governments at all levels must carry forward this fine tradition  of attaching importance to work with nationalities and  religions, put it at the top of their agendas, make constant  efforts to investigate and comprehend the situation in these  aspects, and solve existing problems in a timely fashion. This  should start with units at the grass-roots level. Prefectural  and county party committees and governments must truly  strengthen the building of party organizations at the town,  township, and village level, as should state power organizations  as well. They must overcome weakness and laxity. Attaching  importance to work with nationalities and religions must become  the general practice of the entire party and all of society.    Yang Zhenjie continued: It is necessary profoundly and  consistently to provide cadres and people of various  nationalities with education on Marxist views on nationalities  and religions, and with propaganda on socialism and patriotism.  In accordance with the party's policy on nationalities and  religions, we must handle properly any problems arising among  nationalities or religions. We must have a good grasp of the  policy, and must make strict differentiations between, and  correctly handle the two kinds of contradictions of different  natures. It is necessary to truly strengthen management of  religious activities, and to bring religious activities into the  course of the legal system. It is necessary to continue  consolidating and developing the patriotic united front  involving both the party, and people in nationality and  religious circles.    In conclusion, Yang Zhenjie stressed: Accelerating economic  development and social progress in areas inhabited by minority  nationalities is of vital importance to strengthening  nationality solidarity, safeguarding social stability, and  promoting the modernization of the entire province.  Contradictions and problems arising in these areas, in the  final analysis, must be solved through the development of the  economy. Our provincial authorities must give more support to  these areas in terms of funds and material resources, vigorously  develop their cultural and educational undertakings, train more  cadres and scientific-technical personnel of  minority-nationality origin, and try in every possible way to  speed up their economic development. It is necessary to  gradually narrow the gaps between different nationalities in  terms of development, and to achieve common prosperity for  various nationalities.    Yang Huaixiao, member of the provincial party committee  standing committee and vice governor, aired his specific views  on implementing the spirit of the provincial meeting on work  with nationalities and religions. Li Ziqi, Zhu Xuanren, and  Yang Fuxing were present at yesterday's meeting.</p>

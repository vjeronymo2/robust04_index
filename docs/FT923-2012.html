			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Gold shows a muted reaction WHILE IT is true that the gold price has moved ahead this week, the subdued extent of the rise reveals the market's lack of response to the chaos in European currency markets. Yet again, it appears that an international crisis has by-passed the gold market. However, there is no doubt the market is jittery. Gold closed on the London bullion market last night at Dollars 352 a troy ounce, up Dollars 11.75 on the week and Dollars 3.75 on the day. Yesterday's rise came in late trading after a quiet day which saw the afternoon fix at Dollars 347.20. London was boosted by the early advance on Comex, where the active December gold contract was Dollars 4 up at Dollars 353.80 at midday in thin and nervous trading ahead of the weekend IMF meeting in Washington and the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Most of the week's rise came on Monday as traders responded to the morning cuts in German interest rates, and ignored the strength of the dollar. The market rose Dollars 6.30 to close at Dollars 346.25, having moved above Dollars 348 during the day after the New York market opened higher than expected. There was little sign of heavy producer selling and traders said the market was looking to consolidate between Dollars 345 and Dollars 350. That is exactly what it did throughout the currency market upheavals which followed. The London market closed at Dollars 349.40 after the Wednesday hike in UK interest rates, a rise of just over Dollars 3, and eased to Dollars 348.25 on Thursday. Mr Andy Smith, precious metals analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland, believes that gold's behaviour has been unusual rather than remarkable - 'outpacing the dollar's rise and emphasising the Euro-epicentre of the uncertainty.' Taking September 3 as the market low at Dollars 338 and this week's high of Dollars 350, the market shows a rise of 3.5 per cent. In terms of Yen it has risen by 3.9 per cent; in Swiss francs by 6.5 per cent; in D-Marks by 10 per cent; in Lira by 20.6 per cent; in Australian dollars by 2.5 per cent; and in South African Rand by 6.7 per cent. Italy, where local gold prices are up by one-fifth, is the biggest single European market for gold jewellery, Mr Smith points out. At the same time Australian and South African producers are getting ADollars 480 and R1,000 a troy ounce, prices they have been happy to take for forward sales. 'There has got to be something else - another shock - to make the price jump,' says Mr Smith. 'Otherwise the market will come off again.' All eyes in the market will be on the outcome of the French referendum. Trading on the London Metal Exchange has been both nervous and thin during the currency market shenanigans. In the words of Nick Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett: 'Base metal markets have behaved like the proverbial startled rabbit caught in the flare of the headlights.' Copper, showed the most gains, closing yesterday at Pounds 1,383.50 a tonne, up Pounds 141 on the week, but in dollar terms it is only about Dollars 25 ahead. Helping to support prices has been the re-emergence of the threat of industrial action at Poland's KGHM, where a 24-hour strike has been called for next Wednesday. The aluminium market has had only bearish news, particularly the Wednesday news from St Petersburg that exports from the CIS are expected this year to reach at least the same level as in 1991 - 843,000 tonnes - and possibly to exceed that figure by a further 100,000 tonnes. Cash aluminium closed yesterday at Dollars 1,249.50 a tonne, down Dollars 22.50 on the week. Of the softs, the cocoa market has seen the most action, soaring on Wednesday as sterling slumped, triggering short covering purchases. The London December contract closed at Pounds 655 a tonne, but has since retreated to close yesterday at the day's low of Pounds 629, only Pounds 11 ahead on the week. Bearish news arrived from Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trade house owned by ED &amp; F. Man, which yesterday predicted a reduced world cocoa production deficit of only 25,000 tonnes for 1992-93. This compares with an estimated deficit of 88,000 tonnes in the current season. The London market has also ignored this week's International Cocoa Organisation talks, which have mooted the idea of selling off the organisation's buffer stock to Russia with the aim of reviving the country's chocolate industry. But as one delgate put it: 'They are feeding soup to a dead man.'  ------------------------------------     LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS    (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------ tonnes  ------------------------------------ Aluminium  +1,850  to 1,360,500 Copper     +3,275  to   285,075 Lead       +3,075  to   159,900 Nickel       +186  to    44,874 Zinc         +675  to   354,750 Tin          +240  to    14,870  ------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Fuel for thought on VAT: A Tory party memo has found its way to John Willman Chancellor, I thought you might welcome a memorandum setting out the policy options over the extension of VAT to domestic fuel and power, widely blamed for our humiliation in the Christchurch by-election. I assume that you do not wish to withdraw the extension - popular though this would be. VAT on domestic fuel at 8 1/2 per cent in 1994 will raise almost Pounds 1bn; the second-stage increase to 17 1/2 per cent in 1995 will raise Pounds 2.3bn a year thereafter. Unless you put up other taxes to raise similar amounts, the markets would see this as a fatal weakening in your resolve to curb government borrowing. The Treasury gilts people would have a fit. I read in the press that you thought about going ahead with the first-stage rise to 8 1/2 per cent in 1994, but scrapping the second-stage increase. The same newspapers say that the deficit would be made up by extending VAT to other zero-rated items such as food and children's clothes. I assume this bizarre suggestion was designed to frighten backbenchers away from scrapping VAT on domestic fuel. If you are going ahead with VAT on domestic fuel, quick action is needed to substantiate your predecessor's pledge to 'help people on low incomes'. There is good news and bad news, chancellor. The good news is that you can help most people on low incomes - though it will swallow up about a third of the additional rev-enue from the rise in VAT. The bad news is that you can't help everybody. Worse, you can only compensate people for average rises in fuel bills. People with higher-than-average bills will get less than they need and will still feel aggrieved. People who get more than they need are unlikely to draw attention to this. I understand that Peter Lilley (social security secretary) is anxious to announce a package at the party conference in October. Here are some points to think about: Don't make the mistake Mr Portillo (chief secretary to the Treasury) made of saying compensation for higher fuel prices can be left to the annual uprating of social security benefits in line with the retail prices index. First, uprating is retroactive - so pensioners, the disabled and low-income families would get a benefits increase only after a year of paying higher fuel bills. Second, most people know the poorest households spend a higher-than-average proportion of their income on keeping warm and need more than average compensation. Paying an extra 80p a week to people on means-tested benefits from next April would compensate them for VAT at 8 per cent on the average fuel bill of the poorest 20 per cent of households, according to our Social Security Advisory Committee. That means finding about Pounds 360m next year and Pounds 720m a year from 1995 when the second-stage increase is imposed. This looks cheap at the price. We need some way of dealing with the criticism that the fuel price increases will also hit many pensioners just above the income level for means-tested benefits. I suggest we put a decent sum - say Pounds 100m  - into a scheme to provide them with home insulation grants. This would also bolster our green justification of the VAT increase. Politically, the cost of this package, more than Pounds 800m when the full VAT increase is imposed, is a small price to pay. You could always cover the cost by imposing VAT on newspapers which would raise more than Pounds 1bn and teach the treacherous tabloids a lesson.</p>

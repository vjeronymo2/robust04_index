			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (7): Impact is significant  -Foreign direct investment WHILE portfolio flows to all developing countries stagnated somewhat last year, the importance of foreign direct investment continued to grow. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, international direct investment accounted for less than 20 per cent of total private capital flows to developing countries at the beginning of the 1980s. By 1987-89, this had risen to 60 per cent, in part because bank lending had dried up. In Latin America, FDI is already having a significant impact on the region's balance of payments. While in 1988 it was equal to less than a third of the region's net transfers abroad on debt, estimates for 1992 show FDI almost equal to net transfers. Direct investment accounted for 65 per cent of Chile's capital inflows in 1991, and 35 per cent of Mexico's. There is no doubt that contributory factors behind this increasing inflow have stemmed from within the region: the improved macroeconomic performance, more welcoming regulatory regimes, the decline in Latin America's economic nationalism and its privatisation programmes. The development has also come against the background of an extraordinary boom in cross-border investment that continued throughout the 1980s, but which appears to have slowed down in the early 1990s as, one by one, the main industrial economies have sunk into recession. In the 1980s, according to the OECD, the total stock of FDI boomed globally from about Dollars 500bn in 1980 to Dollars 1,500bn today. Worldwide flow of FDI grew in the 1980s at an unprecedented average rate of about 29 per cent, reaching close to Dollars 200bn in 1990. This growth rate was five times that of world exports and 10 times world output. Such rapid growth meant that the percentage of FDI going to developing countries fell markedly in the 1980s, even as in absolute terms the amount rose. The proportion going to developing countries declined from 20 per cent in 1980-84 to just over 10 per cent in 1985-89; Latin America's share of the total dropped from 7.4 to 3 per cent of global inflows and that of Africa from 2.5 to 0.6 per cent. In the years 1985-90, when overall cross-border direct investment in industrialised countries was growing at around 30 per cent a year, FDI into Latin America was expanding at a more modest rate of 11 per cent. ACCORDING to the figures, global FDI peaked in 1989 and fell in 1990 - a development in part related to the end of the debt-financed cross-border mergers and acquisitions boom in industrialised economies in the late 1980s. The OECD figures unfortunately stop in 1990 and therefore it is difficult to be more exact about developments since then. However, there can be little doubt that overall cross-border FDI fell sharply in 1991 and 1992. Meanwhile, figures from the World Bank suggest continuing growth in FDI to all developing countries and into Latin America in 1991 and 1992. Indeed, 1989 appears to have marked a low point for the relative share that Latin America took in total FDI and in FDI to developing countries. Thus it seems that the growth of foreign direct investment in the region is more than a function of the FDI boom of the 1980s. In some senses, this continued growth in developing countries may in part be a reaction to that boom: most acquisitions within the industrialised world during the 1980s are already considered to have been overpriced failures. In part, aggressive privatisation - which can happen only once - has swollen the figures. Balancing this though,debt-for-equity swap programmes with subsidies for non-privatisation investments have been largely abandoned or have become irrelevant (as the secondary market prices of its debt rose close to face value) in the case of Chile. According to Ms DeAnne Julius, chief economist of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group Latin America, the increased FDI flows to developing countries may be more than a short-term phenomenon. She calculates that FDI to developing countries could grow from Dollars 30bn in 1990 to Dollars 80bn (in 1990 dollars) in 2000, representing 30 per cent of world flows against 17 per cent in 1990. Latin America, she notes, overtook east Asia as an FDI destination in 1990. The continued rise of FDI into Latin America is important too because it demonstrates that Latin America may have less to fear from eastern Europe than most of its governments thought perhaps two or three years ago.</p>

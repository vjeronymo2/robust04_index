			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S VIETNAM MEMORIAL  </P> <P> As a World War II front-line nurse in the admittance tent of an evacuation  hospital in Europe, I have tried for many years to get Colorado congressmen to  support a statue of the World War II combat nurses to no avail. Nurses  volunteered, we were not drafted. Many men would have died if they had not  received front-line care.  </P> <P> The nurses on Corregidor suffered the most. I saw some at Fort Dix when they  returned. I'll never forget the faces of these young women. Faces of wounded  and dead servicemen still are in my mind after 44 years. We all suffered shock.  </P> <P> Nurses deserve a statue for service in any war that a man has a statue erected  to him. We helped to preserve democracy.  </P> <P> ISABELLE P. DEXTER  </P> <P> Arvada, Colo.  </P></p>

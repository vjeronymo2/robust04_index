			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 17 May (MTI) -- Emphasizing the similar  and complementary features of both of their parties' policy  goals and fostering dialogue rather than debate was the main aim  of today's electoral forum hosted by prime minister candidate  for the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) Gabor Kuncze and the  top economic specialist of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP),  Laszlo Bekesi. The forum, held in Budapest, was intended as a  preliminary to the May 29 run-off of the parliamentary elections.    Bekesi and Kuncze said they see no obstacles to a governing  coalition being formed between the two parties, and they both  agreed that the new government should be led by a pragmatic and  active prime minister.    Bekesi said the new prime minister should be a diplomatic  personality with a great deal of tolerance, who would be able to  introduce even the bitter pills by making people understand the  sweetness they will bring in the future. The two men also feel  that the Hungarian economy will reach its deepest point of  recession next year.    Analysing the current state and prospects of the Hungarian  economy, Bekesi said the next government would have a much more  limited scope of action and resources for tackling much heavier  tasks. "Despite the extremely strict measures the next  government will have to take, Hungary's economic performance may  decrease even next year," Bekesi said.    Kuncze added that, due to the erroneous or belated decisions  of the outgoing government, the new one would have to adopt a  forced course on seeking solutions for the economic ills. "The  Hungarian economy is in a worse situation than it was four years  ago," he said. He stressed the need for creating a more  cost-efficient state, and phasing out all useless offices and  functions. Kuncze forecast a 5 percent drop in real incomes  next year, and Bekesi expects a 4 to 5 percent decline.</p>

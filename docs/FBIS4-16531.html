			<p>BFN     [Text] Within 10 days Ukrainian and Russian delegates are  to submit to their heads of state a draft treaty on the division  of the Black Sea Fleet. This was disclosed by Ukraine's  President Leonid Kravchuk at a news-conference in Kiev last  night upon his arrival from Moscow.    As he revealed, at a meeting with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin on Friday agreement was reached to set up a Russian  naval base in Ukraine. However, as Kravchuk emphasized, it will  be "a base, rather than bases," and its site, in his words, will  be chosen at state level bilateral talks.    The Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, who attended  the negotiations on the navy division, told newsmen that, in his  opinion, such a base could be leased to Russia for up to five  years.    Kravchuk stressed that before the lease treaty takes effect  it must be ratified by Ukraine's parliament.    He argued that Ukraine claims 15-20 percent of the Black Sea  Fleet's ships and recalled with reference to the Yalta accords  that Ukraine would be entitled to one half of the fleet, if it  were divided. However, as he remarked, Ukraine is ready to sell  Russia its portion of the fleet, which, as he explained, Ukraine  does not need to guarantee its defence potential.    He voiced displeasure with the Black Sea Navy Commander,  Admiral Eduard Baltin. He said he would be prepared to revoke  his approval of Baltin's appointment to the post of commander  and would do so if "the process of negotiations drags on." "If  not, I will have nothing to do with the Russian Black Sea Fleet  Commander," he said.    As he explained, on Friday the defence ministers of Ukraine  and Russia were told to instruct the subordinate units to  resolve all conflicts and abide by the achieved accords in their  future actions. All conflicts similar to those in Odessa have  been settled for good. This view is shared by the leaders of  Ukraine and Russia alike, he declared.    He reaffirmed an invitation to Yeltsin to pay an official  visit to Ukraine after the preparation of a comprehensive  friendship and cooperation treaty.    He voiced hope that such an accord would be ready in the  first half of 1994.    Another round of talks on the Black Sea Navy division was  scheduled for 22 April in Moscow.</p>

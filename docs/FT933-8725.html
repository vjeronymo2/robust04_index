			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price drops below Dollars 370 GOLD'S PRICE dropped below Dollars 370 a troy ounce in late London trading yesterday in very nervous market conditions. Selling by some of the same US investment funds that helped drive the price above Dollars 400 an ounce less than two weeks ago had been responsible for gold's steady slide since Monday, traders suggested. Funds started selling again yesterday after publication of US economic data showing inflation was firmly under control, some dealers said. Nervousness was also compounded by rumours, not widely believed, that a European central bank was selling gold. Others attributed the US funds' decision to move out of gold to calmer conditions in world currency markets. Gold closed in London at Dollars 373.50, down Dollars 1.75 an ounce. But late trading took the full impact of the fund activity and the price dropped to Dollars 364.85 an ounce at one point last night. One dealer suggested there was 'very solid support' for the price at Dollars 360. He expected gold to be very volatile in the next few weeks, with price swings of Dollars 10-Dollars 15 an ounce likely, until physical demand picked up in September.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY;  </P> <P> ROSENBERG EXHIBIT AT SDSU COMPARES 1950S TO PRESENT;  </P> <P> AFTER ALL, A NATION GROWS UP, LEARNS ITS LESSONS. DOESN'T IT?  </P> <P> Margaret Randall poses that question in her introduction to the book, "The  Rosenbergs: Collected Visions of Artists and Writers." An account of her own  experience provides some answers.  </P> <P> An American-born poet and photographer, Randall moved to Mexico in 1961. When  she returned to the United States to live in 1984, she had to petition for  residency. During her interview with the Immigration and Naturalization  Service, several of her books were spread before her. Passages critical of U.S.  foreign policy were highlighted in yellow. There, she writes, "I encountered my  first tangible evidence that the McCarthy Era is still very much alive in this  country."  </P> <P> That the constricted freedoms of the 1950s have parallels in the present was  something that had also occurred to Rob Okun, editor of "The Rosenbergs," which  was published last year. Okun, referring to the period in terms of its victims  rather than its chief persecutor, organized the exhibition, "Unknown Secrets:  Art and the Rosenberg Era," with curator Nina Felshin.  </P> <P> The show, at the San Diego State University Art Gallery through Oct. 6,  impresses a formidable weight on the consciences of its viewers. It testifies  to the lingering presence of anti-communism, anti-Semitism and the government's  desire to streamline political beliefs -- forces that were instrumental in the  conviction and execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.  </P> <P> All of the artists in the show, whether working in the '50s or the '80s, assume  the Rosenbergs' innocence of the charges of passing secrets of the atomic bomb  to the Soviet Union. (Okun states in "The Rosenbergs" that he could find no  examples of anti-Rosenberg art.) Most relegate facts and figures of the case to  the background of their work. They use historical data as a framework upon  which to construct statements about such broader, ever topical issues as  scapegoating, paranoia and fear of the "other."  </P> <P> Several artists who responded to the Rosenberg case as it transpired adopted a  direct, imploring tone in their paintings and prints. The urgency of their  </P> <P> appeal finds its most powerful form in a woodcut by the Mexican artist  Francisco Mora. The poster, from 1952, pleads for letters to be sent to the  U.S. president to "stop the crime" of the Rosenbergs' impending execution. The  poster shows a strong, bare arm reaching out and preventing the richly adorned  arm of American industry from pulling the switch to send the Rosenbergs to  their death.  </P> <P> Other works from the '50s humanize the couple whose case has become a symbol of  cold-war politics. Pablo Picasso's delicate lithograph of the faces of Ethel  and Julius Rosenberg brings the notoriety of the case down to an intimate,  personal scale. Fernand Leger's silk screen, "Liberty, Peace, Solidarity,"  approaches lyricism with its hovering streaks of lavender, yellow and red, its  tender depiction of the Rosenbergs beside a dove and the gentle meeting of two  hands, one handcuffed and the other free.  </P> <P> Beyond humanizing the Rosenbergs, many artists from both the past and present  attempt to portray the beleaguered couple as heroes. Rupert Garcia's large  pastel portraits of Ethel and Julius are monumental and sympathetic. Newspaper  photographs of the pair kissing and being carted off in a police van recur in  other works with the frequency and often the reverential treatment of icons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sentimentality Dissipates  </P> <P> Most of the sentimentality that crops up in the work of the 1950s has  dissipated by the 1980s, and the contemporary artists invited to participate in  the show regard the Rosenberg case with keen scrutiny and a sharp sense of its  ramifications for the present. Their work tends to be more analytical, but no  less gripping.  </P> <P> Although portraits such as Picasso's and Garcia's humanize the Rosenbergs, many  of the contemporary works focus on the forces and strategies that dehumanized  them in the first place. Deborah Small's "Witch Hunt" blares out a cacophonous  cry of labels used to brand those who deviate from the political mainstream.  "Pinko," "provocateur," "pawn," "dupe," "devil" and "Judas of democracy" are  spelled out in painted blocks and arranged in rows across the wall,  interspersed with communist symbols, blacklists and historical references to  the hunting down of witches.  </P> <P> Robert Arneson sets his bronze double-portrait of the Rosenbergs on the floor,  their open mouths and hollow eyes giving them the appearance of falling down a  deep well. Across their foreheads runs the label, "2 Fried Commie Jew Spies."  </P> <P> Such disturbing images shift attention from the crime purportedly committed by  the Rosenbergs to the crime inflicted on them. Sue Coe's haunting painting of  truth strapped into the electric chair suggests the importance of martyrs in  fulfilling the "Needs of the State."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Touring Through 1991  </P> <P> This show has been touring nationally for a year already, and will stop in four  more cities through 1991. Its presence in San Diego is particularly timely, for  it adds fuel to a local debate over government censorship of the arts.  Installation gallery, which originally planned to host "Unknown Secrets,"  recently was denied public funding for its exhibition program after sponsoring  a billboard critical of the city. This show not only argues against such  censorship but also makes a strong case for renewed support of Installation's  program.  </P> <P> On a national level, Congress is grappling with the issue of arts censorship. A  proposal to temporarily "blacklist" two arts institutions for having promoted  work deemed offensive and obscene is under discussion, as is an amendment to  bar such work from receiving federal support. Many of the works in "Unknown  Secrets" certainly would be denied funding under the proposed criteria simply  because they use religious imagery or the symbol of the flag to empower their  message.  </P> <P> At the heart of both the current show and the congressional debate is art's  power to affect society. By teaching, provoking, posing questions and rubbing  raw our blind faith in the system, "Unknown Secrets" asserts the positive  impact of that power. Many of today's leaders fear that power and are therefore  attempting to control it and legislate its boundaries. Maybe some nations never  do learn their lessons.  </P></p>

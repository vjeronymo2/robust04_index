			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Waterford Wedgwood at IPounds 10m - Lack of exceptionals and growth in crystal side behind turnround The sparkle has returned to Waterford Wedgwood, the luxury ceramics and crystal manufacturer, which after six years of losses has reported a IPounds 10.1m (Pounds 9.7m) pre-tax profit for 1993. Pre-tax losses of IPounds 17m for 1992 included an exceptional charge of IPounds 18.4m for restructuring costs and losses on property disposals. Turnover rose by 17 per cent to IPounds 319m and operating profits improved by 80 per cent to IPounds 16.5m. Year-end gearing dropped from 54 per cent to 41 per cent. The main improvement came from the crystal division where operating profits grew from IPounds 500,000 to IPounds 7.8m, on turnover up 34 per cent to IPounds 102m. According to Mr Paddy Galvin, chief executive of the division, restructuring at its Irish plants, the introduction of 250 new products in the past two years, better market conditions and improved marketing have all contributed to the turnround. 'We will not be satisfied though until we are achieving margins of at least 15 per cent on sales,' he said. Outsourced products in its middle-market Marquis range of stemware, introduced in 1991, now accounted for 12 per cent of turnover he said. He added that margins on products from the Irish plants continued to lag behind outsourced products, but those were improving as a result of the rationalisation measures and more flexible working practices. Operating profits at the Wedgwood ceramics division edged up to IPounds 10.7m (IPounds 10.5m) on turnover up 10 per cent to IPounds 193m. Mr Kneale Ashwell, chief executive of Wedgwood, said recession in the Japanese market had been the main cause of tighter margins. The company's currency hedging policy has meant that the full benefits of the devaluations of sterling and the punt in 1992 and 1993 respectively, will not be felt until this year. Earnings per share were 1.27p (2.69p losses) and there is no dividend. COMMENT The prolonged and painful restructuring appears to have finally paid off, with the result that management and unions are now working together and are better attuned to what the luxury products market is demanding in the 1990s. A carry-over of tax losses for the next three to five years and upturn in the group's main overseas markets point to a strong recovery in earnings. Pre-tax profits of IPounds 23m and an eps of 2.5p look achievable this year giving a prospective 1994 p/e of 21. No basement bargains here for the moment, but as earnings look set to outpace other Irish industrials in the medium term, the current share price is not excessive.</p>

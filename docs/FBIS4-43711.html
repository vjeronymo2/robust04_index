			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Thierry Portes: "Faced With Balladur, the UDF </F> and RPR Step Up the Pace"]    [Text] Now that the last electoral hurdle before the  presidential election is past, those close to [French Democratic  Union, UDF] President) Valery Giscard d'Estaing and [Rally for  the Republic (RPR) President] Jacques Chirac intend to "regain  control" and reduce [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur's room to  maneuver with regard to the big 1995 election date between now  and the summer. This is an offensive which the prime minister  hopes to contain by relying on his political contacts,  especially within the liberal-centrist confederation, and by  relaunching the government's action.    The UDF and RPR leaderships did not take long to learn the  lessons of the majority's division in the European elections.  Charles Millon, chairman of the UDF group in the National  Assembly who is close to Valery Giscard d'Estaing, on the one  hand; and RPR Secretary General Alain Juppe and his deputy  Jean-Louis Debre, who are both close to Jacques Chirac, on the  other, have reached the same conclusion: The majority will find  it difficult to present a single candidate in the first round of  the presidential election.    It is the success of Mr. de Villiers' list in the European  elections which has just reduced this likelihood, they explain,  without regretting it too much. The chasm into which [former  Socialist Party, PSF Secretary General] Michel Rocard, the  former "natural candidate of the PSF," fell on 12 June permits  an extremely bold stance.    For instance, Mr. Millon has just stated that the "majority  union is not enough." Mr. Debre talks of "the obvious  impossibility of preventing a particular majority figure from  seeking the supreme office...."    Mr. Juppe, also thinking about the presidential election,  wondered whether it would not have been preferable in the  European elections to "organize a competition with one candidate  for each of the big families" of the majority. From questions  to calculations, the UDF and RPR leaderships postponed the  question of the single candidate in 1995 and proposed, in the  meantime, a "contract" to the majority leaders.    In his "contract," Mr. Millon calls on the UDF and RPR each  to establish a plan for the coming seven-year term. After that,  he explained with false naivete, the majority will see whether  it should have one or several candidates in the presidential  election.    Mr. Juppe, speaking on the RPR's behalf, has just given  approval to this approach. In his "contract," Mr. Debre was  anxious to reaffirm that "the political parties should not  impose their plan on the candidate for the supreme office,"  because it is for him and him alone to present his plan,  according to Gaullist precepts.  <H5>  Chirac in Readiness </H5>   This detail comes at the right time, because Jacques Chirac  is now ready to present the broad outlines of his presidential  platform. The ideal, for the Chirac supporters, would therefore  be for the UDF and RPR leaderships to agree to "bury," at least  temporarily, the principle of the single candidate.    Then, between now and the long vacation, Jacques Chirac  should sound out the majority with some of his proposals. If no  more than some 20 UDF deputies, among all those who are being  approached by the RPR leadership, approve of the broad outlines  put forward, Jacques Chirac, taking care not to officially enter  the race, would have given greater credibility to his candidacy  for the highest office.    This is obviously all just conjecture. Mr. Chirac, who had  discovered on his return from Vietnam that his close aides were  thinking of him to head the majority list in the European  elections, is currently in the United States.    In addition, [Interior Minister] Pasqua and [Assembly  Speaker] Seguin are due to express their views on Sunday [19  June]. The most elementary courtesy therefore makes it  necessary not to move too quickly.    For his part, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, who also hopes to play  his presidential card, has announced that between now and the  summer, he would make proposals "for the return to full  employment."    But the UDF president is not in a good position in the  opinion polls, and the Republican Party leadership, currently  the guardian of Mr. Balladur's interests, is trying to resist  him. "We want to exist and we do not want others to make  decisions for us," Ladislas Poniatowski said yesterday on Monte  Carlo Radio, to explain the PR deputies' latest acrobatic  maneuver. This party's spokesman said that "we must seek a  candidate who attracts the greatest possible consensus." And  that "it is obvious that" Edouard Balladur "now has this image  more than the others."</p>

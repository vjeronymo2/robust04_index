			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> OPENING TO NEW EAST ASIAN WORLD;  </P> <P> THE COLD WAR ENDED AND ERASED IN THE PROCESS THE SCHEME OF REGIONAL RELATIONS.  A UNIFIED KOREA COULD BE THE KEY TO A COHESIVE NEW FRAMEWORK.  </P> <P> The Cold War ended with the dismantling of Soviet military-political alliances.  In its wake, America's network of alliance systems worldwide has also begun to  unravel. While the end of the Cold War can only be welcomed, the post-Cold War  era has not yet fully begun. Even in Europe where a new structure of security  is being built upon the foundations provided by the Helsinki process, concerns  remain about the durability of the new order. If questions about stability  still remain in Europe, then such questions apply even more broadly to East  Asia, the next region in line to undergo the transition out of the Cold War.  </P> <P> In fact, the heat of superpower confrontation in East Asia has already  diminished to a considerable extent, which in turn will inevitably lead to a  fundamental restructuring of existing arrangements. We already see the first  manifestations of this process in the improvement of Soviet and American  relations with former adversaries in the region. Moscow has normalized  relations with Beijing and will soon do the same with Seoul, and in time, with  Tokyo. The United States has started a dialogue with Vietnam and is ready to  see a resolution to the conflict in Cambodia.  </P> <P> The two superpowers also face the daunting task for redefining their alliance  relations in the region. Moscow has reduced its presence in Vietnam, and now  confronts the need to fundamentally reorder its relationship with North Korea.  Washington must also contemplate a new set of relations with its regional  allies such as Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.  </P> <P> On the whole, the unfolding dynamic in East Asia is a healthy one. However,  there is at the moment no alternative framework capable of providing new  sources of cohesion among the various countries within it. Without such a  framework, continued erosion of the present system can create new sources of  tension, even as it removes Cold War-inspired ones. For example, a  Soviet-Japanese resolution of the Northern Territories (Kuril Islands) issue  will remove the basis for the U.S. military presence in Japan, and thereby  undermine one of the central pillars upon which postwar Tokyo-Washington  relations have been built. Inevitably, other dimensions of the bilateral  relationship between these two countries will also be affected.  </P> <P> Similarly, if North-South Korean talks proceed smoothly, calls for removal of  U.S. troops from Korea will also grow. Uncertainties arising from erosion of  U.S.-led alliances, however, pale in comparison to the unpredictability  inherent in any comprehensive change of Soviet regional policy. For example,  reduced Soviet support could lead the North Koreans to initiate reforms of  their own or, by raising their frustration to extreme levels, trigger vengeful  and destructive actions.  </P> <P> If the postwar military alliance net works that the United States and the  Soviet Union forged with various East Asian states become increasingly less  relevant, what sort of post-Cold War arrangement can we envision that would  ensure both cohesion and continued progress for the region? Who is to provide  leadership in creating a post-Cold War order in East Asia? Conventional wisdom  has long held that a multilateral arrangement for regional security and  cooperation is not feasible. This line of reasoning, however, resulted from the  fact that no agreement could be expected among the powers so long as Cold War  tensions remained. In such a confrontational environment, moreover, no state  could be accorded legitimacy to initiate steps toward building such a  framework.  </P> <P> Thus, questions remain about future structure and leadership for the region.  The United States may wish to hold onto its pre-eminent regional position, but  its growing reluctance to underwrite the costs of leadership suggests that it  cannot retain its current position over the longer term. Japan clearly  possesses the economic and financial wherewithal sure to be required for such  leadership. Unfortunately, few in the region would like to see an increase in  Japan's political clout alongside its already preponderant economic role. The  Soviet Union is clearly in no position to assume leadership. China certainly is  not up to the task, either.  </P> <P> Some have been tempted to argue for a condominium of sorts between the United  States and Japan, with the former providing the larger balance of political  leadership while the latter takes a relatively bigger role in economic matters.  </P> <P> Such thinking, however, is seriously deficient. Neither Beijing nor Moscow is  likely to view the emergence of such an arrangement favorably. It is not clear  that other countries in the region would fully welcome it, either. Also, such  thinking seeks to preserve the status quo at a time when farsighted policies  are needed.  </P> <P> Taking all this into account, let's consider the international role for a  unified, democratic and economically strong Korea. There are several reasons  why this new nation could have the necessary legitimacy to initiate steps  toward the creation of a post-Cold War multilateral arrangement.  </P> <P> In marked contrast to the other powers in the region, Korea does not have a  history of external aggression or interference. A unified Korea would still be  in no position to seek dominance in Asia. Also, having long endured the  consequences of superpower machinations, Korea would have a genuine interest in  seeing a stable arrangement worked out that will balance the interests of the  big as well as the smaller states in the region. Finally, though it will be in  no position to have hegemonic ambitions, a unified Korea will not be an  insignificant regional power. With a combined population of 64 million,  enhanced economic and political power and cultural affinity with most of the  actors in the region, Korea's voice would be respected but not feared.  </P> <P> It is clear that Korea, divided as a result of confrontation between the major  powers, cannot be united without mutual cooperation. In turn, this Korean state  will be in a unique position and have a vital interest in ensuring that the  momentum created by unification leads to a broader effort toward the creation  of a regional, multilateral framework.  </P> <P> Such a future is possible but not inevitable. Several developments could  undermine it. A resumption of hostile conflict between the two Koreas would end  all prospects for unification. Another negative outcome could result from the  superpowers' attempt to use the reunification process for short-term gains. For  instance, if Moscow sought to use Korea as a lever against Japan, or if the  United States sought to prolong division in order to retain the basis for its  military presence in the region, then neither unification nor a regionwide  framework is likely.  </P> <P> At a minimum the major powers must recognize and work to prevent the outbreak  of armed hostilities on the peninsula. Even more important, they must not  perceive the end of division in Korea as merely the removal of one hot spot  among many in the world. They must see Korea's unification as a key to opening  the way to the creation of a new order in East Asia.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Karimov considers as inefficient  transformations in some republic's industries. Addressing in  Tashkent the government meeting, he said that the chemical and  machine-building industries are working inadequately.    The president has leveled criticism at the managers who  believe that the disruption of economic ties among the Republics  of the former Soviet Union is the reason for the production  slump. He believes that these leaders do not take advantage of  the economic possibilities opened lately due to the Republic's  transfer to the free market relations and inadequately use the  reserves and rich resources of Uzbekistan.    The president said negligent leaders of enterprises and  industries have found a good niche. The president is  particularly concerned by the fact that the nostalgic sentiments  have not become a thing of the past in some places. Karimov  believes that many leaders continue working without due account  of peculiarities of the market and interests of the Republic.  The president is sure that the use of outdated forms and  methods makes it impossible to build a state with a great future.</p>

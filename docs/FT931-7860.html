			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (17): Too few desirable models - Used Cars THE growing number of canny business motorists who buy their cars 'nearly new' instead of straight from the showroom - and save thousands on early-months depreciation - are in for a shock this year. The cars they seek are likely to be in far shorter supply than they have been for years, and what stocks there are will be picked over by hard-pressed car dealers before the end-users get a look in. At the other end of the scale, the used car market is becoming increasingly clogged with high mileage three- and four-year-old business cars, which recession-hit businesses kept for too long in extended leasing deals. These models, often with more than 100,000 miles 'on the clock' are proving unattractive to private buyers who, in better times, would be their natural second owners. Worst of all, because private buyers of new cars have been in full retreat for three years, the flow of trade-ins to dealers they provide - the best used car stock of all - has dwindled alarmingly. It all adds up to crisis in the used car business. In a nutshell, the potential buyers can't get enough of the cars they want, and the cars most readily available are largely unwanted. 'This complex combination of factors, plus the fact that everyone is short of money, looks like making things things very tough in used car retailing as the year goes on,' says Mr David Raeside, editor of the trade newspaper, Motor Trader. 'There will be some good cars about very early in the year, but quite soon they're going to be much harder to find.' The root of the crisis is the rise of a British 'nearly new' car culture in the second half of the 1980s, following a similar US trend. Volume car sellers such as Ford, Vauxhall Rover and Peugeot, desperate to increase market share and keep their factories at capacity, began selling lots of cars to big daily rental companies. As the recession has grown in severity the selling - at discounts reputed to be as high as 40 per cent - has become more and more of a lifeline for the car companies. For some, discounted sales to fleets and rental outfits have been accounting for as much as a third of total volume. Laughing all the way to the bank, the rental companies have been selling at auction, sometimes at a net profit, and ordering more new models. At the height of the business, about 18 months ago, some hire companies were keeping their cars for as little as three or four months and 3,000 miles before replacing them. Commonly, a Ford Fiesta, bought for Pounds 8,500, might go through the auctions at six months and with just 5-10,000 miles on the clock, at not much more than Pounds 5,000. Bigger cars showed even larger percentage price falls. Not surprisingly, dealers have been up in arms at the companies' practice, over the past five or six years, of selling cars to big customers at far less than to their own franchised networks - which have to operate from premises which are often plush and expensive. Dealers have been operating on margins of 18 to 20 per cent and coming under strong customer demand to provide discounts up to 15 per cent. Last year, when rental companies, notably Hertz, began retailing their own ex-hire cars directly to the public, dealers hit the roof. Typical of their reactions is this from Mr Terry Dignan, chairman of the Wolverton Motor Company, who called the move 'a double whammy on the motor trade' and claimed it showed car companies had lost control of their own franchising system.' 'The recession has hit our business,' says one West Country sales director, 'but a lot of our regular customers, who might have bought anyway, have become reluctant to lose so much money so quickly on their new cars.' There is little doubt that the car firms would like to curb the practice of selling hugely discounted cars to hire fleets; both Mr Ian McAllister of Ford and Mr Peter Batchelor of Vauxhall have said so. But the company that stops first risks losing market share, and history seems to indicate that gentlemen's agreements do not work in cases like this. Mr Peter Vardy, chairman of the north-east dealer group Reg Vardy, has been an enthusiastic dealer in nearly new ex-hire cars for the past few years, seeing them as a way of providing economical cars to private buyers for whom showroom cars have become too expensive. He notes a new firmness in the way car makers are resolving to curb the sale of ultra-cheap cars to fleets. 'They all say there will be fewer of these sales this year,' he reports, 'and they sound as if they mean it. But then again, they all said it last year  ..' According to Mr Vardy, the availability of nearly-new cars puts alert dealers at no disadvantage: it presents them with a source of good cars they can sell a lot cheaper than new, while making a healthier profit per unit than the Pounds 200-Pounds 400 they take on, say, a new small Ford after discount. 'As long as the cars go through the auctions, we'll be standing there to buy them,' he says. He is sure, however, that the market needs an end to the two-tier sales system, which will lead to a firming of residual values, to get completely back into its stride - December showroom sales surge notwithstanding. 'New cars for private people have become too dear because the makers have been selling so cheaply to hire fleets,' he declares. 'When that ends we'll get buyer confidence back, and the world will turn a lot more sweetly.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               ACQUISITION METHOD (figures in percentages)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Size of fleet             (Totals)   6-9   10-19   20-49   50-99   100+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Straightforward purchase     43       46     31      33      43     46 Purchase with trade-in        3       14     11       9       -      1   Hire purchase               3       20     10       5       7      1 Contract hire                45       17     40      43      46     46 'Open-ended' or    'finance leasing'          5        3      3       9       4      4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company Seceretary's Review Survey of Company Car Schemes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

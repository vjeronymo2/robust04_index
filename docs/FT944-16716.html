			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / People: Leven on the rise at Holiday Inn Bass, the UK brewing and leisure group, has appointed Michael Leven president and chief operating officer of its Holiday Inn subsidiary. The appointment to this newly-created position led to speculation by leisure analysts yesterday that Leven was being groomed to take over from Bryan Langton, Holiday Inn's chairman and chief executive. The only flaw in this view is that the two men are too close in age. Langton is 57, with three years to go until retirement. Leven is only a year younger. Bass said yesterday that no conclusions should be drawn from the appointment except that Holiday Inn believed Leven had a job to do. The chain recently announced a rebranding of its most expensive hotels, the Crowne Plaza properties, which will no longer carry the Holiday Inn name. The company has also embarked on an aggressive expansion campaign. Over the past two years it has, on average, opened a new hotel every second day. It now operates or franchises over 1,900 hotels in 60 countries. Ian Prosser, Bass chairman, says Leven will be responsible for Holiday Inn's worldwide hotel operations and sales; Langton would focus more closely on strategic issues. Leven joined Holiday Inn in 1990 as head of franchising in the Americas, after serving as a senior executive with several US hotel companies. He became president of Holiday Inn's Americas division last year.</p>

			<p>Reactor   `FUGEN'   <F P=102> 94FE0275A Tokyo FUJITSU in Japanese Sep 93 pp 448-454--FOR  OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0275A </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo FUJITSU </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kazutoshi Isomura, Shigeki Okamura and Jun </F> Suganami]    [Text]  <H5>  Abstract </H5>   An isolation management support system has been developed  for  the isolation process of the advanced thermal reactor (ATR)  "FUGEN." The isolation process identifies problems in plant  equipment during maintenance and requires extensive preparation  and management.    This system was designed to prevent errors from occurring  during the isolation process, and to reduce labor costs and  waste, and speed up data retrieval.    This system can centrally control the isolation procedure  and  the reactor's equipment. It can also display the status of  individual pieces of equipment on a workstation.    This comprehensive and easy-to-use system greatly improves  the reliability and efficiency of isolation management.  <H5>  Foreword </H5>   With the goal of establishing a nuclear fuel cycle to ensure  energy for Japan, the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development  Corporation (PNC) is working on technological developments for  uranium exploration, uranium enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing  and waste disposal, and on developing next-generation advanced  power reactors such as the fast breeder reactor (FBR) and the  ATR.    Construction of the Fugen ATR power plant (hereafter, FUGEN)  prototype[.sup]1[/] began in 1970, and it has operated  normally since full-scale operation began in March 1979. So far,  there have been 10 scheduled inspections and a great deal of  modification and maintenance work.    When doing inspection or repair work on FUGEN equipment,  valves on either end of the equipment to be worked on are shut  off to isolate the equipment from the system, and power is shut  off and operating switches disconnected to prevent accidental  operation of the equipment. This is called isolation. In  scheduled inspections of power plants, which are required by law  to be conducted annually, this isolation affects operation and  many systems in a complex manner, so controlling the state of  the plant is an extremely difficult task. This involves tens of  thousands of operations per year, and it takes a tremendous  amount of labor and time to carry out the various work involved  in isolation.    For this reason, the introduction of a system aimed at  reducing and accelerating the work and increasing reliability  was desired.    In this article, we will discuss in summary form the  isolation support system that was developed for FUGEN in  response to this need.    Basic concept study and pilot system development began in  1983, and the first version of the system was completed and put  to use in 1988. Subsequently, the system has been used in three  scheduled inspections; several system performance upgrades have  been instituted; and user interface was improved by introducing  the S family workstation in 1992.  <H5>  Development Goals </H5>   Isolation    Isolation refers to work that is done during facility  inspection or repair to isolate the equipment being worked on  from the plant by shutting off valves around the equipment or  cutting off power. This is extremely important in terms of  preventing breakdown of other systems, protecting equipment and  the facility and ensuring operator safety.    Figure 1 shows an example of isolation. When pump X is to be  inspected, valve A, which is upstream of pipes connected to pump  X, is turned to the "shut" position from the "open" position  (normal operation). This stops water from flowing to pump X.  Next, valve B, which is downstream, is turned to "shut" in the  same way, and pump X is isolated from the plant. This operation  implements the isolation, and then the equipment to be worked on  (pump X) can be removed and inspected. After inspection is  completed, the above steps are reversed to lift the isolation  and restore normal operation.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-35A>      Figure 1: Isolation </FIG>    The following are isolation duties, the series of steps  involved in carrying out isolation:    1. Isolation planning    2. Drafting of isolation plan list    3. Drafting of isolation execution note    4. Isolation execution    5. Drafting of isolation release note    6. Isolation release    7. Verification of isolation notes    8. Isolation management    When drawing up an isolation plan, the range and steps  involved must be checked for possible interference with other  isolation plans (in which a different status is planned for the  same period). Using the earlier example, if pump X must be left  "on" for another operation, the inspection period for pump X  must be adjusted so as not to conflict with this operation.    The isolation execution note is affixed to the equipment on  which isolation steps will be taken during isolation execution.  The note consists of a management number and isolation status,  so that it is clear at a glance what kind of work is to be done  on that equipment. This will prevent accidental operation of the  equipment for other tasks.    The isolation release note is carried when doing work to  return equipment to normal operation and lift the isolation. The  isolation release note consists of a management number and  restoration status. Therefore, by comparing the isolation  execution note and the isolation release note, it can be  confirmed that nothing was missed or leaked out when lifting  isolation and restoring the system to its normal state.    Possible interference with the isolation of other operations  must be checked before carrying out isolation execution or  release.    Figure 2 is a conceptual outline of isolation duties.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-36A>      Figure 2: Flow of Isolation </FIG>     System Goals    Isolation duties are relatively easy if few isolations are  involved, but in cases such as scheduled inspections or planned  shutdowns, where there are multiple isolations, it takes a lot  of labor and time for management and for drafting various  documentation (in a year, several hundred isolation lists and  several tens of thousands of execution and release notes are  issued).    For this reason, an isolation support system has been  introduced for FUGEN, with the goal of achieving the following  improvements by enabling on-line processing of duties extending  from isolation planning to isolation execution:    1. Improve thoroughness of operational management by  unifying  isolation data management.    2. Rationalize isolation plan by reference to recorded data  and standard data.    3. Reduce isolation duties by automating documentation  output  and bar code reading.    4. Accelerate access to information by unified management of  plant-related blueprints and other data.    Additionally, for FUGEN, a maintenance management system  (MMS) has been developed and implemented since 1979, for storage  and retrieval of record data and maintenance management  including preventive maintenance and detection of malfunctions.  Within the MMS, there are management systems for the priority  isolation duties, such as the operation and breakdown management  system and the equipment ledger management system, and by  linking these systems, management of isolation duties from the  viewpoint of maintenance duties as a whole is possible.  <H5>  System Composition </H5>   Figure 3 shows the composition of the isolation support  system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-37A>      Figure 3: System Composition </FIG>     This system is composed of a multipurpose large-scale  computer M770/6 as the core with various types of terminals and  workstations linked by local area network (LAN).    The system base was built with AIM/DC (advanced information  manager/data communication) application of M770/6, with unified  management of various masters. The system also is set up for  automatic reference to databases such as the operation and  breakdown management system and the equipment ledger management  system which are built on the AIM.    Isolation execution and release notes are printed on a  serial  printer dedicated to documentation, and isolation lists are  printed on an office printer. Blueprints are printed by plotter  and Post Script printer.[.sup]2[/]    Terminals used in the system can be divided into general  terminals (such as FM R.VDS[.sup]3[/]) and workstations  (S-4/2GX). From the general terminals, the isolation support  system can be used online from a screen using the PSAM  (presentation service access method). From the workstations, the  isolation support system can be used online from the diagram  displayed by the ICAD/SX[.sup]4[/] using the workstation  library. Access from workstations is accelerated by using  Informix[.sup]5[/] Online to control various master data  files. Figure 4 shows a general terminal system use screen.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-37B>      Figure 4: Online Screen </FIG>   <H5>  System Functions </H5>   The isolation support system is composed mainly of the  following functions:    Isolation Plan Function    In processing the isolation plan, the operations, operators  and period needed for the plan can be retrieved from the  operational and breakdown management system database by  inputting the isolation management number. Then, by clicking on  the symbols in the plant diagram that is displayed by  workstation CAD, the equipment numbers of the equipment to be  isolated can be designated in order, and the isolation status,  etc., is typed in by menu, in the same order as the steps to be  taken in the isolation work. When using a general terminal, the  isolation plan is input in interactive format by directly typing  in the equipment numbers of the equipment to be isolated.    Additionally, to carry out the plan efficiently, standard  and  past performance isolation data can be referenced and  incorporated.    When registering isolation plan data, the system can check  for data on times and execution status of other isolation plans.  At this time, the isolation list is automatically issued as  well. Figure 5 is a sample isolation list.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-38A>      Figure 5: Example of Isolation Lists </FIG>     Isolation Execution/Release Functions    The execution note or release note will be issued  automatically when the scope of isolation execution or release  is designated after typing in the isolation management number.  The execution note is in the form of a seal, which is affixed to  a base tag that is tied with string to the equipment. Figure 6  shows sample execution and release notes. Information from the  issued notes are treated as records and are used to reserve  execution times and prevent overlapping with other isolation  plans.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-39A>      Figure 6: Example of Execution Note </FIG>     On-site isolation work implemented in accordance with issued  execution or release notes can be conveyed immediately by  telephone to a central management room, and the scope of the  isolation execution or release can be typed in from this  information, thereby updating isolation data.    Additionally, the execution note that is collected after  isolation release can be checked against the release note by a  bar code reader for verification.    When isolation release is displayed, one can check to see if  the whole isolation under that isolation management number has  been carried out. If completed, the isolation data can be stored  in the system as a record of isolation.    Isolation Temporary Release Function    If it becomes necessary to temporarily lift isolation from  some equipment, all isolation management numbers, operations,  operators and periods involving that equipment are displayed by  typing the equipment number into the system.    The displayed screen will have a column to confirm temporary  release of isolation, and when a command confirmed against all  isolation management numbers is typed into the system, a  temporary release note is issued automatically, the system is  notified of the temporary release, and isolation information is  updated.    When temporary release of isolation becomes unnecessary,  isolation information is updated by selecting the command for  full-scale release or reinstatement.    Isolation State Release Freezing Function    The isolation state freeze is applied when alteration by  other operations of the isolation that is currently underway,  such as an isolation with test conditions, is not desired.    The freeze on isolation release has been set up only for  high  priority isolations, and is used to ensure that isolation will  not be released unless the command to lift the freeze is typed  in. By selecting the isolation management number to be frozen or  the isolation equipment number, other isolation operations  involving that equipment can be prohibited. To lift the freeze,  selection is made in the same manner.    Isolation State Management Function    When using a terminal, isolation state or operational  history  can be searched, displayed, or printed by selecting the  isolation management number or equipment number. Also, each  isolation plan or isolation state by plant system is displayed  visually by change of color of symbols in the plant diagrams  through workstation CAD. Figure 7 [omitted] is an example of  state management using a workstation. Symbols that change to  green indicate that the equipment represented by that symbol is  "shut" or "off" and symbols that change to red indicate that the  equipment is "open" or "on."    Master File Editing Function    Editing of the master file, which manages isolation  equipment  data and standard isolation data, can be done efficiently by  interactive processing. For isolation equipment, data can be  extracted from the equipment ledger database of the equipment  ledger management system, and for standard isolation, data can  be extracted from record isolation data.    Diagram Management Function    When inputting the plant diagram, pipes and wiring  configuration can be input automatically in accordance with  equipment configuration, thus reducing the work of diagram  inputting. Also, the symbols representing equipment (valves,  pumps, circuit breakers, etc.) often used in plant diagrams can  be recorded easily using basic CAD functions.    Equipment numbers can be attached to symbols displayed on  the  diagram and based on this information, isolation plan processing  and status management can be carried out with CAD.    Additionally, plant diagrams can be output easily by  selecting the necessary diagram from the diagram table.    Backup Function    The latest isolation status is transferred to the backup  computer. Thus the latest isolation status can be confirmed by  printing the contents of stored data in the backup computer even  when the system has been shut down.  <H5>  Results and Problems To Address in the Future </H5>   The following are the results of running this system with  FUGEN:    1. Unified management of various types of isolations has  made  it possible to quickly discover lack of smooth operation and  human error by checking for interference, and this has helped to  tighten operational management.    2. By using pre-entered data on standard isolations and past  isolations, it has become possible to plan isolations swiftly,  and this has helped increase operational efficiency.    3. Automatic issuing of execution and release notes and  isolation lists (total of several hundred thousand notes and  several thousand isolation lists) and collective verification  using the bar code reader has eliminated the massive amount of  writing and checking that has been done until now, and this has  helped reduce work.    4. Unified management of plant diagrams has facilitated  acquisition of diagrams, and this has helped to accelerate  operations.    As for problems to address in the future, we plan to add the  following capabilities: Visual display of isolation scope on the  plant diagram, automatic generation of isolation steps, and  retrieval of data on other systems from the plant diagram. This  will further reduce the workload, accelerate operations and  increase reliability.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   This system has been successful in three scheduled  inspections since 1988. In April 1992, it received the Science  and Technology Agency Director General's award in recognition of  originality and practical use before any other plant. It would  be gratifying if the results of this system and experience with  its use can contribute to further improvement of safe and stable  operation of nuclear power plants.    Finally, we express our deep gratitude for the guidance and  cooperation that we received in developing this system.  Footnotes    1.

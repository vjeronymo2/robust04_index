			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Small steps to an equity stake How close are we to the day when banks regularly take equity stakes in the businesses to which they lend? Among the UK high street banks, Midland is one of the closest to making such a move part of every day banking. Among others, only Royal Bank of Scotland is developing equity products along similar lines through its specialised lending services division. Midland's starting point is the recognition that the returns banks have made from smaller businesses have been poor. Too often banks have been lending what is effectively risk capital but have only earned a debt return. 'The boards of all the banks must be very disappointed by the returns they have made from this sector over the whole business cycle,' says David McMeekin, corporate finance director of Midland Bank. Midland's response is modest but a pointer to where small business banking may be going: At the smallest level, Midland is developing a product that would allow business banking managers to make relatively small but unsecured loans to well-managed companies with inadequate security but robust cash flows. The bank would take equity options or a form of 'phantom options' - instruments that carry rights to some up-side reward - which the owner-managers will be encouraged to buy back from the bank. Midland accepts that it will need to continue training bankers to recognise when equity could be useful and relevant. Since 1990 Midland, in common with some other banks, has adopted just this approach for bigger customers with the same characteristics. For private companies and smaller quoted companies, the bank will consider taking equity options. With middle-sized family controlled companies, where a float is unlikely, it will consider lending unsecured but will take phantom options. Nearer to conventional venture capital but targeted at companies requiring as little as Pounds 5,000-Pounds 150,000, there are 10 independently managed Midland Enterprise Funds. An 11th office is to open in Wales on June 21. They look at start-up and early-stage finance. To cut the set-up costs, Midland has introduced standardised documents. By many accounts this is proving a labour-intensive slog.</p>

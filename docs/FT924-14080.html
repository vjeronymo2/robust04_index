			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: WMS raising Pounds 15m via share placing WMS Group is to raise about Pounds 15m in a placing of shares in the last week of November. The new shares will account for about 40 per cent of the enlarged share capital - the balance will remain with Mr Joe Moore, the chairman and founder, and his family. After the placing, the company will be valued at about Pounds 45m. Originally Window Machinery Sales - though Mr Moore maintains that the company's initials stand for Work Means Success - WMS has grown into a designer, developer and distributor of window hardware and related domestic and industrial fasteners. It is now branching into silicones and sealants. Almost all the company's products are sourced outside the UK - mainly in Taiwan, the Philippines and India. Wong Shi, the Taiwanese subsidiary, oversees all WMS' Far Eastern activities. Mr Moore said that, despite the problems of the construction industry, replacement windows was a 'buoyant market' and that he ran a 'nice clean business'. WMS has no debt and Mr Moore said the placing was to finance organic growth - the company has in the past few months moved into the decorative hardware and decorative sundries markets. 'More product penetration is needed,' he said. The company employs 220 staff and operates from its national distribution centre which sits on an 11 1/2 acre site in Brighouse, near Leeds, bought from Coloroll, the collapsed home furnishings group, for Pounds 1.9m in 1989. A prospective p/e of between 11.5 and 15, with 13.5 the likeliest, has been forecast. WMS has predicted profits for 1992 of more than Pounds 3m post-tax, compared with Pounds 1.72m in 1991, on turnover of Pounds 25m-plus, against Pounds 20.2m. The company will pay dividends, Mr Moore said.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISTIANI'S PLEA FOR CONTINUED MILITARY AID  </P> <P> The president of El Salvador is seeing his situation through rose-colored  glasses. He should come to Los Angeles and live incognito and learn from his  fellow Salvadorans just how "so-called" the democracy is in that country. He  can try to "red herring" us by pointing out actions of FMLN or actions by his  forces done to discredit FMLN, but he cannot conceal the overwhelming use of  killing and torture done by forces under his direction.  </P> <P> MARLENE BRONTE, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome, 24 Feb (ATOP/PANA)--The National Electoral  Commission [CEN] late last night published the results of the  legislative elections in 19 out of the 24 constituencies  concerned in the second round of the elections that took place  on 20 February. According to these results, the opposition  officially won 38 seats as against 37 for President Eyadema's  supporters and one for Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh.    According to CEN Chairman Sipohon Gaba, it is now up to the  Supreme Court to deliberate on the case of five constituencies  where incidents disrupted the votes. It should be recalled that  the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT], the former single ruling  party led by President Eyadema, accused the opposition of being  at the origin of the incidents that marred the votes in several  polling stations and of "organizing fraud to such an extent that  it was impossible to validate the results of the contested  constituencies."    The opposition has rejected all the accusations leveled  against it and affirmed that "the RPT should accept defeat  instead of confusing people." One of the opposition activists  who is also member of the CEN, Mr. Ali Diabate, affirmed that  the opposition had definitely won in the five constituencies  contested by the RPT. He warned that "if the government does  not proclaim the full results, the four opposition members  belonging to the CEN will resign."    The Supreme Court, to which all the results and various  reports were submitted on 23 February, has about 10 days to  deliberate on all the contested cases before proclaiming the  final results. For their part, foreign observers believe that  despite the regrettable incidents that took place on 20  February, "the second round of the legislative elections took  place in satisfactory conditions."</p>

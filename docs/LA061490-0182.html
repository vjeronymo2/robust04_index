			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY LIFE: CHILD PROTECTION FUNDS RUNNING OUT AS ABUSE OF YOUNGSTERS GROWS  </P> <P> If the directors and staff of the county's Child Abuse Prevention Program are  feeling a little neglected and abused themselves these days, you can't blame  them.  </P> <P> The money for the 4 1/2-year-old program runs out at the end of this month, and  Gov. George Deukmejian has stricken any future funding from his 1990-91 budget.  </P> <P> So, barring a miracle -- either from heaven or the Legislature -- that means  CAPP's valuable services to Orange County schoolchildren have come to an end.  </P> <P> Ironic indeed, considering the rising incidence of abuse in the county.  </P> <P> During its brief run, CAPP has reached a lot of people -- at least 120,000  preschool through high school youngsters, in addition to any number of adults  and community groups.  </P> <P> It was, incidentally, after sitting through CAPP presentations that more than  400 children sought relief from abuse.  </P> <P> "I wonder how long it would have been -- if ever -- before those 400 cases  would have been reported," asks CAPP official Nancy Dickerson, "if it hadn't  been for the knowledge and assistance they received from us?"  </P> <P> Ironically, it was Deukmejian who signed the legislation in 1984 that gave  birth to CAPP and its counterparts statewide.  </P> <P> Since then, CAPP -- working under the aegis of Community Services Programs in  Orange County, has initiated and conducted educational programs in 26 of the  county's 27 school districts (only Huntington Beach does not participate).  </P> <P> Its work with children has been particularly effective, teaching them what  child abuse is and showing them that in any form it is wrong and also teaching  them how to report it.  </P> <P> Workshops are also conducted for teachers to show them how to spot abuse.  Parenting classes and community organization workshops have been conducted by  CAPP too.  </P> <P> The workshops, incidentally, have been available in English, Vietnamese and  Spanish.  </P> <P> And, overall, through CAPP and other efforts, reportings of child abuse in the  county have risen by more than 50% in the past several years.  </P> <P> CAPP's Orange County budget of $750,000 is small potatoes compared to many  other state programs, but 99% of it comes from the statewide annual allocation  of $10 million.  </P> <P> According to Dickerson, members of the governor's staff have insisted that the  monies can come from other sources, particularly from the proceeds of  Proposition 98, the school-funding measure passed by voters last November.  </P> <P> The problem is, she says, none of the school districts in the county have shown  an inclination to share any of those funds with CAPP.  </P> <P> "We conducted an informal survey (of the school districts), and they all say  whatever extra money they get from Proposition 98 must go for what they call  'educational needs,' although for the life of me I can't think of a better  definition of a child abuse prevention program."  </P> <P> CSP's executive director, Margot Carolson, worries that if the governor does  not restore the funds, "it will send a mixed message to students, parents,  staff and offenders -- that child abuse is not a major problem and therefore a  low priority."  </P> <P> So, where does CAPP go from here?  </P> <P> "We're really in a strange place," says Dickerson, "with everyone from the  governor on down praising our work and apparently assuming we'll get the money  somewhere to continue it.  </P> <P> "We know the Legislature favors the program, but it can't put funding back into  the budget without the governor's approval. And, he tells us to get the money  from the schools, who tell us they don't have any money."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, she says CAPP is contacting private foundations and corporations,  but such grants usually take time and that's something CAPP doesn't have.  </P> <P> "In the end, you know," she points out, "we all will pay for such  shortsightedness. "We either pay for education and prevention now or we pay a  lot more -- at least double -- down the line for prisons and social services."  </P> <P> Dickerson says the group is soliciting both money and support from the  community. Its phone number is (714) 634-3848.  </P></p>

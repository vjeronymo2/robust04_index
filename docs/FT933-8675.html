			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Jamaican minister resigns Mr Hugh Small resigned yesterday as Jamaica's finance minister following disagreements within the cabinet over proposed changes to the island's foreign exchange market, Canute James reports from Kingston. In a letter to Mr P J Patterson, the prime minister, Mr Small said the changes, which were discussed and agreed at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, were not in keeping with the government's commitment to allow the market to determine the exchange rate. In a statement, Mr Patterson said the changes, the details of which were not given, were based on concern at the depreciation of the currency over the past few weeks. The prime minister has taken responsibility for the finance portfolio.</p>

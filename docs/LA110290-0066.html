			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLICE BARRED FROM WORK AT BINGO PARLORS;  </P> <P> IDENTITY INC.: THE ACTION COMES A WEEK AFTER AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION OF  OFFICERS ACTING AS SECURITY GUARDS AT THE CITY'S LARGEST SUCH OPERATION.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department has revoked permits allowing its officers to  work as off-duty security officers in 75 bingo parlors as a result of  allegations that the officers knew about financial improprieties at the city's  largest bingo operation.  </P> <P> Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker ordered officers who work at bingo parlors to turn  in their permits Thursday, a week after the department began an Internal  Affairs investigation into allegations against officers working at Identity  Inc., a Woodland Hills charity.  </P> <P> "It has been brought to the attention of the department that, in many cases,  this type of employment involves an inherent and blatant conflict of interest  for Los Angeles police officers, and, therefore, should be prohibited," Kroeker  said in an internal memo circulated to division commanders.  </P> <P> The city's Social Service Department, which regulates bingo operations, has  long advocated barring police officers from working at the parlors. Officials  said the appearance of impropriety can arise when the department investigates  parlors where officers are working. Cmdr. William Booth said the order, which  was issued at the direction of Chief Daryl Gates, will affect officers who work  at any of the 75 licensed bingo halls in the city. The number of officers  affected was not known, but bingo operators generally use from one to seven  security guards. In addition to hiring off-duty police officers for about $15  an hour, many of the bingo operations use private security firms or retired  police officers.  </P> <P> Kroeker, commanding officer of the Personnel and Training Bureau, wrote that  officers may reapply for permits once they are revoked, but such requests "will  be evaluated on a case-by-case basis."  </P> <P> Identity, which serves the disabled, operates the largest bingo game in the  city, and has grossed about $29.4 million since February, 1982. About 80% of  that money was returned to players in prize money.  </P> <P> The Social Service Department is seeking to revoke Identity's bingo license  because of charges that workers who helped run the games were paid from $100 to  $300 a session. State law requires that workers for charitable bingo games be  unpaid volunteers.  </P> <P> Two former Identity bingo workers who testified last month that they received  the illegal payments also said they believed that off-duty police officers who  worked as security guards were aware of the improprieties. The former workers  also told The Times that wives of the officers played for free or were among  the paid volunteers.  </P> <P> The allegations prompted the Internal Affairs investigation, which is  continuing, police said. A parallel criminal investigation also is under way by  the vice unit into accusations by former Identity workers that some bingo  proceeds went unreported.  </P> <P> Edith Ryan, founder and president of Identity, has denied any wrongdoing by the  charity. Monday, Ron Ponzi and Kenneth Hurwitz, two officers who work at  Identity, testified at a hearing that they never saw or heard any workers  talking about being paid.  </P> <P> City investigators later revealed that during an Aug. 19 search of Identity's  bingo hall on De Soto Avenue, detectives found a torn check for $65 written by  Hurwitz's wife in a trash can. Investigators said the fact that her check was  thrown out could indicate she played bingo for free.  </P> <P> Ryan told The Times that she often allows guests to play for free because it is  not illegal. City bingo regulators said the practice is not specifically  outlawed but could be construed as unfair and a misuse of charitable funds.  </P> <P> In 1984, the Police Department tried to discourage officers from working at the  Identity bingo games, but an investigation failed to find any wrongdoing and  the officers were permitted to continue the work.  </P></p>

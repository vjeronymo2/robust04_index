			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Iraq military sites 'poor target' THE DEMOLITION of Iraq's military sites since the end of the Gulf war has been so great that they are not worthwhile targets for any military action by the United Nations, according to Mr David Kay, former head of one of the UN inspection teams in Iraq. Mr Kay said last night that almost all the installations in Iraq's huge secret nuclear weapons programme had been demolished by UN teams. Last September, in an episode that foreshadowed this month's impasse outside the Agriculture Ministry, his team camped for five days in the car park of the Baghdad Defence Ministry until they were allowed to take away documents. Al-Tuwaitha, the main nuclear research centre south of Baghdad 'has been taken to bits' and al-Atheer, the main weapons design and testing centre, 'has now completely gone', he said. Al-Shakat and Tarmiya, two sites north of Baghdad used to produce enriched uranium, necessary for nuclear weapons, had also been demolished, and there was one building left at al-Farat, which had produced enrichment equipment. UN inspectors, who were astonished at the scale of the nuclear research programme they uncovered, concluded that Iraq could have been within a year of producing a weapon when the war started. There is no evidence that it had yet built a workable weapon. Mr Kay, who is now director-general of the Uranium Institute in London, said he did not believe the UN would target chemical weapons sites around Mosul in the north of the country in any strike as they were due to be dismantled anyway in September. 'The weapons there are already leaking, there is already a risk to the inspectors, and if they bombed those sites no-one could go near them.' However, he said that industrial and military installations around Tikrit, President Saddam Hussein's home town north-west of Baghdad, might still be considered a target, and that there was still a large military base around Falluja, west of Baghdad.</p>

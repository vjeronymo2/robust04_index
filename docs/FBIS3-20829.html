			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by STA's Belgrade correspondent: "Janez Drnovsek </F> Too?"]    [Text] Generals Veljko Kadijevic and Blagoje Adzic  are supposed to be the ones most guilty for the JNA's [Yugoslav  People's Army's] withdrawal from Slovenia.    There is specific evidence that Branko Kostic, Borisav  Jovic,  Jugoslav Kontic, and Sejdo Bajramovic did not prevent the  adoption of the decision on the JNA's withdrawal from Slovenia,  and that they did not declare martial law or a state of  emergency and adopt a decision on general mobilization on 12  September 1991. For these and other reasons, Djordje Dozet, a  Belgrade military court judge, is proposing to the military  prosecutor of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] army's  General Staff that appropriate measures be taken against the  members of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia] Presidency, according to STA's Belgrade  correspondent.    Judge Dozet, who has the rank of captain, is actually  demanding a trial of the entire former SFRY Presidency, i.e.,  also Stipe Mesic, Janez Drnovsek, Vasil Tupurkovski, and Bogic  Bogocevic [as published], namely because in March 1991 they  rejected a proposal from Federal Secretary for National Defense  Veljko Kadijevic to declare a state of emergency and because in  July 1991 they adopted the decision on the JNA's withdrawal from  Slovenia, and thus recognized its secession.    Dozet is primarily accusing Generals Veljko Kadijevic and  Blagoje Adzic because they did not prevent the SFRY Presidency's  decisions on the JNA's withdrawal from Slovenia and on the  release of 5,000 soldiers from the September draft, and because  they did not order JNA attacks against Croatia's paramilitary  units. The list of the accused also includes Generals Zivota  Avramovic, Andrija Raseta, and Dobrasin Parasevic, who among  other things are supposed to have been responsible for turning  over the equipment of the military hospitals in Zagreb and  Ljubljana to the secessionist republics' authorities.    Some circles in Serbia and Montenegro, especially military  ones, still cannot reconcile themselves to the fact that the  SFRY no longer exists. An answer to the question of why there is  one trial after another in the FRY of officers for the military  defeats of Greater-Serbian policy would be interesting. The  answer is more than simple: obviously someone has to be blamed,  especially now that the Serbian policy is facing its most real  danger to date--the NATO alliance's ultimatum. It is easiest to  make long-retired generals and members of the former SFRY  Presidency, one of whom is already deceased and four of whom are  not within reach of the judges and prosecutors in Belgrade, the  scapegoats.    It is actually not very likely that the military prosecutor  of the Yugoslav army's General Staff will respond to Dozet's  proposal. The Supreme Military Court, just a few days ago,  annulled the verdict of the Belgrade military court on the basis  of which five officers from the JNA's Varazdin Corps were  acquitted of surrendering their units and turning over enormous  amounts of weapons to the Croats.    The judicial proceedings against the Varazdin Five, of whom  General Vlado Trifunovic was supposedly the most responsible,  have been dragging on for more than a year, and it seems that  they still will not end soon. They are also interesting because  the above-mentioned five people were acquitted precisely by  Judge Djordje Dozet, who presided over the Belgrade military  court at the trial. The Supreme Court annulled his verdict  acquitting them on the basis of testimony by Generals Zivota  Avramovic and Veljko Kadijevic, according to STA's Belgrade  correspondent.</p>

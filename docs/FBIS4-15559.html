			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yanchenkov report: "Vyacheslav Kostikov Briefing"] </F>   [Text] At a routine Kremlin briefing yesterday Vyacheslav  Kostikov, the Russian president's press secretary, briefed  Russian and foreign journalists on the program for Boris  Yeltsin's forthcoming official visit to Spain. He noted that  Russia has long-standing political, cultural, and international  links with this state. Seven documents will be signed -- the  most important being a treaty of friendship and cooperation  between the two countries. It is worth noting, Kostikov said,  that it has been decided to sign these documents in the Moncloa  Palace, where the agreement on civil consensus in Spain was once  signed. This fact, the press secretary believes, forms a kind  of bridge between international actions and our current domestic  problems.    Vyacheslav Kostikov went on to answer numerous questions  from  journalists on Russia's international and domestic policy.  Explaining the situation within the Russian Federal Assembly  Federation Council in connection with the discussion of the  question of former General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik, the  press secretary expressed disappointment at what had happened,  but does not think that the Federation Council intended to seek  a confrontation with the president. Unfortunately, emotions  prevailed, and the Federation Council itself will have to find a  way out of this involved situation.    Answering a question about State Duma deputies' attitudes  toward the signing of NATO's "Partnership For Peace" program,  the press secretary noted that our position is to avoid any  confrontation between the president and the State Duma on this  issue. NATO's "Partnership For Peace" program, Vyacheslav  Kostikov believes, presupposes extensive cooperation both in  politics and in the military sphere, but one of the most  important elements of big-time politics -- the economy -- cannot  be hived off. Russia, as is well known, would like to join the  G-7. Why not link these problems? If we are being invited to  engage in partnership on an equal basis in the political and  military spheres, then it would probably be logical to extend  this approach to the economy as well.    The briefing also touched on the question of G. Burbulis'  departure from the "Russia's Choice" parliamentary faction. Of  course, Vyacheslav Kostikov said, it is disappointing that the  trailblazers of Russian democracy are leaving "Russia's Choice"  -- where the forces of democracy are concentrated. When asked  by this ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent why the president's  instructions on restoring order on the North Caucasus Railroad  -- where robbery and theft from trains traveling from Chechnya  continue -- are not being fulfilled, the press secretary replied  that the question was a fair one, that corresponding  instructions had been issued to the Defense Ministry, and that  the military should be approached for further explanations.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: QMH details rescue package - Pounds 1.3bn debt reconstruction could leave shareholders with 40% Queens Moat Houses yesterday unveiled details of a Pounds 1.3bn rescue plan almost two years after its shares were suspended, which could leave existing investors with 40 per cent of the heavily indebted hotels group. The stake is substantially higher than that won for shareholders recently in other large debt reconstructions. At Heron, for example, shareholders have been diluted down to 5 per cent. The Queens Moat package includes a Pounds 200m debt for equity swap which will allow existing shareholders to increase their stake. The swap is, in effect, an equity issue underwritten by the company's banks which will be priced at 8.6p. Few shareholders are expected to buy the shares at this price. The survival of Queens Moat is still in question, however, as one lender continues to resist the package. It must be unanimously approved by the company's 74 lenders before investors can vote on the proposals. Queens Moat refused to comment on individual creditors, but it is believed that the unhappy lender is California-based Trust Company of the West. TCW, which bought the debt in the secondary market, is thought to disagree with its ranking relative to other creditors. Mr Andrew Coppel, the chief executive brought in by the banks to replace the company's founder Mr John Bairstow last year, said he was confident the proposals represented a good deal for creditors and shareholders. 'The alternative is stark,' he said. 'The group would have to cease to trade.' Under these proposals, Mr Coppel said, Queens Moat would not have to return to shareholders for further finanical support. However, investors would be unlikely to receive a dividend in the foreseeable future. In addition to the debt swap, which will give ordinary shareholders 24 per cent of the company and preference holders 16.2 per cent, Pounds 630m of the Pounds 1.3bn debt will be restructured into longer-term and convertible borrowing. This will be payable between 2000 and 2008. The convertible instruments allow for a second debt for equity swap, at the board's discretion, which could leave lenders with 75 per cent control. Mr Coppel did not expect the second swap would be necessary; it was there as protection in the event of unforeseen difficulties. Other elements include the conversion of preference shares into ordinary equity on substantially enhanced terms and amendments to debenture stock terms. Finally, banks have agreed to waive Pounds 43m in interest accrued since the beginning of the year. This is roughly equal to the fees which Queens Moat has incurred in the negotiations. After the restructuring, Queens Moat's net liabilities would be Pounds 184m. A circular detailing the proposals will be sent to shareholders in the new year if the final lender agrees to the terms. This would open the way for the shares to resume trading in the spring. One substantial institutional shareholder said he was likely to back the proposals. 'The banks could have left equity holders with nothing,' he said. Now that the restructuring is largely out of the way, however, shareholders will begin tackling operational issues, such as management, he added. 'It is not necessarily the case that the people with the qualifications to get the finanical restructuring out of the way are the right people to  .. run a hotel company.' Queens Moat has been in negotiations with bankers since April 1993, when it became apparent it would breach certain loan covenants. Subsequent valuations wiped Pounds 1bn off its property portfolio and last year the group reported the second biggest loss in UK corporate history.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: A burst of activity in Hungary Hungary is experiencing an unprecedented burst of new equity issues. Public offerings in Egis, the pharmaceuticals producer, and Global, a retailer, were oversubscribed last week. Subscriptions for shares in Pharmavit, a thriving private-sector producer of vitamin pills, opened on Friday and are expected to close today or tomorrow, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Holders of compensation coupons - securities issued to victims of communist expropriation - can from today apply for shares in Chinoin, a leading pharmaceuticals company. Queues of investors were already growing at the weekend. Another issue scheduled for next week is that of Graboplast, a manufacturer of artificial leather. Some 58 per cent of the company, worth Dollars 14m, is on offer from June 30. In addition, AV RT, the state holding company, gave the go-ahead for the sale of a minority stake in Richter Gedeon which the authorities hope will raise Dollars 47m. Although international interest in Hungary has cooled since the Budapest bourse began to fall in February, demand for new issues still remains much stronger than last year.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / UK Company News: MTM plans Pounds 16.7m expansion - Better agrochemicals showing behind return to black with Pounds 1.13m MTM, the chemicals company which almost collapsed two years ago, yesterday announced details of a new acquisition strategy aimed at rebuilding the group. It is planning to spend up to Pounds 16.7m of its cash reserves to establish three or four core businesses in sectors such as bio-technology, ceramics and instruments. The move follows an aggressive divestment programme, culminating last month with the sale of its agrochemicals subsidiary to United Phosphorus for Pounds 10.5m - the last subsidiary inherited from the previous management. Having sold most of its assets to BTP last year to reduce debt, the group has emerged with just one business: Colin Stewart Minchem, a minerals and chemicals processor acquired for Pounds 11.8m earlier this year. 'The old MTM no longer exists and there will be no more bad news,' said Mr David Swallow, chairman. The shares rose 6p to 85p yesterday after the company announced first half pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m, against losses of Pounds 11.9m last time. Mr Swallow said the turnround was due mainly to an improved performance by the agrochemicals business, where a new management team has cut costs and consolidated operations at two sites. The figures were also flattered by Pounds 221,000 of interest receivable, compared with payments of Pounds 3.7m, and a Pounds 418,000 contribution from CSM. Announcing an interim dividend of 0.5p - the first since 1991 - Mr Swallow added: 'We want to get MTM on a sound long-term footing, and this is the start.' With the balance sheet strengthened by the agrochemicals disposal and funds raised by the placing and open offer earlier this year, the group has began eyeing technology-related businesses. Likely acquisitions range from established profitable companies to emerging businesses which promise to be cash generative. Earnings per share were 3.73p (losses of 60.6p). COMMENT MTM is a speculative buy. Uncertainty surrounds the on-going inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office, which is investigating the former management, and there is no guarantee that their successors will find the right acquisitions to bolster shareholder value. Nevertheless, second half contributions from CSM and the sale of surplus property - including the Rudby Hall headquarters when the market capitalisation was Pounds 214m rather than Pounds 19m - should lift full year profits to Pounds 2.5m. The shares look pretty cheap on a forward multiple of 14.8, but the risks remain.</p>

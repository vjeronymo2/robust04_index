			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead Lonrho's annual results for the year to September 30 are the first it has published since Dieter Bock its German joint chief executive, started the process of making the international trading group a 'more normal company.' Last autumn, he succeeded in having non-executives appointed to the board for the first time in 20 years and in setting up an audit committee to review auditing procedures and financial performance. The figures will therefore be of particular interest to see if the audit committee's influence is apparent - and whether the company statement contains any telltale signs of the state of the battle between Bock and his fellow joint chief executive, Tiny Rowland. Analysts believe that profits from ongoing businesses doubled last year to around Pounds 80m and that the figure including gains from disposals could be as high as Pounds 140m. John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based retail and wholesale group, is expected to announce on Monday increased profits for the six months to October from Pounds 3.8m to between Pounds 4.1m and Pounds 5m. WH Smith reports on Wednesday, and profits are expected to be up from Pounds 40.2m to between Pounds 42m and Pounds 46m for the six months to November. Sales increases for the first half may be flattered somewhat by weak comparatives from the year before, with the second half comparatives getting more difficult. Thursday sees interim results from furniture retailer MFI, with analysts' uncertainty about its performance reflected by the wide spread of forecasts centring on about Pounds 22.5m-Pounds 23m - up from Pounds 12.7m last year - excluding the profit on MFI's sale of shares in Carpetright. Its comments on the January sale period will attract particular attention.</p>

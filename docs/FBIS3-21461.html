			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] In the government-proposed budget for the year  beginning 21 March 1994, the most striking points are the  unprecedented 47% rise in the government's budget, and  the 60%  jump in state-owned companies' budget. This request for  statutory endorsement takes place at a time when the  government's oil revenue, affected by the price crash, not only  has declined and its future because of the slack world demand,  is dim, but, as a consequence of the credit boycott, which has  been imposed on the Iranian state for some time now, a major  portion of oil receipts has to go into paying up the Central  Bank's almost $13 billion[b] matured debts better known as  "overdues."    It was due to those very short-term and costly foreign debts  that the government resorted recently to a policy of eliminating  the non-government demand for hard currency. As a result,  imports of raw and complementary materials and machinery parts  for industries have come to an almost standstill. But on the  other hand, no change has been made in the government  undertaking as regards to paying "consumer" subsidies, among  which the fuel subsidy alone comes up to somewhere around $10b a  year. Moreover, the measure to transfer to the public the state  companies and units for which, despite the fall in activities, a  monstrous budget of Rls 56,000b[rials] has been proposed, has  come to a halt because of lack of a strong, tactful, resolved  caretaker.    In this way the government intends to secure before anything  else the personnel budget of its organizations and units,  whether active or semi-active, and also to provide the necessary  financial resources for carrying out the "manpower adjustment"  policy in factories facing a cut in production caused by the  lack of raw materials. Furthermore, the government prefers for  the time being to continue paying consumer subsidies, which are  mostly on foodstuffs, fuel, medicine, domestic flights and  pilgrimage tours. But then, this method of tackling the problem  of employment and earnings is, due to its human factor, a  particularly sensitive social issue, will prove fictitious in  the medium run with negative economic sequels.    While the government sticks to paying consumer subsidies and  the economy's tax paying power is waning, the major outlet for  financing the government's continuous budget deficit will be the  Central Bank and taking advantage of the country's banking  system. And both these sources are, incidentally, extremely  inflationary.    In other words, the inflation arising from the increase in  the government budget and unproductive subsidized expenses is  outwardly delusive in the short run, for it will produce a false  impression that the problems of production and employment have  somehow been desirably solved. Whereas the very existence of  abundant money and liquidity will, in the medium run, leave  devastating, inhibitive marks on the level of employment and the  income of labor power. People will become more and more inclined  to converting their money into land, property, gold and hard  currency. The inflationary visions spiral will gulp down all the  sinking-funds of industries and social security and retirement  savings and do away with all incentives for productive  investment.    In order to neutralize the inflationary sequels of the  government proposed budget for next year, the following measures  need to be taken:    1. The Islamic Majles should adjust the proposed funds at a  reasonable single-digit inflation level;    2. Instead of spending thousands of billions of rials on  keeping the state companies up, the government should as soon as  possible transfer these units at a suitable price and by  long-term installments to the public, experts and the personnel  of the same units. Besides, the banking facilities asked for by  the government should be made available to the private sector;    3. Except for the low-income and downtrodden strata, the  government subsidies on pilgrimage tours, domestic flights,  basic goods, fuels, etc should be phased out;    4. The Central Bank should be accorded greater independence  to issue rial bonds in domestic markets and foreign exchange  bonds in the world market and to show sensitivity to any decline  in the rial's purchasing power and to be answerable to the  public through the legislative branch.    Foreign Debts: Until now the role of the oil  export earnings has been to shore up the government's general  budget and meet part of the general spending.    However, as of 21 March 1993, the oil revenues have come to  assume a dual (domestic-foreign) role. The continuation of the  government budget movement, on the one hand, and of the process  of repaying the foreign debts, on the other, is now mainly  dependent on crude oil exports. Thus, with the scarcity of the  revenue resulting from oil exports and the maturing of foreign  debts the authorities have three courses in front of them:    First--Giving priority to domestic exchange expenditure and  deferring the debts further.    Second--Giving priority to foreign debt payment and assuming  a period of austerity at home.    Third--Choosing a middle course and earmark the hard  currency  partly for home and partly for foreign purposes.    Apparently, the best course is the third one. But then this  is when the share portions for domestic exchange requirements  and foreign exchange requirements grow equally and at a limited  fashion.    What has been proposed in the 1994-5 budget bill is for  repaying just one billion dollars, and this means we have chosen  the first course, i.e. giving priority to domestic exchange  expenses and postponing the debts further. Whereas, foresight  rules that we opt for the second course in the 94-5 budget for  the following reasons:    1. The more we delay our debt, the bigger its principal and  interest will become.    2. On-time repayment of debts does not push up the interest  progressively. So, preparation in the 94-5 budget for paying a  bigger portion of the debts could mean reduction in the debt  burden in the future.    3. The experience of the highly debtor countries indicates  that deferral, reborrowing and going round again have been one  of the causes of their accumulated foreign debts...    4. Contrary to what some believe that today's world is the  world of debts and so one should not be worried, our  indebtedness is very much different from the indebtedness of,  say, Brazil or Argentina. Because the West helps those countries  to solve their problem...But with us...it stops at nothing to  strike a blow at the Islamic system.    5. Neither the world oil price nor our exports are reliable  for repaying the debts on time. And so, the sooner the debts are  paid the more we can avoid the oil market fluctuations and debt  crisis...    Liquidity &amp; Inflation: According to the 1994-5  budget bill, state-owned companies add Rls 4,365b to the  government's debt to the banking system, for they don't pay back  a major part of the loans thay have received.    Unfortunately, there is a big gap between the credits  granted  to the people and to the government sectors. In the 1994-5  budget bill the government instructs the banks to provide Rls  7,598b in credits to government-affiliated units and Rls 1,565b  for the private sector. Among the government establishments too  a huge portion goes to oil, gas, petrochemical, underground  transportation system, steel, aviation and sugar-cane projects.    If the credits prescribed for the banks are set next year at  the same levels indicated above and the private sector receives  as much credits as it received this year, the liquidity  expansion will exceed 25%. And this would bear no  relation to  the average 11.7% set by the Second Five-Year Development  Plan.    Since the rate of inflation has hitherto grown in pace with  liquidity, it will be increasing by the same ratio next year.  And that is if there is no budget deficit, or else liquidity  would assume a faster rate of expansion.    Inflation, however, can be contained through controlling the  credit ceiling. One should at least avoid to extend credits to  those investments which have no economic justification and whose  repayment by state companies is not possible. Otherwise, this  would be considered a kind of budget deficit and could generate  inflation.    As for the banking system, its organizational structure has  to be reformed and revised. The administrative, organizational  and promotional expenses of banks are already very high.  Besides, the banking network charges credit receivers high  profit (interest) and surcharges.    These have to be reconsidered... The cost-price of money at  our banks is high compared with what it should be, and the  penalty is paid by the public.    One of the problems relating to how banks are managed is the  composition of the Money and Credit Council. A noticeable number  of its members are from the credit-using ministries. In order to  reform the monetary system, the composition of the Money and  Credit Council has to change with mostly organizational-economic  officials and economic pundits, not credit-users, being on it.  Also, to reform the economic decison-making system the  composition of the Council of Economy has to be altered. Because  the consumer establishments are in the majority in this council  and they push the latter's decisions towards being uneconomic.    A problem with the banks is that they have come to own  companies. These should be transferred to the people as soon as  possible. Direct investment accounting for 50% of the  share  should also be delegated to the people.    As monopoly is harmful in many economic activities, the  banks  too must come out of monopoly within the rules of Islam and the  Constitution. Non-bank credit institutions should be allowed to  operate so that the grounds for healthy competition would be  provided. In this way the state banks which now call themselves  non-government and public would no longer be able to impose all  sorts of costs on credit users.    1 - The amount of loan to be received by some companies from  the banking system in the year beginning 21 March '94 is like  this: National Oil Company Rls 1.643b, Continental Shelf Oil  Company Rls 130b, National Oil Products Distribution Company Rls  166b, National Gas Company Rls 226b, Power Generational and  Transmission Company of Iran (Tavanir) Rls 427b, National  Iranian Steel Corp Rls 280b, (Esfahan) Steel Mill Rls 100b,  Mobarakeh Steel Rls 120b, National Petrochemical Company Rls  1,062b, IRI Airline Rls 150b, Iranian National Steel Industrial  Group Rls 100b, Metro Company Rls 100b and Sugar-Cane and  Ancillary Industries Development Company Rls 500b.    2. As a consequence of the budget notes alone 16%  will be  added to the liquidity next year.</p>

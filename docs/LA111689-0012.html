			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: KOOP JUST WHAT FUND-RAISER FOR HOSPICE NEEDED  </P> <P> Wearing the instantly recognizable, steel gray beard that makes him look a  cross between Abraham Lincoln and Captain Ahab, former Surgeon General C.  Everett Koop marched into the Admiral Suite at the San Diego Marriott, cast a  stern eye over the crowd and then relaxed when asked if he really liked to be  called "Chick." He does.  </P> <P> Among those invited to address Koop by his nickname last Saturday were  philanthropist Joan Kroc and banker Gordon Luce, who served as general chairman  and dinner chairman of the San Diego Hospice testimonial at which Koop was  presented the institution's Humanitarian of the Year award.  </P> <P> Invitations to the private, predinner reception were limited to about 50 or so  top patrons of the fund-raiser, which broke its own records by attracting  nearly 800 guests and raising more than $195,000 for the acute-care center.  Karon Luce, who coached her husband on a few party-giving details, said of the  event: "It was the easiest sell in town, not just because everybody wanted to  hear Dr. Koop, but because it's such a wonderful charity. Anybody may need to  use the hospice one day."  </P> <P> Koop, who spent part of the day visiting a home-bound hospice patient before  cruising on Kroc's yacht (Kroc is largely underwriting the cost of building the  facility, under construction on Vauclain Point) and changing into black tie for  the dinner, was described as "so accommodating" by hospice foundation board  chairman Murray Galinson.  </P> <P> "I just met Dr. Koop this morning, and what a delightful human being he is,"  Galinson said. "He's so caring, it's a delight to be in his presence."  </P> <P> One of those so delighted was columnist Abigail Van Buren, perhaps better known  as Dear Abby, who advised Koop to continue to counsel the country on its major  health concerns. Among others with whom Koop chatted quietly were his wife,  Betty, Kim and Marilyn Fletcher, Iris and Matthew Strauss, Malin and Roberta  Burnham, Anne and Bill Otterson, Peggy and Peter Preuss and 1988 Humanitarian  of the Year Bill Cleator with his wife, Marilyn.  </P> <P> The accolades flowed at the dinner proper, which jammed the San Diego Ballroom  with an over-flow crowd that applauded when Rabbi Michael Sternfield said that  Koop has "the passion of the ancient prophets," and again when Mayor Maureen  O'Connor, referring to the former surgeon general's outspoken efforts against  the AIDS epidemic, called him "one of the courageous leaders of our time."  </P> <P> After an interlude filled by the Steven Spencer Orchestra, a chicken Wellington  and bananas Foster dinner and a video presentation that featured remarks by  Ronald Reagan, Jonas Salk and Barbara Walters, Koop managed to get the last  word.  </P> <P> Having just accepted the award presented by Kroc, Koop said that he had never  considered himself a humanitarian, but allowed that the shoe probably fit. He  spoke at length about his landmark career as the first surgeon to limit himself  to a children's practice (it was said earlier that his proudest moment came  when he separated a set of Siamese twins and "allowed them to lead lives of  their own"), and as one of the first doctors to recognize that children can  develop cancer.  </P> <P> But he added that he did regard his eight years in Washington as the topper to  it all.  </P> <P> "I had a marvelous career as a pediatric surgeon that I thought nothing could  beat," said Koop, "but my time as surgeon general did."  </P> <P> Among those joining in the standing ovation that followed were Roger and Ellen  Revelle, John and Marcia Trombold, master interior decorator Steve Chase (who  has charge of Joan Kroc's new North County mansion); weight-loss czarina Jenny  Craig and her husband, Sid; Doug and Betsy Manchester; Frank and Lee Goldberg;  Dean and Marie Dunphy; Cliff and Ruth Grobstein, and Joan Embery, who brought  along a toucan from the San Diego Zoo.  </P> <P> The Koop testimonial was the second such event to break its own records last  week.  </P> <P> On Thursday, a local Who's Who roster of nearly 800 turned out at the San Diego  Hilton to honor Larry and Junko Cushman at the 13th annual "A Tribute to the  Golden Years" dinner, given by Senior Adult Services to benefit its countywide  Meals-on-Wheels program.  </P> <P> Sally Thornton, who co-chaired the event with her husband, John, said "We've  broken all records for Meals-on-Wheels dinners, and I understand the Hilton has  never served so many meals to one group. And we expect tonight to be our most  financially successful." Proceeds were expected to exceed $125,000.  </P> <P> The guests seemed inclined to grant the records, but to dispute their exact  cause. Overall credit was given to the honorees, although Larry Cushman, a  member of one of the county's oldest families, said, "I'm pleased to be here  tonight, but you know, they're not here for us, they're here for  Meals-on-Wheels."  </P> <P> Tawfiq Khoury, with his wife, Richel, a long-time pal of the Cushmans,  disagreed. "These two people not only give money, which is the easiest thing  you can give, but they give of themselves." (Marion Bourland added another  point of view, saying, "The real reason the Cushmans are being honored is  because they're so damn cute!")  </P> <P> The disagreements ended, however, when Carrie Nordby, a 100-year-old Norwegian  immigrant and a current Meals-on-Wheels client, was invited to the podium.  </P> <P> "Meals-on-Wheels keeps me happy," she said in a fluttery but clear voice that  resounded through the room. "To see those bright faces bringing in those meals  just makes my day every day."  </P> <P> Meals program executive director Barbara Bright said that about 300,000 hot  lunches and cold suppers are delivered annually, by a volunteer force that  numbers roughly 1,600, to several thousand seniors who no longer can cook for  themselves. The program receives no public funds, and is supported by donations  and by subsidized fees from clients who can afford to pay; those who cannot  afford the service receive it free.  </P> <P> "Seniors stay independent because of San Diegans helping San Diegans," Bright  said. "The proceeds we earn tonight will keep our meals program on wheels."  </P> <P> The Cushmans' many civic ties and their intercultural marriage (Junko was born  in Japan's Nagano prefecture; her parents, Takehiko and Yaeko Sano, flew over  for the event) were represented by the ecumenical nature of the event. Rev.  Akio Miyaji, minister of the Buddhist Temple of San Diego, offered the  invocation, and Rabbi Lenore Bohm of Temple Solel in Encinitas the blessing  over the meal. Msgr. Joseph Carroll of the St. Vincent de Paul Center gave the  benediction as a special favor to Larry Cushman, who is chairman of the  center's board.  </P> <P> In his acceptance of the tribute, Cushman told the audience, "We are all here  tonight because we believe in the same value of caring for the seniors in our  community. They all are members of our extended family."  </P> <P> However, it fell to Junko Cushman to bring down the house. "For my old age, I  have a plan," she teased. "No. 1, I'll get a face lift. No. 2, I'll get  Meals-on-Wheels. And No. 3, if my husband ever falls in love with someone  younger and prettier, I'll do the same!"  </P> <P> The guest list included Helen and Elliott Cushman, Richard and Harriet Levi,  Liz and Joe Yamada, Norma and Sam Assam, City Councilmen Wes Pratt, Ron Roberts  and Bruce Henderson; Ross and Betty Tharp; Barbara Bry and Patrick Kruer;  Lillian and William Fishman; Carol and Mike Alessio; Norma Hirsh; Jan Madigan,  and Joy and Merl Ledford.  </P></p>

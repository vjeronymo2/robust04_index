			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Sosin, director of the Scientific Research </F> Center of Problems of Economics and Management: "The Practice of  Economic Reform. Unusual Thoughtlessness"]    [Text] Kemerovo--The popular thesis about "shifting  the center of gravity of the reforms to the localities" is  erroneous--thinks the author of the article published below.  Only the Government of the Russian Federation is capable of  bringing the coal, metallurgical, chemical, and machine-building  regional complexes out of the crisis. And it must not take its  hands off the wheel.  <H5>  The Monopoly is Immortal. Long Live the Monopoly! </H5>   I must say that no document developed by the president's  administration, signed, and, moreover, read by B. Yeltsin, has  evoked such authentic interest among specialists as the first  Message of the president of the Russian Federation to the  Federal Assembly, "On Strengthening Russian Statehood." The  document can be viewed in various ways. But there is no doubt  about one thing: The Message clearly brought Ye. Gaydar's  economic experiments to an end.    In his message the president stated that "1994 must be the  year of the formation of Russian financial-industrial groups.  The government must make sure that they are created strictly on  a voluntary basis and prevent the revival of old ministerial  structures, illegal appropriation of state property, and  unjustified monopolism."    The creation of corporations has proved to be viable  throughout the entire 20th century. But, as analysis shows, the  potential capabilities of financial-industrial groups (FPG)  could remain unrealized if their creation turns into a regular  campaign and they themselves are regarded as a panacea for all  economic problems.    Is the alarm justified? Unfortunately, yes. And here is a  concrete confirmation of this. The administration of Kemerovo  Oblast, based on the key points of the Edict of the President of  the Russian Federation No. 2096 of 5 December 1993 "On the  Creation of Financial-Industrial Groups in the Russian  Federation," began to work actively on forming the  financial-industrial group Kuzbass Company. According to the  intention of the authors of its concept, it "is being created  for fuller utilization of scientific-technical and production  potential of the Kemerovo production-territorial complex." As  you can see, in Kuzbass they are trying to rely on the edict to  create not an interbranch structure but a regional one which  would function like the old Sovnarkhoz [Soviet of the National  Economy].    But, God help them, with "local" problems. Here, as analysis  shows, we are speaking about something altogether different: the  creation of a real monopolistic monster which could cause  serious harm both to the region and to Russia as a whole. The  administration intends to solve the oblast's economic problems,  among other things, "through cartel agreements of participants  in the financial-industrial group...." It is in this connection  that I fully share the viewpoint of Ye. Salnikova, deputy chief  of the Main Administration for the Development of Competition of  the State Committee of the Russian Federation for Antimonopoly  Policy and Support of New Economic Structures: "The most  dangerous thing for market relations are agreements in the form  of financial-industrial groups among competitors--enterprises  operating on the market for the same commodity." How does one  avoid this?  <H5>  We Can Save Ourselves Only Together, in the Same Boat </H5>   Speaking at a conference of leaders of coal enterprises and  associations of the Kuzbass, oblast Governor M. Kislyuk said  that: "We need financial-production groups, since it has long  been clear that rescuing the drowning is the problem of the  drowning themselves. No Moscow and no ministry will help us."    With all due respect to the governor, I think Kislyuk's  statement is profoundly erroneous and very rash.    What is the most alarming thing? The key circumstance for  the  Kuzbass is that saving the oblast economy is far from an oblast  problem since we cannot overcome our adversities within the  framework of the Kuzbass alone. Why? Because these problems are  too great and the price of solving them is very high...let us  think about it.    If we tried to rely only on our own investment resources and  organizational efforts, we would not be able to complete the  structural rearrangement of the oblast national economy or  perhaps even just the fuel complex by the end of the 21st  century. The essence of the problem, in my opinion, is this.  According to figures from oblast statistics, by 1 July 1992 the  fixed capital of the oblast national economy (before it was  reappraised) was estimated at 49.1 billion rubles [R] in 1984  prices. Of this amount, R39.3 billion was in fixed production  capital. So if we set for ourselves just a partial task and  began structural rearrangement only of the sphere of material  production and the production infrastructure, we would have to  invest, depending on the branch, R3.5 and sometimes even R10 in  capital investments for each ruble of fixed production capital.    Our calculations show that just high-quality transformation  of worn-out fixed production capital will take from R25.0  billion to R41.0 billion in capital investments in 1984 prices.  As for agriculture, which produces approximately 38 percent of  the social norm of grain, it could collapse completely if  financial aid is not rendered to it from the federal budget.    So are we at an impasse? The problem, it seems, can be  resolved only on the basis of combined efforts: federal,  interregional, intraregional, branch, and production. For no  matter what anyone says, the Kuzbass with all of its factors is  only a particle of immense Russia. Its key branch--coal--will be  subsidized from the federal budget in the future as well.  Therefore there will be no "economic gallop."    We will be forced to pass through such stages as:  stabilization, which will occupy the years 1994-1996;  restoration; structural, and, finally, market. Conducting the  basic economic reforms will probably take from 25 to 30 years.  And this is in the best case, with a satisfactory solution to  the most difficult economic problems and mandatory provision of  the necessary investment resources. But in all probability the  emergence of the Kuzbass from its structural and ecological  crisis will last up until the middle of the 21st century.    Here a great deal can be resolved through a well-considered  and weighed regional economic policy, strategy, and selected  priorities. We will probably not be able to reach the key  indicators of the United States, Japan, and Western Europe until  the end of the 21st century. The historic disparity is too great.  <H5>  What Can the Oblast Administration Do? </H5>   And so the problems are legion. Who should work on them?  Within the framework of the oblast, who is responsible for  leading the process of economic reform? The answer to this is  simple: Of course, it is the oblast administration. But, as the  situation shows, its economic role is decreasing and in all  probability it will decrease even more. The reason for this  phenomenon is fairly commonplace. Everyone who is very familiar  with modern history recalls that before 1929 in the United  States the majority of economic functions were under the  jurisdiction of the states. But the crisis of 1929-1932  demonstrated the inability of the states and local authorities  to handle socioeconomic problems alone, which brought about  strengthening of federal power within the framework of F.  Roosevelt's "New Deal."    Therefore, drawing historical analogies, I can say with a  fair amount of certainty that the thesis: "The center of gravity  of the reforms must shift to the regions," if speaking about  branches of specialization, will not stand up even under the  slightest criticism since one can see nothing here but good  intentions and wishes. In this case I have in mind investment  resources. It is in this connection that the federal government,  relying on the region's administration, must take over the main  functions for bringing the coal, metallurgical, chemical,  machine building, and other regional complexes out of the crisis  and also provide a federal production infrastructure.    And agriculture should be under the direct jurisdiction of  local administrations; this pertains to the intraregional  production and social infrastructure. After a couple of years  when the administration begins to be restored and return to its  initial condition, when its quantitative and qualitative growth  begins, when normal tax mechanisms are created--then, I agree,  it will be possible to begin a stage-by-stage increase in the  role of regional administrations in solving economic problems.  At the same time this would be based on interaction between  federal and regional legislation. But today....    In my view, it is necessary, in the first place, to develop  a  full-scale "general plan for management of the oblast national  economy," which is capable of functioning in a market  environment; second, to create as a part of the oblast  administration a "Committee on Coordination of Economic Activity  and Organization of Cooperative-Economic Ties in the National  Economy of Kemerovo Oblast."    In general I think that the oblast administration, while not  a market subject, can do a great deal for its reliable  functioning--through the creation and priority support of  corporations (financial-production groups), associations, and  private and joint enterprises.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / British Coal expects sharp fall in profits BRITISH COAL is expected to report substantially lower overall profits - and may sustain losses - for the year just ended in spite of increased efficiency and significant improvements in operating results. The reduction in overall profits will result from exceptional losses arising from write-offs due to coal price falls and from delays in pit closures. Separately, unions and trustees of the British Coal staff pension scheme are expected to decide later this week how to challenge legally the corporation's move to use a pension fund surplus to finance payments to be paid into a fund for redundancy payments. British Coal owes the special fund Pounds 480m, but says it is entitled to Pounds 470m of the Pounds 1bn pension scheme surplus. Unions argue that the BC move is illegal. The corporation already enjoys a pensions contribution holiday until 1997 due to a previous surplus. The steep fall in overall profits from Pounds 170m in 1991-92 will be the first worsening in the corporation's overall financial performance in three years. However, in the run-up to privatisation, expected in the next two years, the government will be able to point to a significant rise in British Coal's operating profits from Pounds 360m in 1991-92. Ministers will argue, and British Coal's potential buyers are likely to accept, that operating profits are the best gauge for judging British Coal's potential. It will irk the corporation to report a fall in profits in a year when productivity has risen 20 per cent. However, Whitehall is braced for a sharp fall as a result of two exceptional items. The first item results from having to keep open 10 pits no longer being mined but which British Coal has been forced to maintain because of a High Court decision that it failed to consult properly on their future. It intends either to close them or license them to the private sector. The cost of keeping the pits in a state which would allow them to be mined again is about Pounds 13m a month. Since British Coal stopped mining at most of the 10 in November the effect on the results for the year ending March 28 is likely to be at least Pounds 60m. The accounts for last year, due to be published in July, are also likely to be affected by a fall in the price of coal. British Coal executives are working on proposals to write down the corporation's assets on the grounds that the falling price of coal means stocks and machinery are no longer as valuable. The write-offs could amount to over Pounds 100m. NUM court threat, Page 9</p>

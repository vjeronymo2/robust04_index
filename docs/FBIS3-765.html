He told WEEKEND STAR that resistance to the homeland  government had developed "organically".    The ANC, he said, had attempted for some time to persuade  the  Bophuthatswana government "to be sensitive to the desires of the  people by opening up the space for free political activity.    "We thought that by doing so we would help Chief Lucas  Mangope and his government to bow out gracefully," Molefe said.    The homeland's rejection of offers made by the ANC had left  the organisation with no option but to throw its weight behind  the striking workers.    Molefe said a powder keg had been simmering for a long time  in the area, and shootings and daily arrests had provided the  spark.    The intervention of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC]  in the crisis had resulted in the opening up of a climate for  free political activity, he said.    "It is important that we call on the Bophuthatswana security  forces to co-operate with the people and the TEC, and to refrain  from shooting their own people. This, we believe, will create  the conditions for their speedy integration into the new defence  force, police force and civil service," Molefe said.    He further appealed to the public to refrain from the  destruction of property. Businesses provided jobs, he said.</p>

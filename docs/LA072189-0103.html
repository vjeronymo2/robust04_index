			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN GUILTY IN PLOT TO SELL U.S. SECRETS TO SOVIET BLOC  </P> <P> A former civilian worker for the Army was convicted Thursday of conspiring with  a U.S. soldier to sell American military secrets to East German and Soviet  agents.  </P> <P> The guilty verdict against Huseyin Yildirim, 61, was returned by a U.S.  District Court jury. Judge B. Avant Edenfield said he would sentence Yildirim,  who could be given life in prison, within 60 days.  </P> <P> Yildirim, a Turkish-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, was charged with conspiring  with Warrant Officer James William Hall III to sell classified information to  Soviet Bloc agents between 1983 and 1988, when Hall was stationed in Germany  and New Jersey. Yildirim was working as a mechanic at an Army auto shop in  Germany at the time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seen Damaging to U.S.  </P> <P> Defense experts said the espionage scheme damaged U.S. intelligence efforts in  Europe. Hall worked as an analyst of intercepted radio and telephone traffic  and coded messages.  </P> <P> The trial was held here because Hall was stationed at nearby Ft. Stewart at the  time of his arrest last December. He pleaded guilty at a court-martial in March  and was sentenced to 40 years in prison.  </P> <P> In closing arguments Wednesday, defense lawyer Lamar Walter argued that Hall  was solely to blame for the espionage.  </P> <P> "The evidence you heard is sufficient to convict him (Hall), but not my man,"  Walter said. "Mr. Hall is very definitely a guilty man. The man is not capable  of being believed."  </P> <P> Walter called no witnesses after Assistant U.S. Atty. Fred Kramer rested the  government's case.  </P> <P> Kramer contended the evidence showed overwhelmingly that Yildirim was Hall's  contact, that he carried documents to the Soviets and East Germans and that he  returned with money.  </P> <P> Before resting his case, Kramer elicited testimony from FBI espionage expert  Nicholas J. Walsh that a "Dear Friend" letter found among Yildirim's property  in Berlin included a "shopping list . . . a list of things they would like . .  . . You would probably be paid the most for it."  </P> <P> Testimony said Yildirim's fingerprint was found on the unsigned letter. FBI  agents testified that Yildirim's fingerprints also were on two $50 bills found  in Hall's truck.  </P> <P> FBI agents seized the bills, a phony passport and military intelligence  documents at Hall's home and from his truck in Richmond Hill, Ga., when he was  arrested Dec. 20, evidence showed.  </P></p>

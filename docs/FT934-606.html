			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Overseas buying spurs Taiwan 4.4 per cent ahead Firm share prices in the electronics sector, led by Oki Electric, brought the Nikkei average up a little ahead of today's national holiday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei fluctuated within a narrow range before closing 130.31 better at 17,445.74, after a day's low of 17,296.33 and high of 17,453.15. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.64 to 1,450.37, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.37 to 1,194.95. Sentiment also improved on afternoon reports that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, may unveil an economic stimulus package along with his speech on political reform tomorrow. However, many investors remained on the sidelines as uncertainty over the political situation prevailed, and technical trading on the futures market dominated the day. Volume was 280m shares, against 220m. Rises outpaced falls by 587 to 396, with 179 issues unchanged. The design of the government's package to stimulate the country's financial markets, announced on Tuesday, had little affect on share prices. Along with deregulation measures, the Ministry of Finance will allow the resumption of rights issues, which have been suspended since March 1990. Although the government hopes that an increase in blue chip issues will attract investors back into the market, traders said the stock market had enough supply already. Oki Electric, the most active issue of the day, rose Y38 to Y510. Reports that the company may post a pre-tax profit for the current business year to March, instead of a pre-tax loss, encouraged investors. The yen's fall against the dollar supported some export-orientated high-technology stocks. The Japanese currency closed at a seven-month low of Y111.30 yesterday to the dollar. TDK moved ahead Y40 to Y3,800 and Victor Y10 to Y820. Automobile issues were also strong, with Suzuki Motor up Y50 at Y1,060 and Honda Motor gaining Y20 at Y1,500. But some stocks lost steam. Matsushita Electric Industrial closed unchanged at Y1,490 and NEC lost Y3 at Y857. Hanwa, the steel trader, fell Y20 to Y630. The company, known for the large losses on financial investments it made during the late 1980s, has been facing selling due to worries over financial difficulties. Moody's Investors Service yesterday lowered its credit ratings for the company from BA2 to B1. In Osaka, the OSE average improved 8.73 to 19,221.65 in volume of 129.3m shares. Roundup The region produced another selection of new highs yesterday, with major new issue debuts, so far, failing to make much of a dent in demand. TAIWAN soared 4.4 per cent to a 29-month high in hectic trade, the weighted index closing 228.88 stronger at 5,474.75 as turnover nearly doubled from TDollars 55.24bn to TDollars 103.92bn. Financials led the gains, surging 6.6 per cent as signs of foreign buying were used as an excuse to act on bullish domestic sentiment and loose liquidity. Insurance stocks, including Cathay, Fubon and Shinkong, were all the day's limit up. KUALA LUMPUR saw further speculative buying and renewed institutional interest, the KLSE composite index ending 24.77 higher at a new closing peak of 1,121.38. Volume swelled to 776m shares from 497.8m and the big winners, again, were rubber and tin stocks driven by takeover rumours. BANGKOK hit its new high on heavy buying of finance and brokerage houses in the afternoon, and on active trade of the new Telecom Asia listing. The SET index climbed 16.52 points to 1,523.75 in active trading of Bt24.75bn, with TA, the most active stock on Bt4.32bn turnover, finishing at Bt116 against an initial offer price of Bt55. HONG KONG talked of bargain hunting, although the 183.68, or 1.75 per cent, gain in the Hang Seng index left it just over 100 points short of Monday's record high - itself 99 per cent higher than the January 4 low for the year. Turnover was HKDollars 7.66bn against an adjusted HKDollars 9.09bn on Tuesday. The real estate sector, weak on Tuesday, led the gains with Sun Hung Kai Properties putting on HKDollars 4 at HKDollars 61.50. NEW ZEALAND strengthened after a weak start to close 1.2 per cent ahead, the NZSE-40 index rising 24.81 to 2,071.78 in turnover of NZDollars 46 million. Telecom rebounded from selling earlier in the week, ending NZDollars 10 higher at NZDollars 395. AUSTRALIA fell as another fall in News Corp triggered profit-taking in most sectors. The All Ordinaries index finished 13.8 lower at 2053.2 in turnover of ADollars 620m. News Corporation, which dropped 33 cents on Tuesday, fell another 38 cents, or nearly 4 per cent to ADollars 9.32. Investors worried about the USDollars 1.5bn the company paid to broadcast the next four seasons of National Football Conference games in the US. KARACHI closed lower on profit-taking by jobbers and institutional investors after the steep rises of the past few days, the KSE 100 index falling 14.38 to 2,062.86. BOMBAY, pensive after the parliamentary report on last year's Rs40bn stock scandal, stayed closed for the seventh successive session due to a brokers' boycott after a ban on forward trading. There was some hope that this issue could be resolved today.</p>

However the meat is safe to eat, the Ministry of Agriculture  said yesterday.    Farmer David Blything, of Green Lane Farm, Kelso, where  traces of bovine immuno deficienco virus (BIV) have been found  in at least two animals, said yesterday that the meat was likely  to be made into mince or beefburgers.    Mr. Jim Jack, solicitor for Mr. Blything, said last night  one  of the cattle was sold for slaughter before tests showed it  contained BIV antibodies.    A second animal, which tested positive, had also been sent  for slaughter as had a third from the herd which had not shown  signs of antibodies.    BIV is a distant relative of HIV virus in humans, but the  ministry said there was no risk to public health.    It originated in the United States and was first discovered  in Britain in 1990.    -- Pig farmers were facing a serious economic crisis, Mr.  David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said at  its annual meeting in London yesterday.    An urgent message had been sent by him to Mr. Renee  Steichen,  EC farm commissioner, urging him to speed up an inquiry into  state aid given to French pig producers.    The NFU says that the state aid puts the British producers  at  a competitive disadvantage.</p>

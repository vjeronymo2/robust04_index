			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Move to cut audits attacked PLANS to abolish the statutory audit requirement for small companies should be strongly resisted, the outgoing president of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants said yesterday. Mr Ken Anderson attacked both the idea and its supporters at the association's annual meeting in London. The Department of Trade and Industry is considering abolishing the mandatory audit requirement for very small companies. Under the proposals, requirements could be eased for all companies below the Pounds 36,600 value added tax threshold. Mr Anderson accused the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales  - which has supported the idea  - of 'orchestrating' a campaign for abolition. 'In the current climate, with the audit side of the profession under such focus . . . it is surely not the time to seek to reduce the role of the audit,' he said. He argued that limited liability status imposed responsibilities on companies.</p>

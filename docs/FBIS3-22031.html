			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] A few minutes ago, Attorney General Gustavo Arrieta  said it is not true that the United States has stopped sending  evidence in conjunction with the Medellin Cartel surrender  process in Colombia. International wire services have, over the  past few hours, reported that the U.S. State Department will no  longer cooperate with Colombian justice.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Attorney  General, what is the official information or reaction to reports  by international wire services that U.S. legal assistance to  Colombia has been suspended?    [Arrieta] Diego, the information I have from Colombian  authorities is that this is not true.    [Reporter] Where could this information have originated  then?    [Arrieta] I do not know. I think there are too many  misunderstandings on this topic, too many unverified reports  circulating. The truth is that the news could have come from any  of these confusing reports. I reiterate, however, that according  to the information I have, this is not true.    [Reporter] Mr. Prosecutor, what is the situation right now  regarding U.S.-Colombian relations in conjunction with  exchanging legal information relating to drug trafficking?    [Arrieta] These past few weeks we have talked with the U.S.  State Department through the U.S. Embassy and with the support  of the Colombian Government. The idea is to bolster this process  because we believe that it continues to be fundamental for  carrying out surrender policies and legal actions in Colombia. I  do not think there is any sense in denying that relations have  been tense and difficult, but we are working on this and I hope  it turns out well and we will be able to rebuild the judicial  cooperation program.    [Reporter] Does cooperation continue despite current  problems?    [Arrieta] Yes, we have received cooperation these past few  days. Obviously, the intensity and level has dropped  significantly, but I repeat, I believe it will recover. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Moldavian leaders tried to placate outraged minority groups by considering a  watered-down version of a plan to make their native tongue the official  language of the ethnically diverse Soviet republic. Legislative leaders,  reportedly at the urging of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, are leaning  toward adopting the compromise to try to stop strikes by Russians and other  groups opposed to the pending language law. The original proposal would make  Moldavian the only official language of the republic. The compromise plan would  make it the language of government officials and documents, while Russian would  be the language for everyday contacts.  </P></p>

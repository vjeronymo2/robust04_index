			<p>BFN     [Text] The movement of government and Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] forces to assembly areas has become  increasingly slower over the past few days. Since the beginning  of this week, only 68 government troops and four from Renamo  arrived at assembly areas. A total of 33,369 soldiers from the  government had been confined by yesterday. This represents 54  percent of the total number of soldiers to be confined. On  Renamo's side, a total of 14,809 soldiers have already been  confined. This represents 77 percent of troops to be confined.</p>

Thus, a cease-fire which was due to be put into effect as of  yesterday morning in Kabul was broken with exchange of scattered  fire, and the opposition group's attacks against one another's  positions.    Dispatches received indicate that the set cease-fire was  proposed by a council of Afghan Mojahedin commanders.    The Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution of  Afghanistan on Wednesday January the 19th unilaterally announced  that it will unconditionally accept the cease-fire conditions  and will observe it as of 6 a.m. Thursday morning.    In the meantime, reports coming in from Peshawar, Pakistan,  indicate that a four man team consisting of the representatives  of Hekmatyar's Islamic Party, Dostum's National Islamic  Movement, Mojahedin's National Salvation Front, and the Wahdat  Party have arrived in Peshawar to hold talks with the  responsible Pakistani officials, the Afghan parties, as well as  theologians and the chieftains.    Based on this report, another group of Afghan commanders  too,  have decided to mediate between the opposition groups and  supporters of Rabbani's presidency.    In the meantime, the United Nations yesterday called on the  warring sides in Kabul to create safe corridors for relief  assistance to tens of thousands of Afghans who have fled to the  nearby cities from Kabul.    This is while the International Red Cross Committee has  announced that clashes between hostile groups in Kabul has left  600 dead and 7600 injured.    War in Kabul continues at a time when the leaders of the  warring groups have not yet attained common principles on the  division of power in a country, which has witnessed war for the  past 15 years, and where military clashes in Kabul has led to  the killing of a high number of innocent people in that country.    Despite mediation by the neighboring countries the clashes  still continue.    Beyond doubt the bloody war which we have witnessed in Kabul  over the past few days will not entail anything other than  adding further dimensions to the ruins of 15 years of war.    Heavy losses arising from the spread of war and bloodshed  has  damaged the brilliant record of 14 years of struggle by the  Afghan people and will leave its negative and unpleasant effects  in the history of Afghanistan.    Evidently the new conditions which the present leaders are  trying to obtain by making the use of military power will by no  means solve the numerous problems faced by the Afghan people,  for any solution to the problems, specially the political ones  is legitimate only when the majority of Afghan people accept it.    On this basis, the present war whose most immediate result  is  spread of ruins, loss of resources, and waste of human force  will not only not solve any problems of the disastrous stricken  Afghan people, but will add to their problems.    At any rate, the meeting and talks between the four-man team  and the Pakistani officials is a move aimed at putting an end to  the clashes and establishment of peace in Afghanistan.    And it will be efficient only if all the warring factions  participate in it.    Hence, if one of the warring sides does not take part in it  the success of the measure has to be doubted.    Evidently, although efforts aimed at paving the way for  meeting among the leaders of the opposition groups in  Afghanistan may face problems in terms of putting an end to the  war in Kabul, beyond doubt, perseverance of mediatory countries  along with flexibility which political groups have to show will  picture a promising outlook for the agonized Afghan people.    At any rate, we must draw the attention of the leaders of  the  warring sides to the reality that the experience of the past 21  months in Afghanistan has shown that war is not the main  solution to political problems in Afghanistan.    And that the continuation of clashes in Afghanistan will not  entail any result other than increasingly the number of war  victims who are mostly innocent people.</p>

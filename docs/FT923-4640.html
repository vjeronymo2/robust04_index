			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE DERIVATIVES market experienced a volatile but busy end of the account session as early strength gave way to profit-taking and a retreat caused by poor economic data from the US, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, September opened strongly at 2,420 but after a brief move up when it touched 2,423 and pulled the underlying cash market higher, profit-taking set in leading it to gently drift lower. The release of disappointing employment figures from the US after 1.30pm caused a sharp retreat in the contract and a poor opening on Wall Street, following the figures caused further weakness. Interest from Goldman Sachs, which was a buyer of September and a seller of the December contracts helped produce a rally just before the close. September closed at 2,377, down 34 on its previous close and around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was high at 14,348 contracts. Traded options were also busy, with turnover reaching 33,357 lots. The FT-SE 100 option traded 18,066 lots, while Hanson was the busiest stock option with 1,752 lots.</p>

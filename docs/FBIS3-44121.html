			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Malawi Young Pioneers Seek Political </F> Asylum in Zimbabwe]    [Text] The Portuguese news agency, LUSA, reported yesterday  that the Zimbabwean authorities announced over the weekend that  a group of Malawian nationals, allegedly members of the "Young  Pioneers" are seeking political asylum in Zimbabwe.    Commissar for Refugees Samuel Mhiribidi has confirmed the  presence of Malawian citizens in Harare, but he said that he  does not know whether they belong to the "Young Pioneers" group  because none of them presented themselves as a member of this  organization. Mhiribidi said that there are some who have not  yet presented themselves to the authorities, but some Malawian  nationals residing here have told us that the aforementioned  persons are members of the "Young Pioneers".    Until last month, the "Young Pioneers" were the youth wing  of  President Kamuzu Banda's Malawi Congress Party, one of the most  feared organizations in Malawi.    Charles Kadama Manga, head of consular services in the  Malawian Embassy in Harare, told LUSA that despite the fact that  he does not have details on the aforementioned people, it seems  "unreasonable" to him that they are seeking political asylum in  Zimbabwe, adding that the Malawian authorities, including  President Banda, have appealed to the Pioneers to return to  Malawi, promising that they would not be tried for their crimes.    About 7,000 Pioneers took refuge in the bush following  violent clashes between the group and the Malawi Army that broke  out after two soldiers were shot dead.    The commissar for refugees has favored the decision to  receive the group, stating that it is the country's policy to  shelter people who flee their countries alleging political  persecution. Mhiribidi said that the OAU Convention stipulates  that granting refugee status does not mean hostility toward  one's country of origin.    The announcement of the presence of "Young Pioneers" in  Zimbabwe comes less than one week after the Mozambican and  Malawian Governments agreed on the repatriation of members of  this organization who had penetrated the Mozambican territory.    The "Young Pioneers" entered Mozambique from the Milange  border area in Zambezia Province, heading for Tete Province. It  is believed that they headed for Tete because it is the last  province before reaching Zimbabwe.    Malawi has a border with the Mozambican Provinces of Niassa,  Zambezia and Tete, and out of these only Tete has a border with  Zimbabwe.    The agreement on the repatriation of the "Pioneers" from our  country followed a request by the Malawian authorities, after  talks between the Joint Defense and Security Commission of the  two countries.</p>

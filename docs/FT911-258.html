			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Observer: Bananas Woody Allen, the American comedian, writer and film director, may not seem the most obvious name to associate with the Italian Co-op, one of the country's biggest retailers with almost L8,000bn (Pounds 3.6bn) in sales. But shooting for a series of five 45-second TV commercials written and directed by Allen is due to start soon. It is not quite the first time Allen, best known for his films of New York life, is making a commercial. An earlier project for the Campari drinks group never got off the ground owing to problems over the script. The scripts for the Co-op's new ads have already been delivered, although executives at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in Italy, which has the Co-op account, are sworn to secrecy as to their content. However, word is that there is already some concern about the use of typical Allen characters drawn from the US east coast, such as the New York shrink, to sell the fruits, vegetables and other foods promoted by the new ads. Nevertheless, Italy's Co-op, which is both bigger and richer than most of its European counterparts, is determined to go ahead, and may even try to draw attention to its status-raising director by giving Allen an on-screen credit at the end of each commercial. The company is less keen to say how much he is being paid. Peter Falk, the television detective 'Colombo', reportedly earned L700m for his Co-op ads five years ago. Evidently, the company made the artistic Allen an offer he couldn't refuse.</p>

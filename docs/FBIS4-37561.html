			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former president of </F> south Yemen, by Shadiyah Riyad; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has  left for New York to submit a report to UN Secretary General Dr.  Butrus-Ghali. Which side do you think he will blame for his  mission's failure?    [Muhammad] First of all, I would like to thank Cairo radio  for its concern and attention to the events in Yemen and its  objective reporting of the news. I also wish to thank His  Excellency President Husni Mubarak for his concern for Yemen's  security and stability. I believe it is still possible to  contain the Yemeni crisis and that Brahimi's role has not ended  yet. I believe he should continue his good offices. He will  need help from the Arab League, the United Nations, the Arabs,  and other concerned parties. Brahimi's mission is a worthy one.  We hope his efforts will prove successful.    [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, we know that you are in touch with all  Yemeni parties. You have said that the possibility of ending  the crisis still exists. However, the issue has gone before the  UN Security Council for a second time. Does this mean it has  reached a new, critical stage?    [Muhammad] At first, we hoped that the crisis would be  handled among the Yemeni leaders themselves. I said earlier  that the crisis should have been handled in a domestic context.  We also hoped that the cooperation of the brothers in the  region and the Arab League would help to settle the conflict.  Regrettably the situation escalated and became more  complicated. Speaking on Cairo radio at the beginning of the  crisis, I warned of this escalation and said it would produce  infighting and secession. The crisis has moved from the  domestic Yemeni sphere to an Arab one and finally to the  international sphere. Nevertheless we still hope that the UN  secretary general and the Security Council will help Yemen to  contain the conflict, stop the bloodshed, and bring stability  and security to the country.    [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, your remarks make me wish to ask you  about the roles played by the Arab League and the fraternal Arab  countries that are really concerned with Yemeni stability. Arab  League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has asserted  that the Yemeni crisis is not the responsibility of the world  community alone but of the Arab world as well. 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has  said, however, that he wants the issue to remain in the hands of  the Yemeni themselves. He remarked that if foreign intervention  stops, the Yemenis will be able to solve their problems more  easily through dialogue. He noted that there had been nine  months of dialogue before military actions began.    [Muhammad] 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani expresses his own  viewpoint. I actually agree with him that the crisis was a  purely Yemeni affair at the beginning. I stressed this several  times, emphasizing that a solution should be found at home by  the Yemeni leaders themselves. It is now known, however, that  the crisis has moved from the domestic sphere to a regional  sphere, to the Arab League, and finally to the United Nations.  We would like our brothers and friends to cooperate with the  Yemeni leaders to contain the conflict, reach a cease-fire, and  restore dialogue to spare the Yemeni people further losses and  tragedies.    [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, do you believe that if Lakhdar Brahimi  returns to the region, his mission will succeed?    [Muhammad] We wish him success but this requires sincere  cooperation from the warring parties. I want to declare over  Cairo radio that the problem is political and the solution must  be political. Guns and missiles must fall silent. I said this  from the beginning and called for a political solution. I  believe that all the parties must offer concessions to make a  solution possible. In fact, I am in touch with all Yemeni  parties. I and some sincere people are seeking to help the  Yemeni leaders and brothers to contain the conflict. I have  some proposals that I hope will succeed, with some assistance  from good people in Yemen and our brothers and friends abroad.    [Riyad] Have you submitted these proposals?    [Muhammad] I am continuing my contacts and consultations  with  all the parties concerned with the Yemeni crisis.    [Riyad] Mr. Muhammad, former south Yemeni president, thank  you.    [Muhammad] Thank you.</p>

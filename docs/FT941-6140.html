			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / PolyGram becomes first victim The Malaysian government's trade ban against UK companies claimed its first victim yesterday - the music group PolyGram, which is Dutch. PolyGram Television International, which has the rights to sell the television show of the Brit pop awards, said it was told by fax that the programme, which features artists such as Elton John, Meat Loaf and Van Morrison, would not be shown in Malaysia. Although PolyGram has its headquarters in London it is 75 per cent owned by Philips, the Dutch electronics group. PolyGram, which owns PolyGram Television International, is quoted on the Amsterdam and New York stock exchanges but is not listed in London. PolyGram yesterday refused to comment on the ban or to say whether it had pointed out to the Malaysian government that it is not a UK company. The company, one of the world's largest music groups, has a growing Asian business. It announced this week that its operating income in the Far East and Japan had increased by 22 per cent to Fl 197m (Pounds 68m). The Brit awards, which took place in London last month, are organised by the British Phonographic Industry, representing UK music companies. The awards were sponsored by Britannia Music which, in spite of its name, is also a PolyGram subsidiary and therefore Dutch-owned. PolyGram Television International is believed to have sold the television show to 20 countries. The contract to screen the awards in Malaysia is thought to be worth less than Pounds 10,000. PolyGram Television said the fax it had received from a Malaysian television station said: 'Due to the recent announcement by the Malaysian government pertaining to contracts with UK companies, we regret to inform you we are unable to pursue this programme for now. We will contact you again should there be any changes.'</p>

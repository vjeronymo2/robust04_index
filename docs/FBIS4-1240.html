			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] In Burundi part of the Army attempted a coup last  night, but it seems that the attempt failed. The plotters did  not manage to get the Bujumbura military camps onto their side,  and early this morning the Burundi chief of staff said the  situation was under control.    It was at 0300 that a group of 300 putschists --  paratroopers  plus a tank -- attempted to persuade other troops to join them,  but without success. A first truckload of troops involved in  the coup was arrested, and the others scattered and fled through  the town.    According to some reports, some of the officers involved in  the coup have been arrested.    The Burundi Army is made up almost entirely of Tutsis; last  night's coup attempt was probably made by Tutsi extremists.  Some reports say that Tutsi civilians were involved in the  organization of the coup, but the army staff remained loyal to  the interim president and the government. The political  leadership was warned in time and took shelter.    Some shooting was heard at about 0600 or 0630 this morning  near the military camps in the south of the town, but otherwise  Bujumbura is calm. People are starting to come cautiously out  of their houses. The French and the Belgian schools opened  normally. [passage omitted]</p>

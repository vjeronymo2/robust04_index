			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SIX MEN ARRESTED IN FATAL STABBING IN BALBOA PARK  </P> <P> Police arrested six men Wednesday night in connection with the stabbing death  of a man in Balboa Park earlier in the day, authorities said.  </P> <P> Franklyn James Black, 34, no current address available, was found by a  passer-by near Balboa Drive and Maple Street about 5 a.m., said police  spokesman Bill Robinson. Black had been stabbed several times, authorities  said.  </P> <P> The passer-by notified police, who discovered signs of a struggle 60 to 70  yards from where Black was found.  </P> <P> He was wearing white athletic shoes and shorts, leading police to believe he  had been walking or jogging, Robinson said.  </P> <P> One park visitor told police that he had encountered a group of men on  Wednesday who he believed were going to rob him, Robinson said. The man told  police he picked up a stick and scared off the group.  </P> <P> The stabbing death is believed to have occurred during a robbery, Robinson  said.  </P> <P> As police combed the canyons of Balboa Park for men matching the descriptions  provided by witnesses, the body of another man was found by a police dog in the  underbrush near 6th Avenue and Elm Street, Robinson said.  </P> <P> The death of that man is not believed to be related to the stabbing death,  Robinson said. A preliminary investigation led police to believe the second  man, unidentified, died of a drug overdose, said Sgt. Jerry Callaway. There  were no signs of trauma on the man, Callaway said.  </P> <P> Autopsies on both men are scheduled for today.  </P> <P> The search prompted police to pick up two groups of people -- some of whom were  reported to have blood on their clothes -- for questioning.  </P> <P> A wallet belonging to Black was found near where some of the people were taken  in, said Sgt. Frank Martinez.  </P> <P> Police arrested six men ranging in age from 18 to 20 years old, who identified  themselves to police as Mexican nationals who had entered the country  illegally. They were being booked and held in County Jail downtown on suspicion  of homicide, Martinez said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 12 Jun (AFP) -- The declaration of a  state of emergency in Haiti today by provisional President Emile  Jonassaint (who is not recognized by the international  community) is "a reply of firmness and legitimate defense"  against the U.S. Government, a Jonaissant associate said.    This measure and Jonaissant's solemn rejection of yielding  to  foreign pressure comes 36 hours after President Bill Clinton's  announcement that new sanctions will be applied against the  Caribbean country to force the departure of the Haitian military  chiefs.    The provisional government on Sunday had yet to publish the  "series of measures" announced by Jonaissant in his  radio-television speech early this morning, but there is great  calm in Port-au- Prince, where no special security measures are  visible.    According to the source, the establishment of the state of  emergency does not have any connection with the murder of a  soldier near the National Palace 15 days ago. A military  official, who asked to remain unidentified, blamed the death on  a guerrilla operation launched from Washington by exiled  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his supporters.    Referring to rumors according to which a group of armed men  attacked the Army headquarters in this capital in the evening  last week, the official indicated that it was "a minor incident"  and that "the shots were apparently accidental." "The incident,  which did not cause any casualties, was controlled in a few  minutes by guards, and no bullet holes were found in the  buildings," he added.    Meanwhile, official sources denied rumors about the Haitian  authorities' possible decision to close the Port-au-Prince  international airport on 21 June, four days before the  suspension of flights by the United States and Canada goes into  effect.</p>

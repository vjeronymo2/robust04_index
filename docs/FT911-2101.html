			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Benchmark incurs loss and seeks Pounds 6m Benchmark, the financial services group, is asking shareholders for Pounds 6m via a rights issue of 107.3m shares at 6p apiece on a 2-for-1 basis. The group also announced that for the first half of 1990 it incurred a loss of Pounds 4.95m pre-tax-after exceptional provisions of Pounds 5.05m compared with previous profits of Pounds 732,000. As a result group net asset value fell from Pounds 14m as at June 30 1990 to Pounds 6.5m at the end of December 1990. This would breach loan covenants, hence the rights issue. Losses per share totalled 9.23p (earnings 0.88p) and there is no interim dividend - 0.75p was paid previously. The 20p shares are being sub-divided into one new ordinary of 5p and one deferred of 15p.</p>

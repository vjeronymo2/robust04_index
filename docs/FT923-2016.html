			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Theory of bond investment culture comes unstuck - How the ERM crisis has dented a fashionable economic viewpoint IN THE period between Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism in October 1990 and the negotiation of the Maastricht treaty late last year, it became fashionable to talk about the development of a 'bond culture' in Britain. With the country beginning to import lower German-style rates of inflation via the ERM, it was suggested that the relative attractions of equities would decline vis a vis gilts; fixed-interest securities would become much more attractive in a world that harked back to the more stable price conditions of the 19th century. It was always a contentious thesis and after the events of this week it scarcely looks tenable. Within the ERM the Bundesbank provides the nearest alternative in the modern world to the gold standard on which the 19th century operated. Britain's exit from the ERM demonstrates, among other things, how hard it is to recreate the kind of climate in which currencies do not lose half their value in the space of a mere decade or two. The problem was neatly encapsulated in BZW's latest Exchange Rate Monitor, which pointed out that since Britain came off the gold standard in 1914, only one government has left office with sterling at a higher level than at the outset. The government in question was the Conservative administration in which Winston Churchill returned to gold at the pre-First World War parity of Dollars 4.48. The depression followed. And that, of course, was the way stable prices came about in the 19th century. If Mr Major and Mr Lamont had been born 100 years earlier and had presided over a comparable crisis, they would have seen runs on the banks, with interest rates soaring to unconscionable levels. The denouement would have been accompanied by falling prices, as a shellshocked populace retreated into the prudent financial behaviour that invariably precipitates deflation. Britain today could, like Sweden, have tried to shore up sterling by resorting to further intervention, 500 per cent overnight interest rates and the rest. But the financial system today is less able to take the strain. Indeed, its whole structure is predicated on a bail-out in such circumstances. A 19th-century banker operated on a ratio of capital to deposits that sometimes went as high as 40 per cent or 50 per cent. Modern ratios of 8 per cent-plus in effect presuppose the existence of a lender of last resort. So, too, does the growing dependence of building societies on wholesale deposits. With more than half their net inflow of funds coming from the wholesale markets, building societies would not have survived for long a serious attempt to defend the pound. The miracle is that the Bundesbank managed to establish such anti-inflationary credibility in a world without a link to gold. But then it is easy to forget how long it took for the German central bank to acquire that reputation. Even when a central bank has succeeded in winning credibility, it may still take an extraordinary time for the portfolio shift into bonds to run its course. In a British context, with more than two thirds of equities in institutional hands, a full shift to a bond-dominated investment culture would probably not have come until the occupational pensions system went back to denominating its contractual liabilities in nominal terms. With sterling floating, the immediate case for bonds can only be made on conventional grounds. Many brokers are raising their forecast for retail price inflation from 3 per cent next year to 4 1/2 per cent or even 5 per cent after this week's events. On that basis, long gilts are no bargain, although the short end of the market will benefit if the government encourages rates to come down thicker and faster than now anticipated. The government is rightly perceived to have suffered a humiliating defeat this week. Yet in the long run the real losers from the ERM debacle may, paradoxically, turn out to be Germany and the Bundesbank. The recent turmoil in currency markets reflects the German failure to manage the fiscal consequences of unification. As Mr Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research points out, the whole resource cost of German unification has been borne by foreigners through the deterioration in the German current account. In the end, the share of west German real disposable incomes in national income will have to be cut to foot the unification bill. The strength of the D-Mark has merely deferred the problem. It follows that the D-Mark, like the dollar in comparable circumstances in the mid 1980s, will weaken in due course. If a hard core of the ERM survives, the D-Mark and the credibility of the Bundesbank might sustain a damaging blow. Whether it is sufficient to test the German bond culture remains to be seen.</p>

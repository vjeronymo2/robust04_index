			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Fresh equity for GD Express TNT, the Australian transport group, plans to inject ADollars 50m (USDollars 36m) in fresh equity into its lossmaking GD Express Worldwide joint venture with five European and North American post offices. In a letter to the Australian Stock Exchange, TNT confirmed speculation that GD Express would require a further ADollars 100m in equity 'assuming no change in operating circumstances'. TNT is required to provide half of any fresh equity needed to maintain the joint venture's 50-50 debt-to-equity ratio. The balance will be split between the post offices of Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Canada. GD Express has been a consistent loss-maker since it was established in 1991, partly in an attempt to absorb unused capacity within TNT's European aircraft fleet. TNT reported net restructuring, establishment and loss-funding costs of ADollars 68.9m for GD Express in 1991-92, which contributed to the group's second consecutive annual loss of nearly ADollars 200m. The joint venture removed more than ADollars 900m of debt from TNT's balance sheet, but start-up costs have significantly delayed the group's forecast that GD Express would move into profit by June 1992. TNT made a net loss of Dollars A74.5m in the six months ended December, and expects to return to profit in 1993-94.</p>

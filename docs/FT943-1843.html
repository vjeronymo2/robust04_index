			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Accountancy Column: Curbing creativity in future UK acquisitions - Jim Kelly reports on the arguments over the ASB's latest financial reporting standards Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, has been expecting trouble for some time over the board's intention to push ahead with its tough new proposals designed to control the way companies account for acquisitions. He is unlikely to be disappointed. In December 1993, after the publication of the financial reporting exposure draft (Fred 7) on fair values in acquisition provisions, he let it be known that he would be 'checking the wheel nuts on my car from now on'. The joke was in character and this week, following the publication of the largely unaltered financial reporting standard 7, he was typically robust in anticipating vocal and organised opposition. Criticism of FRS 7 amounts to more than a dispute over accounting principles. Much of the opposition which has already surfaced is fighting a different battle: that against what is seen as prescriptive regulation overriding the professional judgment of the auditor. Critics of FRS 7, or at least elements of it, include the Hundred Group of the finance directors of companies in the FTSE-100 share index, and even one member of the ASB itself. But Sir David says the ASB listened very carefully to such objections during the consultation process before deciding to stand by the general thrust of the exposure draft. It is not difficult to see why Sir David has had his eye on acquisition accounting right from the moment that the ASB came into being in 1990. The treatment of provisions became a controversial issue during the wave of takeovers of the late 1980s. Provisions can be appropriate but the ASB believes that FRS 7 will substantially reduce the scope for companies to manipulate profits by creating generous pre-acquisition provisions in the balance sheet for items such as stock writedowns and reorganisation charges. These costs by-pass the profit and loss account of the acquirer, and the unused provisions can later be released to bolster profits. Sir David's objection is to what he calls 'big bath' accounting, by which companies can throw in large provisions supposedly to cover a multitude of future expenses. One of his main objections is to what might be called 'psychoanalytical' accounting: making a provision on the basis of a stated intention to incur a future expense. He also objects to the effect provisions can have on financial reporting: for two or three years after an acquisition, he maintains, it has often been difficult to see where the profits have been coming from. Up till now, the scope for widespread use of pre-acquisition provisions has been plentiful under SSAP 22, the existing accounting standard dealing with goodwill - the difference between the net asset value and the purchase price of an acquired business. A classic example is provided by Terry Smith in his book Accounting for Growth, in which he considers the acquisition of the textile company John Crowther by Coloroll, the wallpaper manufacturer. Crowther was acquired for Pounds 213m in shares and cash, with related goodwill in Coloroll's accounts shown as Pounds 224m] Thus Coloroll wrote off Pounds 11m more than the total cost of Crowther. The Accounting Standards Committee, predecessor of the ASB, tried to tighten down the screws in 1990 with non-mandatory guidance which called for a ban on provisions for future earnings, and far tighter rules on reorganisation expenses. Despite such pressure, a survey by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based accounts monitoring service, showed that of companies with turnover above Pounds 300m which made acquisitions during 1991 and 1992, provisions were an average of 35 per cent of the purchase price. 'Accounting for acquisitions has long been seen as fertile ground for manipulating figures,' Sir David said this week. 'This is in no one's interests as it creates an atmosphere of suspicion and it puts unfair pressure on many companies that try to present their results honestly. 'The new standards favour neither one side not the other but reflect an objective and neutral approach, and I believe that they will restore much needed credibility in the reporting of acquisitions.' The ASB has the support of several leading investment institutions, several big manufacturers, and a collection of 'think tanks'. Mr David Porteous, head of technical compliance at the London Stock Exchange, has also backed the ASB's stand: 'A financial reporting standard based on the exposure draft will make a major contribution to ensuring that there is consistent treatment of acquisitions which should lead to greater comparability of the results reported by acquisitive companies.' Opposition to FRS 7 focuses on two areas. One is a technical criticism that the standard does not reflect commercial reality. The ASB acknowledges that some preparers of accounts believe its approach 'ignored the commercial reality of the transaction by treating as an expense the costs of reorganisation that the acquirer regards as part of the capital cost of the acquisition; and that within defined limits a provision for planned post-acquisition expenditure should be permitted to be included in the net asset acquired'. The ASB has rejected this argument, with one dissenting vote, and insists: 'Acquisition accounting should reflect the business that is acquired as it stands at the date of acquisition and ought not to take account of the changes that an acquirer might intend to make subsequently.' The Hundred Group is critical of FRS 7 while reiterating its support for stamping out abuses in financial reporting and 'inappropriate flexibility'. 'We part company with the ASB, however, when they introduce a new standard which does, in our view, destroy one of the basic principles of accounting under which capital and revenue costs are kept separate.' The group offers an example: 'If you buy a house for, say, Pounds 100,000 that you know needs Pounds 50,000 spent on it to bring it into good condition and make it equivalent to a property that sells for Pounds 150,000, then you would treat the Pounds 50,000 renovation expense as part of the cost of the house and not as part of ordinary outgoings.' The group states that FRS 7 goes beyond standards set in other countries, including the US. It also recommends that abuses in this area should be dealt with by tightening existing accounting standards and through 'proper policing' by external auditors and 'not by distorting accounting concepts'. This reference to auditors underlines a second area of criticism: that the standard undermines, to some extent, the professional judgment of the auditor. Mr Christopher Pearce, chairman of the technical committee of the group, believes that despite laudable intentions, the ASB has over prescribed in an area where the good judgment of auditors should have been considered sufficient. Mr Roger Davis, the head of audit at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, says that the standard fails to reflect commercial reality and helps encourage the concept that auditors are not to be trusted to use professional judgment. He sees FRS 7 as part of the 'slide towards a legalistic profession'. Writing recently in the FT, Mr Davis painted this rather sombre background to the appearance of FRS 7: 'The British created accountancy as a real profession in which experienced professional judgment counted for more than theory. It led much of the world. It is time for my profession to wake up and realise we now face the greatest challenge in our history to retain our relevance to the business community.'</p>

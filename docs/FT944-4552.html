			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Thai minister quits over land scandal Mr Suthep Thuaksuban, Thailand's deputy agriculture minister, has resigned after claims he helped to assign land on the resort island of Phuket to 10 rich families under a scheme designed to help landless farmers. The resignation should help Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's chances of being the first Thai premier to lead a government to its full four-year term. The opposition parties - delighted to have some dirt to dish onto the Democrat party's squeaky clean reputation - have warned that a censure debate scheduled for December 14 will go ahead as planned. Most government critics, however, may be satisfied with one or two resignations and the promise of a full inquiry.</p>

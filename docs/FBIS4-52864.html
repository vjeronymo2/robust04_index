			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned Editorial: "Indonesian Non-Oil-and-Gas Exports </F> Cannot Keep Rising Sharply"]    [Text] The realization is increasingly emerging that  Indonesia's non-oil-and-gas exports cannot keep rising sharply.  This time it is Prof. Dr. Suhadi Mangkusuwondo, economist at the  FEUI [Economic Faculty of the University of Indonesia] and  member of the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] group of  "eminent persons," who has expressed it.    It is true that Indonesia's non-oil-and-gas exports continue  to rise from year to year in absolute volumes and values, but  the rate of increase is steadily declining. Meanwhile, it is  difficult to expect any increase in oil and gas exports.    In 1993, Indonesian exports rose by 8.41 percent over 1992.  That increase was lower than during the 1988-1992 period (an  average of 15.8 percent). Thus, there is a trend toward steadily  lower increases. Again, we should note that what is declining is  the increase, not the absolute volume or value.    This has been a problem for economists and economic policy  makers for the last two or three years and will be a big problem  in the future. It is not a new problem, however. In 1989, while  Indonesia was euphoric over increases of more than 15 percent in  non-oil-and-gas exports, Dr. Iwan Jaya Azis, another FEUI  economist, warned us and predicted the current situation.    Iwan said that after 1992, increases in non-oil-and-gas  exports would decline and would continue to do so. He said it is  very probable that non-oil-and-gas exports will level off after  1995. That was said merely from the viewpoint of Indonesia's  ability to increase its non-oil-and-gas exports (capabilities of  resources, production, and competitiveness on international  markets), without considering any other factors.    There are factors now that did not enter into calculations  at  that time. One of them is GATT. Its impact and consequences will  be felt gradually over the next several years. In general, GATT  will create freer world trade, which, as far as possible, will  be without tariff and nontariff barriers. It requires that each  country be able to compete in international trade and demands  more production, investment, and trade.    It means an opportunity to increase non-oil-and-gas exports,  but it also means a threat to Indonesia if we are not able to  take advantage of it and fulfill its requirements or if we are  not able to compete in an atmosphere of sharper competition.    We have also read predictions that the developing countries  will lose much export revenue because of the introduction of  GATT. In fact, it is predicted that Indonesia will lose the  most. We need not believe such predictions or assessments,  although they are not without basis. Moreover, Indonesia's  capabilities are viewed and assessed through foreign eyes. In  other words, the predictions may not come true, or they may.    We should accept such assessments as warnings to be alert  and  to act. Prof. Suhadi Mangkusuwondo suggests that we look again  at our investment capabilities, because increases in exports  depend on such capabilities, which include our ability to  attract foreign investment.    We feel that is not enough, however. There are several other  factors, including our ability to spot opportunities on world  markets consistent with our capabilities. We need to be wise by  selecting what we are capbable of doing in exports, for we  cannot export every commodity and every service.    There is another matter that has not been touched on very  much, because it has not been acknowledged as a big problem.  When it has been touched on, it apparently has not been done  very directly.    We have been faced with changes through a variety of  deregulation measures. Their objective has been to restrain the  high-cost economy and increase competitiveness with exports and,  domestically, with imports. Nevertheless, hindrances in the form  of bureaucratic costs -- both official and under-the-table --  and collusion between officials and businessmen are increasingly  visible as the main factors in Indonesia's high-cost economy.    It cannot be denied that exports are the mainstay of  Indonesia's economy. The dependence of our economy on  non-oil-and-gas exports will increase in the future. Exports  will be even more the source of financing for development and  the source of loan payments.    In our opinion, there are three things we could experience  in  the future in our economy, including exports. First, we could  continue to be surprised by the rapid and continuous changes  that occur as the result of globalization in the economy and in  technology, information, and telecommunications. For example,  the export commodities that Indonesia depends on, and that  represent our "prima donna" exports, could suddenly cease to  sell or suddenly decline in revenues because of those changes.    Second, we might not be prepared to adapt or able to react  to  the changes that occur in the world. The consequences could  affect our economy, and development could also be hindered.    Third, the changes could force us, for the sake of the  survival of our economy, to make alterations that actually are  unwanted by some interest groups. The fact is, the choice is up  to us.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Ruling party powers ahead in gubernatorial elections MEXICO'S ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has won an overwhelming victory in elections for governor of the state of Mexico, the country's most populous state and formerly a region of opposition strength. With counting almost completed the PRI had won 57.9 per cent of the vote, the centre-right Party of National Action 16.5 per cent, and the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution 8.1 per cent. Although both opposition parties complained of irregularities, the result is undoubtedly a blow to the PRD, whose leader, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, has declared his candidacy in next year's presidential election, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari stands down. Mr Cardenas carried the state in the 1988 presidential election, and in the 1990 gubernatorial election the PRD won 14 per cent of the vote. The PRI also won a sweeping victory in the election for governor in the state of Nayarit, obtaining 57.7 per cent of the vote, against 27.5 per cent for the PRD, with nearly 90 per cent of the vote counted. However, the PRD managed to win two of the 18 elections for state deputy. While more peaceful than elections in 1990, the opposition described the State of Mexico poll as 'unequal, inadequate and anti-democratic'. Apart from criticising the PRI's heavy spending and control of the electoral process, the opposition said the ruling party changed voter lists at the last moment.</p>

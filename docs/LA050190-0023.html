			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SCHOOLS TIGHTEN CAP TEST SECURITY;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: LOS ANGELES DISTRICT OFFICIALLY ENDS ITS INVESTIGATION INTO CHEATING  ALLEGATIONS. DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST THOSE INVOLVED IN TAMPERING.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District has officially ended its investigation  into alleged cheating on the annual California Assessment Program tests, with  the announcement of tightened security measures aimed at preventing a repeat of  the scandal that rocked the district several years ago.  </P> <P> The discovery of a high number of erasures on student test booklets at several  district schools in 1986, 1987 and 1988 led to an investigation of whether the  tests had been tampered with by teachers seeking to inflate students' scores to  improve their schools' standing.  </P> <P> The questionable test results were invalidated, but no school district employee  was ever publicly identified or disciplined for having altered tests.  </P> <P> However, school board President Jackie Goldberg said Monday that appropriate  action had been taken against employees involved in test tampering, but she  would not say what actions were taken or identify the employees for fear of  lawsuits against the district.  </P> <P> Officials alleged that cheating had occurred at 40 schools statewide, including  some in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The district opened its own investigation of the scandal, and hired a law firm  to conduct a separate yearlong probe that resulted in the new security measures  disclosed on Monday.  </P> <P> The purpose of the investigations, officials said, was not so much to determine  individual responsibility for the erasures but to help the district develop  policies to prevent recurrences.  </P> <P> "It was an exhaustive investigation and the board has taken the necessary  action," Goldberg said. "I can assure you that should there be any indication  of tampering in the future, people have been very firmly warned."  </P> <P> Goldberg said the cheating that did take place was by teachers who do not  believe in standardized testing and wanted their students to appear to perform  well.  </P> <P> The stiffer security measures include having two teachers in each classroom  during testing, placing tests in sealed bags immediately after they are  completed, and having the school principal or test coordinator supervise  teachers who must check, correct or complete the student information part of  student answer sheets.  </P> <P> Teachers administering the tests also will be encouraged to attend training  sessions, and answer sheets will not be allowed in the schools.  </P> <P> Elementary and junior high schools across the state give the test each year to  third-, sixth- and eighth-graders to measure the effectiveness of school  districts -- not individual student performance -- in reading, writing and  mathematics. The CAP scores are widely used by parents to judge the quality of  their children's schools.  </P> <P> Some educators have complained that state pressure to raise CAP scores may  encourage some teachers and administrators to improperly coach students in  preparing for the exams and, in some cases, to change answers.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC  Committee, together with some comrades from the provincial party  committee general office, the policy research office of the  provincial party committee, and the policy research office of  the provincial agricultural commission, conducted surveys in the  rural areas of Nanhai and Zhongshan cities from 5 to 11 January.  They attended forums with local people and cadres to sum up  experiences in the development of the rural joint-stock  cooperative system invented by local people and cadres.    Xie Fei believes that this joint-stock system with the right  to use farmland pooled together, which is currently practiced in  the rural areas of Nanhai and Zhongshan cities, is innovative  and a great reform of the land management system and has pointed  out a new road for relatively economically developed areas to  deepen reform, stabilize agricultural production, develop the  secondary and tertiary economy, and realize the integration of  urban and rural areas.    Xie Fei reminded the cadres that they should pay attention  to  several points when introducing the joint-stock cooperative  system for land management: first, they should not be impatient  and must judge whether conditions for introducing the system are  available in their localities before they go into action;  second, they should show respect for the peasants' choices and  will; third, they should monitor the development and give  positive guidance where the system has been introduced and  practiced, and they should never take a laissez-faire attitude;  fourth, pilot projects can be launched in the Zhu Jiang Delta  area first, and then the system can be steadily popularized  after more experience is obtained; and fifth, never should they  resort again to the past practice of rushing headlong into mass  action and that of egalitarianism and indiscriminate transfers  of resources.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bankers Trust abandons purchase BANKERS Trust, the New York investment bank, has abandoned plans to buy Integrated Resources, a New York finance group which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, in a complex Dollars 565m deal. Bankers Trust, confirming the move yesterday, regretted it had been unable to reach a definitive agreement with committees of the company's creditors. It reached a tentative deal with them last November, under which it would have paid around Dollars 210m for Integrated's non-cash assets. A final agreement was meant to have been reached by mid-January. Integrated said it and creditor committees were continuing discussions with other potential funders of a reorganisation plan. It did not give details but the wealthy Pritzker family of Chicago put in a bid last November which was said to top the Bankers' Trust one by some Dollars 22m. Saudi American Bank (Samba), 30 per cent owned by Citibank, has announced a 43 per cent rise in earnings to Dollars 200.4m for 1991, reflecting strong profitability among most Saudi banks and a buoyant private sector in the kingdom since the end of the Gulf war, writes Mark Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent. Net operating revenues rose by Dollars 71m, a 27 per cent increase, while operating expenses rose Dollars 17m, following exceptional costs from the Gulf war. Total assets rose 22 per cent over the previous year to Dollars 9.7bn, while deposits rose by 24 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn. Saudi bankers say they have seen a strong influx of Saudi-held funds since the end of the war, a trend they say indicates growing confidence within the Saudi private sector and recently diminished returns from overseas investments.</p>

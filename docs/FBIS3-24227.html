			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Morley Dupree, by Viktor Sutyagin; date and </F> place not given: "We Like Working With the Kazakhstanis"]    [Text] As reported in a previous issue of  KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA, last week Nursultan Nazarbayev, Sergey  Tereshchenko, and other leaders of the republic met with Kenneth  Derr, chairman of the board of directors of the Chevron  Corporation, and discussed questions of cooperation in the  sphere of the production and shipment of oil, including the  activity of the Kazakhstani-American Tengizchevroil Enterprise,  which, as the participants in the negotiations observed, has  already produced the first positive results. Our correspondent  met with Morley Dupree, manager of Tengizchevroil, and conducted  with him the interview that is offered the reader today.    [Sutyagin] It is planned initially at the Tengiz deposit to  produce 60,000 barrels of oil a day and subsequently to raise  production to 700,000 barrels. The terms of the contract specify  that Chevron shall in the first three years invest in the  production of oil $1.5 billion, from which Kazakhstan is to  receive $805 million net profit. Several vitally important  facilities, powerful water-purification installations, and a  boiler house have been and continue to be built, and engineering  systems are being modernized in the oblast from Chevron's  resources paid out as a bonus for the right to work on Atyrau  land, and money has been allocated for the development of  medicine. Mr. Dupree, negotiations were conducted for quite some  time between the Soviet Union and, subsequently, sovereign  Kazakhstan, and Chevron on the right to develop the Tengiz  deposit. A contract was signed. I would like to know: What did  you imagine work at Tengiz to be like and what have you  encountered in practice?    [Dupree] I would like to affirm first of all that our  expectations of finding in the oblast people who could work at  our enterprise have been borne out. When we came here, two  integrated production lines (IPL) were already operating, and  the construction of IPL-3 had begun. But the point is that  problems of the shipment of the oil to ports with terminals had  not been resolved. Our primary task was to put IPL-1 on a sound  footing, fully equip IPL-2 from the safety standpoint, and find  a market for the oil that could be produced and refined by the  gas-treatment plant. The construction of IPL-3, say, had from  our viewpoint, therefore, to be suspended, inasmuch as it would  at that time have been simply unprofitable to scatter our  forces. The main problem now is selling the oil that has been  produced. And we have been unable as yet, unfortunately, to  solve this question completely. The point being that Kazakhstan  lacks its own oil line, via which it could ship the oil to the  international market. All this is giving rise to a whole chain  of difficulties.    [Sutyagin] Would it not be better to refine the oil in situ,  having engaged the capacity of Kazakhstan's refineries, Atyrau  primarily?    [Dupree] I am forced to remind you that from the very  outset,  the contract was based on all the oil recovered at this deposit  being exported and the entire revenue being obtained from  exports of crude. It will not be refined in situ. Gas is another  matter. There could here be various options, which we are  beginning to study with the government of the republic.    [Sutyagin] And how do you view the idea of the construction  of an oil pipeline from Iran with an outlet at the Red Sea?    [Dupree] There are two very important aspects in the  construction of this pipeline, I believe. The economic aspect  entailing enormous expenditure and not completely weighed  benefits. And the political aspect: The oil pipeline would run  over the territory of Iran. Who could guarantee that Iran would  not tomorrow say "no" to the oil pipeline or ban the shipment of  oil for some reason or other?    We are, meanwhile, on the other hand, studying more  acceptable ways, from our viewpoint, of the shipment of the oil.  These include, primarily, the Caspian Consortium project  incorporating Kazakhstan, Russia, and Oman. A solution of the  problem may be found also in the creation of transport routes to  the Black Sea by Tengizchevroil directly. But I am not a  utopian, and I realize that this problem will not be fully  resolved in the coming three to five years.    [Sutyagin] But can the joint venture reach design capacity  in  this case?    [Dupree] This is not currently part of our tasks. The joint  venture has many other unresolved problems. Everyone knows that  Tengiz oil is unique in terms of its composition. I refer  primarily to its very high hydrogen sulfide content. We are  building a plant to treat the oil, therefore, and we would like  in the very near future to have achieved a volume of production  of 6-7 million tonnes a year--this is perfectly sufficient as  yet. Such a quantity of oil cleansed of hydrogen sulfide and  other harmful admixtures could be shipped across Russia via the  Druzhba oil pipeline.    After we have laid our own transport line, for which, I  hope,  it is planned to produce 12 million tonnes a year, the planned  production of 30 million tonnes will be achieved only by the  year 2010. Fewer than 1 million tonnes have been produced and  shipped thus far. We hope to obtain permission for the  construction of our own oil pipeline. In this case, we would  embark immediately on equipping IPL-3, in order that we might  increase production, raising it to the maximum.    [Sutyagin] When the contract was being worked up, Chevron  fired up the hopes of the inhabitants of the oblast with a  promise to actively enlist in work at the joint venture the  local population and to train personnel. How are these promises  being fulfilled?    [Dupree] Training local personnel is a tradition for us.  This  may be confirmed in many countries in which Chevron operates.  Thus, in Indonesia, for example, more than 6,000 employees work  at the company. Only 100 of them are not local specialists. I  believe that this was one of the reasons why our company was  invited to Kazakhstan. Even at the initial stage, we are  cooperating actively with local contractors, who are offering us  various services. Of course, they do not in all respects as yet  conform to the high demands that we make of our specialists and  workers. But at the same time, we are constantly observing a  trend toward an improvement in their work indicators.    [Sutyagin] I would like to hear about specific examples of  cooperation with local outfits.    [Dupree] I could cite as an example our experience of work  with the Tengizneftestroy Trust. This was one of the first  companies with which we concluded an agreement. Very useful  partner relations have taken shape between us. They provide us  with various services connected with the buildup and development  of the shift community of Tengiz and the production complex. The  main difficulty in relations with local construction workers is  the fact that they are not properly supplied technically and  that they lack the technology that we need. But these problems  are easily soluble via the organization or rather, the creation  of every conceivable type of joint venture with foreign  companies. Such ventures could be supplied with various Western  equipment, and the same services as we usually obtain from  Western companies could ultimately be expected of them. We  ourselves are extremely interested in this, inasmuch as our  contract with Kazakhstan is for 40 years. Seeking partners in  the West is to our disadvantage. For this reason we are closely  studying the potential of local enterprises.    [Sutyagin] Nonetheless, Turks, Hungarians, Slovaks, and  representatives of a number of other states are today working on  contract with Tengizchevroil on the rigging out and development  of the field. Does it not seem to you that all the work that  they are doing could be done by local personnel also?    [Dupree] The process of involving local organizations in the  range of tasks being tackled by the joint venture is not  something that can be accomplished overnight. Although even  today we give the inhabitants of Zhylyoyskiy Rayon and Atyrau  Oblast priority when we are looking for a contractor. It is  among them that we begin the search for the specialists we need.  And only if we do not find them here do we widen the sphere of  the search--to the level of the region, all of Kazakhstan, and  then the CIS. Only having convinced ourselves that the search  has been unsuccessful do we turn to our old partners in other  countries. The basis, however, for the conclusion of a contract  are the good quality of the work performed for us, observance of  the deadlines specified by the contract, and a reasonable price.  It is my personal opinion, incidentally, that Kazakhstan has an  appreciable advantage over other countries in which we have  worked. There is here a wealth of experience in oil production:  The first well produced a gusher of oil in Atyrau Oblast in  1911. You have many high-class specialists, and practically all  residents of the area where we are located are familiar with the  process of oil and gas production. Training them is not an  issue. It is simply necessary to familiarize them with our  standards of the organization of labor, and with Chevron they  are at the level of the world's highest.    [Sutyagin] Our readers would be interested in learning, I  believe, how the everyday life of employees of the joint venture  who have come from America and Europe to the difficult semi-arid  climatic conditions has been established. What difficulties have  you encountered, and how are you resolving them?    [Dupree] Chevron specialists work in Africa and Indonesia  and  other countries with no less difficult a climate and a very  unstable political atmosphere at times. Everyone who came here,  therefore, knew that it would not be easy. And all day-to-day  questions are gradually being solved: The Hungarian construction  workers have built quite comfortable accommodations, and we have  resolved transport problems, having purchased automobiles for a  number of employees, and have ourselves organized flights from  Atyrau to Europe.    The most painful problem is that of food. Although there are  several pretty good restaurants, we cannot always find  good-quality food in the oblast. But we are attempting to engage  local resources as much as possible--we are concluding contracts  for supplies of agricultural produce, purchasing what we can. We  are trying to support our suppliers materially here and are  supplying them with hardware and equipment. On just one  condition--the quality of the food must be high. Unfortunately,  we sometimes encounter amazing situations, which could, in my  view, be avoided. Thus, we concluded a contract with the Atyrau  poultry factory for the supply of broilers. We looked them  over--pretty good quality. We started to talk about money,  offering any form of payment in any currency. But they told us:  We do not need money; supply us with gas for heating. According  to the terms of the contract, however, we are not entitled to  dispose of the gas--it is at the disposal of the government of  the republic. We tried to explain: Buy the gas for foreign  currency. The factory management is sticking to its guns. The  contract is, naturally, in jeopardy, and we will be forced,  consequently, to purchase the broilers elsewhere.    [Sutyagin] It is no secret that many people are trying to  land jobs at the joint venture, where remuneration is higher  than at Kazakhstan's enterprises. Especially since earnings are  in dollars. Will the system of remuneration change?    [Dupree] We try to motivate people as much as possible. In  principle, it is all the same to us in what currency wages are  paid. We could have a mixed pay in two currencies, we could pay  merely in tenge. But with the continuing inflationary processes,  which have intensified as of late, payments merely in tenge  could only increase the inflation and partially "eat up" the  wages before they are spent, even. We will continue, therefore,  to try to protect our employees as much as possible, stimulating  their good work in every way possible. Especially since there is  something to pay for. We are observing how the competence of the  local personnel is increasing and their interest in the affairs  of the venture is growing literally before our eyes. We like  working with Kazakhstanis.</p>

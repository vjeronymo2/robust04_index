			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Nationalising the police PLANS FOR a radical reorganisation of the police service in England and Wales are to be discussed by a special cabinet committee this week. The plans would reduce the number of police authorities, transfer responsibility for police funding to Whitehall and put police committees under the control of government appointees. If agreed, they amount to the effective nationalisation of the police, a step which is not only unnecessary but also undesirable. At present, the police service is provided by 43 police authorities. They receive 49 per cent of funding from local government and 51 per cent from central government. Elected councillors fill two-thirds of the places on the authorities, with the balance going to magistrates. Some authorities share boundaries with county councils; others span several local government areas, with representatives from each. The exception is London's Metropolitan Police, which is directly accountable to the home secretary, because of its national importance. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is proposing to reduce the number of police authorities, possibly to 25. Their funding would come entirely from the government. No doubt in consequence, the government would appoint the majority of police authority members. Policing would become a national service, delivered by quangos largely unaccountable to those they serve. Civil liberties Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is reported to be opposing this further diminution in local accountability. He is right: too many public services are now in the hands of unelected Whitehall officials. It is also undesirable on civil liberties grounds that so much power be concentrated in the home secretary's hands. In a country where one-party rule is dangerously close to entrenchment, locally accountable police services are part of an essential system of checks and balances. Centralisation is also wrong from the point of view of effectively tackling crime. It is true that some forms of criminal activity require a national approach. But this can be tackled - as it already is - through co-operation between police forces to deal with problems such as terrorism and drug trafficking. Police action to stop flying pickets moving around the country during the last miners' strike demonstrated that effective national action was possible even in conditions of political controversy. Trusting relationship More important, the success of day-to-day policing depends on relationships between the police and the communities they serve. Without trust, the flow of information central to preventing crime and catching criminals dries up. So too does confidence in the responsiveness of the police service, an essential element in creating a safe and secure environment. Such relationships are unlikely to be fostered by a police service run from London. There may be a case for fewer police authorities. It may be true - though it has yet to be proved - that larger forces are more efficient. And police authorities coterminous with counties may be prone to the political interference that dogged the old watch committees when police forces were under municipal control. A breakdown in the relationship between the former chief constable of Derbyshire and local politicians on the county council led to a deterioration in the standard of policing in that county in the 1980s. However, the police services should be more independent of Whitehall, not less. If change is needed, it should be directed towards strengthening the accountability of police authorities to elected local authorities. The shape of those authorities is currently under review by Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission. Change should therefore be deferred until the Commission has completed its reorganisation of local government. In any case, the Sheehy Inquiry is examining police pay, grading and efficiency. Further changes in policing procedures are likely to follow the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. Mr Clarke has more than enough on his plate without this undesirable centralisation of yet another public service.</p>

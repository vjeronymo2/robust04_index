			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH BOB  </P> <P> Times handicapper Bob Mieszerski recorded a $79 profit Saturday when one of his  $10 exacta boxes, Silver Hatchet and Best Picture in the third race hit for a  $21.80 payoff for $2. The profit pushed Mieszerski back into the profit column.  He started the meeting Wednesday with a mythical bankroll of $1,000 which now  stands at $1,077.  </P> <P> Each racing day Bob will make at least one bet. He could make a straight win  bet, he could make a daily double bet, he could make an exacta bet, he could  make other exotic bets, or any combination of bets. But, he will make at least  one bet.  </P> <P> For today, Bob's bets are $10 daily triples from Defend Your Man in the fourth  to Keen Night, Naturally Mitch, Rusty Attitude and His Legacy in the fifth to  Sun Streak in the sixth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Beginning Bankroll: $1,000  </P> <P> Saturday's Profit: $79  </P> <P> Current Bankroll: $1,077  </P></p>

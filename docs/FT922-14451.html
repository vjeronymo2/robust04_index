			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Strike begins at Ireland's banks STAFF at Ireland's four main clearing banks began a national strike yesterday after the breakdown of talks at the weekend over longer opening hours and a 6.5 per cent pay claim. Irish Bank Officials' Association (IBOA) said 80 per cent of its 13,000 members were supporting the strike, although many branches were working with skeleton staffs. The four banks affected are Allied Irish Banks (AIB), Bank of Ireland, National Irish Bank and Ulster Bank. Between them they account for 56 per cent of private bank credit in the Irish Republic. AIB, Ireland's largest bank, claimed that more than half its staff had turned up for work. The dispute came to a head at the weekend, after two months of limited industrial action by the IBOA led the banks to begin sacking staff who refused to process bank charges. The four banks have offered a 6 per cent pay rise linked to longer opening hours, which the IBOA has rejected, despite its recommendation by a Labour Court mediator. The banks intend to initiate lunchtime opening next month, and argue that if their workforces do not accept the principle of all-day opening, the banks will be unable to compete when the last barriers to an open EC market in financial services are dropped next year. The IBOA said its pay demand goes back three years, and a settlement on the introduction of new technology was still outstanding. These had to dealt with before lunchtime opening could be agreed.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Fitch has no explanation for continued share fall FITCH, the design consultant, said yesterday it was at a loss as to why its share price was continuing to fall. While the company was being financially restructured, the shares were suspended at 41p until October 19. Relisted, they rose from 16p to 20p on October 20. But as recently as Wednesday they stood at 15p, dropping to close at 8 1/2 p. Yesterday they fell to 6p before rallying to 8p. Mr Christopher Thomson, chief operating officer, said that the restructure had been successful - 35 per cent of the equity was now controlled by Brand Trust, a company led by Mr Jean-Francois Bentz and Mr Bernard Roux, two former executives of the French RSCG advertising agency, and 25 per cent by Sir Terence Conran, founder of the Habitat group and one-time chairman of Storehouse. Fitch gained Pounds 2.5m through the subscription. On October 15 RSCG failed to obtain a court injunction to prevent Sir Terence investing in Fitch, though he undertook not to take an active role until his consultancy period with RSCG expired on July 2 1993. Mr Thomson said that he had no idea who was selling, but added that it was a thin market. Earlier he had said he thought it was no-one connected with the company.</p>

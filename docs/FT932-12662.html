			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: BBV returns to growth with 4.4% rise in quarter BANCO BILBAO Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's biggest banking group, raised first-quarter net income by 4.4 per cent to Pta17bn (Dollars 147m), indicating a return to growth following a fall in income last year. Operating profit rose 7.3 per cent to Pta36.7bn and ordinary profit rose 10.4 per cent to Pta21.8bn. Last year, the group's net profits were held in check by a 42 per cent drop in extraordinary income. BBV claimed that it was continuing its 1992 trend of increasing its share of the banking sector's deposits and borrowed funds. Customer deposits stood at Pta6,200bn, 10 per cent up on the first three months of last year. The results were moderate in comparison with the 8.1 per cent and 6.1 per cent first-quarter profit rises that were reported last week by Banco Santander and Banco Popular respectively, but they were welcomed by analysts. 'If BBV's operating profit continues to grow, the bottom line will not drop this year and the quality of results will improve,' said one analyst yesterday. The state-run Spanish electricity utility, Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA (Endesa), said its net profit rose 10 per cent to Pta33.1bn in the first quarter of 1993.</p>

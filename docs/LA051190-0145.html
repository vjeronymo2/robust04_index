			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SKELTON'S RETURN TO DANA HILLS ONE OF FOUR COUNTY COACHING CHANGES;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: HE GOES BACK AFTER A ONE-YEAR SUSPENSION. KIERNAN MOVES FROM LA  QUINTA TO GUIDE SAVANNA BOYS' TEAM. RIVERA, ADAMS RESIGN.  </P> <P> Four Orange County high school basketball coaches, including Rich Skelton of  Dana Hills, were involved in job changes Thursday.  </P> <P> Skelton, who served a one-year suspension for violating a Southern Section  rule, will return to his job at Dana Hills.  </P> <P> The three others are:  </P> <P>  -- Nash Rivera, who resigned as Santa Ana boys' coach after one season at the  school.  </P> <P>  -- Kevin Kiernan, who has been named the boys' coach at Savanna after spending  five seasons as girls' coach at La Quinta. The Anaheim Union High School  District board approved his appointment Thursday night, Savanna Principal  William Wong said.  </P> <P>  -- Sheila Adams, who resigned as Foothill girls' coach after 15 seasons at the  school, Athletic Director Jerry Whitaker said.  </P> <P> The Capistrano Unified School District suspended Skelton last June for the  season under the "undue influence rule" because Skelton had contact with the  father of basketball player John Vivona before Vivona was enrolled at Dana  Hills. Vivona, a transfer from Texas, later lived at Skelton's home in Dana  Point for three weeks in the fall of 1988.  </P> <P> Skelton acknowledged his guilt on both counts, but has taken issue with the  penalty imposed.  </P> <P> However, he said the district made it clear to him that he would be allowed to  return to his job after a year passed, if he so desired.  </P> <P> "I was a little discouraged," said Skelton, a history teacher at Dana Hills.  "I've been coaching for (25 years) and basically, I had a pretty good track  record. I felt like what happened wasn't fair. I was a little bitter about it.  It dimmed my enthusiasm (for coaching)."  </P> <P> But Skelton said Thursday he decided last month to return to coach the  Dolphins.  </P> <P> Rivera led Santa Ana to a 10-14 record and a third-place finish in the Century  League this season.  </P> <P> He was the El Dorado boys' coach from 1966-80, winning two Southern Section  championships and five Orange League titles. He coached the girls' team at El  Dorado for three seasons before becoming an assistant coach at Chaffey College  for one season in 1984.  </P> <P> In the five seasons before going to Santa Ana, Rivera was an assistant coach  for the women's team at UCLA.  </P> <P> "I've been in basketball a long time and maybe it's time to change my  priorities a little more," said Rivera, 55, who cited family reasons for his  decision.  </P> <P> Kiernan, while at La Quinta, established the Aztecs as the Garden Grove  League's dominant team. They won 54 consecutive league games and five league  championships under him and were 112-24 overall. Kiernan also was an assistant  to Jim Perry, La Quinta boys' coach. "It's a challenge," Kiernan said. "I've  done as much as I can do (at La Quinta) with the girls. It is real hard to  leave because I put a lot of time in this program."  </P> <P> Kiernan replaces Tom Gregory, who resigned at Savanna at the end of the season.  </P> <P> Adams' teams won 12 league championships and played in three Southern Section  championship games in her 15 seasons at Foothill, winning the 3-A title in  1985.  </P> <P> "I just think it's time to move on," said Adams, a former player at UCLA. "I  want to go into other areas of education. And coaching was really time  consuming."  </P> <P> Adams will remain as Foothill activities director.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Donna Carter contributed to this story.  </P></p>

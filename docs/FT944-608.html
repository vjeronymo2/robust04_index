			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: Silver screen memories - Television A New Yorker cartoon shows a man using an axe to attack one of those mile-a-minute Russian vines at the corner of his house. His wife, at an upper window, is looking the other way to where a few leaves are appearing round the corner, and shouting, 'Look out, here it comes again]' It reminds you of Christmas television: no sooner have you repulsed one onslaught than the next is upon you. The worst thing about the programmes - apart from the movies - at this time of the year, however, is the falseness. No matter how bounteous the bonhomie, it is hard to forget that it was all contrived in a hot studio in September. So let us look ahead to 1995. BBC2 will mark the hundredth anniversary of the Lumiere brothers first showing films to a paying audience in 'Cinema Century' which will run right through the year. This will include The BBC 100, a collection of films which are being insistently described as 'NOT the hundred greatest films ever made', but 100 of the more significant works from the 3,500 held by the BBC. Those likely to be screened in the first quarter of the year include Top Hat, King Kong, 42nd Street, The 39 Steps, Bringing Up Baby and The Maltese Falcon. They kick off with Citizen Kane on January 2, then, on January 7, Terry Gilliam begins presenting The Last Machine, which investigates film before 1913. At the end of January Channel 4 starts Visions Of Heaven And Hell, a series looking at our 'headlong rush into the arms of technology'. In the first programme, people such as Bill Gates of Microsoft and Peter Cochrane, the head of research at BT, talk about the advantages that technology can bring. The second considers such social phenomena as the changes in work practices brought about by modems - not to mention 'cyber hippies' and 'cyber anarchy'. The final programme ponders the question of whether social divisions may increase rather than diminish thanks to the new technologies. It is all very well for the information rich to regard their home work stations as a boon, but to the information poor the new habits may look like a way for the privileged to cut themselves off electronically from a threatening outside world of pollution and crime. One of the most heavily promoted series will be The Private Life Of Plants, starting on BBC1 on January 11. This is the latest part in what will, surely, be seen eventually as one of the key achievements in the first 50 years of television: David Attenborough's remarkably successful attempt to explain the natural world. Beginning in 1979 with the monumental series Life On Earth, he has progressed via The Living Planet and The Trials Of Life to the more recent - and technically more astounding than ever - Life In The Freezer. We are promised that during this forthcoming six-part series on plants the intrepid Attenborough jumps across savannah fires in Kenya and dangles 200ft up in a rainforest canopy in Borneo. The trouble is, of course, that every director he works with is trying to outdo that blasted gorilla sequence. On January 3, John Thaw moves yet another rung up the ladder of the legal fraternity when he makes his first appearance in Kavanagh QC on ITV as a barrister, though with a northern, working-class background. Ted Childs, who was responsible for the Morse series, is again executive producer, and the casts are glossy and expensive. In the opening two-hour episode, Kavanagh's wife is played by Lisa Harrow and the housewife who accuses a student of rape by Alison Steadman. Geraldine James is the prosecuting counsel. Subsequent episodes will last 90 minutes; what a shame they could not bring them down to 60. Ever alive to the potential of an anniversary, the BBC will be marking the tercentenary of Purcell's death with a sequence of programmes on BBC2 and Radio 3 throughout 1995. They begin on New Year's Day with a documentary, Henry Purcell, The English Orpheus, providing a picture of his life in the London of Charles II, and continue on the same day with a live concert relay from the Banqueting House, Whitehall. The finale is 'Welcome, Welcome Glorious Morn' which Purcell wrote in 1691 for Queen Mary's birthday. Fitting that someone so involved in the anniversary business should have his own celebrated.</p>

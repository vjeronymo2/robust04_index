			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Hong Kong may accept airport deal THE Hong Kong government yesterday appeared to reverse policy by accepting a Chinese solution to a dispute over financing for the colony's new airport, which would involve an increase in direct government funding. It is understood that, at a meeting of a Sino-British committee yesterday, the British side agreed to use part of the revenue raised from the sale of land resulting from the construction of the airport and its connecting railway to fund the project. The Hong Kong government's position has been that the package it had devised was the most cost-effective method of financing the project. China is seeking to restore order to its stock markets after August's riots in Shenzhen and a sharp fall in prices in Shanghai, Reuter reports from Beijing. Quoting reliable sources, the state-controlled China News Service said new listings on the Shenzhen market had been postponed, plans for a third bourse shelved and a regulatory committee would be created.</p>

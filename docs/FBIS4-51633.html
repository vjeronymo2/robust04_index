			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with new ROK Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok by KBS </F> anchorman Kim Kwang-il on 30 April; place not given--recorded]    [Text] [Kim Kwang-il] In an interview with KBS today, new  ROK Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok revealed that the future  direction of the government's administration is reform amid  harmony. We will listen further to Prime Minister Yi's view on  his appointment and the direction of the government's  administration.    [Begin recording] [Kim] How are you?    [Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok] Hello.    [Kim] First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your  appointment.    [Yi] Thank you very much.    [Kim] You have been entrusted with a heavy duty of leading  the third-term cabinet of the civilian-rule government. What is  your impression of your appointment?    [Yi] Since I have been entrusted with an important duty  during a difficult period, I, who am lacking in every way, have  a heavy heart.    [Kim] One of the tasks which the civilian-rule government  must continue to promote is reform. What do you think that the  third- term cabinet must urgently do to continuously promote  reform?    [Yi] I will work to emphasize harmony by gathering all kinds  of different and creative opinions into one unified opinion. We  must achieve reform through harmony.    [Kim] In the past you were the deputy prime minister in  charge of South-North diplomacy and security-related issues and  presided over coordination meetings for reunification and  security-related policies. Now you have become the prime  minister, are you thinking of continuing to be in charge of  diplomacy and security-related issues?    [Yi] I have experience in this field, but the coordination  meetings for reunification and security-related policies are  held centering on the deputy prime minister in charge of  national unification. It has operated in such a way for about a  month. I believe that it is ideal for the joint work in the  process of establishing, coordinating, and promoting a policy.    [Kim] You have been known to be a conservative figure. Some  people even pointed out that you are not fit for carrying out  reform. What is your opinion on this matter?    [Yi] People who have a practical knowledge about the true  nature of North Korea regard that North Korea can be our partner  only when reunification is achieved together, and at the same  time they say that we should find a way for reunification with  the North by taking a prudent attitude and being cautious of the  danger of North Korea's line toward the South. This kind of  people are saying that I am a conservative. I think this matter  is related to who has a more correct understanding of reality. I  believe that I am very knowledgeable about North Korea because I  have visited North Korea for talks, have thought about this  matter over a long period of time, have had many experiences,  and read many books on it. Therefore, I think I am a practical  rationalist.    [Kim] Thank you for the interview.    [Yi] You are welcome. [end recording]</p>

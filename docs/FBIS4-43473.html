			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will focus  on a new plan to help get the confidence-building measures  accepted and implemented. A Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation  correspondent reported from New York that according to  well-informed sources, the UN secretary general will send  letters to the two sides in Cyprus explaining the manner to  implement the confidence-building measures and will refer  extensively to the benefits for the Turkish Cypriot side.    According to the same sources, the UN secretary general will  proceed with this move if he decides that Turkish Cypriot leader  Rauf Denktas has given a positive reply to the 21 March UN  document, based on the briefing by Gustave Feissel, the UN  secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus.  Denktas seems unwilling to accept this procedure, but  Butrus-Ghali appears determined to send his letters.    During their meeting yesterday, the UN secretary general  informed Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis of his intention.  The Cypriot delegation at the United Nations is skeptical about  the effectiveness of the UN secretary general's move and  expresses the conviction that the impression that Denktas will  accept the confidence-building measures is an illusion.    Mikhailidhis said it is crystal clear in the UN secretary  general's mind that, despite the course of negotiations on the  confidence-building measures, the substance of the Cyprus issue  must be discussed without delay. The foreign minister added that  the United Nations began forming a picture about the next steps,  which will be finalized once Feissel's report on his latest  meeting with Denktas is conveyed.    The foreign minister had a one-hour meeting with  Butrus-Ghali  in New York and later held separate meetings with the British  and U.S. permanent UN representatives. Mikhailidhis left New  York last night to return to Cyprus. He will be in London today  where he will meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.    The UN secretary general's spokesman, Joe Sills, said that  all aspects of the Cyprus issue--including the  confidence-building measures, other substantive issues, and the  UN secretary general's good offices mission--were discussed at  the meeting between Butrus-Ghali and the foreign minister. The  spokesman added that the United Nations continues to feel that  the confidence-building measures are balanced and offer  advantages to both sides.    Asked if Denktas accepted the confidence-building measures  during his meeting with Feissel, Sills said the UN secretary  general is awaiting his representative's briefing.</p>

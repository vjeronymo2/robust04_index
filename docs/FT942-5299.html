			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Expand jobs 'through training' The US and other western industrial nations could achieve higher levels of employment by training more people to develop problem-solving skills, Mr Robert Reich, US secretary of labour, said yesterday. At a seminar on job-creation, organised in London by the British newspaper The Guardian, Mr Reich said there was a 'third way' between the US experience of the past 20 years, of creating many jobs but with low wages, and the European approach of creating few, highly-skilled jobs and suffering high unemployment. Faster job growth, Mr Reich said, would be in areas where intellectual capital is required. Job seekers in industrial countries had to cope with the world in which the mass production of high-volume, standardised products was no longer the engine of economic growth. Instead, growth lay in fulfilling niche requirements and constant adaptation. The US administration has acted, Mr Reich said, to create national vocational standards, created links between school and apprenticeships, introduced an earned income tax credit to help the poor in work, and started a scheme to channel the unemployed into new jobs and skills. Mr Reich will explain more about the US programme for dealing with unemployment at a meeting of finance, employment and trade ministers in Paris tomorrow. That is due to adopt a new report on job-creation prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr Reich's remarks yesterday showed how far the Clinton administration has shifted the debate on unemployment and pay from the free market doctrines of the Reagan and Bush years. Using words that would surprise many in the UK, he said flexibility in labour markets should not mean giving employers the power to fire workers or reduce wages at will. He also spoke in favour of the minimum wage as a way to combat poverty, suggesting that the present US minimum wage of Dollars 4.25 (Pounds 2.81) per hour could be raised by 50 cents to Dollars 1 without endangering employment.</p>

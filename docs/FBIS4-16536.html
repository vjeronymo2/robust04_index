			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has said that  Kiev will take an active part in a CIS economic union. In an  interview with INTERFAX he said that he would sign documents on  an associated membership.    Kravchuk believes that now the difference between full and  associated membership in the economic union is only relative.    "I have looked through economic documents prepared for the  Moscow CIS summit. We shall sign them. Like full members, we  shall put our signatures under the documents on the economic  cooperation among the CIS members," said Kravchuk.    Asked to express his attitude to the initiative by  Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on the creation of a  Euro-Asian union, Kravchuk said that today the integration in  such a scope, proposed by some politicians, following the  example of the European Union, has no basis.    For a Euro-Asian union to work, conditions should be  prepared  gradually, said Kravchuk. It is no secret that it took European  countries 35 years to form the European Union. The CIS has  existed only several years and we did not yet form many  mechanisms for the Commonwealth to work. There are also other  problems which are not solved, not for a lack of will. The  conditions are not ripe for a Euro-Asian union, said Kravchuk.    Kravchuk said that he was not against the idea of a  Euro-Asian union. He said he did not want the idea to  materialize now, because, he believes, it would lead nowhere.</p>

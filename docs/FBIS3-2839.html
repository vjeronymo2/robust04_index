Yang Jiwan, a consultant for the Ministry of Finance, said  that the government has to bring scale of investment under  control so as not to fuel inflation. "It is very important to  keep prices from rising too fast at present," Yang said.    Wu Jinglian, a well-known economist, said that in the past  two months, the series of reforms that China adopted this year  have been carried out smoothly. But he said that the reform  measures for taxation, financial and foreign exchange systems  have yet to be perfected.    Gan Peigen, vice-director of the Financial Research  Institute  under the central bank -- People's Bank of China, said that at  the present stage of transforming economic structure, China  should properly regulate the economic growth rate and avoid  major fluctuations in economy.    CPPCC members from Hong Kong said they hoped that the  government will continue to increase investment in education and  make great efforts to improve educational undertakings, because  education is a key factor that bears profound influence on the  growth of the national economy.    Rui Xingwen said that training courses for enterprise  managers and legal persons should be held to teach them modern  management skills. He said that a multi-tier social security  system should be set up to take over the social insurance and  welfare burdens from state-owned enterprises.</p>

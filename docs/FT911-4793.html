			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (7): Sweet taste of success - Muller CONSTRUCTION of a new yoghurt production plant for Molkerei Alois Muller of Aretsreid, Bavaria, has started at Market Drayton - a move which has brought some smiles to Shropshire County Council, which is celebrating the largest inward investment that its economic development department has managed to attract. Muller's total investment will be Pounds 20m. It has signed contracts to take 22 acres of land at the Tern Valley Business Park, a venture of the County Council, the North Shropshire District Council and the Rural Development Commission. The decision by Muller to go to Market Drayton followed 15 months of negotiations with the county council which had originally responded to an advertisement for a site placed by Muller in the Financial Times. The first request was for five acres of land, but this demand gradually increased. The planning permission for the site covers 12 acres. By any standards, Muller's move is a fillip to the local economy. Recruitment starts later this year and production will start in summer 1992 with a payroll of about 100. But employment is expected to grow over four years to 500. This would make Muller the biggest employer in Market Drayton, replacing Palethorpe, the sausage manufacturer. Such investments are seen as necessary to bring more competition to the local labour market so that the level of wages may gradually be raised and the lagging rural economy reinvigorated with greater spending power. The investment, in any case, helps to counterbalance the problems faced by local food processing industry. The attraction of Market Drayton for Muller were largely twofold. First, the town is near the motorway network, important for the distribution of goods with a limited shelf life. Second, the town is within an hour's tanker drive of 25 per cent of UK dairy production. Muller will be buying about 50m litres of milk a year to produce initially about 300m pots of yoghurt a year spread over a range of 15 products. This is an important degree of import substitution: Muller is estimated to have a 13 per cent share of the UK yoghurt market, but all of this is produced at the Aretsreid plant. The Market Drayton plant, the first overseas venture for Muller, a private company, will provide yoghurt not only for the UK market but also for Belgium, northern France, Netherlands and Scandinavia. The Aretsreid plant will service Muller's other European markets.</p>

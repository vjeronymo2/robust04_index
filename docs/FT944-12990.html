			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Week in the Markets: Selling trims metal price rises London Metal Exchange base metal contracts mostly survived a wave of pre-weekend profit-taking yesterday to end with most of the week's earlier impressive gains intact. The only substantial loser on the day was aluminium, which closed Dollars 14.25 down at Dollars 1,827.50 a tonne for three months delivery. But that was still Dollars 74.25 up on the week. In a hectic morning session the price had first soared to a fresh four-year high of Dollars 1,870 a tonne, helped by news of another big fall in LME warehouse stocks, and then tumbled to Dollars 1,810, before bouncing to Dollars 1,853. The sellers returned after lunch, but not insufficient force to spark off the major 'correction' some pundits have forecast following this month's 15 per cent surge. Mr Tony Bird of the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy warned this week that the multilateral agreement to curb aluminium production could collapse 'quickly and chaotically' if the price rise continued unabated. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, predicted meanwhile that some trade delegates would be arguing for capacity re-starts when signatories to the agreement meet next month. That did not mean the agreement was about to collapse, he said, 'but it does suggest that it is starting to crumble well before its end-1995 deadline'. This sort of talk brought a response yesterday from Alcan, one of North America's biggest producers of the metal, which cut its output by an annual 156,000 tonnes earlier this year. 'The fundamentals dictated the cutbacks; the fundamentals will dictate restarts,' Mr Jacques Bougie, chief executive, told reporters after a presentation at the Alumitech '94 conference in Atlanta, Georgia. Stocks remained too high to permit a restart of capacity, he insisted. Copper was also helped early on by news of a further fall in stocks, though much more modest than aluminium's. The three months price shot to a four-year high of Dollars 2,690 a tonne before the profit-taking trimmed it to Dollars 2,647. It closed at Dollars 2,658.50, up Dollars 15.50 on the day and Dollars 102 on the week. The earlier strengthen of the market had been fuelled by speculative buying, notably from US investment funds. Zinc also attracted the attention of speculators as its LME stocks fall speeded up. The announcement yesterday of a 2 per cent drop to 1.21m tonnes encouraged a rise to a near-two-year high of Dollars 1,147 a tonne for the three months position. It eased to Dollars 1,135.50, but was still Dollars 47 up on the week. Nickel was the only LME metal to register a stocks rise yesterday, but that did not prevent it building on its earlier strength during the morning, when it touched Dollars 7,450 a tonne. Subsequent selling took the price down to Dollars 7,335 at the close, down Dollars 22.50 on the day and up Dollars 347.50 on the week. Tin followed a similar pattern, reaching a 22-month high of Dollars 6,070 a tonne for three months delivery but closing Dollars 95 off that level. At the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures sank lower as uncertainty about the Brazilian weather outlook kept buyers on the sidelines. 'Everyone is frightened to take a position,' one dealer told the Reuters news agency. 'Even the locals (traders operating on their own account) are scared to get into the market.' He said a flurry of crop forecasts and rain forecasts from Brazil had finally saturated an already nervous market. At the close the January futures position stood at Dollars 3,488 a tonne, down Dollars 70 on the day and Dollars 175 on the week.  --------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------------- Aluminium               -29,675  to 2,058,975 Aluminium alloy         -140     to 25,540 Copper                  -1,700   to 335,075 Lead                    -1,500   to 371,150 Nickel                  +624     to 149,262 Zinc                    -24,875  to 1,211,300 Tin                     -895     to 30,340  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

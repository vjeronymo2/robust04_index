			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shibdas Bandhopadhyay] </F>   [Text] The assurance Narasimha Rao gave at the very  beginning that he would make efforts to democratize the  structure and function of the party has suffered a setback at  the very inception. Though the strength of the prime minister  in the government has increased, his position as party leader is  gradually weakening. Recently, the prime minister himself  violated his earlier pledge regarding maintaining a democratic  structure in the party by dismissing the state committees of the  party in 10 states with the stroke of a pen and installing  selected people who are obedient to him in those states.    Personal interests rather than political consideration  always  played a greater role both in making and in violating pledges.  The main allegation against the Nehru-Gandhi family was that  they did not care to abide by democratic norms while running the  affairs of the party. They were competent in administering the  party on an ad hoc basis. There has been no organizational  elections of the party for at least 20 years. After Rao was  nominated party leader and prime minister, he announced that if  the party adopts the path of democratization through the holding  of organizational elections then it would become difficult for  the followers of Sonia [wife of late Rajiv Gandhi] to get the  leadership of the party. With the passage of time, Rao has  himself surrendered to the ruling family. It is significant to  note that Rao held about an hour long face-to-face talks with  Sonia before appointing the ad hoc committees of the Congress-I  in 10 states. Party men have noticed that Sonia is gradually  getting rid of her lack of interest in politics which she  earlier displayed. The recent visit of Sonia to Andhra Pradesh,  which is the constituency of Rao, her acceptance of an  invitation extended by the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh,  Digvijay Singh, to visit the state, and her later rejection of  an invitation -- are all are quite significant.    Under Rao, elections to the working committee of the  Congress-I and also the organizations of the party throughout  the country were held. Earlier the members of the working  committee were nominated. Taking advantage of the elections, the  groups opposed to Rao became active and became desperate to  seize the control of the organization. After the election of  the working committee, Rao identified the persons who posed a  challenge to his authority. He then made influential leaders  like Arjun Singh [Human Resources Development Minister] and  Sharad Pawar [Maharashtra Chief Minister] resign from the  working committee and inducted people nominated by him in their  places. Apart from these minor strategies, Rao allowed the  party to move in its own way. Then he became active to  consolidate the seat of the prime minister by keeping his  authority on his party firm. He also succeeded in establishing  an absolute majority of his party in the Lok Sabha by creating  divisions in different parties and winning them over to his  party despite the existence of the Antidefection Law.    After consolidating the seat of the prime minister and  making  it free from danger, Rao has now turned his attention toward the  party organizations. He wants to make these organizations such  that they will only carry out his orders. Rao is sparing no  opportunity to embarrass and harass Arjun Singh and Sharad  Pawar. This has been proved by the incidents that took place at  a function held to pay homage to martyrs of the Jalianwalabag  massacre [this massacre took place during the British rule]. At  this function, the human resources development minister, Arjun  Singh, was harassed, and Sharad Pawar was embarrassed over the  issue of the illegal wealth of Dawood Ibrahim [underworld  figure].    It appears from the last meeting of the working committee  that the authority of Rao has been reestablished. The State  Congress committees of Goa and Gujarat have entrusted Rao with  the responsibility of nominating their leaders. This confidence  in and allegiance to Rao may lead to autocracy. The failure of  Rao to nominate the chief minister of Gujarat even in two months  has created doubts whether he deserves the confidence that has  been placed in him. In the last working committee meeting, at  least five pro-democracy leaders viz. Arjun Singh, Balram Jakhar  [agriculture minister], A.K. Anthony [civil supplies minister],  Rajesh Pilot [state minister for home], and R.K. Dhawan raised  objections to giving supreme power to Rao for reconstituting the  working committee and the All India Congress Committee. At the  end a compromise was reached that allowed Rao to reconstitute  the party committees in the states and the organizations at the  lower level. By exercising this power, Rao can keep the  provincial leaders within his grip.    The organizational success of Rao will depend on his  efforts to suppress the powerful groups within the party. Apart  from this, he needs to win over the people by his own charisma  and also have a dependable group of followers. Until now Rao  has failed to achieve any of these two objectives. This state  of affairs has created a favorable situation for his sycophants  like Pranab Mukherjee [commerce minister], Sidhartha Shankar Ray  [Indian ambassador to U.S.] and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. Pranab  Mukherjee is now showing as if the West Bengal State Congress  Committee is within his pocket. At the same time he is studying  the prospects of the reentry of Sidhartha Shankar Ray in the  politics of the state. He is also keeping a watch whether Priyo  Ranjan Das Munshi makes any sabotage. Priyo Ranjan is keen to  get either the position of Soumen Mitra [leader of the West  Bengal State Congress] or a post in the union cabinet. He is  not willing to delay this special day celebration.    Due to the pace at which Rao is proceeding, the confused and  divided opposition cannot rule out the possibility of sudden  elections in at least 10 states if not of the Lok Sabha. These  states include Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Goa, Manipur,  Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Orissa, and Arunachal Pradesh. Rao  has not taken up any political program or announced any slogan  as a preparatory measure for the holding of elections in these  states.    The scope of preelection slogan talk has reduced in view of  the current economic and political scenario at the national and  international level. The days of cheap slogans and announcement  of schemes are over. For these reasons, Rao has become more  interested to use party organizations as a tool to win  elections. With this end in view the process has started to  nominate the right candidate, remove the dissidents, and to  convert the party into a professional bureaucratic organization.  Rajiv Gandhi also adopted the same techniques in the year 1989.  Will Rao ultimately be able to control the impact of the GATT?    Rao is now trying to run the party in the style set up by  Indira and Rajiv. Until now he has failed to attain the command  displayed by Indira or Rajiv. He has postponed for an  indefinite period the organizational elections that were  scheduled for this year. This time all appointments against  party positions will be given on an ad hoc basis. Rao will  perform this task with the assistance of different committees or  observer groups. He will brief these committees or observers  about the people liked and disliked by him.    In the past this strategy or method failed to mobilize the  internal strength of the Congress. Will it be different in the  case of Rao? Or will he gradually hand over over his authority  to No.10 Janapath [residence of Sonia Gandhi]? Rao has achieved  some election successes in Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.  In these two states, Digvijay Singh and Vir Bhadra Singh have  become chief ministers by defeating the leaders who had the  blessings of Rao. In these two states the party organization  has been resusticated to the grass-roots level. Party elections  in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan has been set aside. In  these areas, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, perhaps, Rao wants  to nip in the bud the prospects of the growth of powerful  leadership. The reverses suffered by his party in the elections  held in these states has been seen by all. Here lies the danger  of running the party on an ad hoc basis. The claims he can make  regarding the successes of the government will perhaps not play  a significant role in the contest during the elections. In that  case his dream to lead the party during the next Lok Sabha  elections may be shattered whether the elections is held on  schedule in 1996 or earlier.</p>

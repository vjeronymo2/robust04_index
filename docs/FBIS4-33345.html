			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jose Luis Sobrinho, former leader of the </F> Sole Workers Central, CUT, and Landless People's Movement, MST,  by Angela Lacerda; place and date not given]    [Text] [Lacerda] What can you tell us about the report on  the existence of a guerrilla training center at the Workers  Ranch?    [Sobrinho] I do not know. It could be a rumor, spread by  people with interests in the area or by ill-informed  individuals. What we cannot deny is that the MST is starting to  have a war image, which is not real and which does not help the  struggle for agrarian reform. They make a lot of noise and  obtain poor results. It is a case of "too much potato and too  little meat."    [Lacerda] Do you think the MST is the appropriate channel  for  achieving agrarian reform?    [Sobrinho] No. The MST is one of the instruments. What I  criticize in this movement, and what I try to tell our fellow  peasants, is that the agrarian reform is not the responsibility  of a single entity. I do not question MST's good intentions,  but the movement has adopted policies characterized by  imposition, bureaucracy, and state ownership. If we are not  careful, the MST will end up as a paternalistic movement,  considering itself to be the sole representative of agrarian  reform. We have already seen conflicts in expropriated areas on  the issue of land ownership. Does the land belong to workers or  to the MST? I am not supporting capitalism as a solution, but  it is necessary to find a middle ground.    [Lacerda] But the MST has helped landless people, has it  not?    [Sobrinho] Sometimes they act in radical ways and end up  losing the people's support for causes that are absolutely just.  Landless peasants often invade unproductive areas or land owned  by people who are indebted to the state.    [Lacerda] What else do you condemn in the MST?    [Sobrinho] First I want to make clear that I believe the MST  is doing an important job. But I am worried about the  movements' narrow views. Agrarian reform does not mean simply  conquering the land. Our experience shows that most people who  have benefited from a piece of land abandon their lots if they  have the tools to work them. This occurs because landless  peasants are led to believe that all their problems will end  when they settle on a new piece of land. Things are quite  different in real life.    [Lacerda] What do you think is needed, then?    [Sobrinho] Peasants occupying a piece of land need to eat  until their land starts producing. They need medical care.  They need to learn how to read, and credit to start  cultivating. I think they need a comprehensive program with the  support of many entities and groups until they can stand on  their own two legs.    [Lacerda] Are landless peasants prepared to produce?    [Sobrinho] Most of them are not. It is not their fault that  they lack preparation. People from the northeastern forest  zones, for instance, became used to factory salaries. Workers'  unions are not doing anything to prepare these people to become  farmers.    [Lacerda] Do you believe an agrarian reform encompassing all  those aspects is viable?    [Sobrinho] Yes. It is arduous, but a true agrarian reform  will require a lot of work. Those who think that an agrarian  reform can be implemented only through the installation of a  socialist state are completely wrong. Besides, the right as  well as the left agree on the need for change in land ownership  policies. I think there is lack of government political  willingness, on one hand, as well as lack of planning and  reasoning by those organizing and struggling with workers and  landless peasants.</p>

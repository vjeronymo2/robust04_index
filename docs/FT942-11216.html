			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Company News: London Capital to get Pounds 150m valuation London Capital Holdings, the property investment company owned by Citibank, will offer up to Pounds 104m of new shares in a flotation, valuing the company at close to Pounds 150m, a small discount to its net asset value of Pounds 160m. Citibank will sell between 65 per cent and 70 per cent of its shares, while LCH - the former Randsworth Trust property portfolio - will raise a further Pounds 15m from new shares. The value of LCH's 14 properties increased by 7.25 per cent to Pounds 244.8m between December and mid-April. Management is optimistic that with limited new property coming on stream before 1996, the outlook for property values in London's west end remains positive. According to James Capel, the brokers, vacancy rates in the west end are expected to fall from 8.7 per cent in March 1994 to 2.5 per cent by March 1996, and prime rents should rise 30 per cent by the end of 1995. However, the outlook for property flotations has become less rosy since LCH announced its intention to float. The sector's premium to asset value has all but disappeared, while the company will have to compete with a number of property flotations, including Argent and Pillar. LCH has recently signed a Pounds 100m loan facility from HSBC, and will have gearing of less than 50 per cent. Mr Nigel Kempner, joint managing director, said he would be happy to see gearing rise to about 70 per cent. The shares will be offered through a placing and public offer, sponsored by Baring Brothers. The pricing will be announced on May 25.</p>

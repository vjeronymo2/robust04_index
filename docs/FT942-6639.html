			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (Great British Eating): A tight grip on a growing market - In a new series, Nicholas Lander samples oysters and is told they are good for the diner and the restaurateur 'Nature gave us the best shellfish in the world and my objective is to supply it and serve it as nature intended.' With these words Johnny Noble, a partner in the Loch Fyne Oyster Company, 50 miles north of Glasgow on the west coast of Scotland, tucked into a plate of nine gigas oysters. Viewed from the low, white-washed restaurant that today constitutes the Loch Fyne Oyster Bar, but 15 years ago was a run-down farm building, nature could not be improved on. In early May the sky was as blue as the loch, in which 2m oysters nestled. The lamb-covered hills rose sharply to the Highlands beyond which still revealed snow. Oyster bars, in which you can enjoy half a dozen molluscs and a half of porter, are considered archetypically British but the figures do not bear this out. In 19th century Britain, oysters were cheap and plentiful. In Charles Dickens' Pickwick Papers, written in 1836, Sam Weller talks of 'poverty and oysters' and, as a nation, we then consumed 1,800m a year. Then pollution and a nasty disease, binomia, which hit the native oyster beds that flourished in the River Helford, Cornwall, off Colchester, Essex and Whitstable, Kent, decimated stocks. As Noble says: 'Oysters became scarce, then expensive and so became toffs' food.' Today, the French consume 2,000m oysters a year while British consumption is up from 4m, 10 years ago, to 20m today. Loch Fyne now breeds and sells more oysters than anyone else in Britain but it dates back only to 1978 when a chance meeting between Noble and Andrew Lane, a marine fish farmer, led to the purchase of 10,000 seed oysters from Guernsey. A series of disasters then ensued. The seed oysters did not survive the year and strong tides washed away the wooden poles supporting the oysters. These problems were solved after Lane's visits to oyster beds at Arcachon and Brittany in France. Lane switched to the gigas oyster and to a method of rearing which involved metal trestles laid on the loch, retrieved at low tide by tractor. To survive financially they realised they would have to ship their oysters to London but were hampered by British Rail's insistence on classifying their oysters as 'cattle and livestock'. Today, Loch Fyne's annual turnover is more than Pounds 4m. Every afternoon three refrigerated lorries leave for their two other oyster bars in Nottingham and Elton, Peterborough, and for top London hotels and restaurants. In the morning a van is loaded with oysters and smoked salmon for Glasgow Airport and on to stores, hotels and private customers in Germany, Hong Kong, France, Spain, South Africa and, recently, Argentina. In 1993, exports exceeded 1m, a landmark recognised by a Queen's Award for Export. The revival of oyster eating in Britain today may be because they are good for you - they are low in cholesterol and rich in minerals - but they are attractive to the restaurateur, too. As restaurants become bigger it is a big advantage for a busy kitchen if some first and main courses, such as oysters, langoustines and seafood platters, require no cooking or can be prepared in advance. Noble has years of serious oyster eating under his belt and, just before the last oyster of our meal disappeared he told me how to spot a good gigas. There should be no blistering on the shell, which would mean uneven growth, nor should the shell be too frilly, which would mean too much sediment in the oyster beds. Most of all, they should be nice and plump, which would mean that they had fed on plenty of plankton. 'A good mouthful,' he added. And with that another tray of British oysters was finished.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Chill extends beyond tree line THE BOUNDARY between our property and the neighbouring property has been a tree line roughly 75 yards long with the mutual understanding that the trees themselves belong to our neighbour. There has never been a boundary fence in place. We painted our house last September, which is surely our prerogative. Ever since our neighbours have been distinctly 'cold'. Our neighbour has now decided that the boundary line needs clarification. We have looked at garden plans which reveal no means of assessing the boundary line save the garden area (which is complicated by the fact that the shapes are irregular). I maintain that the boundary line is the tree line with my neighbour in possession of the trees, which is consistent with my area measurement. He insists that it is several feet past the trees on my side. On whom does the onus lie to alter this mutually accepted boundary? I have no wish to involve myself in any legal expenses when I am not disputing its present position. Can my neighbour erect a fence where he assumes it lies? What are my rights in this case? We have lived in the house since 1987 and have carried out many mutually beneficial improvements which our neighbour appreciated until now. We are a young family with three children and no wish to cause ill feeling or incur large expenses. You have no obligation to do anything to resolve or fix the boundary. However, if your neighbour puts up a fence within your land you have little choice in practice other than to challenge him in court or by physically removing the fence. If you do not he will acquire title to the strip of your land which he has thus enclosed once 12 years have elapsed. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

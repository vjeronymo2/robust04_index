Chase raised its  provision for real estate loan losses to $225 million from $150 million the  year before, cutting into net income. In addition, the bank received almost no  interest payments from Brazil. Manufacturers Hanover Corp. reported a 7%  decline in profit to $96 million for the quarter. Net income from nonperforming  loans to major refinancing countries, including Brazil and Argentina, was $18  million less than in the previous year's first quarter.  </P></p>

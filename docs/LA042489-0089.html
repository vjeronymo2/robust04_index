			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NICHOLS SHOWS HE CAN MAKE HIS MARK IN 800-METER RUN;  </P> <P> EDISON RUNNER MOVES TO A NEW EVENT, AND HE LIVES UP TO OWN EXPECTATIONS  </P> <P> A little less than a year ago, Doug Nichols of Edison High School stood beside  the track at the Southern Section track and field preliminaries and watched as  the entrants in the boys' 800-meter run sped past.  </P> <P> Nichols, then an above-average 400-meter runner, was not extremely impressed.  In fact, although he had never raced the 800, he felt certain he could run it  as fast, or faster, than those in the race.  </P> <P> "I remember thinking, 'That can't be that tough,' " said Nichols, who ran  cross-country in the fall. "I was pretty sure I could run a 1:56."  </P> <P> Translation: Nichols, then a junior, was saying he could run the distance in 1  minute 56 seconds -- a time achieved by only about 100 high school runners in  the nation last year.  </P> <P> Was Nichols a bit overconfident? A little cocky? Not at all.  </P> <P> Last month, in his first 800-meter race, Nichols outkicked Corona del Mar  standout Eddie Lavelle to win the Beach Cities Invitational 800 in 1:55.9.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago at the Arcadia Invitational, he placed fourth in a national-class  prep field in 1:53.93.  </P> <P> And Saturday, at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays, Nichols improved his time  once again, running a 1:52.54 to place a very close third behind two foreigners  -- Mike McLean of Edmonton, Canada (1:52.34) and Mexico's Arturo Espejel (also  1:52.54).  </P> <P> Nichols' mark is the best in California this season and the third-best mark in  the nation. Florida's Scott Peters, who won the Arcadia Invitational 800 in  1:52.51, has the country's top time.  </P> <P> Currently, Nichols is considered the early-season favorite to win the State 800  title in June.  </P> <P> Remarkable? Quite so, considering that a year ago, he failed to advance past  the Southern Section preliminaries.  </P> <P> "I guess it is kind of surprising, actually," Nichols said. "I mean for me to  be (so close) off the national best . . . "  </P> <P> An explanation for Nichols' sudden success? Nichols points to the mixture of  his cross-country background with his 49-second speed in the open 400.  </P> <P> But Edison distance coach Stan Stauble, who claims he was not at all surprised  with Nichols' first 800 performance, said he is keeping Nichols' training a  secret.  </P> <P> "Everyone calls me to find out what Doug's doing," Stauble said. "Everyone  wants to know my system. But I keep quiet."  </P> <P> The fact is that no matter how he trains, Nichols -- who said he runs only 15  miles a week in training, about 15-20 miles less than the average  middle-distance runner -- is bound to improve. Especially when he becomes more  adept in race tactics.  </P> <P> To the casual observer, there might not seem much difference between the 400-  and 800-meter races aside from the distance. But the fact is that the 400, a  one-lap race in which all runners remain in separate lanes, is somewhat docile  compared to the 800, in which all entrants are allowed to cut to the inside  lane after the first 100 meters.  </P> <P> It is at this cut-in point, as well as the remainder of the race, where some of  track's biggest battles are fought. Runners speed up, slow down, jostle and  bump -- many times intentionally -- in order to gain better position. It is not  at all uncommon for elbows to be thrown, heels to be clipped and shins to be  "spiked" by opponents' shoes.  </P> <P> Like most newcomers to the event, Nichols, a 6-foot-2, 155-pound senior, has  not had the easiest time adjusting.  </P> <P> At the Arcadia meet, Nichols, trying unsuccessfully to keep from getting boxed  in, tripped and almost fell.  </P> <P> "Getting boxed in is new to me,"  </P> <P> said Nichols, who takes all honors classes and carries a 4.2 grade-point  average.  </P> <P> "My first race was rough; everyone was really pushing. It's like you have to  speed up or slow down at any time, but then make sure you don't get boxed. At  the same time, you've got to stay relaxed."  </P> <P> Saturday at Mt. SAC, Nichols fell into a similar trap, getting boxed in early  in the race and having to move outside to lane 3 where he ran for nearly 500  meters.  </P> <P> "I never once got into lane 1," Nichols said. "I think I ran an 810 meters.  With about 100 yards to go, I passed about four guys. If I had started kicking  earlier, I might have won."  </P> <P> How fast does Nichols think he can run the 800 this year?  </P> <P> "Probably about 1:50, I hope," he said. "Especially after (the Mt. SAC race)  because I felt real good after I finished. I had a lot left. I wish I had  kicked sooner.  </P> <P> "I think if I got in a big race like (Mt. SAC), and if I kind of led it where I  wouldn't have to catch up, I think I could do a 1:50 or so."  </P> <P> With Nichols, only time -- or tactics -- will tell.  </P></p>

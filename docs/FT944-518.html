			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Record industry's heart develops healthier beat: The new Beatles album is just one of the reasons why sales have rebounded Executives of EMI Records knew they had a hit on their hands last month when they launched a rare Beatles recording, Live At The BBC. But they never thought it would sell nearly 1m copies in its first month. Live At The BBC is not the only success on the UK music scene. Album and singles sales rose by 12.5 per cent in the year to October, according to the British Phonographic Industry. Early estimates suggest Christmas sales could be 20 per cent up on last year. Record companies are also basking in the success of UK acts - such as Take That, East 17, Blur, Oasis and Eternal - in the continental European market. This rosy picture could not be more different from that of a few years ago when the industry was mired in recession and haunted by legal and regulatory problems. The music market declined steadily in the early 1990s with album sales falling from 163m in 1989 to 134m by 1992, British Phonographic Industry statistics show. The record companies also faced the dual threat of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into compact disc pricing and the legal attempt by George Michael, the singer, to end his contract with Sony. These threats have evaporated. The MMC found in the industry's favour and George Michael lost his case. The latest probe into the music business - the MMC's investigation into the Performing Right Society, the body that collects royalties for composers - will not affect the record companies. The economic environment has also improved. Music is traditionally a leading indicator, emerging from recession earlier than other consumer sectors, and its recovery from the early 1990s recession has been accelerated by other factors such as demographic trends and technological changes. The growth in the number of teenagers, the prime purchasers of singles, has triggered a revival in teen phenomena such as Take That and East 17. Both bands have had a string of hits and become the most successful teen acts since David Cassidy, the Osmonds and the Bay City Rollers back in the 1970s. The record companies have also invested in new alternative acts such as Oasis and Blur. These bands have more critical kudos than Take That and East 17, which might help them to last longer. They have also enjoyed healthy sales. Blur's Parklife album has sold 500,000 copies since its September debut. The jungle dance craze which started in the London clubs has been bombarded by media attention in the US and UK. Record companies have been signing up jungle acts in the expectation that it will become a commercial phenomenon next year. Meanwhile the industry continues to benefit from increased sales to age groups which grew up in the vibrant pop culture of the 1960s and 1970s. Some of the most successful 1994 releases have been aimed at this age group. REM's Monster sold 200,000 copies in its first week - more than any album for five years - when it came out in September. The 'greatest hits' compilations by Bon Jovi and the Beautiful South have been among the best-sellers this Christmas. Live At The BBC is even better news for retailers, as it attracts older consumers who do not normally buy albums. EMI's compact disc plant has been working round-the-clock to satisfy demand. Mr Brian McLaughlin, managing director of the HMV chain, said his shops were still selling 'as many copies as we can lay our hands on'. The popularity of compact disc players is also boosting music sales. Some 40 per cent of UK homes now have compact disc machines and consumers are replacing their record collections by buying old favourites on disc, increasing sales of classic rock, jazz and classical music. The outlook is even brighter on the international front. UK acts are well-established on the Continent and are starting to regain the ground they lost in the US in the early 1990s due to the popularity of American phenomena such as country music, rap and grunge rock. Country and grunge are waning, making it easier for UK acts to make their mark in the US, by far the world's largest pop market. This means that their UK record companies can earn royalties on their North American sales. Take That is being primed for a US debut next autumn. Mr John Preston, chairman of the UK subsidiary of BMG, its record company, said: 'The US is such an important market and Take That is such a big act that we want to get it right first time. If we do, the upside is stupendous.'  ---------------------------------------------                  MUSIC SALES  ---------------------------------------------                       Albums       Singles  --------------------------------------------- 1989                    163m         61m 1990                    151m         59m 1991                    142m         56m 1992                    134m         53m 1993                    153m         56m  --------------------------------------------- Source: British Phonographic Industry  ---------------------------------------------               ALBUM MARKET SHARE           January to September 1994  --------------------------------------------- Company                           Share  --------------------------------------------- PolyGram                          23.3% EMI                               14.1% Sony                              11.6% Warner                            10.8% Virgin                             9.1% BMG                                5.0% Telstar                            3.9% Others                            22.2%  --------------------------------------------- Source: CIN  ---------------------------------------------</p>

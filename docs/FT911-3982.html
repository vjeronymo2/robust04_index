			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Electrical shops 'ready for upturn' THE recession has forced electrical retailing companies to refine their strategies and restructure their operations, allowing them to benefit from any uplift in demand, according to a report by Verdict, the retail consultants. The report says the electrical retail trade was one of the first to be affected by the recession in the late 80s and will be one of the first to emerge from it. But the report sees little increase in demand until at least the end of the year. Dixons, the market leader, has successfully refocused its operations, according to the report, although this process was accelerated by the threat of takeover from the rival Kingfisher group. It has reduced its dependence on discounting, which will help restore profit margins. Comet, the chain which is owned by Kingfisher, has lost market share but still remains the dominant out-of-town electrical retailer, the report says. The position of the two leading companies will be challenged by Clydesdale, the Glasgow-based retailer, and the privatised electricity companies, which are stepping up their commercial activities. Collectively, the electricity companies account for 10.6 per cent of the total electrical retailing market, behind only Dixons with 13.3 per cent.

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: New stand for rugby stadium The construction of the new 25,000 seater East Stand at Twickenham has been awarded by the Rugby Football Union to MOWLEM SOUTH EAST, a division of John Mowlem Construction. Structurally, the new East Stand will be identical to the North Stand, successfully completed by Mowlem at the end of 1990. It will provide uninterrupted views of the playing area by means of a 39 metre cantilevered tubular steel roof, supported by large concrete columns at the rear of the stand. This design also achieves continuity of seating and weather protection. Work will begin on site shortly and the lower tier seating 10,000 spectators will be available for the England versus South Africa match on November 14 this year. The remainder of the stand will be completed by the end of October 1993. The new stand will increase Twickenham's capacity from around 60,000 at present to nearly 69,000 - the second step towards the Rugby Football Union's goal of a 75,000 capacity all-seated stadium.</p>

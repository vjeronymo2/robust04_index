			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The Philippine  Government and people wish to see China "playing a positive role  in political, economic and security matters in the Asia-Pacific  region as a stabilizing influence in the maintenance of peace  and tranquility."    This was stated by visiting Philippine Vice President Joseph  Estrada in an exclusive interview with XINHUA before he left  here for Shanghai today.    China's rapid economic development in recent years has been  astonishing to the extent that the country is making efforts to  cut its growth rate while other countries are seeking higher  growth rates, Estrada said.    He noted that the Philippine Government would like to see a  stronger China in the region.    The Philippine Government does not have any fears about a  stronger China and "sees no threat from China," Estrada said,  adding "maybe some western countries do." but as for the  Philippines and other Asian countries, they want all their  neighbors to become stronger.    Sitting comfortably beside a dinner table in a villa of the  Diaoyutai state guesthouse where the vice-president stayed  during his visit to Beijing, he talked softly with occasional  rises in his voice for emphasis, seemingly with a clear-cut  rhythm, fully demonstrating his conversational skills as an  eminent film star.    Before assuming his current post in 1992, the vice-president  had been a popular actor in the Philippines, staging more than  100 films in his 25-year career and starring in many of them.    He described his current visit to China, his first China  tour, as "quite a success", having met Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren, Premier Li Peng, the National People's Congress  Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi and many other senior  officials. What satisfied him most was the signing of a trade  protocol between the two governments which is expected to help  further boost the vibrant trade to an annual volume of 400  million U.S. dollars and enhance economic cooperation between  the two countries. His coming to China is itself an indication  of the Philippine Government's high regard for China, he  stressed.    The exchanges of visits by senior officials of the two  countries over the past few years have helped strengthen the  healthy bilateral relations, especially in the fields of  economic cooperation, science and technology and culture.  China, already a "very important player in international  affairs," is naturally encouraged to assume "an active role in  economic and security regional discussions," such as the  Asia-Pacific Economic Conference and the ASEAN regional forum,  the vice-president stated.</p>

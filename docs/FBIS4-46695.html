			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Levko Lukyanenko by Mariya Bazelyuk, under </F> the rubric "Interview of Current Interest"; place and date not  given: "When the Leeway for Maneuvering Is Very Narrow:  Interview with Prominent Politician Levko Lukyanenko"]    [Text]    [Bazelyuk] Mr. Lukyanenko, could you briefly discuss the  current political sentiment in Ukraine associated with possible  presidential elections?    [Lukyanenko] Whether presidential elections are to be held  or  not is indeed the most burning problem of the current political  development in Ukraine. Preparations for elections to the local  organs of power have begun; elections to the Supreme Council of  Ukraine are not complete yet. We are living in a particularly  stormy period. Even earlier I believed that the political system  needs to be changed, but not all at once. For stability to exist  in the state, we could successively elect first the parliament,  subsequently the local organs of power, and then the president,  rather than all of them at once. Our state, which has not yet  grown strong, has faced all three of these great problems  simultaneously. That an appropriate legislative foundation has  not been laid yet is another complication.    I think that completion of our parliament, so that it will  have 450 deputies and be able to work normally, is the most  important issue. The elections of the president and the local  organs of power are also very important, but they should be held  at a later date. Given that we have not succeeded in putting  together the Supreme Council and this process is being dragged  out until July, whereas the presidential elections have been  scheduled for June, all of this generates incredibly great  strains which are hard for the people to bear. The people are  not in their most active period, which occurred in 1989 through  1991, and for this reason their participation in these numerous  elections at the same time may present a problem. These will be  elections in which people will be elected at random, or the  voters simply will not come to the polling stations at all.    I think that the elections of the president and the local  organs of power should not only be postponed but be held at  different times. I am in favor of holding them toward the end of  this year or even in the first quarter of next year. This would  be the fall and winter season, when people are not involved in  farm work and have more spare time to examine candidates in a  more serious and profound manner.    As far as rescheduling the presidential elections is  concerned, the motive is different. A legal foundation has not  been laid, the rights and responsibilities of the president have  not been fully set forth. The very time of the  election--June--is very close; however, this is a time when  students have a break and many people are on vacation.  Consequently, it is highly likely that the election will be  frustrated, and the funds spent will go down the drain. To this  day it has not been determined whether ours will be a  presidential republic, presidential-parliamentary republic, or  parliamentary republic, and this also does matter in a  presidential election. In principle, I think that our current  shortcomings result from the fact that our president himself  displays insufficient determination and firmness in his post  rather than from the incompleteness of the legal foundation.  That is to say, there is a lack of will rather than a lack of  law in this instance. However, we want to create a rule-of-law  state after all in which rights and responsibilities will be  clearly defined.    [Bazelyuk] You mentioned that the president does not always  show his willpower, and I agree with you. However, let us look  to ourselves for the reason why. Why is he indecisive? Could it  be because the democratic forces did not stand behind him like a  monolithic wall and did not breathe down his neck? Perhaps it  would after all be important to adequately surround the  president. Understandably, it is very hard to consider  nonpopulist decisions. Do you also see the fault of the  democratic forces in our having the capability to do more, even  in the political situation that we have, but not doing it?    [Lukyanenko] I do think that the democratic forces could  have  done more than they have even with this president, but in a  different manner. Our president is a very intelligent man, and  not just intelligent but also cunning. In his time, the  president said that he would draw on Rukh's support, but Rukh  supposedly did not support him--I mean our nationwide democratic  movement rather than the Rukh-party. I am certain that this was  cunningness on the part of our Mr. President; he did not even  think about drawing on the support of the Rukh-party or other  democratic organizations because if he wanted to draw on support  from the democratic forces, he would have proceeded differently.  Mr. President says that the Supreme Council restricted his  actions. Let us assume this is so. However, out of the entire  Cabinet of Ministers the Supreme Council confirms eight  ministers, and the president appoints the rest of the ministers  himself. Second, he has created a presidential team of those who  serve as his advisers, etc. Who did he draft for the positions  of ministers whom he had the opportunity to appoint them  himself, or who did he use to form the presidential entourage  which is important because it develops draft laws? The president  brought in Fokin, Symonenko--a stubborn partocrat from  Odessa--and other former friends from the CPSU, and on a pro  forma basis--certain people from the democratic milieu. However,  in essence his team is full of old friends from the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine. So, there are no  grounds for the idea that he could be different. Our president  is a product of the communist system. It is indeed so, and I  agree with you that the president could have acted otherwise had  the democratic forces acted otherwise, without joining the  president's team. He should have been influenced from the  street--through rallies, hunger strikes, protests, hundreds of  thousands of people convening in front of the Supreme Council,  strong pressure.    I know from my experience that the actual political course  has a vector value. It results from the action of various  forces. Had the democratic forces continued to act as they did  in 1991 and demanded changes, this vector value would have  obviously been somewhat more to the right, and on the whole  reforms would have taken off long ago in our country, that is to  say, the situation could have been different.    [Bazelyuk] What if the presidential election is held, after  all, and we face the choice: We have what we have. I am not  talking about the openly antistate communists. We have Leonid  Kravchuk and Ivan Plyushch among those who have been nominated.  Recently, Ivan Stepanovych said in Lisichansk that he is a  supporter of federalism as a modern, democratic form of system,  and said other strange things. Who are we to vote for?    [Lukyanenko] Indeed, our leeway for maneuvering is very  narrow because we know for sure than none of the democrats would  win the presidency. The election has revealed very curious  things. The communist cobweb which the empire wove on the  territory of Ukraine over 70 years has not been destroyed and  torn to shreds but has remained whole and shown itself in a big  way. It has perceived its strength, and we have perceived its  strength, which will be revealed in the presidential election.  This is why it would be an exercise in futility to field a  democratic candidate. We have this minuscule leeway--from  Plyushch to Kravchuk. It is between them that we have to choose.  Which one of them is better?    Kravchuk is an advocate of the state but without willpower,  as a result of which two and a half years have been taken up by  the gradual decay of the economy and its plundering rather than  the building of an independent Ukraine. Plyushch is also an  advocate of the state, and in this he has an advantage over  Moroz and Kuchma. All of them are nondemocratic candidates.  However, we have been put into such a narrow framework when we  have to choose among people who are not ours, among bad  candidates, someone who is a little bit better, that is, the  lesser evil. I see Plyushch as being a lesser evil. He is an  advocate of the state.    [Bazelyuk] However, if he starts talking about the  federation  yet again, nobody on most of the territory of Ukraine will take  him seriously.    [Lukyanenko] Let us take a different view. In preparation  for  the elections, Plyushch went to Lisichansk rather than Lvov. Had  he stated that he comes out in favor of a unitary Ukraine he  would have pushed away many people, because recently very  vigorous anti-Ukrainian, subversive, communist, pro-imperial  activities have been conducted there. A certain segment of  people have been influenced by this propaganda which is hostile  to Ukraine. Plyushch responded, taking this sentiment into  account. His answer is a model of obscurity. This obscurity was  conscious, it was clouding the entire audience rather than  clouding minds. It is a very good obscurity because it does not  bind him and does not give anybody the opportunity to accuse him  of whatever they like. Therefore, I simply see this as a talent  of his.    [Bazelyuk] Halychyna expects to have its own candidate in  your person. Will you run?    [Lukyanenko] I think I will run. You know, when I look at a  list of 112 seats and picture that the communists may get all of  them, I grow fearful, and out of this fear I want to fill one of  the gaps with my own person. They have proposed Kiev, Lvov, and  Ternopol to me. I am rather leaning toward Ternopol.    [Bazelyuk] Thank you for the conversation. I wish you  success.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Japan Yesterday's economic figures confirm that Japan is experiencing its very own double-dip. Stagnation at home and the brow-beating from Washington on trade can only increase pressure on the government to deliver an economic package of substance tomorrow. Two rounds of blunt fiscal stimulus totalling Y24,000bn have failed to stimulate recovery. Something more imaginative is now required. Since Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's fragile coalition is split on personal tax cuts and the scope for deregulation of business, it is far from clear that he can deliver. Still, serious gestures in the direction of deregulation and measures to stimulate personal consumption might at least relieve upward pressure on the yen. Evidence that the structural causes of Japan's trade surplus are finally being addressed might persuade the US to stop talking up the Japanese currency. The impact on the markets would be all the greater if such a package were to be followed by a cut in official interest rates. While the trade surplus remains stubbornly high in dollar terms, though, anything more than a gentle depreciation of the yen would again upset the apple cart with Washington. On that basis, the recent strength of the Tokyo equity market is perplexing. As in other markets, low deposit rates are encouraging a flow of savings into equities. But without coherent measures to nurture a consumer-led recovery, reasons for optimism are few and far between.</p>

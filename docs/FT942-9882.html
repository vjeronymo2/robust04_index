			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Chip boost for signal processing speed An electronic chip that could significantly increase signal processing speeds has been developed by Robomatix Technologies, writes Anna Kochan. Tests to be completed by early summer on an initial production batch of 160 chips will prove whether Robomatix has succeeded where others have failed, says Zami Aberman, president of the Israeli company. He describes the Xium chip as massively parallel; it incorporates 1,024 processors. Simulations show a Xium chip could perform 1bn instructions per second. It would function as a single chip or as part of a computer board. If the tests prove successful, Robomatix plans to put the chip into automated inspection systems. Its ability to perform real-time recognition and processing of data could be useful in video-conferencing and air traffic control systems. Robomatix: Israel, 9729 986976.</p>

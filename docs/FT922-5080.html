			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Rockwell fined Dollars 18.5m in nuclear waste disposal case A US judge yesterday fined Rockwell International Dollars 18.5m (Pounds 10.2m) for violating environmental laws at a nuclear weapons plant it once operated, Reuter reports from Denver. It is the largest fine in the US for hazardous waste violations and the second largest under environmental laws, after the Dollars 125m fine and restitution resulting from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. Rockwell had pleaded guilty to violations at its Rocky Flats plant, near Denver. Judge Sherman Finesilver noted that the fine was the maximum allowed. Three environmental groups told the court last week that closed records of a four-year investigation, which led to the charges, would reveal public officials also violated environmental laws. The company admitted illegal treatment and storage of hazardous wastes and the illegal disposal of contaminated water. Prosecutors said the Energy Department, which owns the plant, shared the blame.</p>

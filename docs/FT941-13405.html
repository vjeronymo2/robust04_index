			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / World Trade News: US, Tokyo far from agreement The US and Japan have ended two days of trade talks in Washington without agreement and still face 'substantial stumbling blocks', according to a senior US official, Reuter reports. The two sides are trying to come up with a new economic agenda in time for a February 11 summit between President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The US official said he expected further intensive talks. But he made clear it would be an uphill struggle to come up with market opening agreements on cars, insurance and government procurement.</p>

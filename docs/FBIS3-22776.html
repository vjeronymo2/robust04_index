Armored Missile Train Lost in Perm  Forests"]    [Text] An abandoned rail-based strategic missile  system has been discovered on the railroad tracks near Perm. The  discovery by the group of Perm journalists headed by the  department chief of the oblast newspaper MOLODAYA GVARDIYA, Oleg  Andriyashkin, was the result of an investigation they conducted:  The reporters' attention was drawn to the fact that electronic  equipment intended for "defense purposes" had begun to appear on  the local market, and then they found the RS-22. After the  journalists contacted the leaders of the missile forces, the  six-car train was placed under guard. Yesterday the  KOMMERSANT-DAILY editorial staff learned the details of the  incident.    The Perm journalists reported to the KOMMERSANT-DAILY  editorial offices that at the Kurya Station of the Perm Railroad  they had discovered a six-car train which, they thought,  contained an RS-22 rail-based strategic missile system.    The rail-based RS-22 strategic system is better known  as the SS-24. It is usually "disguised" as passenger cars or  refrigerated cars. One system contains up to 10 strategic  missiles with a target radius of up to 10,000 km. These systems  were produced in Ukraine in Dnepropetrovsk. They have now been  removed from production. At the present time they are still on  combat alert.    As the Perm journalist Oleg Andriyashkin told a  KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the reporters managed to freely  enter two cars whose doors had been opened (nobody was guarding  the equipment). The first of the cars was an electric power  plant and the second was the main command post. The doors of the  other four cars, which presumably contained missiles and missile  fuel, were blocked. The journalists noted that there had been  some looting of the equipment in the cars. Most likely it was  not foreign spies who had found their way here but thrifty  citizens of the country who were interested in the instruments,  which contain gold and silver and other valuable metals. In  Andriyashkin's opinion, saboteurs would not be able to use the  missile system for its intended purpose. The danger came from  the marauders, who could carelessly set one of the cars on fire.   <FIG ID=JPRS-TND-006-29A>           Similar railcars are to be found in any railway stop. </FIG>      <FIG ID=JPRS-TND-006-30A>           Today, little remains of the "electronics" aboard the train.. </FIG>       As the deputy chief of the Perm Oblast administration,  Yevgeniy Sapiro, told a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the  missile system that was discovered is now being used as a  training facility of the Perm Higher Military School of Missile  Forces. Representatives of the training institution refrained  from commentary, alluding to a leadership conference that was  taking place at that moment. In the press group of the Main  Commissariat of Strategic Missile Forces (RVSN) they said that  they had no information on this question: "These missile systems  are on combat alert and are guarded reliably enough."    A worker of the press service of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service, Vladimir Murashkin, said that the  Federal Counterintelligence Service knows about the military  school's written-off training train located at the Kurya station  of the Perm Railroad, which contains training missiles with the  warheads removed. From the standpoint of state security the  system is of no special interest to foreign intelligence  services--the American military were familiarized with similar  missile systems not very long ago.</p>

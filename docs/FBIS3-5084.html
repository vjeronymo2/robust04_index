			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 3 Mar Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The government plans to call on China to  substantially reduce its tariff rates. With the working group  on China's joining GATT set to meet in Geneva in mid-March, the  government will present China with a list of products including  textiles, machinery, and electrical equipment, on which Japan  wants it to reduce duty rates. Japan will also ask China to open  up its markets in the service areas of trading agency business,  distribution, and telecommunications. The duty rates in China,  averaging more than 30 percent, are conspicuously higher than  those of Japan, Europe, and the United States.    China hopes to be admitted to GATT within this year, and  GATT  member nations like Japan, the United States, and European  nations have expressed a willingness to support its admission.  But with tariff rates so high and service markets not open  enough, China is expected to have a tough time negotiating  admission. Japan intends to work on China to reduce its tariff  rates and open up its service sector, to help China in its  negotiations on admission to GATT.    As a result of the year-end agreement in the Uruguay Round  of  talks on tariff reductions, the average tariff duty rate for  Japan came down to 1.5 percent, and that for Europe and the  United States to the 3-percent level. Coming into 1994, China  effected a large-scale tariff reduction of its own, but tariff  rates in general still remain high, with, for instance, the  import duty rates for gasoline-fueled vehicles of less than  3,000cc in displacement and color television sets running to 110  percent and 50 percent, respectively.    The government will suggest large-scale tariff rate  reductions primarily on Japan's key export products to China  like machinery, textiles, and electric equipment. The Ministry  of International Trade and Industry is now studying the specific  rates to suggest, but also is considering first suggesting  actions on rates which exceed 50 percent. For Japan, China is  the second largest trading partner after the United States, and  the government hopes to expand its exports by having the latter  reduce import duties.    In the service market, Japan will call on China to open up  the trading agency business which is currently under state  control, and to also open up the distribution and  telecommunications markets.    At present, China and also Taiwan are getting ready to join  GATT, and member nations agree: "Taiwan should be admitted  after China is admitted." China in effect is accepting GATT's  admission of Taiwan. That being the case, once China's admission  into GATT becomes certain, the government will start  negotiations on tariff reductions with Taiwan.</p>

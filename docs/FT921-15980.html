			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Hong Kong sees record container throughput HONG KONG'S container port handled more than 6m TEUs - or twenty-foot equivalent units - for the first time last year and total cargo throughput exceeded 100m tonnes also for the first time. Container traffic increased 21.7 per cent to about 6.2m TEUs, according to provisional figures from the Hong Kong government. Singapore, which overtook Hong Kong as the world's busiest container port in 1990, is expected to announce even higher throughput figures later this year. Hong Kong's increase is largely a result of exports from southern China. Hong Kong manufacturers have shifted production across the border into China for cheaper land and wages. Southern China's economy has also expanded rapidly, despite an austerity programme launched in 1988. 'China trade has been steaming ahead at a greater rate than anyone could have forecast two to three years ago,' said Mr Ian Dale, assistant director of marine planning. Hong Kong's rate of increase, which exceeded government five-year forecasts, will add urgency to plans for the colony's ninth container terminal, due to become operational in 1995. The site for the terminal has been criticised by environmental groups.</p>

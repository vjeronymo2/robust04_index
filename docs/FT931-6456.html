			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / EC urged to bring car taxes into line THE European Commission should take 'political action' to harmonise car taxes in EC member states, according to European carmakers, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. ACEA, the European automobile manufacturers' association, says wide disparities in car tax 'constitute the single most important cause of car price differences in the EC, maintaining low pre-tax levels in high taxation countries'. An ACEA study of car taxes across Europe reveals that the overall level of tax on an average 2-litre car in the EC varies from 15 per cent in Luxembourg and Germany to 213 per cent in Denmark. 'Apart from being contrary to the philosophy of the single market, these discrepancies obviously cause distortion in the cross-border movement of new motor vehicles,' ACEA says. EC legislation has set minimum levels of value added tax across the Community, and cut higher VAT rates, but it has not affected additional sales and registration taxes in some member states.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WESTCHESTER;  </P> <P> RECREATION CENTER TO GROW  </P> <P> The Westchester Recreation Center will be expanded to include a center for  teen-agers and a picnic area under a plan approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles  City Council.  </P> <P> The council voted to allow the Department of Transportation to donate nearly 1  1/2 acres of vacant land adjacent to the center for the new facilities and the  widening of a small stretch of Lincoln Boulevard.  </P> <P> Transportation officials had intended to use the land, valued at $675,000, for  a service yard. But they recently decided the yard was not needed.  </P> <P> Under the new plan for the property, the Department of Recreation and Parks  will provide staffing for youth programs at the enlarged facility.  </P> <P> "There is a significant dearth of recreational land in Westchester and along  with that a dearth of organized activities," said Rick Ruiz, spokesman for  Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents Westchester. "To the degree you can  keep teen-agers busy, you can keep them out of trouble."  </P></p>

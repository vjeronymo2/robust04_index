			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Baring expects 'quantum drop' in Swiss inflation LAST Thursday's Ascension Day holiday seemed, yesterday, to have taken the initiative away from most continental bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. Baring Securities observed that last week's subdued performance from European equity markets followed on from weakness in bond markets, the latter reflecting weakness in US bonds and interest rate prospects, and disappointment with French fiscal policy. This week, its strategy team expects 'another quantum drop' in the headline rate of Swiss inflation, perhaps giving some impetus to a bourse which has been somnolent, if still elevated, in recent days. STOCKHOLM rode a wavelet of foreign interest, with talk of institutional program trading as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 7.0 higher at 998.5 in turnover up from from SKr349m to SKr642m. However, dealers noted that the sharp jump in volume reflected the fact that many of big investors, including all of the major insurance companies, stayed closed last Friday. Among prominent winners the base metal miner, Trelleborg, recovered some of last week's losses on disappointing current year prospects to end with the B shares SKr7 higher at SKr130. The June synthetic future on the OMX Swedish share index closed at 746.3, compared with a spot level of 740.18. Some analysts said that equities may be poised to shoot through a resistance level Other Nordic makers were not so fortunate. COPENHAGEN's 25-share KFX index fell 0.58 to 100.04 ahead of today's Maastrict treaty referendum, reflecting profit-taking in heavyweight stocks like Novo Nordisk, FLS Industries and Carlsberg. OSLO lagged in spite of slightly firmer prices for Norway's North Sea oil. The all-share index fell 1.56 to 449.53 in turnover of NKr173m. Meanwhile, HELSINKI shed 1 per cent, the Hex index closing 8.5 lower at 892.2 in slow trade. KOP restricted shares fell FM1 to FM11.50 following Friday's first quarter loss of FM527m, up from a deficit of FM95m for the same period of last year. MILAN's screen trading system was knocked out of commission by heavy rainstorms and lightning overnight; this produced drastic cuts in volume in its 35 stocks which account for about one quarter of bourse turnover, and the rise of 1.38 to 497.98 in the Comit index came in very thin trading. Turnover was estimated at L60bn or less, against figures in the L100bn area last week and over L150bn on Friday, May 22. Sifa, the state-held controlled financial services company, closed L153 or 13 per cent higher at L1,350 after being delayed from trading once during the session for excessive gains. Consob, the market's regulatory agency, had suspended Sifa from trading on Friday pending details of a plan, approved over the weekend, to merge it with the state engineering group, Finmeccanica SpA. FRANKFURT was subdued, the DAX index ending 5.08 lower at 1,798.14 after a decline of 2.83 to 718.34 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover stayed low by recent standards at DM5.1bn, up from DM4.6bn last Friday. Bulls had the upper hand in a pre-bourse which saw the DAX well above Friday's level in a continuation of that day's gains, but they lost the initiative after both follow-through orders and foreign buyers failed to materialise. PARIS saw out a dull day in which technical factors were more influential than corporate news. A number of leading shares went ex dividend, which helped to depress the index, and slim turnover of some FFr1.5bn showed that there were few buyers around. The CAC-40 index closed down 15.89 at 2,017.40. Euro Disney again featured among the day's losers, falling FFr4 to FFr117 following negative press comment over the weekend. Eurotunnel advanced 30 centimes to FFr36.55 after bankers agreed at the end of last week to make new funds available. Elsewhere, Paribas lost FFr3.40 to FFr408, LVMH roseFFr5 to FFr4,025 and Elf shed FFr3.60 at FFr398.40. AMSTERDAM was led lower by the weaker dollar which affected stocks with exposure to the US. The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.6 at 130.4 in turnover of Fl 504.6m. Royal Dutch lost 60 cents to Fl 157.00, Unilever was Fl 2.20 down at Fl 183.10 and Akzo slipped 90 cents to Fl 159.30. BRUSSELS improved on the first day of trade after a four day holiday. The Bel-20 index finished up 1.76 to 1,232.56 in high turnover of BFr1.4bn. Tractebel put on BFr300 or 3.6 per cent to BFr8,600 following local press interviews with the chairman over the weekend while Glaverbel, the glass manufacturer, gained BFr90 to BFr3,980 following a positive agm last week. MADRID was weaker, with news that the current account deficit had narrowed slightly between April and March having little effect on sentiment. The general index closed down 0.41 at 260.65 with turnover estimated at Pta14bn. Banesto weakened Pta5 to Pta2,895 after it said at its annual meeting at the weekend that it was setting up a Pta6bn loan loss reserve to stabilise profits and that it is to reduce industrial investments. BBV lost Pta25 following its purchase of a 20 per cent stake in General Electric Capital of Puerto Rico for Pta2bn. Acerinox rose Pta610 to Pta7,600. VIENNA was stronger with sentiment boosted by the successful offer of 5.4m shares in Vienna International Airport. The issue, which was due to last all week, was closed yesterday with trading planned to begin next month. The offer, reducing the state's share to 73 per cent, will raise Sch1.8bn to finance expansion work. The ATX index gained 3.06 to 990.2.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUNE 1                              Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open     10 am   11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1197.50  1197.42  1195.54  1195.67  1195.72  1195.95  1196.86  1196.12                 Day's High  1197.72    Day's Low  1194.96            May 29    May 28      May 27    May 26     May 22           1199.58    1195.22**  1194.56    1198.37    1197.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ** Partial.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

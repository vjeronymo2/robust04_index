			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FHP PROFIT JUMPS 28% IN QUARTER  </P> <P> As some health maintenance organizations flounder, FHP International Corp.  reported Tuesday that its earnings jumped 28% to $5.3 million for its fiscal  1989 third quarter. Revenue for the quarter, which ended March 31, increased  38% to $186.8 million.  </P> <P> The Fountain Valley-based HMO said its performance was boosted by a 24%  increase in membership, which grew to 446,000 enrollees March 31, contrasted  with 360,000 a year ago. And the company benefited from rate increases in its  commercial and senior plans, Chairman Robert Gumbiner said.  </P> <P> For the first 9 months of fiscal 1989, earnings were ahead 38% to $14.4  million, contrasted with $10.4 million. Revenue was $499.7 million, up 39% from  $358.4 million.  </P> <P> FHP reported its increased profits amid a stream of losses from some other  for-profit HMO's, including Maxicare in Los Angeles, Cigna Health Plans of  California in Glendale and Greater San Diego Health Plan in San Diego.  </P> <P> Cypress-based PacifiCare has remained profitable, and analysts expect it to  post an earnings increase for its fiscal 1989 second quarter, which ended March  31.  </P> <P> Health care analysts said FHP continues to do well because of strategic steps  taken by its management, which still follows the careful, moderate-growth  strategy that influenced the company's operations when FHP operated as a  nonprofit operation before 1985.  </P> <P> "FHP and PacifiCare operate as regional and local businesses. They did not do  what Maxicare did and overexpand," said Peter Grua, a health care analyst at  Alex Brown &amp; Co., a brokerage firm in Baltimore. FHP operates in  California, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.  </P> <P> By growing slowly, FHP has been able to pay for its medical centers soon after  opening them. Because many of its facilities are paid for, FHP has a  competitive advantage over recently formed HMOs that must make large interest  payments on newly built centers, said Lee Grover, a principal in Wm. Mercer  Meidinger Hansen, an employee benefits consulting firm in Orange.  </P> <P> FHP stock, which was up on Monday, fell $1 per share Tuesday to $24 in  over-the-counter trading.  </P> <P> To capitalize on a stock price that has recently traded at record-high levels,  FHP plans a public offering of 2 million shares. The offering could come as  early as mid-May, analysts said.  </P> <P> At FHP's recent trading price of $24, the company could raise $48 million,  which Grua said should help the company reduce its debt.  </P> <P> Less than 2 years ago, when FHP stock was trading at 25% of its current level,  the company benefited by repurchasing 2.5 million shares, some for as little as  $5.75 per share.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FHP INTERNATIONAL CORP. AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> FHP International Corp. is a Fountain Valley-based health maintenance  organization with 446,000 members in California, Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.  Primarily, FHP operates a staff-model HMO, in which it hires most of the  doctors and staff it needs and owns most of its own medical facilities.  Chairman Robert Gumbiner started the HMO in 1961 as a nonprofit corporation,  and in 1985 he led an 18-member employee group that acquired the operation  after it had been converted into a for-profit concern. In 1986, the new owners  took the company public.  </P> <P> Assets: $252.9 million  </P> <P> Number of employees: 4,500  </P> <P> Shares outstanding: 10.5 million  </P> <P> 52-week price range: $25.25-$8.75  </P> <P> Tuesday's closing price (over the counter): $24, down $1  </P> <P> Chief executive: Robert Gumbiner  </P> <P> </P> <P> FHP YEARLY RESULTS  </P> <P> NET INCOME  </P> <P> In million of dollars  </P> <P> '84: 4.3  </P> <P> '85: 7.4  </P> <P> '86: 9.2  </P> <P> '87: 6.9  </P> <P> '88: 16.5  </P> <P> Year ends June 30  </P> <P> REVENUE  </P> <P> In million of dollars  </P> <P> '84: 123.0  </P> <P> '85: 181.3  </P> <P> '86: 264.7  </P> <P> '87: 367.5  </P> <P> '88: 503.5  </P> <P> Year ends June 30  </P></p>

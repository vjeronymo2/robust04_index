			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Arts: Stephen Kovacevich - Concert While there is no sign of rising unemployment in the ranks of pianists and conductors, the practice of job-sharing continues. The number of pianists who follow a double career as conductors includes such eminent keyboard players as Daniel Barenboim and Christoph Eschenbach, to whom in recent years we have also had to add the name of Stephen Kovacevich. As his conducting duties have grown, Kovacevich (previously Stephen Bishop, then Bishop-Kovacevich) has been seen far less in recital. A new recording contract would, however, seem to be pointing him back in that direction. His weekend appearance in a South Bank piano matinee was a welcome return, both to the Royal Festival Hall and the sonatas of Beethoven, in which he was always respected. It is in the classical repertoire that Kovacevich has mainly won his laurels. But even among the noted classical pianists, he has a distinct personality. There is not the intellectual rigour that marked out Serkin, with his determination to shine a bright light of clarity over the music and throw every inner voice into relief. Nor does he have the determined rhythmic grip that marks out, say, Annie Fischer and others. For Kovacevich power and momentum fuse to provide the driving force. He played two sonatas in this programme, the 'Waldstein' and the A flat major, Op. 110, and both of them wanted to be fast and furious. It may be that the violent contrasts catch the Beethovenian spirit, though it was difficult to reconcile the hushed piano of Op. 110's Arioso, when it was followed moments later by the thundering entry of the fugue in the left hand. The 'Waldstein' was an exciting performance - at a price. Again the quieter passages were properly reflective. But once the momentum was up, the music hurtled forwards with little sense of there being the control to guide it. The thrill was undeniable, but this was a big-dipper performance that ended up throwing other musical virtues to the winds. The last climax before the end became a noisy, incoherent, headlong assault. In between, there was the solace of Schubert. Two late collections, the Moments musicaux, D780, and 12 Landler, D790, offered playing of genuine subtlety, the inimitable Schubertian harmonies sensitively touched upon, the colours delicately varied: another Kovacevich altogether. Played like this, these supposedly simple pieces seem to take on almost the richness of the Chopin Mazurkas.</p>

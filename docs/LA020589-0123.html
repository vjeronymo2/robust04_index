			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONSMOKERS SPEAK OUT  </P> <P> Thank you for Sharon Dirlam's article, "A Nightmare Flight Leaves Nonsmokers  Fuming" (Jan. 15). I could relate some other horror stories concerning groups.  I have "no smoking" coaches on my tours, so I seldom have smokers on the trips.  Also, I always book 28 no-smoking seats with the airlines when I plan the  tours.  </P> <P> However, on departure I have had many passengers placed in the smoking section.  I no longer book the two air carriers that have let me down, and I let them  know why. Airlines of other nations are the worst. I'll keep letting airlines  know why I no longer book them for groups. Maybe we'll prevail.  </P> <P> JANE E. HILLSEN  </P> <P> Travel Today,  </P> <P> Reminisce Tomorrow  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

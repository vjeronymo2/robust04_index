			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Credit Suisse in plan to sell up to 20% of shares UP TO 20 per cent of the shares of Credit Suisse, Switzerland's third-biggest bank, may be sold to the public as part of a wide-ranging capital-raising exercise by CS Holding, its parent company. Mr Rainer Gut, CS Holding's chairman, announced the move at the same time as revealing a fall of 78 per cent in consolidated earnings to SFr192m (Dollars 129.7m) for 1990. CSH also revealed a Dollars 587m loss last year by its investment banking subsidiary CS First Boston, into which it had to inject new capital after the US operations were caught with a Dollars 1bn exposure in doubtful bridge loans. CSH owns more than 99 per cent of Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank's shares were converted into CSH stock when the group adopted a holding company structure in 1989. This structure has since been challenged by the Federal Banking Commission. Analysts had expected an increase in CSH's capitalisation. However, the re-opening of Credit Suisse stock to the public - which would mean a relisting of the bank's shares - appeared to be a bold reaction, typical of CSH's forceful chairman. Mr Gut said the size, timing and pricing of a Credit Suisse share offer would depend on market conditions. Shareholders will be offered a bonus option. Under this, 20 options from registered or bearer shares will carry an entitlement to subscribe to one registered or bearer share. The terms will be announced before the annual meeting on May 22. CSH is also considering placing subordinated loans up to the 25 per cent limit allowed by Swiss banking law. The loans would be offered to foreign investors, Mr Gut said. CSH parent company net profit for the year ending March 31 fell by SFr135m, or 29 per cent, to SFr324m. The board proposes to reduce the shareholders' dividend from SFr110 to SFr75 per bearer share and from SFr22 to SFr15 per registered share. CSH's 1990 performance was determined by what Mr Peter Kupfer, executive board member, called CS First Boston's 'catastrophic' year and the 31 per cent slide in net earnings and dividend cut at Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank provides more than 80 per cent of the parent company's dividend income. CS First Boston, Page 23 Lex, Page 18</p>

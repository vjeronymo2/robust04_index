			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Postal union faces structural shake-up THE Union of Communication Workers, the main postal union, risks the loss of recognition and financial collapse unless it can reach internal agreement over a complete overhaul of its structure and industrial relations strategy next week. More than 2,000 union officials will have, in effect, to vote themselves out of jobs if the union is to survive, Mr Alan Tuffin, the UCW general secretary, will tell a four-day special conference next week. The changes will practically decimate the union's current local structure, reducing the number of branches from about 700 to 80. The proposed reforms are closely linked to changes in industrial relations agreements being demanded by Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, which are due to be in place by April. Royal Mail is reducing its headquarters staff from 2,000 to 140 and devolving responsibility to nine new divisions. Overall, 3,500 management and administrative jobs will go. Also, the reporting lines will be shorter: the number of management layers between the managing director and delivery workers will be cut from nine to six, says management. The UCW's structure currently reflects Royal Mail's and is based on 64 districts. Management has made it clear that from April it will refuse to negotiate with union officials who do not relate directly to the new divisions. The union is heavily financially dependent on the Post Office: it is estimated that management currently provides annually Pounds 7m to Pounds 10m worth of time off for officials to carry out union business. This is seen by management as a high price to pay for the representation of about 120,000 UCW members in Royal Mail. Total subscription income to the UCW totals about Pounds 8m, so the union would be unable to finance independently the existing branch structure. Mr Tuffin will tell the conference that the union has little choice about accepting Royal Mail's ultimatum and he will commend the new industrial relations agreement as having many positive features. A new national joint consultative council, for example, will be set up which will entitle the UCW to discuss Royal Mail's business plans with management.</p>

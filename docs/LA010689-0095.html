			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR: THE RACE IS ON;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS  </P> <P> JOHN K. VAN DE KAMP -- California's two-term attorney general and front-runner  of the Democratic Establishment, Van de Kamp, 52, decided long before  Deukmejian's decision to seek the governorship next election no matter who the  GOP candidate was. He already has a blue-ribbon campaign staff. The namesake of  the Los Angeles bakery family and resident of Pasadena, Van de Kamp was  previously Los Angeles County district attorney, first appointed in 1975 and  serving until 1982. A philosophical moderate, he is viewed as strong where  Democrats have been weak -- on crime. On the other hand, he has a reputation as  a lackluster campaigner.  </P> <P> GRAY DAVIS -- A relentless fund-raiser and cagey tactician, state Controller  Davis, 46, has eyed the governorship for most of his adult life. He worked his  way up from being an assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley to chief of  staff to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., 1974-81, to a state assemblyman from  the Westside of Los Angeles, 1982-86, and controller. He has to decide if this  is the time to risk his office. A liberal with an image as a "new breed"  Democrat, Davis is media-wise and energetic. Some find him too much so, and say  that for all his political ambition, he lacks a driving policy agenda.  </P> <P> DIANNE FEINSTEIN -- In the regional politics of California, Feinstein, 55, can  claim a strong base in the Bay Area. She served two terms as mayor of San  Francisco, from November, 1978, when incumbent George Moscone was assassinated,  through 1988. Before that, she served nine years as a San Francisco County  supervisor and twice was defeated for mayor. Her mayoralty brought growth to  San Francisco and she was mentioned as Walter F. Mondale's second choice for a  vice presidential running mate in 1984. She is attractive and skilled on  television, but even her strongest backers question whether she has the "fire  in the belly."  </P> <P> LEO T. McCARTHY -- California's lieutenant governor just lost a statewide race  for the U.S. Senate last year. But the governorship has been a burning ambition  of his all along, and some think defeat did not douse all of his drive. At 58,  he is strong in his hometown of San Francisco -- where his base rivals  Feinstein's -- and worked hard trying to become known and organized in Southern  California. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1982 and again in 1986.  Before that he served in the state Assembly from 1968 through 1982, including  six years as Assembly Speaker. He is a lifelong liberal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> REPUBLICANS  </P> <P> PETE WILSON -- At 55, Wilson suddenly is unrivaled as tomorrow's leader of the  California GOP. Just elected to his second term in the U.S. Senate, this  seasoned but cautious politician is now being asked by some desperate party  leaders to look west again and help the GOP keep the Statehouse. In fact, being  governor was Wilson's first ambition. He ran and lost in the 1978 GOP primary.  He ran again in 1982, but party leaders, ironically, urged him to seek the  Senate. He is a former mayor and state assemblyman from San Diego.  </P> <P> DAN LUNGREN -- It is a measure of the GOP's weak "bench" that Lungren, 42,  would be considered in the first-rank of gubernatorial contenders. A  conservative, he was elected to Congress from Long Beach in 1978 and served  through last year. Gov. Deukmejian appointed him state treasurer but he was  rejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate in February, 1988, a decision  upheld by the state Supreme Court. Since then he has been taking stock of his  options.  </P> <P> DARYL F. GATES -- A career policeman, Gates, 62, joined the LAPD in 1949. He  was made assistant chief in 1969 and chief in 1978. Late last year, he said he  would be interested in running if Deukmejian decided not to seek reelection. He  is one of the party's more colorful characters, is close to President-elect  Bush and has been mentioned lately as a possible pick for drug czar in the Bush  Administration.  </P> <P> PETER UEBERROTH -- At 51, the retiring commissioner of baseball is standoffish  but has done nothing to quell speculation about his political ambitions. He is  the hands-down favorite of those who think only a celebrity candidate can save  the GOP in Sacramento. A registered Republican, little is known of Ueberroth's  political views. He has been commissioner of baseball since 1984 and was Time  magazine's Man of the Year in 1984. He ran the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing  Committee before that, proving that the Games can be run at a profit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> NOT RUNNING, BUT . . .  </P> <P> KEN MADDY -- This 54-year-old Fresno-based politician is handsome and affable,  and some think his announcement that he will not run for governor could be  turned around with some coaxing. He is Republican leader of the state Senate.  He was first elected to the Legislature in 1970, serving first in the Assembly,  and then won a special election to the Senate in 1979. He ran for governor in  1978 and lost in the primary. He has a strong base in agribusiness and family  wealth which could prove a big asset under California's newly tightened  campaign finance laws. He has a reputation as a moderate.  </P></p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Markets: The bill comes in for the free lunch - Global Investor If you believe the proponents of modern portfolio theory, international diversification offers the nearest thing in the investment world to a free lunch. For those who do not have an already fully diversified fund, raising the proportion of overseas assets is supposed either to lower risk at no sacrifice of return; or to raise expected returns for a given degree of risk. That is, in the American argot, a win-win situation. Yet for professional fund managers who have bought this theoretical package the phrase seems an odd description for events in 1994. The essence of the diversification argument lies in the notion that price movements in foreign markets are not closely correlated to price movements at home. Yet in practice world bond markets have been relatively closely correlated for many years. And the bond market fall-out earlier this year was synchronised to an extraordinary degree. By now a more divergent pattern of behaviour has emerged. But if part of the point of buying foreign bonds was to escape a dramatic market shock at home, then the strategy was not much use in the first half of 1994. As for equity markets, they are already very integrated in the developed world, if not quite to the same extent as bonds, and show fairly high correlation coefficients despite cyclical divergence in the underlying economies. It has always seemed plausible that emerging markets offer the best form of diversification. Their economies are furthest out of synchronisation with those in the OECD area. The first of the attached charts, showing the movement of Latin American and Asian equity market indices against a world index, appears to support that view. If there was any correlation with the OECD economies in the first half of the year it was with bonds rather than equities, no doubt reflecting the use of borrowed money. Since then emerging markets have recovered to earlier levels. A more hard nosed interpretation might be that it simply demonstrates a fad. US fund managers caught the diversification bug last year, just as investors generally were waking up to the potential for high returns in Asia and Latin America. So the diversification argument became self-fulfilling after a long period in which emerging markets had seen their correlations with equity markets in the developed world increase. Another striking feature of the chart is how closely correlated Asia and Latin America seem to be, despite widely divergent economic circumstances. While diversification is available generally in emerging markets, there is not much benefit to be had by spreading the investment between different regions. The overall message is that it is increasingly difficult to obtain worthwhile diversification. Nor is the pay-off very obvious. Over the 10 years to end-1993 UK domestic equities showed an average return of 18.8 per cent compared with only 15.2 per cent on international equities in sterling terms. And of the 18 countries covered in UBS's Global Pension Fund Indicators, 10 showed better domestic equity returns than international equity returns in local currency terms. British fund managers with a high overseas content could argue that the lower return was amply justified by the reduction in risk provided by diversification, and that international equities may well do better in future years. The latter point is convincing if you believe that the UK stock market's extraordinary capacity to grow faster than UK output and incomes is unsustainable. But in the light of the growing integration of markets, was the risk reduction really so great? The short answer is that it must still be worth having, in order to insure against country-specific shocks. The proportion of Hong Kong pension fund assets in overseas equities and bonds is an astonishingly high 60 per cent. Yet it is hard to argue with that strategy given the political cloud that hangs over this highly dynamic economy. What, then, of the merits of property as a vehicle for diversification? The second chart confirms that property shares are more closely correlated to the equity market than to property itself. Direct property, meantime, has offered useful diversification against the bond market shake-out. On the international front property is clearly no worse than equities or bonds in providing cross-border insurance. And property markets have the huge advantage of being much less integrated. Forms of tenure, lease terms and patterns of ownership vary enormously from country to country. It follows that property should be able to provide far more diversification benefit than securities. But even here there are caveats. AMF Pension, the Swedish insurer and pensions group, with help from agents Jones Lang Wootton, recently looked at more than a decade of returns on prime offices in the main European property markets. According to Tor Perry Marthin, senior vice president and chief investment officer, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Brussels moved in lockstep, while Paris was only marginally less closely correlated. So three out of the four continental European centres could offer no additional worthwhile diversification benefits. Only London was out on its own. Note, too, that theoretical discussion about diversification tends to ignore the real world problem of liquidity, which is important in property - although not as important for immature pension funds as for other investors. It is possible that this year's events in the markets will reduce the appeal of diversification for the more practically minded fund managers. And if US institutions conclude that they have much less need for insurance against country-specific shocks in their vast continental economy, the pattern of global capital flows could look very different next year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 20/10/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  % change over period                        US    Japan    Germany    France    Italy    UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week                 0.09     0.04      0.09      0.10      0.16   0.10 Month                0.41     0.21      0.42      0.45      0.69   0.45 Year                 3.44     2.38      5.75      6.06      8.25   5.38  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                -0.40     0.36      0.25     -0.17      0.28  -0.19 Month               -0.51    -0.35      1.43      1.01      1.47   1.94 Year                -3.24     0.06      1.47     -0.25      0.17  -0.01  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                -0.82     0.44      0.10     -0.75     -0.07  -0.32 Month               -0.93    -0.58      2.55      1.33      1.33   3.01 Year                -8.59    -1.52     -3.31     -7.07     -7.07  -3.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                 -0.1     -1.2      -0.6      -3.9      -3.2   -3.2 Month                 1.1      0.7      -0.7       2.8      -7.6   -7.6 Year                  3.2     -2.3       0.2      -7.9       6.9    6.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

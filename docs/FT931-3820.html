			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Arts: Question of attribution - Off the Wall HAVE THE sackings in the London auction salerooms, which have claimed some well respected experts, combined with intense pressure on specialist departments to hit profit targets, had a debilitating effect on the veracity of the auction rooms' catalogues? In the current recession fewer good items are being put up for auction, but dealers complain that not only has there been a substantial falling off in quality in recent months, but also in the accuracy of the catalogue descriptions. In pictures, the main complaint is that the actual canvas can bear little relation to its glossy photograph in the catalogue: anyone foolish enough to bid without viewing the lot could be disappointed with their purchase. But generally, catalogue entries on paintings, especially expensive paintings, are almost overburdened with information. The problem lies in sectors where time causes wear and tear to antiques and the restorer has been active - notably ceramics and furniture. One recent sale in particular, of furniture at Sotheby's in February, has caused a great deal of concern among dealers, many of whom felt that some lots were not all that they were made out to be. Dealers are in an invidious position. They are both the great rivals of the salerooms and also their best customers. Many of the doubtful lots will at some time have passed through the hands of dealers and carry their attributions. Dealers also make their biggest profits when their expertise enables them to snap up poorly catalogued treasures. But they also worry that if a private collector buys a wrongly attributed antique the whole business suffers in the long run. Furniture dealers are never likely to agree with all the catalogue entries but in this auction the criticisms were vociferous. 'Surely those 18th century wall lights are modern?' 'That Queen Anne armchair has new legs. They are described as 'good' but if they are they justify an estimate of Pounds 10,000, not Pounds 5,000'. 'Those 18th century armchairs have modern needlework'. 'These 18th century pier glasses have 20th century carving'. One particular lot caused a great deal of concern. A pair of parcel gilt window seats, which sold for Pounds 30,000, was reckoned to be modern. And so it went on. (Sotheby's disputes the fact that it is cutting any corners. Furniture expert Charles Walford had re-examined the above mentioned pieces when making condition reports and 'saw no reason to doubt them whatsoever'.) Many of these opinions might be debatable but there was enough consensus for the dealers to be taken seriously. They do not blame the cataloguers. They attribute any solecisms to the extra workload caused by the staff cuts at the auction houses, and the pressure to make every item seem attractive, an impossible task when only the most desperate owners will dispose of decent objects in the current depressed market. One prominent dealer described a catalogue as 'just a load of lot numbers.' Now that the salerooms frequently sell direct to the private collector they must make sure that, in difficult times, they do not sacrifice accuracy in the pressure to achieve turnover targets. Last year a half of all the West End's box office money came from just ten long running modern musicals. In 1993 it should be even higher with the successful launch of Crazy for You, and with City of Angels and Sunset Boulevard to come. The public's appetite to forget its troubles with escapist nostalgia knows no bounds. In the two days after it opened last week Crazy for You took almost Pounds 300,000 at the box office, a record for producer Michael White. But then Crazy for You is a big show in every way. It re-opened the Prince Edward Theatre, refurbished at a cost of Pounds 3m, and it cost another Pounds 3m to put on. The money comes from Roger Horchow, and his friends. Horchow is an American mail order magnate who sold out to General Cinema for Dollars 117m - which allows him to indulge his passion for the music of the Gershwins. It is proving a profitable passion: he is recouping handsomely on the Broadway production, and, despite weekly running costs of Pounds 150,000, the exuberant West End show, with its old fashioned values in terms of costumes, chorus girls and ritzy song and dance numbers, should hit the spot with the middle aged, the middle class, indeed middle England generally  -traditional theatre goers who in recent years have been starved of product. So farewell, then, the Arts Council of Great Britain, Lord Keynes' idealistic post-War creation which was to usher in the Brave New World. In an almost unrecorded move the government's lukewarm sop to Scottish nationalism this week deposited the ACGB to the dustbin. Now Scotland and Wales will have their own independent Arts Councils and there will be an English Arts Council operating in London. An Act of Parliament will be needed to make the changes official. It all seems very messy. The Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales will hand over the annual subsidy to the Councils but the actual sum, in theory, will still be negotiated from the Treasury by Peter Brooke, the Heritage Secretary. As things stand at the moment the projections are that the grants for the next two years will represent real cuts in funding. Surely the Scots and the Welsh will not stand for this at the start of a new regime. The arts in Scotland and Wales could gain from the inevitable politicking. Just before the election last year the Scottish Office somehow found Pounds 500,000 to help Scottish Opera out of a financial embarrassment. Welsh National Opera also received a sizeable hand out from the Welsh Minister. Local pressures could mean that the main arts organisations in the two countries will do well out of the new arrangements by playing one Minister off against the other while the English Arts Council may become a poor relation.</p>

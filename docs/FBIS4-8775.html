			<p>BFN     [Text] [Anchor-man Henri Masure] Lieutenant-Colonel Pernod,  UNPROFOR spokesman is live with us from Sarajevo. Good evening.    [Pernod] Good evening.    [Masure] Correspondent Francois Cornet repeated a moment ago  that there are 336 UN soldiers belonging to the intervention  force who are now ready to go to Gorazde. Why are they not  going there?    [Pernod] Actually, I believe that things are quite simple.  We do have a detachment from the Sarajevo sector which is to go  to Gorazde. We are awaiting the order for their departure.  This order will come only when the negotiations under way are  over, and I believe that, for the moment, we are ready and  waiting. Negotiations are under way and I believe that it will  add to the confusion if I gave information that may not be  accurate.    [Masure] Are 336 men sufficient when we know how strong the  forces in Gorazde are? There is talk of 7,000 Serb fighters.    [Pernod] Listen, anyway, this detachment has been put  together. We decided that it was amply sufficient to carry out  the mission that was set at the beginning. It was created to  carry out a mission of intervention and, for the time being, the  command has decided that it was enough, given the elements we  have.    [Masure] You are in Sarajevo yourself. UN soldiers have been  the victims of a whole series of provocations on the part of the  Serbs recently. Several dozen of them were held, if I may put  it this way. Is there any sign of detente this evening in your  difficult relations with the Bosnian Serbs?    [Pernod] If you like, tension has indeed stepped up  dramatically since the air strikes last Sunday and Monday. As  you know -- and it has been said -- some places where weapons  are being kept were closed. Our traffic was subjected to major  hindrances. I can tell you, for example, that this tension has  decreased dramatically today. For instance, the various points  for the collection of weapons were resupplied with vehicles by  road today. As you can see, things are much less tense. I think  that the situation is less tense because, on the one hand, we  did not respond to the provocations made on the Serb side, and  this is mainly thanks to the professional approach and the  sang-froid of the people on the ground who are behaving in an  exemplary manner.    [Masure] Thank you very much, Lieutenant Colonel Pernod,  speaking live to us from Sarajevo.</p>

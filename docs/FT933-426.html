			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Accounting for 'green' efforts  -Ian Rodger scrutinises Ciba's new environmental report Big companies, especially big chemical companies, are constantly searching for new ways to allay deep-seated public suspicions about the damage their operations do to the environment. Most now devote large sections of their annual report and accounts to descriptions of their environmental protection activities in addition to other published brochures and data. Ciba, the huge Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, is well known for its efforts in this sensitive area. It has just gone a step further, publishing what it calls a 'Corporate Environmental Report 1992'. Clearly modelled on the typical annual financial report, the 28-page glossy brochure provides a combination of statements of policy from the chairman and chief executive, detailed descriptions of progress achieved during the past year and several pages of statistical data with helpful explanations of their meaning. The report will be published regularly, and possibly annually like the group's financial report, although Ciba says only that 'it will be updated regularly'. It is published in German and English, is well written and illustrated, and will undoubtedly be useful as a handout to concerned shareholders, employees and various interested groups in the communities where Ciba has operations. The first section of the report, setting out Ciba's environmental policies, is particularly clear and the group's goal, sustainable development, is particularly well explained. 'We must help meet the needs of today without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,' Ciba says. On the whole, however, the report is less than satisfying. The items in the descriptive section, perhaps necessarily, are repetitive variations on a theme. One describes how Ciba has improved its use of resources in Argentina, another how it virtually eliminated waste water at Toms River, New Jersey, another how it developed a new process to recover waste at a chemical plant in Spain, and so on. The result is a report with a slightly surreal 1950s optimism - everything is getting better and better every day in every way. Ciba's editors may have sensed this. A section entitled 'Incidents' describes soberly the group's two plant accidents that occurred last year, one at Grimsby in the UK and one at Schweizerhalle in Switzerland, and explains their causes and effects. There is also a startlingly punchy question and answer section with the group's environmental directors. Sample question: 'Ciba had to pay Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.8m) in fines and penalties in the US for violations of waste disposal regulations at your Toms River site in New Jersey. How does this accord with your commitment towards complying with the law?' The answer regrettably was much less punchy than the question. The statistical section likewise has a slightly off-beat quality. Unlike corporate financial reports, where one is accustomed to viewing charts where the bars march confidently upward to the right, here we are invited to take some comfort from seeing the charts all march smartly downwards. Water and CFC usage, emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide emissions, discharges into the river Rhine - have all declined over the past three years. A few indicators are still rising, such as energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions, and the explanations provided point to an inevitable paradox in the group's efforts to lessen environmental impacts of industrial activity. 'The rise in carbon dioxide emissions is mainly due to our growing use of waste to produce energy through our own incinerators . . . A further reason is the increased energy requirements of air pollution control equipment.'</p>

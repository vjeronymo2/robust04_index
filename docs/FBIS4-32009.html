			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/6/1994 -- Romanian-Chinese  consultations at deputy minister level ended in Bucharest on 16  June. The two delegations, headed by Qin Huasun, deputy foreign  minister, and Ion Gorita, secretary of state, approached matters  of multilateral diplomacy and especially problems on the UN  agenda.    The visit to be paid here at the beginning of July by Li  Peng, president of the Council of State of the People's Republic  of China, the first at this level after 1990 paid by a Chinese  official to Central and Eastern Europe, was also discussed by  the two deputy ministers.    Regarding the multilateral diplomacy, the two delegations  referred to such topics as the UN's reform and restructuring,  especially concerning the Security Council, the peace-keeping  operations, regional conflicts, with stress on developments in  ex-Yugoslavia, human rights, and disarmament. Both parties  expressed their "concern" in connection with the recent  developments in the Korean peninsula and stressed that what was  needed was "a political settlement negotiated among all parties  concerned."    The representatives of the Chinese and Romanian foreign  ministers noted pursuant to the consultations the existence of  an "identity" of standpoints between the two countries  concerning the major issues of concern to the UN. It was agreed  that, based on the fine relations of cooperation, such kind of  consultations should be continued, in view of establishing  common modalities of action for the future UN session (September  1994.)</p>

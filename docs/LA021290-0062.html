			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> BELL LABS CONFIRM QUASI-CRYSTAL  </P> <P> Scientists peering at atomic structures through a super-powerful microscope  have taken the first clear look at the quasi-crystal. AT&amp;T's Bell  Laboratories said last week their research shows that quasi-crystals have an  arrangement of atoms with multi-faceted symmetry, which many scientists doubted  could happen.  </P> <P> Scientists said X-rays and other techniques had pretty much proven the  existence of quasi-crystals, but Bell Labs' research showed them with unmatched  clarity.  </P> <P> Bell Labs provided the first surface glimpse of a quasi-crystal, helping refute  arguments that previous manifestations were a quirk of nature, said Lionel  Kimmerling, director of Bell Labs' materials interface research department in  Murray Hill.  </P> <P> Bell Labs used a scanning-tunneling microscope, which is exact enough to probe  individual atoms. Researchers cut atoms on a plane and used the microscope to  sweep a fine-tipped probe over the surface. The image of each atom was then  projected on a TV screen.  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Post Office urges stock market sale of minority shareholding The management of the Post Office is pressing for a stock market flotation through the public offer of a minority shareholding in an attempt to dissuade the government from shelving privatisation as politically unacceptable. The suggested scheme - the sale of a 30-40 per cent stake - is known as the 'BP option', so-called because British Petrolem was government-controlled but publicly quoted for most of this century before being sold off in the late 1980s. Under Treasury rules, it was allowed to act as a private company throughout. Using this model, it is argued, would maintain the government's responsibility for the Post Office's operations, reassuring the public about the level of service. It would also give the Post Office the freedom to borrow without adding to the government's budget deficit. Privatisation is opposed by a number of backbench Tory MPs, who are worried about the possible closure of village post offices and the withdrawal of postal services to remote areas. In an effort to placate them, the scheme proposes legislation stating that before selling any further shares in the Post Office, the government would have to seek permission from parliament. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has said he believes there is a strong economic case for privatisation. He is thought to favour the sale of the Royal Mail together with the lossmaking Parcelforce, while leaving the more politically sensitive Post Office Counters within the public sector. However, the Post Office fears that the whole project may be abandoned as too politically sensitive. While the Post Office continues to press for commercial freedom, it claims to have no preference for how it is obtained. Mr Bill Cockburn, managing director, said: 'It doesn't really matter which route is taken, provided it's a means to an end. If the government decides to separate the businesses, the Post Office will work with the government to make that successful.' This would be equally true if the BP option were applied to the Royal Mail alone, he said. 'The worst option is for the government to do nothing.'</p>

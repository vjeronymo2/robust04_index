			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Skopje, Feb 23 (AFP) -- A European Union delegation  headed by Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van der Broek arrived here  Wednesday to mediate a dispute sparked after Greece slapped a  trade blockade on Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM].    Van der Broek was to meet with Macedonian President Kiro  Gligorov before heading to Athens where he was to try to  persuade Greek officials to lift their eight-day blockade  against the former Yugoslav republic.    Greece's partners in the 12-member European Union have  threatened to take Athens before the European Court of Justice  unless the dispute is resolved.    Athens announced on February 16 that it was blocking all  trade to Macedonia through the northeastern Greek port of  Salonika, which handles most of the country's imports including  oil.    Greece justified the move by citing Macedonia's "continual  provocations and growing irredentist intransigence" and claims  that Macedonia has territorial ambitions in the northern Greek  province of the same name.    Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias said Wednesday that  Athens wishes to have good relations with Macedonia but the  latter must accept the "logical" demands made by the Greek  Government.</p>

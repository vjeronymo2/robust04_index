			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Damascus Stresses Importance of </F> Coordination `To Prevent Infiltration Harmful to All'"]    [Text] Damascus -- Syria yesterday stressed the importance  of coordination and consultation among the Arab parties involved  in the peace process in order to prevent any Israeli  infiltration [ikhtiraq] "harmful to all." It pointed out that  Resolution 904 opens the door to the resumption of bilateral  negotiations.    Syrian sources said that the Security Council resolution  "has  provided a new opportunity to resume the peace  negotiations...and will prevent a repetition of the ugly crimes  committed by settlers against Palestinian citizens with support  from the Israeli Army." The sources added that "the strong  condemnation" contained in Resolution 904 "is bound to open the  door to the resumption of the negotiations, but in isolation  from Israel's maneuvers, which nearly managed to undermine the  foundations on whose basis the peace process was launched."    The sources said that Syria's eagerness to rid the peace  process of the effects of the Hebron massacre caused Syria to  respond to the U.S. Administration's efforts, "as represented in  the telephone calls President Hafiz al-Asad received from  President Clinton, because Syria expressed every interest in  giving the peace process every impetus that is bound to make it  a success and achieve its desired aims."    The sources added that Damascus's eagerness prompted it to  invite the Arab parties to hold a coordination meeting next  April to agree on resuming the negotiations. But they stressed  that "it is not important for the negotiations to begin today or  tomorrow. The important thing is Israel's compliance with the  need to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy so  that a just and comprehensive peace can be achieved."    After revealing that Syria has invited the parties concerned  to meet in Damascus, the sources said that Syria "did that  because of its absolute belief in joint Arab action and because  of its awareness that the coordination issue and commitment to  this issue mean denying Israel any opportunity to try to achieve  another infiltration along the lines of the Oslo agreement."</p>

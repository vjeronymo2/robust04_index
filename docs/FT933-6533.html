			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Legacy of debt for new Nigeria ruler GENERAL Ibrahim Babangida yesterday stepped down as Nigeria's military ruler and installed a non-elected administration of civilians and soldiers, in which the military is expected to retain an upper hand. It remains unclear, however, what role, if any, will be played by the man who seized power in 1985 and has since postponed the handover to civilian government on three occasions. Chief Ernest Shonekan, head of the outgoing administration which served under Gen Babangida, was named as Nigeria's head of government. However, the composition of the new administration remained uncertain, although civilians are expected to outnumber the soldiers. In a televised speech last night, Gen Babangida said: 'I believe the time has come for me, my service chiefs, deputy chief of defence staff and inspector general of police to give way to a new set of leadership to propel our march towards lasting civilian democratic governance at all levels of our country.' He urged Nigerians to give the interim government a chance to finish the transition to civilian rule. The new administration's length of tenure has not been announced. Gen Sani Abacha will continue to hold his post of defence minister in addition to the new post of vice-president. Gen Abacha played a pivotal role in pressuring Gen Babangida to quit office. Several members of the outgoing Transitional Council, appointed by Gen Babangida eight months ago to oversee the transition to civilian rule, are expected to stay on in new jobs. Mr Aminu Saleh, former industry minister, becomes finance minister. Mr Matthew Mbu remains foreign secretary, and Mr Clement Apango attorney general. New faces are likely to include Mr Don Etiebet in the strategic post of petroleum minister, and Mr Sam Aluko, an economist, as the minister for national planning. Gen Babangida leaves behind a bankrupt legacy. During his eight-year rule, Nigerians saw their country drop out of the club of middle-income countries to join the mass of impoverished nations. Per capita income has fallen from Dollars 1,000 in 1980 to under Dollars 300 (Pounds 203). The naira, once worth more than the dollar, is now worth only a few cents. Nigeria owes around Dollars 34bn to foreign creditors, including arrears. 'At least Babangida destroyed one myth for us: that civilians are more corrupt and inefficient than the military,' a businessman in Lagos said. The apparent winner of an election in June subsequently annulled by Gen Babangida, publisher Moshood KO Abiola, said in London yesterday he would return to Nigeria next week claim his mandate. 'I will go to Nigeria as soon as the dust settles and as soon as it is safe to do so,' he said. 'I am still waiting to give my oath of office. I will soon be president. The government will soon go home.'</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (Regional reports) (13): Long bonds and cash are recommended for Europe Europe was not a happy home for investors' money in the second quarter of 1994. Measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the continent's equity markets fell by 6 per cent in local currency terms in the three months to June 30. The writing was on the wall three months ago. Among other professionals, Mr Bert Jansen, of Paribas Capital Markets, said then that weakness in global bond markets would hit continental equities, regardless of growing evidence of economic recovery. He said, too, that European equities were overvalued in absolute, and in relative, terms. Country by country, the worst performer in the second quarter was France, down 9.3 per cent. With the weakening dollar adding to its woes, the Paris market was depressed by higher interest rates and rising raw-material prices. Over the quarter, too, the weight of new equity issues, threatening the sated institutional investor, was perceived earlier than in neighbouring countries. At the level of individual companies, arguments about investment in cyclical, or defensive stocks, with markets in general going down, carried less weight than they had in the first quarter. Among the constituents of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, Daimler Benz and Deutsche Bank, two of Germany's biggest blue chips, did almost equally badly in the second quarter of 1994, falling by 13.5 and by 14.5 per cent respectively. The automotive, engineering and defence combine was depressed by an upcoming DM3bn rights issue; and the senior bank was weighed down by its exposure to debt markets, property scandals and other corporate debacles, and by talk of management changes. However, some of the front-line cyclicals, which showed up well in the first three months of this year, continued to outperform in the second quarter. The restructured industrial conglomerate Montedison nearly topped the Eurotrack 100 performance charts with a rise of 10.2 per cent in local currency terms over three months, after coming a resounding first over six months with a gain of more than 68 per cent, extending its recovery from a low base. In the automotive sector, Fiat came first and Volvo fourth, with gains of 14 and 9.8 per cent respectively. The extremes of performance tie in with observations by Mr Peter J. Sullivan, an assistant vice-president with Merrill Lynch in London. He detects a clear conflict between the greater than expected economic strength, indicated by high-yielding bond markets and a weak dollar, and the forces that they set up to dampen the cyclical recovery. Merrill Lynch has moderated its aggressive cyclical stance without abandoning it: increasing its recommended weighting in utilities and modestly reducing its commitment to Germany, which is very much based on a strong cyclical recovery. That, of course, is advice for institutional investors. Some of them, unfortunately, are forced by trust deeds or their own trustees to be fully invested. For private investors, strategists are recommending higher holdings of cash and, given high bond yields and low inflation, up to twice as much weighting in long-term bonds as in equities at the moment. It is not all gloom for ordinary shares. Most economic growth forecasts on the continent have been revised upwards during the second quarter - except Italy - while inflation forecasts have been revised down. In that connection, however, there are worries about commodity-based stocks, strong recently on economic recovery prospects and on booming commodity prices - Elf Aquitaine and Total, the French oil companies, and Union Miniere of Belgium figured high in the Eurotrack second quarter charts. The longer that bond yields stay at their present high level, goes the argument, the more there will be questions about growth prospects. Also, commodity-based stocks are the current favourite of hedge funds, which pulled out of European bonds, with serious damage to the latter, from last January onwards.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Daniel Kunstat: "The Czech Republic Army and </F> NATO"]    [Text] The rapprochement process and the future  incorporation of the postcommunist countries of Central and East  Europe into the North Atlantic Alliance has had two fundamental  aspects since the very beginning. The absolute prerogative was  and undoubtedly is the willingness (or unwillingness) of the  Alliance itself to make a strategic decision and intrinsically  alter the geopolitical constellation in the zone between Germany  and Russia. The recently approved Partnership for Peace plan,  however, diverts attention, to a certain extent, to the "other  end of the court" inasmuch as the possible admission of the  individual aspirants for NATO membership is conditional upon the  quality and speed of their domestic reforms and upon stable  development in the economic, political, and military spheres.    The first practical steps within the framework of the  Partnership plan should be joint military exercises between the  armed forces of the Visegrad Four countries and NATO, while the  interested parties will have their own permanent representatives  in the Alliance's Brussels headquarters. The coming months will  indeed be a testing time for the "converging" Visegrad Four  states,because the phase of noncommittal political declarations  on their readiness "to share in the joint aims and values" will  be replaced by practical experience, which will establish the  potential for effective military cooperation. In this  connection, it is impossible not to ask if our Army is ready for  close cooperation with the NATO Command.    It is no use disguising the fact that the current Czech Army  is, for all sorts of reasons, the element of political authority  least affected by the post-November changes and that even the  various "screenings" have not done much to alter this sad fact.  It comes as no surprise that it is a, so to speak, superhuman  task for Defense Minister Baudys to find at least 30 young  officers with the appropriate education and linguistic ability  capable of acting as our representatives in the Alliance's  Command and individual committees. The fact that, since 1989,  some 170 Czech soldiers have undergone training in the West (at  the state's expense, of course) and that many of them are now in  better-paid positions in the private sector completes this  paradoxical situation. The greatest shortcoming in the  qualifications of the Czech Army's Command Corps is not so much  their "technical" expertise but their absolute lack of world  languages. This is despite the fact that two-thirds of the some  25,000 officers are university graduates. Unfortunately, it is  impossible to tell today how many soldiers studied in the former  Soviet Union because the Defense Ministry's Personnel Department  does not keep such records. It is certain that, for example,  the current chief of the General Staff was a very diligent  student; this is even borne out by his endeavor at two colleges  in the very womb of the camp of peace and socialism. Jiri  Nekvasil is obviously the right man for the job and is indeed a  suitable partner for his "western" colleagues (a mixture of  former West Point students).    The Czech Army is currently going through a very demanding  and painful structural reorganization process, and the number of  men at arms should be reduced from 100,000 to 65,000 within two  years. The fundamental transformation of the General Staff, the  creation of new logistics (that is, principles for financing the  troops), and the creation of completely new commands (for  example, the Tactical Air Force) are all planned in this first  phase. The concept also envisages the early formation of a  fully professional Rapid Deployment Brigade of 3,500 men, whose  equipment will be "compatible" with that of similar units in the  NATO forces. According to Baudys, this brigade, along with the  Czech UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] unit, should form the  basis for our participation in the Partnership for Peace plan  and, at the same time, act as a kind of precursor of the future  fully professional Army.    It is certainly not news to our political officials that the  equipment, structure of the forces, and, in view of its  personnel makeup, the Command Corps are not "compatible" with  the armed forces of NATO states. Compared with the other  parties interested in a spot beneath the security umbrella,  however, this handicap is, in essence, insignificant. After  all, the Czech Republic's integration into the Euro-Atlantic  security structures depends, first and foremost, on the  political decision of the Alliance itself.</p>

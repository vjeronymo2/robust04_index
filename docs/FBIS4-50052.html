			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Jianjun (0491 1696 6511): "The Inner </F> Mongolia Autonomous Regional Party Committee and Government  Cosponsored a Financial Work Forum"]    [Excerpts] On 25 April, the regional party committee and  government cosponsored a regional financial work forum to  analyze the regional financial situation and to study and work  out methods for resolving the current financial difficulties.    Present at the forum were regional leaders Bai Enpei, Liu  Zuohui, Song Zhimin, Shen Shuji, and Bao Wenfa; and leaders of  the regional departments concerned, all leagues and cities, and  some banner and county party and government departments. Bai  Enpei, Liu Zuohui, and Song Zhimin made important speeches at  the forum. The forum was chaired by Bai Enpei.    Along with the ceaseless deepening of reform and the rapid  development of the economy since the third plenary session of  the 11th party Central Committee, our region has registered big  increases in revenues with each passing year. The region's  revenues in 1980 was 413 million yuan; those in 1985, 1.136  billion yuan; those in 1888, 2.35 billion yuan; those in 1992,  3.91 billion yuan; and those in 1993 rapidly increased to 5.61  billion yuan. Song Zhimin pointed out in his speech: The  region's revenues continued to double for several times in the  past 10 years or so. Simultaneously, the region's economic and  social undertakings have developed at an increasingly faster  speed. Increasingly more financial resources have been spent to  develop economic and social undertakings. The input to the  construction of production projects and the development of  undertakings continues to increase with each passing year. The  number of personnel to be provided by the financial departments  increases at an excessively high speed. The income of staff and  workers and cadres increases with each passing year. The  financial burdens become heavier and heavier. Leagues, cities,  banners, and counties differ greatly in revenues. Meanwhile,  problems of collecting, managing, and using financial resources  exist in varying degrees among the financial departments at  various levels. All this helps enhance the contradictions  between the region's revenues and expenditures. The financial  difficulties, cropping up in the course of promoting the  economic construction, rapidly developing other undertakings,  and ceaselessly improving the people's livelihood, are temporary  difficulties in the course of advance and development. So long  as we persistently implement the line, principles, and policies  of the party will the financial difficulties certainly be  alleviated and eliminated in a step-by-step manner along with  the ceaseless deepening of reform and the sustained development  of the economy. [passage omitted]    At the time of collecting financial resources, the financial  departments at various levels should conscientiously manage both  budgetary funds and extrabudgetary funds. Under the leadership  of the governments at various levels, the financial departments  should further arrange, in a unified manner, available financial  resources and expenditures; and make arrangements for the use of  funds in the order of importance and urgency. We should first  ensure the payment of wages in accordance with the principle of  feeding the people primarily and building the country  secondarily and the principle of acting according to  capabilities; and arrange the expenses in other aspects  according to the principle of keeping expenditures within the  limits of income. We should strengthen and achieve the  distribution of financial funds, do our best to shorten the  capital turnover period, and ensure the timely distribution of  capital. The banks at various levels should support the rapid  distribution of financial funds, avoid the occurrence of the  phenomenon of keeping the capital that should be allocated, and  ensure the timely turnover of capital. The tax departments at  various levels should strengthen the management of tax revenues,  widely open tax resources, handle tax affairs persistently  according to laws, calculate taxes according to tax rates, and  collect and hand over to the state the taxes that should be  collected and handed over. The banking departments at various  levels should positively collect funds, try every possible means  to alleviate the strain on capital, and better support the  economic construction and the production of enterprises. The  governments at various levels should support the financial  departments to develop deposits, assimilate savings from  society, increase available funds, and enliven the existing  funds. [passage omitted]    Bai Enpei finally stressed: We should strengthen leadership,  rely on the masses, work arduously, and jointly overcome the  financial difficulties. The party committees and governments at  various levels should realistically strengthen the leadership  over the financial work, regularly conduct research, carefully  make arrangements, and timely solve various kinds of  difficulties.

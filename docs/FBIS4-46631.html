			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Guard Major Yuriy Sychov under the rubric "In </F> the National Guard of Ukraine": "Maximum Respect to the Young"]    [Text] The ranks of the National Guard are being  replenished with young personnel today. The youth from various  corners of Ukraine, who after the corresponding training will be  protecting the constitutional order and territorial integrity of  independent Ukraine along with their senior comrades, will be  protecting people against criminal infringements and protecting  their rights and freedom.    The main concern today is to provide the young soldiers with  suitable conditions for training and service. The discussion was  about that at the meetings of deputy commanders of the  formations and units, which discussed ways of increasing the  effectiveness of indoctrination and humanitarian training for  the young Guardsmen and expanding closer ties with the parents  of the soldiers as well as resolved a number of urgent issues.    The meetings were conducted by NHU Commander Guard  Lieutenant-General Volodymyr Kukharets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- A five-member North  Korean family, headed by Yo Man-chol, 48, who defected from  North Korea in mid-March, arrived here by air from Hong Kong  Saturday afternoon.    "We decided to flee because it was very hard to make a  living  there," said Yo upon arrival, "and we're very pleased to have  arrived in South Korea because our dream of defecting to the  South has now come true."    He said he had been a captain of the Public Security  Ministry  before he worked as a driver just before his defection.    On March 18, he and his family fled to China, crossing the  frozen Yalu River, and then moved to southern China by train.  "In China, we had much help from ethnic Koreans," he said. But  he declined to comment on where they visited in China and when,  where and how they got in touch with the South Korean Government.    Yo arrived with his family members, wife, Yi Ok-kum, 45: Two  sons, Kumyong, 18, and Unyong, 16: and daughter, Kumju, 20.    The Yo were the second North Korean family who defected to  the South after the Kim Man-chol family who fled to South Korea  via Japan and Taiwan in February 1987.</p>

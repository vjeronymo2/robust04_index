			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Monica Bjorklund report: "Left Party Climbs Above </F> Threshold"]    [Text] New Democracy continues to lose voter support and  has now fallen below the threshold for representation in the  Riksdag. The Left Party on the other hand has taken a sizeable  step up, the SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo [Swedish Institute for  Opinion Research] opinion poll for March shows.    For the other Riksdag parties the changes are smaller. The  Moderate Coalition Party and the Center Party have continued the  gains of the past few months. The Liberal Party has also moved  forward, while the Social Democrats and the Christian Democratic  Party are losing voters.    New Democracy has lost 0.9 percentage points since last  month. With 3.3 percent of votes the party is now quite a way  below the 4-percent threshold for representation in the Riksdag.    "It is the tumult in the party and the uncertainty about  where the party is heading that are having an effect," said Alf  Sjostrom, head of Sifo opinion polls.    "From the very start it was clear that New Democracy was two  parties really, an Ian party and a Bert party [reference to  party's two founders], where Ian Wachtmeister attracted Moderate  voters and Bert Karlsson hesitant Social Democrats.    ``It is now uncertain whether New Democracy will become a  Bert party or a former Ian party or no party at all. Many  voters are therefore returning to their old parties.''    During the polling period New Democracy has lost as many  votes to the Social Democrats as to the Moderates.    The second large and statistically reliable change in  voters'  intentions is the rise of 1.1 percent for the Left Party. The  party more than regained its losses from last month and is now  some way over the 4 percent threshold.    Many of the new sympathizers are former "stay-at-homes." The  party has also attracted some Social Democrats, perhaps those  dissatisfied with the party's position on the question of  unemployment insurance. Some new Left Party votes also come  from the nonsocialist bloc -- something that could indicate that  the EU question has begun to play a role. Perhaps some  nonsocialist opponents of the EU are singalling their  dissatisfaction by supporting the Left Party.    The overall SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo poll for March is as  follows, with changes from the previous months in parentheses:    Social Democrats 48.3 (minus 0.7)    Left Party 4.3 (plus 1.1)    Moderate Coalition Party 21.4 (plus 0.4)    Center Party 7.7 (plus 0.1)    Liberal Party 6.7 (plus 0.5)    Christian Democratic Party 4.3 (minus 0.3)    Green Ecology Party 3.0 (plus 0.1)    New Democracy 3.3 (minus 0.9)    Others 1.0 (minus 0.3)    Some 11.1 percent of those interviewed either abstained or  were unwilling to name any party.    A total of 3,732 people were interviewed in the period 28  February to 24 March. They were asked the question: "Which  party would you vote for in a Riksdag election if there were an  election today?"    Four parties are currently balancing around the 4-percent  threshold. The Christian Democratic Party and the Left Party  each with 4.3 percent, New Democracy with 3.3 percent, and the  Green Ecology Party with 3.0 percent.    The Moderates and the Center Party have continued their  gains  of the past few months. Since December the Moderates have  increased by 1.1 percent and the Center Party by 1.3 percent.    The Liberal Party makes gains in the March poll, but is  still  below the 7.5 percent the party had in December.    The Christian Democratic Party continues to move up and  down,  but is remaining around the 4 percent mark.    The Social Democrats lost ground for the second month in a  row and this month lost 0.7 percentage points.    In the previous poll in February there was clear support for  a new women's party. Of the 1.3 percent of voters who were  willing to vote for a party other than the established parties,  more than half made spontaneous mention of the women's  party/women's list.    Now this support has decreased. Fewer people are ready to  vote for another party and fewer people mentioned the women's  party/women's list.    "There is therefore not the same tendency as when the Green  Ecology Party or New Democracy came into being," Alf Sjostrom  said. In these two cases support increased noticeably month by  month.    The reduced support could in part be a result of the fact  that recently there has not been as much attention paid to  writer Maria-Pia Boethius and her possible plans to form a new  women's party.    "If you are going to form a party, you really need to be  outwardly active and work for the party's ideas," Alf Sjostrom  said.</p>

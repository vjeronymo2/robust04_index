The parties to the investment management agreement (the Agreement) would be the Bank, the Manager, and the Plan client. Section 6.1 of the prototype Agreement provides that the Bank unconditionally guarantees the return to the client at the termination of the Agreement of an amount equal to the amount invested by the client (the Qualifying Deposit) under the Agreement (either initially or after the date of any renewal of the Agreement). Qualifying Deposit means any amount invested by the client not more than half of which is withdrawn before the first anniversary of the date of the Agreement (or, in the case of a renewal of the Agreement, not more than half of which is withdrawn before the first anniversary of the date of such renewal). However, pursuant to section 6.2 of the Agreement, the above mentioned guarantee (the Guarantee) does not apply if the client terminates the Agreement before such first anniversary. The Guarantee does apply, however, to any principal withdrawn by the client if (and after): (i) the credit rating assigned to the Bank's unsecured unsubordinated debt securities by either Standard and Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. is reduced below AA- or Aa3, respectively; or (ii) the Manager or the Bank notifies the client that the Agreement will terminate prior to its agreed upon term. There is no time period limiting the application of the Guarantee with respect to the circumstances described in (i) and (ii), above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant states that if a client were to deposit additional amounts under the Agreement after the date of the initial Qualifying Deposit but before the first anniversary of the date of the Agreement (or before the first anniversary of any renewal of the Agreement), such additional deposits would also be guaranteed by the Bank, but such additional deposits would be subject to the same one-year holding period requirement (measured from the date of such additional deposit) for the Guarantee to apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6.1 of the Agreement further provides that if, at the termination of the Agreement, the client has not received an amount equal to its Qualifying Deposit, the Bank shall, upon written demand by the client, pay to the client the entire unpaid principal balance of such Qualifying Deposit. This section permits the client to withdraw up to half of the Qualifying Deposit at any time subject to two weeks advance written notice. However, if at the time of such partial withdrawal the net asset value of the portfolio is lower than the Qualifying Deposit, section 6.1 of the Agreement provides that the Guarantee shall be reduced by a proportion equal to the amount of such withdrawal divided by the net asset value of the portfolio at that time. If at the time of the withdrawal the net asset value of the portfolio is higher than the Qualifying Deposit, the Guarantee shall be reduced by a proportion equal to the amount of such withdrawal divided by the Qualifying Deposit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant has provided three examples illustrating how the Guarantee operates in the case of partial withdrawals when the net asset value of the portfolio has (1) decreased, (2) not changed, and (3) increased. All three examples assume a Qualifying Deposit of $20 million and a withdrawal of $10 million after the one-year period mentioned above. In the first example, the net asset value of the Qualifying Deposit had fallen to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $15 million at the withdrawal date, leaving only $5 million (in net asset value) after the withdrawal. In this example, the Guarantee would be reduced by 67% (i.e., $10 million withdrawn divided by $15 million pre-withdrawal net asset value at time of withdrawal). Therefore, although $5 million would be the total net asset value remaining in the client's account under the Agreement after the $10 million withdrawal, the Guarantee would apply to $6,666,667 of the Qualifying Deposit (i.e., 33% of the $20 million Qualifying Deposit). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the second example, the net asset value of the Qualifying Deposit remained at $20 million at the withdrawal date, leaving $10 million (in net asset value) after the withdrawal. In this example, the Guarantee would be reduced by 50% (i.e., $10 million withdrawn divided by $20 million pre-withdrawal net asset value at time of withdrawal). Therefore, $10 million would be the total net asset value remaining in the client's account under the Agreement after the $10 million withdrawal, and the Guarantee would apply to $10 million of the Qualifying Deposit (i.e., 50% of the $20 million Qualifying Deposit). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

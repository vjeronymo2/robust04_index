			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Affairs Committee of the Russian  parliament's Federation Council expressed its concern over the  unilateral lifting of the embargo against Bosnia by the U.S.  Senate. In its Tuesday statement, made available to Interfax,  the committee said that such steps could obstruct the joint  Russian, U.S. and EU policy in Bosnia and said that weapons  should not reach the warring parties.    The committee thought that as the Serbs complied with the  peace plan the suspension and, at a later stage, lifting of the  sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) would  promote peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.    The upper house deputies expressed their willingness to  consult and act jointly with the U.S. senators in resolving the  Bosnian crisis.    The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament,  had earlier passed a resolution under which, if the embargo on  weapons supplies to Bosnia were unilaterally lifted, Russia was  to respond adequately, going as far as lifting its own sanctions.</p>

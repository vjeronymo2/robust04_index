			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SCALED-BACK PLAYA VISTA BUILDING PLAN IS RELEASED  </P> <P> Playa Vista, the massive residential and commercial project proposed for south  of Marina del Rey, is shaping into neighborhoods with a mix of mid-rise office  buildings and low-rise residential complexes.  </P> <P> At public meetings last week, Nelson C. Rising, who heads the development team  for Maguire Thomas Partners, unveiled preliminary drawings that showed three-  and four-story residential courtyard complexes down the street from five- and  six-story office buildings in a campus-like setting.  </P> <P> Rising said he does not expect any residential complex to be taller than six  stories, or any commercial office building to be taller than 10 stories, which  is below the ridgeline of the nearby Westchester bluffs.  </P> <P> Besides providing some early glimpses of the development's overall  architectural look, the latest plans show several significant changes from  earlier versions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Open Space  </P> <P> About 2,300 residential units and 70,000 square feet of retail business space  that had been planned for the southwest corner of Lincoln and Jefferson  boulevards have been relocated. Those 47 acres will remain open, although an  interpretive nature center may be built.  </P> <P> The elimination of development on this site is contingent on settlement of a  lawsuit filed against the developers by Friends of Ballona Wetlands, a  preservation group.  </P> <P> The previous developer had agreed to set aside 175 acres of wetlands and 41  acres of sand dunes, and had pledged $10 million to the National Audubon  Society to restore and maintain the wetlands. These provisions have been  incorporated by Maguire Thomas Partners.  </P> <P> A six-story senior citizen housing complex that had been planned for the far  west corner of the parcel is being replaced with a one- or two-story recreation  center that will be accessible only by foot, bicycle or shuttle.  </P> <P> The number of streets will be increased in the southeastern part of the  957-acre tract, where most of the development will be concentrated. Rising said  this will allow for a mix of shops, homes, offices and parks rather than  clustering each use in separate areas that are accessible only by car.  </P> <P> In some neighborhoods, people will live above street-level retail and office  space.  </P> <P> Overall, the developers plan to build 11,100 residential units, about 5 million  square feet of office space and about 680,000 square feet of retail space.  </P> <P> "We're trying to create neighborhoods where everyone is within six minutes'  walking distance of town centers," Rising said. "People will not need their  cars to get from one place to another."  </P> <P> In effect, said principal architect Andres Duany of Miami, the developers will  attempt to build a new city by borrowing many of the elements of small towns  before 1940. Ideally, many residents will be able to work and shop within  walking distance of their homes.  </P> <P> Almost all the housing will be in multifamily complexes of apartments,  condominiums and townhouses.  </P></p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet resolved to keep spending inside limit THE government's determination to stick to the Pounds 244.5bn planning total for next year was underlined by Downing Street as the cabinet met yesterday afternoon and evening in the first of an intensive series of meetings this week to try to thrash out an agreement. At the end of the 4 1/2 -hour discussion, Downing Street said that 'good progress was made' in this, the first time the cabinet had looked at individual departments' spending programmes, rather than the overall total and strategy. The final deal is expected to be reached at Thursday's cabinet meeting. Mr John Major has not ruled out holding bilateral discussions with individual spending ministers before then in an effort to break through the difficulties. In spite of what is admitted to be the 'political flak' of cutting back on some programmes, senior officials emphasised that the basis of the discussions was allocating the total that had been agreed by the cabinet in the summer. 'They are not working on any options that breach Pounds 244.5bn,' one said yesterday. Thursday's cabinet meeting is likely to discuss ways of bringing private-sector investment to projects. That was signalled by Mr Major to backbenchers last week, among measures to accompany the Autumn Statement. At present the rules are still being discussed within the Treasury, but will go to the cabinet because they have a bearing on what public spending may be agreed. For example, the decision on how the Jubilee Line extension to London's Docklands counts in the public-expenditure calculations may critically affect what other programmes can be afforded. Other options being looked at by the Treasury include operating leases for British Rail services; and joint ventures between public and private sector such as in the building of sports facilities. Further meetings of EDX, the cabinet committee on public spending which is chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, are scheduled for tomorrow and Thursday, to work on the details of whatever is agreed in the further cabinet meetings, which continue this morning. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday warned Mr Major to draw back from making cuts in public services, and challenged the prime minister 'to stand by promises made during the election when he said that cutting public spending would not be 'an economically sensible thing to do''. As ministers got to grips with the difficulty of keeping to the agreed total, there were fresh opposition protests at the prospect that social security benefits, which have been identified as a likely casualty of the spending round, might not be uprated to match inflation. In the Commons, Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, said there would be 'a sense of outrage' if those on benefit were 'put in the firing line' to help Mr Lamont. But Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, refused to confirm that the government's public-spending plans would not undermine manifesto commitments to uprate child benefit and the basic state pension according in line with inflation.</p>

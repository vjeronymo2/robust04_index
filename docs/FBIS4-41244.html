			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 18/6/1994 -- A meeting of the  departments of foreign relations experts from the Ukraine and  Moldova is to be held at the end of July. The meeting will  discuss issues concerning the frontiers between the two states,  declared to BASA a representative of the Moldovan Ministry of  Foreign Affairs (MAE). Initially, the Ukrainian MAE suggested  the meeting to be organized at the end of June, but the Chisinau  officials requested it to be postponed for a month, for they  wanted better to prepare for it. The cited source stated that a  visit to Kiev by the vice-premier Valentin Cunev was scheduled  for the first half of June. Cunev was to discuss issues  concerning interstate collaboration in the fields of  transportation, economics, and exploitation of sea vacation  houses. The visit was postponed because the new Ukrainian  chamber of ministers was not yet formed.</p>

Mitsubishi is the third major Japanese automaker to announce  import targets for U.S.-made auto parts following Toyota Motor  Corp., leader of the industry, and Mazda Motor Corp., affiliate  of Ford Motor Co. of the United States.    Mitsubishi has announced a purchase plan for fiscal 1994,  which begins April 1, incorporating imports of 400 million  dollars worth of parts from U.S. suppliers and an additional  1.2 billion dollars for local procurement for its U.S. car  venture.    The company also said it will increase U.S. production of  cars mounted with engines and transmissions supplied by Chrysler  Corp. to 200,000 vehicles in 1995.    The company said it can boost local procurement in fiscal  1994 by about 400 million dollars if its vehicle production in  the U.S. expands steadily.    The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said it will  announce next week an appeal for cooperation between Japanese  and U.S. auto industries.    The appeal calls for the establishment of a forum for  consultations between Japanese automakers and the U.S. "Big  Three" -- General Motors Corp., Ford and Chrysler, association  officials said.</p>

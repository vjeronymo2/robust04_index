			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / American Express fined over death fall AMERICAN Express was fined Pounds 1,500 in Poole, Dorset, yesterday after magistrates heard that one of its executives had fallen to his death from an unsafe third-floor window. Mr Bernard Rogers, a compliance director, fell 60ft last November while trying to open the window at the company's offices in High Street, Poole, the court heard. Mr Rogers, of Bournemouth, died from multiple injuries. An inquest jury later returned a verdict of accidental death after hearing that restraints that would have prevented the centrally pivoted window from opening fully were not in place at the time. The company was prosecuted by Poole Borough Council under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. American Express admitted failing to discharge its duty by not ensuring the safety of an employee. Mr Shaun Ferris, for American Express, told the court that a colleague of Mr Rogers noticed that the window restraints were not in place shortly before the event, and planned to replace them later that day. 'The defendants have now well and truly put their house in order,' he said. 'They are not likely to re-offend or ever reappear before you again.'</p>

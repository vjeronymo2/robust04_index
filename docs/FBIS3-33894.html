Meanwhile, the  bilateral talks between the Israeli, Syrian, Lebanese, and  Palestinian delegations continue in Washington. Our  correspondent Natan Gutman reports from Washington:    [Begin recording] [Gutman] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  arrived at his Washington hotel a short time ago. From what he  told us, it appears that Mr. Peres is slightly less optimistic  than Yasir 'Arafat concerning the chances of signing an  agreement next week. I asked Shim'on Peres whether he shares  'Arafat's assessment that an agreement can be signed within a  week:    [Peres] I am participating in the negotiations, and that is  enough for me. I hope we will reach an agreement, but I do not  want to commit myself to a precise day or week.    [Gutman] What will take place in Cairo next week?    [Peres] We have to finalize several more issues, some of  which relate to the contents of the agreement, others to the  formulation of the issues on which agreement has been reached.    [Gutman] Upon his arrival in Washington, Foreign Minister  Peres confirmed that Yasir 'Arafat told him in Davos that the  Palestinians are not interested in an independent Palestinian  state at the present time. 'Arafat told Peres at the opening of  their meeting: You are afraid we want to establish a  Palestinian state right now, but in fact we have decided to  proceed toward a confederation rather than a Palestinian state.  This is what 'Arafat told Peres at the opening of their meeting  in Davos.    Foreign Minister Peres will meet Secretary of State  Christopher in about three hours, and tomorrow he will meet Vice  President Gore. The talks between the Israeli and Syrian  delegations will open in about half an hour -- a breakthrough on  this track is not expected to take place today. [end recording]</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Shareholders requisition egm at Bristol Scotts SHAREHOLDERS have thrown down the gauntlet at Bristol Scotts, the stadium and restaurant group run for more than 50 years by the publicity-shy Kerman family, writes Peggy Hollinger. Mr Ian Stevens, whose family owns just over 20 per cent of the shares, has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting to appoint himself and fellow investor, Sir Ian Rankin, to the board. The move is believed to be due to dissatisfaction over the running of the company, including the merger in 1990 with a restaurant group controlled by the Kerman family. The merger was based on an asset valuation of Pounds 6.43m. However, an independent valuation claimed assets of just Pounds 2.3m. The Kerman family then held 23 per cent of the voting shares. Mr Nicholas Kerman, a director, recently sold 707,640 shares, or just over 11 per cent, at 52p. Meanwhile, Mr Nicholas Berry, who bought 13 per cent subsequent to the sale, has not been allowed to register his shares. If the shares are registered before the egm, Mr Berry says he intends to vote for the appointment of Sir Ian and Mr Stevens.</p>

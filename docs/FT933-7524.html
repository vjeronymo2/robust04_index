			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: Philippines mining incentives 'not enough' A PACKAGE of mining incentives recommended for approval by Philipines president Fidel Ramos were welcome but not enough, a Chamber of Mines official said yesterday, reports Reuter from Manila. He said that the easing of a constitutional rule limiting foreign investors to 40 per cent ownership in mining ventures would help, as would early approval by congress of a mining code with measures designed to attract foreign investment. The new mining code should give foreign investors 'more elbow room' to acquire 100 per cent ownership in mining ventures for a certain number of years, he added. But the official noted that mining companies had described as short-sighted the Finance Department's refusal to reduce value added tax payments by mining companies. 'If the rate is reduced to 2 per cent from 5 per cent, we can use the money to expand and create more jobs. That will bring in more taxes later,' he explained. The Bureau of Mines should also be strengthened and should not remain within the Environment Department where it is finding it difficult to help the mining industry, he added.</p>

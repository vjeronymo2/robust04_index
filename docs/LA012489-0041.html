			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL WEBB SUES CALMARK OVER SEC FILINGS  </P> <P> Responding to a $150-million cash takeover offer, Arizona developer Del Webb  Corp. sued the Los Angeles-based Calmark Holding Corp. investment group for  allegedly misleading the public in filings with the government concerning the  proposed acquisition.  </P> <P> Privately owned Calmark develops, manages and syndicates residential and  commercial real estate. Last December, Calmark bought the Vagabond hotel chain  from imprisoned Wall Street speculator Ivan F. Boesky.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Webb said it had asked the Calmark group for financial  information so it could evaluate its $17-per-share offer, which was made Dec.  27. Getting no answer, Webb said Monday, it was left with "no choice" but to  sue.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that the Calmark group's 13D filing with the Securities and  Exchange Commission did not disclose that Calmark President Donald J. Brumlik  was disbarred in 1980, had filed for bankruptcy and has been a defendant for  alleged failure to pay financial obligations in Illinois and California.  </P> <P> Filed in U.S. District Court in Phoenix, the suit said Brumlik was disbarred in  Illinois because of a disciplinary complaint accusing him of "repeated  conversion of substantial amounts of cash from clients, partners and  employees."  </P> <P> Brumlik said late Monday that he had "withdrawn" as an Illinois lawyer because  he could not afford to fight the charges against him, but that they were not  adjudicated. He acknowledged that he had been in financial difficulty in the  late 1970s and early 1980s and had filed bankruptcy in 1980.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Answer  </P> <P> The Webb suit also said Calmark Chairman Uri Sheinbaum has been a defendant in  a number of civil suits alleging failure to satisfy financial obligations and  is the subject of a civil fraud suit in connection with syndication of Texas  real estate. This information was not mentioned in the 13D, the suit alleged.  </P> <P> Sheinbaum's office referred inquiries to a public relations consultant, who  could not be reached.  </P> <P> The suit also alleged that Calmark did not disclose that affiliate Northview  Corp. is a defendant in a pending civil suit arising from Boesky's criminal  case.  </P> <P> Another defendant, New York investment banker Oppenheimer &amp; Co., which is  Calmark's investment adviser, was accused in Webb's suit of breach of contract  and fiduciary duty. Webb alleged that Oppenheimer received confidential  information as a financial adviser for the Webb-controlled Claridge  hotel-casino in Atlantic City last April. No one was available for comment at  Oppenheimer's Los Angeles office.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based ESA Associates made an unsolicited bid of $17.50 a share for  Webb last July. The suit alleges that the recent 13D falsely said that ESA  discontinued discussions with Webb after getting "a strong negative response."  </P></p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Big Vienna rally Vienna saw Austria's largest rally for 50 years at the weekend, when 200,000 Austrians gathered to protest against an anti-foreigner initiative by the right-wing Freedom Party, writes Eric Frey from Vienna. The demonstration was scheduled to coincide with the start of a controversial petition drive by the FPO and its charismatic leader, Mr Jorg Haider, calling for stricter immigration laws and other measures directed at foreigners. The FPO has won support for its anti-foreigner platform and nearly doubled its share of the vote in elections in Austria's second largest city of Graz yesterday, to 21 per cent.</p>

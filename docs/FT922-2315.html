			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Norweb almost doubles to Pounds 137.9m NORWEB, the Manchester-based regional electricity company, yesterday announced pre-tax profits up by 96 per cent to Pounds 137.9m for the year to March 31 1992, writes Juliet Sychrava. Earnings per share rose sharply from 24.5p to 51p and the dividend is increased by 13.2 per cent to 17.7p. 'This year's results demonstrate that high quality customer service and profits can, and must, go hand in hand,' said Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb's chairman who noted that the company had disconnected fewer customers than ever before. The main reason for the leap in Norweb's profits was higher electricity prices. Like all 12 regional companies, Norweb increased prices sharply in April 1991 to recoup losses from undercharging the previous year. Norweb's 9.9 per cent price increase was one of the lowest in the industry, but the company's profit rise will be one of the highest. This is because exceptional items totalling some Pounds 30m also depressed profits last year. These arose from bad debts relating to its retail business, as well as an accelerated depreciation charge. If these items and the effect of recovering losses from the previous year were excluded, Norweb said, the underlying profit growth would be only 20 per cent. The main underlying growth came in the core distribution business, where operating profit rose by nearly 75 per cent. But the retail business also made a strong improvement, with an Pounds 8.3m profit compared with a loss of Pounds 7.5m the previous year. The low margin electricity supply business, which buys and sells bulk electricity, made Pounds 11.9m against Pounds 11.8m previously. The contracting business incurred losses. Underlying growth was partly due to a 1.4 per cent increase in sales, mainly to commercial customers. The company also recovered about half of the big customers it lost when privatisation meant the regional companies had to compete to keep local customers. Costs were carefully controlled, Norweb said. Some 280 jobs were cut over the year, leaving a workforce of 7,367, and controllable costs fell 1 per cent in real terms. Gearing fell from 32.2 per cent to 22.1 per cent, and capital expenditure was down Pounds 8.5m to Pounds 66.3m. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits for the year ending March 1993 of between Pounds 145m and Pounds 155m, giving earnings per share of 55p to 64p. Dividend forecasts range between 19.5p and 20p. COMMENT Norweb's quietly tenacious emphasis on marketing and retailing should perhaps have won it more Brownie points from the City, which has historically favoured nearby Yorkshire's more forceful style. Norweb should at least get points for doing what it promised with the retail business, which now has an Pounds 8.3m profit at a time when most companies' retail businesses are only just breaking even. If the company can now fulfil its promise to turn retail into a Pounds 300m business contributing nearly 20 per cent of profits in 1996, then it will have what many regional companies so far do not - a good non-core business for the future and something to spend its cash on. This promise might temper investors' reservations about the company's rather cautious dividend policy - like East Midlands yesterday it suggested this year's increase was a not-to-be-repeated windfall.</p>

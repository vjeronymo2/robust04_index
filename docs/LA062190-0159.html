			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP '90;  </P> <P> BRAZIL DOES WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN AGAIN;  </P> <P> GROUP C: MULLER'S LATE GOAL GOOD FOR 1-0 VICTORY OVER SCOTLAND, WHICH, FOR THE  SEVENTH TIME, WILL PROBABLY FAIL TO ADVANCE.  </P> <P> Brazil and Scotland played to their histories Wednesday night.  </P> <P> The Brazilians, three-time World Cup champions, edged the Scots, who have never  made it past the first round in six previous visits to the tournament, 1-0. A  tie would have virtually assured Scotland a place in the final 16.  </P> <P> And Brazil, which looked uninspired for much of the second half, pounced on a  mistake, as it almost always does.  </P> <P> Muller scored with nine minutes remaining, poking the ball into an unguarded  net after goalkeeper Jim Leighton could not control a rebound.  </P> <P> "Brazil proved in each game that it has personality," Coach Sebastiao Lazaroni  said. "I know this team has quality.  </P> <P> "Brazil got another win because the players worked hard tonight."  </P> <P> So did the Scots, who were confident of tying the Brazilians.  </P> <P> "We felt the whole second half the game would progress into a draw," Coach Andy  Roxburgh said. "Then, suddenly, it was gone."  </P> <P> So, probably, are Scotland's chances of moving on.  </P> <P> "Our players gave everything they had," Roxburgh said. "They battled away, but  Brazil has real class.  </P> <P> "We knew that if we didn't get a point, we wouldn't qualify."  </P> <P> Leighton made a save on a shot by Alemao, but the rebound came to a charging  Careca. He nudged it toward the goal and past Leighton. Muller, free at the  right of the net, did the rest.  </P> <P> Brazil, which already had qualified, ended the first round 3-0. Surprising  Costa Rica, which beat Sweden, 2-1, finished second with four points.  </P> <P> Scotland ended up third with two points, not likely to be enough to advance.  But the Scots must wait for today's results, the final four games of the first  round.  </P> <P> Despite having the majority of possession, the Brazilians did not create many  chances and found Leighton in fine form.  </P> <P> The goalkeeper's best saves came against Ricardo Gomes in the 24th minute,  Romario's header in the 52nd minute, and again on Romario five minutes later.  </P> <P> Scotland had a chance to tie in the final minute, but Brazilian goalie Claudio  Taffarel flicked the ball over the crossbar to keep out a close shot by Maurice  Johnston.  </P></p>

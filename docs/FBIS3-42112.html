			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Abram Blokh, doctor of geological and </F> mineralogical sciences: "The Secret of the Kodar Sobakita"]    [Text] The secrecy classification has been removed  from information about the search for and extraction of uranium.  Anyone who has worked for decades in this mysterious field  feels, together with relief and a feeling of bitterness, that  too many years have been spent in a routine of prohibitions and  inflexible restrictions.    I will not undertake to judge the advisability of the  decisions made a half century ago--the all-embracing  classification of that vast body of human and physical resources  which was put into effect at the dawn of the atomic problem. I  know only that not one of the countries outside the socialist  camp has taken such a step. We must think that we are not the  last ones for purely economic reasons, in order to avoid the  huge unproductive expenditures, to maintain an army of  protectors and the inevitable informers in secret matters. All  the same, the leak of information is already substantial when  there are two who bring it instead of one, unless they are truly  isolated from the outside world, of course. But hundreds of  thousands, if not millions of people, have been counted here.    In 1954, when a program of searches for uranium was  undertaken on a wide scale, a geological technician with a  radiation meter joined our coal geological exploration party in  Ryazan Oblast. And in the core sample of one of the boreholes  selected for measurement, in a plain layer of clay on the side  of the coal-bearing area, a high concentration of uranium was  suddenly discovered. Soon after, controlled drilling was begun  under conditions of strict secrecy. The trust employees stood  watch at the drills and collected and documented the cores, and  we just provided the drilling process. To the puzzled questions  why we were drilling where there is obviously no coal and in a  system that was unprecedentedly dense, the response was for the  needs of the trust, "but I do not know what kind." While the  slyly smiling drilling foreman once revealed that his mother had  brought home a tale from the market that geologists had found an  "atom" under the village of Zheltukhino.    How can we help but remember the immortal adage, over  200 years old, uttered by the observant Madam de (Stal) after a  trip to our country: "In Russia everything is a mystery and  nothing is a secret." The instructional song of the miner  leaving for a health resort could also have been included in the  Vysotskiy repertoire by the head of the first division of the  uranium mine. Quiet Yakov Davidovich Gotman, an honored figure  in science and technology, one of the pioneers of Soviet uranium  geology and discoverer of the unique Aldan uranium mining area  in southern Yakutia, has recounted the absolutely fantastic  story about the information leak. In the late 1940's, he was  sent along with S. Yershov, the deputy minister of geology, and  his colleague B. Petrushevskiy, to Central Asia on assignment.  On the next day, the "Voice of America" reported the departure  of three specialists from Moscow for the Central Asian uranium  deposits.    After the country acquired its atomic and thermonuclear  weapons, through the selfless labor of its specialists and with  a little help from the prospectors who were just as selfless,  and was able to stockpile enough of them to annihilate all life  on the planet, secrecy in the geology of atomic raw material was  turned into an indisputable absurdity. But the screws were  tightened even more.    In the first decades of the uranium boom a researcher  working  in the atomic energy field could publish scientific works which  did not deal with uranium with all the publication data,  including the name of the organization in which he was working.  But if reference was made to articles on uranium geology,  mention of the subject of one's research and its geographical  location, as well as one's place of work, was prohibited. The  routine of a scientific institution was also considered a big  state secret, and Anatoliy Shcheranskiy, as we know, paid with a  13-year sentence in the camps at the end of the Brezhnev era for  allegedly divulging such information.    From the mid-1970's, after achieving parity with the United  States, the ban on indicating one's place of work was extended  to all scientists who were working with uranium. Even if the  author of a completely harmless article did not mention uranium  in previously published works. Even when secrets which they  endeavored to safeguard were lost because of circumstances, this  did not stop those in control of universal secrecy. After the  Prague spring was smothered, the head of uranium geology in  Czechoslovakia, Vladimir Ruzhechka, did not return home. In a  book published in Canada in the mid-1970's, he revealed the  uranium resources not only of Eastern Europe, but the Soviet  Union as well. But like a mosquito which continues sucking blood  by inertia when its belly has been cut off, so the illuminated  skyscraper of domestic secrecy has continued to increase the  number of its stories.    The closed nature of the sector was convenient for the  uranium barons to a large extent, making it easier to pump huge  budget appropriations into it. The overexploration of deposits,  linked chiefly with the faulty planning system, which is  inconceivable in other countries, is typical for Soviet geology  as a classic cost-based branch of the economy of socialism.  Wages and bonuses depended not on specific results, but the  running meters of drilling, the cubic meters penetrated, and so  forth. Thus the effectiveness of geological exploration  operations turned out to be less advantageous for collectives  than increasing their volumes.    It is unlikely that the almost unknown venture involving the  mobilization of vast sums and numbers of people in completely  unprepared searches for uranium in the Kodar Range in  northeastern Chita Oblast would have been possible without  absolute secrecy. Based only on a highly radioactive piece of  rock with absolutely no geographical connection (such specimens  are called "sobakity" in geological terminology) which was sent  to Moscow, they quickly sent out two camps of prisoners into the  unpopulated high mountains under severe conditions in the late  1940's, and urgently put together a specialized geological  exploration expedition and a second expedition to conduct  scientific support for the operations, organized from scientific  associates of the Leningrad Geological Institute, who were to  remain at the site the year round. At the same time, they  shipped out heavy equipment and began drilling, tunneling, and  so forth in an area that had been given absolutely no geological  study. In the wilderness of the mountainous taiga, out of touch  with communications, the prisoners immediately began erecting  the buildings of a new town. The materials needed were taken in  by a winter road, and by aircraft the remainder of the year. The  results turned out to be poor--at the cost of much effort and  many lives, they found only a number of small signs of ore,  unsuitable for industrial exploitation.    The army of specialists who provided their intellect and  hard  labor and often lost their health to develop the country's  uranium base were the victims of this secrecy. They were  prohibited from traveling abroad, even to "fraternal countries,"  and from contacts and correspondence with foreign colleagues,  which scientists need like a person needs air. Without  convincing explanations, authorization to participate in  international conferences could be refused, even when they took  place in the USSR, and even when personally invited with a paper  which did not lead to complaints.    When my article on important aspects of the theory of ore  formation, whose conclusions were based on Ilya Prigozhin's  assumptions about the lack of equilibrium in thermodynamics,  appeared in one of the scientific journals, I decided to send a  reprint to the Nobel laureate and soon after received a warm  letter from him, a copy of his last monograph, and an invitation  to visit him at the institute in Brussels.    Dreams about a trip were obviously illusory at that time.  But  it would really be up-to-date for an outstanding scientist of  modern times to publish support for his scientific ideas. It was  during those very years of exhausting opposition from the  powerful (not in number, but opportunities) group of scientific  opponents headed by V. A. Zharikov, the current  academician-secretary of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences],  who was no less omnipotent then as the chairman of the VAK  [Higher Degree Commission] and who successfully blocked my  certification for the doctor of sciences degree for almost 20  years.    Nevertheless, I preferred to remain silent, for the fact  that  I had exchanged letters with a foreign scientist could have been  harmful.    The restrictions on movement and contacts were imposed on  participants in the American atomic project as well. But unlike  our bureaucracy, these restrictions were extended equally to  everyone, from Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the project, to  the ordinary technician. But our uranium "generals," who  possessed incomparably greater information under the "secret"  classification, very calmly traveled throughout the world. The  wives of the high officials working in the uranium field also  had the same privileges.    The Americans were generously compensated with additional  payments for the inconveniences related to the restrictions.  Additional payment "for secrecy" was also stipulated for Soviet  uranium employees by some ancient classified government decrees.  But in accordance with the classicial laws of the Kingdom of  Distorting Mirrors, the payments were received by the directors,  their deputies, chief accountants, and employees of the first  divisions, that is, the ones who forgot long ago how to hold a  geologist's hammer--or never did know how, or how to walk the  hills and dales with a radiation meter and through mine  workings, or to study the radioactive rocks under a microscope.    The farfetched secrecy, in accordance with the laws of  feedback, has hit the system which gave rise to it as well.  There is a wide conviction that the criminals sentenced to death  are not shot but sent to the uranium mines, where they soon die.  This is all a fantasy. Throughout my working life I have spent  innumerable shifts underground not only in uranium mines, but  coal, cobalt, molybdenum, and gold workings as well. I am  prepared to attest to the fact that I never encountered more  comfortable conditions than in uranium mines. A well organized  and strictly controlled ventilation system that provides for  work safety, workings at one's full height, not manholes for  "abdominal movement," and a large number of showers on the  surface, maintained in model sanitary condition...    Of course, the all-powerful Minsredmash [Ministry of Medium  Machine Building] was not ashamed to make use of the convicts'  forced labor on a wide scale. But just in construction and  auxiliary operations. The prisoners were not underground. They  were not needed there, and the uranium mines did not experience  a shortage of a mining work force. Many were attracted there by  the exemplary work conditions, the higher earnings, and the  well-equipped housing with which the ministry's towns and  settlements were always provided. In addition, the radioactivity  of even the rich natural ores is incomparable with the enriched  uranium from the reactors of nuclear power stations, the deadly  radiation which is erroneously attributed to the mines. If one  is looking for places suitable for prisoners condemned to death,  one should look in the coal mines, with their unacceptably low  level of safety equipment.    But what comes with the declassification of uranium, aside  from a belated quiet satisfaction? Its features as a more  "cosmopolitan" environment than other ores help to "get into"  the general natural laws of ore formation. So the tens of  thousands of volumes of handwritten reports by Soviet uranium  workers with the most extensive information, which continue to  remain behind the steel doors of the geological funds, are truly  the property of world science. The titanic intellectual labor of  several generations of specialists, which is capable of standing  up to the competition in any market of scientific knowledge, is  concentrated in them. The only question is whether we are really  able to enter these steel doors.</p>

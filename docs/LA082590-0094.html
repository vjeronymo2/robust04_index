			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> A 'COSBY' BLOOPERS EPISODE BEATS 'SIMPSONS' RERUN, BUT NOT IN L.A.  </P> <P> It's still only summer and still only reruns, but "The Simpsons" was no match  for a fresh bloopers episode of "The Cosby Show" in their first head-to-head  battle, according to ratings released Friday by the A.C. Nielsen Co.  </P> <P> But even with an episode that has repeated three times on Fox, "The Simpsons"  did beat NBC's "Cosby" in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The show, about  mischievous Bart's decapitating a statue of his hometown's founder, nationally  managed a second-place finish in its 8 p.m. Thursday time slot, beating repeats  of "The Father Dowling Mysteries" on ABC and "48 Hours" on CBS.  </P> <P> The heavily promoted "Cosby" special, which was filled with outtakes and  blunders from the show's previous six seasons, registered a 15 rating and a 28%  audience share. (Each ratings point represents 921,000 households.) "The  Simpsons" scored an 8.4 rating and a 16% share of homes watching television at  the time.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest market, "The Simpsons" beat "Cosby"  by more than 182,000 households.  </P> <P> While "Cosby" will begin airing original episodes next month, "The Simpsons"  will not get a new episode on the air until late October because of the  animated series' complicated production process. Fox executives so far have  downplayed the David-versus-Goliath confrontation with "Cosby," claiming they  have little hope of toppling the longtime ratings champ and that they would be  satisfied merely with establishing a firm toehold on Thursdays -- a new night  of programming for the 3 1/2-year-old network.  </P> <P> "We're thrilled with these results" was all a Fox spokesman would say Friday.  Peter Chernin, president of Fox Broadcasting, was not available to comment  further.  </P> <P> The debut of NBC's new sitcom "Ferris Bueller" won its 8:30 time period  Thursday, beating a repeat of "Married . . . With Children" on Fox and the  second half-hour reruns of "Father Dowling" and "48 Hours" on ABC and CBS. But  the new series lost three share points from its "Cosby" lead-in and lost  outright to "Married . . . With Children" in Los Angeles. Based on the hit  movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," the series with Charlie Schlatter will be  seen regularly on Monday nights at 8:30 beginning next month.  </P></p>

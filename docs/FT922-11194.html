			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Port prepares for flotation THE Port of Tilbury, privatised six weeks ago in a Pounds 32m management and employee buy-out, has announced plans to move to a stock exchange listing in five years. Mr John McNab, the chief executive, said the port expected to have repaid by then the Pounds 20m lent by National Westminster Bank towards the purchase from the Port of London Authority. He said the port would concentrate on developing cargo feeder traffic with Continental deep-sea ports, building up its growing European cruise business and redeveloping excess land for a maritime business park. The port's prospects would be significantly strengthened, he said, by the freeport status it expected to secure from Customs and Excise this summer, allowing businesses to defer payments of VAT and customs duty on cargo brought into the port. Liverpool is the only other UK maritime freeport. Of the Pounds 32m payment for the port, Pounds 11.9m was jointly invested by the port's management and the venture capitalist, Schroder Ventures. Next month the port's 900 employees will be invited to purchase further shares worth a total of Pounds 1.15m. Last week they were each given 135 ordinary shares free. In the three years since the abolition of the Dock Labour Scheme, Tilbury has moved from losses of Pounds 4.1m to a profit of Pounds 2.2m this year. Since 1989 the port has invested more than Pounds 11m in capital projects. Cargo volumes for 1991 totalled 5.9m tonnes. Mr McNab told a gathering of customers and port employees that the port expected to double its cargo handling capability to 15m tonnes by the year 2022.

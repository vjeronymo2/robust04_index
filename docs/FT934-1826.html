			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: French hotels group warns of sharp fall Societe des Bains de Mer (SBM), the hotel and casino group and the biggest single company in Monaco, yesterday warned of a sharp fall in net profits for the current financial year. SBM, which owns the famous Monte Carlo Casino and the luxurious Hotel de Paris and Hotel Hermitage, reported an 18 per cent reduction in interim net profits, to FFr88.1m (Dollars 15.03m) in the six months to September 30, from FFr107.6m in the same period of 1992. The group blamed the fall on the difficult economic environment, and on financial charges relating to its ongoing investment programme and pension provision. It said the summer season had been reasonably robust in spite of the pressures on the European economy, and particularly the Mediterranean tourist market. It also made progress in controlling costs. However, group turnover fell 11.6 per cent during the first half, to FFr932.7m from FFr1.06bn. The problem posed by this slowdown in activity was aggravated by the volatile nature of SBM's casino business, which provided 73 per cent of turnover in the last full financial year. The profitability of its gaming interests is heavily dependent on the size of gamblers' stakes and by the rate of wins and losses.</p>

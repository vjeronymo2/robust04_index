Continuing their search  among tetrazole derivatives for new radiation protectors the  authors obtained 27 different (2)-aminoalkyl-5-substituted-  aryltetrazoles identified as I-XXVII. Their properties are  presented. Also presented are toxic and radiation protection  properties for N[.sub]2[/] isomers and their salts. Nine  derivatives exhibited a 40-80% radiation effect under an  LD[.sub]05-99/30[/] exposure. A relationship between their  structure and action was observed. The most detailed study of  radiation protection properties was conducted for compound XIV.  It maintains its protection properties for 3 hours after  exposure. Chemical and biological experiments were performed.  The obtained data indicate that tetrazole class is promising in  a search for radiation protectors. Tables 4, references 9.</p>

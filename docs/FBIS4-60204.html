			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has  stated the following:    With the help of Almighty God, and the courage and  dedication  of the heroes in the Armed Forces, the heroic fighters in the  forces of unity and the protectors of constitutional legitimacy,  have continued to fulfill the combat duties assigned to them in  confronting the forces of rebellion and secession on all axes  and sectors. In the eastern, Shabwah axis, the valiant Armed  Forces units managed to capture the military base and the  central axis command headquarters in the city of 'Ataq, the  capital of the governorate. Thus, the Shabwah Governorate, with  all its districts and all its military installations, is now in  the hands of constitutional legitimacy. A Mig-21 was downed in  the ('Aqibat 'Arad) and a large quantity of weapons, vehicles,  and military equipment, including all military depots in the  governorate, was seized.    The loyal brother citizens and their courageous stand  alongside the forces of constitutional legitimacy played a key  role in these major achievements. The people greeted the Armed  Forces with open hearts and feelings of happiness in all  districts, expressing their absolute support for unity and  constitutional legitimacy, and taking part in action alongside  their great national Army, which is capable of defeating the  secessionists and their supporters.    On the Abyan-Lahij axis, the forces of unity and  constitutional legitimacy continued their heroic and brave  tasks. They purged a number of defeated secessionist pockets,  making real advances and inflicting on the forces of apostasy  and secession major losses in hardware, weapons, and vehicles.    The units of the forces of unity and constitutional  legitimacy also managed to seize large quantities of arms and  military hardware, including a helicopter that was lying intact  after its crew had fled. The forces of unity and constitutional  legitimacy are continuing to execute their combat tasks.    In the same direction, the pilot heroes of the Armed Forces  have continued to accomplish the tasks assigned to them. They  hit these targets with great success and accurate effectiveness.  The secessionist traitors will reap the harvest of their  actions.    In their name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. If ye  will aid the cause of God, he will aid you and plant your feet  firmly. [koranic verse]    [Signed] The Ministry of Defense, Sanaa.</p>

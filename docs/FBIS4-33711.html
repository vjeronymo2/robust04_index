			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "Jn Galazi" and "Carlos Nobre"] </F>   [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 8 Jun (AE) -- Acting National  Confederation of Industries (CNI) President Mario Amato said  today that the antitrust law "is draconian to entrepreneurs,"  who feel insecure and fearful of possible punishment. According  to Amato, the law will not benefit enterprises, the government,  or consumers. As an example, he said the president of a  state-run utility company will not be jailed if the company  issues an incorrect bill. Private enterprises, however, will be  subject to this type of penalty. Despite his position against  the antitrust law, Amato voiced support for the Real Plan  because it is being implemented gradually.    Amato lectured today at a seminar entitled "The Solution Is  To Create Jobs," sponsored by the Brazilian Service for  Promotion of Small and Micro Enterprises (Sebrae), in Rio de  Janeiro, during which he said everyone should try to promote the  domestic market. In this regard, he proposed an agenda for the  creation of jobs involving five topics to be discussed by the  whole society: elimination of restrictions on incoming foreign  capital, reduction of social contributions, promotion of  exports, tax reform, and promotion of small and micro  enterprises, which are the main source of jobs on the Brazilian  market.    Sole Workers Center (CUT) President Vicente Paulo da Silva,  aka Vicentinho, endorsed Amato's words, adding his own  suggestions: reduction of the work week to 40 hours, land  reform, and incentives for the creation of small enterprises.  Former Mines and Energy Minister Pratini de Moraes demanded the  elimination of taxes on exports, noting that this can help  create 300,000 jobs. Among such taxes, he mentioned the IPMF  [Provisional Tax on Financial Operations], Confins [Social  Security contributions], ICM [Goods Movement Tax], and IPI [Tax  on Manufactured Products]. With tax exemptions, Brazilian  exports will grow by $6 billion, he said, thus increasing the  positive balance of trade, which last year registered exports  worth $38 billion and imports worth $23 billion.    Taxes paid by export industry entrepreneurs amount to $8  billion annually, and they feel insecure without a clear policy  for the industry. Brazil, Burkina Faso, and Bangladesh are the  only three countries that tax their exports, Moraes said. He  added that exports account for only 7 percent of Brazilian  industrial production, and Brazilian commerce accounts for only  0.65 percent of world trade.</p>

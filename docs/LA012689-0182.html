			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE;  </P> <P> CAMPBELL'S SHORT STINT DOESN'T SLOW LA QUINTA  </P> <P> Is there a better pure shooter in Orange County than Scott Campbell of La  Quinta High School?  </P> <P> It seems doubtful, after watching Campbell score 27 points in little more than  21 minutes Wednesday night in La Quinta's 74-58 Garden Grove League victory  over host Rancho Alamitos.  </P> <P> Campbell made 12 of 16 shots, with all but one from beyond 15 feet, despite  seeing limited action after getting his fourth foul with 6:43 remaining in the  third quarter.  </P> <P> During one stretch, Campbell, a 6-foot 3-inch senior, made 8 consecutive shots  to help La Quinta (13-4, 8-0) solidify its hold on first place in the 8-team  league.  </P> <P> "If there's a better shooter around, I haven't seen him," said Jim Perry, La  Quinta's coach. "Scott has the good height and the great strength to get over  guys, even when he's covered.  </P> <P> "He has unlimited range and is an excellent leaper. So far, nobody has been  able to guard him. I think he's the best player in the county."  </P> <P> But with Campbell on the bench, La Quinta got a chance to demonstrate it's not  a one-dimensional team. The Aztecs picked up the slack and were only outscored  by a point during his lengthy absence.  </P> <P> "We have one great individual, but we generally play well as a group," Perry  said. "We got some quality minutes from our substitutes tonight."  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos (6-9, 4-4) was facing a must-win situation to keep its playoff  aspirations alive, but the Vaqueros managed to make only 17 of 39 free throws  for a dismal 44%.  </P> <P> "We need to beat one of the big three (La Quinta, Kennedy and Pacifica) if we  want to go to the playoffs, and so far, we haven't," said Terry Munson, Rancho  Alamitos coach. "It's been a frustrating year."  </P> <P> Los Amigos 73, Garden Grove 60 -- Carlos Palomino scored 24 points to lead Los  Amigos (5-10, 4-4) at Garden Grove. The score was tied, 11-11, at the end of  the first quarter, but Los Amigos outscored Garden Grove, 20-12, to take a  31-23 halftime lead. Jovan Hunter and David Pearlman each scored 18 points for  the Lobos. Chuck York scored 18 points and Joe Squyres 17 for Garden Grove  (4-13, 3-5).  </P> <P> Pacifica 86, Santiago 48 -- Randy Schulze had 19 points and 10 rebounds to lead  host Pacifica (11-5, 6-2), which led, 30-7, at the end of the first quarter.  Bill Maurer had 18 points and 14 assists for the Mariners, Dustin Bonham scored  13 points for Pacifica. Jason Heskett scored 15 points and Alex Ripley 13 for  Santiago (1-12, 1-7).  </P></p>

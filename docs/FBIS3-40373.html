Manufacturers must still be persuaded to equip their cars  with this miracle device.    Quite sensitive, it shrinks in the slightest cold air draft.  Then, it expands languorously under the effect of heat.  Developed by the Mecaplast company, this car-engine thermal  air-intake regulator is the first to use the surprising  properties of shape-memory alloys.    "The system spares motorists who drive in very cold areas  the  unpleasantness resulting from the icing of intake valves,"  Didier Theron, the marketing manager of this Monaco company  specialized in plastics engineering, explained. When the air  temperature falls below a given value, the spring becomes less  stiff, which causes a trap door to close, thus protecting  carburetion components against the rigor of cold weather.  Conversely, when the weather becomes milder, the spring recovers  its initial characteristics and opens again the trap door.    The trick? The reversible behavior of these shape-memory  alloys which reflects the passage from one crystalline structure  to another. This transformation takes place in a number of  alloys, such as copper-aluminum-nickel or titanium-nickel,  following suitable heat treatments.    Mecaplast uses products made by the Memometal company.  Located in the Alberville area in Savoie, this company has all  the equipment required to make the precious material (vacuum  furnaces, annealing furnaces, drawing machines, etc.). It can  prepare the formula that will exactly meet its clients'  requirements.  <H5>  Fast and Reliable Regulators </H5>   What are the advantages of shape-memory alloys to regulate  the carburetion air intake? First, an extremely short response  time: about two seconds compared with about 50 for traditional  systems using wax caps. "These performance characteristics make  it possible to achieve a much more precise regulation, which is  therefore more suitable for the current electronic injection  systems," according to Didier Theron. Another advantage is its  reliability, as there is a minimum of moving parts. This  simplification also reduced manufacturing costs by about 30  percent.    In spite of all these benefits, the regulator is not yet on  the market. In fact, we shall have to wait patiently for a few  years, until car manufacturers venture to add this "quasi magic"  component under the hoods of their cars. This wait-and-see  attitude, however, does not shake the Mecaplast engineers's  faith in the future of shape-memory alloys in the automobile  world. They just filed a new patent in order to use these alloys  to regulate the ventilation of engine hoods according to the  outside temperature.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Die Harder, and a Lot More Often: When it comes to carnage, Bruce Willis' "Die  Harder" is hard to beat.  </P> <P> New York Times movie critic Vincent Canby made a body count, and found that 264  people die in "Die Harder," including 230 at once during a plane wreck. That  compares to a mere 18 in 1988's original "Die Hard." According to the Canby  count, "Rambo III" had the second-highest number of fatalities with 106. Sam  Peckinpah's landmark "The Wild Bunch" had 89, "Robocop II" had 81, Arnold  Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall" had 74 and "Rambo II" had 62. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

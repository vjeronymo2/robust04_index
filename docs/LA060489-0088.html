			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TONYS: AN HONOR IN DECLINE;  </P> <P> THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE A FAIR PICTURE OF THE NEW YORK THEATER SEASON  </P> <P> It's Tony time again. Tonight at 9, millions of Americans will gather around  their TV sets to watch the 43rd annual Antoinette Perry Awards, broadcast from  Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theatre and emceed by Angela Lansbury.  </P> <P> Let's roll that one again. Tonight at 9, after "Murder, She Wrote," millions of  Americans will say: "Want to watch the Tonys for a little while?" After two or  three awards, millions of Americans will remember that they've got to get up  early in the morning.  </P> <P> This has been the viewing pattern for the Tony Awards even when the Broadway  theater has had a good season. This year, the cupboard was virtually bare, and  the show's TV producer, Don Mischer, will have to go heavy on production values  to disguise it.  </P> <P> Take musicals -- the theater form that Broadway invented. The Tony Award for  Best Musical used to go to a new show, like "Fiddler on the Roof" or "West Side  Story." The leading contender for the best musical of 1989 is "Jerome Robbins'  Broadway." It features numbers from "West Side Story" and "Fiddler on the  Roof."  </P> <P> Another contender is "Black and Blue." This is a tribute to the Cotton Club and  the great blues singers of the past. Another backward-looking show. In more  plentiful seasons, it and the Robbins show would have been called revivals.  </P> <P> The third contender is "Starmites." This isn't something you sprinkle on Fruit  Loops. It is an officially certified Broadway musical, running at a new cabaret  theater called the Criterion. Variety says that its plot concerns "a  fantasy-fixated teen-age girl dreaming she's an exiled intergalactic princess,  who becomes involved with a quartet of boyish space troopers." Variety adds  that it is "silly, heavy and dull."  </P> <P> Usually there are four contenders for Best Musical. This year, there were only  three. Why? Probably because "Legs Diamond" might have received the fourth  nomination, and everybody would have burst out laughing.  </P> <P> There won't be an award for Best Book or Best Score this year, either. So much  for the Broadway musical at the end of the '80s. Now let's look at the Best  Play category. This used to be won by plays like "Death of a Salesman" and  "Streetcar Named Desire" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf." The play with  the most nominations this year (seven) is . . . "Lend Me a Tenor."  </P> <P> Perhaps you haven't heard of "Lend Me a Tenor." It concerns a fellow who has to  go on stage and pretend to be an opera singer. Heyy, Abbott.  </P> <P> Actually it's more likely that this year's Best Play will be Wendy  Wasserstein's "The Heidi Chronicles." It is rueful and charming, and it is  about something: woman's liberation as it has worked out in practice since the  '60s. It's not a heavyweight play, but it's a nice middleweight one, and it's  good to have it on Broadway.  </P> <P> Where did "Heidi" come from? Off-Off-Broadway: Playwrights Horizons. It also  had a workshop at the Seattle Repertory Theatre. That's typical these days.  Years ago, plays were written directly for Broadway. Today almost all Broadway  "product" -- the word is now used without irony or apology -- comes from  someplace else.  </P> <P> There are two ways to look at this change. Critics tend to say it means that  Broadway has lost its position as the creative center of the American theater  -- that it has become a kind of shopping mall for whatever good, bad or  indifferent stuff a producer has the money to bring in, from "Nicholas  Nickleby" to "Moose Murders."  </P> <P> Alternately, you could say that nothing has changed, really; that Broadway is  still our theater's summit, the place where all American plays want to go. In  this reading, the rest of the theater world is a test track for Broadway: a  proving ground to see whether a show has got the stamina to make it in the big  time. If it doesn't get to Broadway, this proves it didn't have the stuff.  </P> <P> You wouldn't give a yearling calf a blue ribbon for being a prize bull, would  you? No. It would be equally silly to give a Tony Award to some nice little  show from Playwrights Horizons or the Seattle Rep -- that is, until it attracts  enough investor interest to be able to afford a production on 45th Street.  </P> <P> This second point of view is the one held by the League of American Theaters  and Producers, the trade association that is the muscle behind the Tony Awards.  Formerly the League of New York Theaters and Producers, this group represents  the owners and major users of the 39 Times Square-area theaters known  collectively as Broadway.  </P> <P> The league doesn't own the Tony Awards. They were invented and are awarded in  the name of the American Theatre Wing, the volunteer group that sponsored the  Stage Door Canteen in World War II. (The late Antoinette Perry -- "Tony" -- was  the Theatre Wing's guiding force in those days.)  </P> <P> But the league does have a powerful say in the administration of the Tony  Awards, particularly since the Tonys became a network TV show in 1967 -- the  only national TV broadcast that honors the theater. That "the theater" should  be equated with the Broadway theater is obviously to the league's interest, and  that is the subtext behind the show.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, it also limits to the heart of the show -- the awards themselves  -- to the current Broadway season. This can be embarrassing when the season is  as paltry as it was this year -- only 19 new shows (plus 10 revivals). Not much  of an ad for "the theater." Certainly not much of an ad for the New York  theater. American resident theater, which probably produces 200 new scripts a  year, gets at least a token nod from the Tonys, in the form of a special award  to a particular resident theater -- this year, the Hartford Stage. (Last year  it was South Coast Repertory.)  </P> <P> But Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway get no recognition at all. This is  particularly embarrassing in the case of new plays -- embarrassing, not to  Off-Broadway, but to the prestige of the Tonys as a symbol of excellence in the  theater.  </P> <P> It's easier for a serious movie to win an Oscar than it is for a serious play  to win a Tony. Either the investor interest isn't there (today's investors want  to see a return right away) or the production is doing perfectly well in a  smaller theater and doesn't particularly want to transfer.  </P> <P> A.R. Gurney's "The Cocktail Hour," for instance, has run all season at an  uptown house, the Promenade, before a clientele that in the old days would have  supported it on Broadway -- but at today's prices can't afford to.  </P> <P> The same thing happened two seasons ago with Horton Foote's "The Widow Claire"  at the downtown branch of Circle in the Square, a superbly underwritten play by  an American master.  </P> <P> Non-Broadway plays are eligible for the Pulitzer Prize in Drama, and often win  it. (Indeed, this is getting to be the rule.) Absurdly, they aren't eligible  for a Tony. But a trifle like "Lend Me a Tenor" is.  </P> <P> Playwright Peter Stone addressed the issue in a recent edition of the Theatre  Development Fund's magazine, Sightlines.  </P> <P> "The major playwrights of America are not functioning on Broadway," he writes.  "Broadway is not user-friendly to serious plays any more."  </P> <P> Stone notes that serious plays are being written and performed all over the  country and all over the city too. But these don't get "the same attention as  they would on Broadway, because it's to the interest of the real-estate people,  who are now the major producers on Broadway, to maintain their geographic  integrity."  </P> <P> "That's where their investments lie," Stone continues. "So they're desperately  hanging onto this Broadway label, as promoted by their Tony Awards. That the  major plays written in this country are not eligible for the excellence award  in the theater is becoming ludicrous."  </P> <P> Ludicrous and dangerous to the reputation of the Tony Awards and that of the  American Theatre Wing. The wing's original intention was to honor excellence in  the American theater -- as defined in 1947. The definition has changed, but the  Tonys haven't, and the chickens may come home to roost on CBS tonight.  </P> <P> As for us, we plan to honor the American theater by taking in a play.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Pedro Pradas from the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] In the past few weeks, there have been changes to  the script, aggressive changes that reflect a typically cunning  nature. The Miami press, with the backing of important  international news agencies, report an insuperable Cuban  political crisis. What a simple [ingenua] coincidence to invent  such a scandal just days before the fourth Ibero-American  summit; reports of illegal departures and naval piracy all aimed  at mocking the Cuban-U.S. international immigration laws.    Undoubtedly, these are excellent arguments that groups of  anti-Cubans living abroad and on the extreme right will use to  unleash a campaign of orgiastic accusations against Cuba, its  people's revolution and its leader, and to create a parallel  show to [word indistinct] the Cuban people from the impact of  the agreements, dialogues, and integration that will take place  among the region's presidents.    I will not mince words: No economic crisis can be sorted out  without creating political and social problems, but the  difference between the truth and their statement of an  insuperable Cuban political crisis is so great that only the  most supine, ill-intentioned ignorance, together with a desire  to molest, could repeat such information, as some news agencies  have.    Furthermore, even a dimwit can clearly see that, one way or  another, these agencies have received instructions, especially  the Spanish-speaking television stations, to ignore everything,  or almost everything, about the Cartagena de Indias summit. To  do this, they report -- as one of those stations did last night  -- that Colombia is only interested in its soccer team's  performance in the World Cup and in the Cauca tragedy.    In the same way, there's an almost funereal silence about  the  OAS Assembly in Brazil, where Cuba's reintegration into the  hemispheric organization has been strongly supported by many.  It is the same silence that surrounds the activities that  dozens of Cuban and U.S. organizations have been carrying out to  participate in a demonstration against the blockade on Cuba.    The obvious needs no refutation, but consumers should at  least receive a modest explanation that saves them from being  clients of such a deplorable enterprise. Perhaps it would be  proper to warn them using Jose Marti's words: In politics, the  most important thing is what is not seen.</p>

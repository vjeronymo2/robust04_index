			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Thos Cook looks to next summer THE RESIGNATIONS this week at tour operator Owners Abroad leave the strategy of travel agent Thomas Cook looking battered, writes Michael Skapinker. Thomas Cook took a 21 per cent stake in Owners Abroad earlier this year as part of the realignment of the industry which saw Airtours acquire retailers Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson. Thomson has owned the Lunn Poly travel outlet for 20 years. While Thomson and Airtours seem pleased with this summer's prospects, this week's events show that Owners Abroad was not. Mr Howard Klein, its outgoing chairman, said on Thursday that the company's products were too expensive. It was also trying to sell too many holidays to the sluggish eastern Mediterranean market and not enough to Spain, which is benefiting from the depreciation of the peseta. How does Thomas Cook, which is owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank and the German travel group LTU, feel about having a tour operator partner which, by its own admission, has the wrong products at the wrong price? Mr Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook's chief executive and a non-executive director of Owners Abroad, says that while the Owners management made mistakes, the glory of the holiday business is that each summer presents a new opportunity. Owners Abroad, he says, can get its holidays right next year, helped by Thomas Cook's intelligence on what is selling and what is not. It is true that tour operators can attack new destinations if the previous year's offerings failed to sell. The problem has always been that others can do so as well. The difference over previous years is that the largest tour companies have a guaranteed retail outlet for their holidays. Owners Abroad sales through Thomas Cook are up 30 per cent on last summer. A rejuvenated Owners Abroad will therefore be in a better position to recover than an independent operator which made mistakes. That assumes, however, that tour operators continue to be allowed to use their retailers in the way they are now doing. As the Office of Fair Trading is investigating these links that might be a dangerous assumption.</p>

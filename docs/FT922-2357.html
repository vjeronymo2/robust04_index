			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Government 'shooting the messenger' THE ABOLITION of Nedo was greeted with hostility by Labour and ambivalence by some Tory backbenchers in the Commons yesterday. Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor, described it as 'an act of industrial vandalism' and asked whether Nedo was paying the price for 'telling the truth' about the UK economy. After ignoring the message, the government 'shoots the messenger', he said. Its reaction to criticism, however constructive, was that the critics were to be eliminated. The favourite for the Labour leadership cited the book written in 1987 by Mr Michael Heseltine, now president of the Board of Trade and present in the chamber, which commented favourably on Nedo's potential while suggesting that the trade secretary rather than the chancellor should take the chair. 'Just as Mr Heseltine was about to claim the seat, the chancellor has whipped the chair away,' Mr Smith concluded. Mr Edward Heath, former Tory prime minister and father of the House, suggested that the decision might strengthen Mr Heseltine's hand. He said the 'vital discussions between all parts of industry for the future of this country' would be undertaken by the trade and industry secretary. He welcomed the move because it got the Treasury 'out of the way'. He added: 'In all my experience of Nedo, the Treasury was a pain in the neck.' Mr Alan Williams, former Labour industry minister, branded the announcement 'a smokescreen' to divert attention from the government's U-turn of advocating a non-interventionist role for the DTI. Mr John Wilkinson, Conservative MP for Ruislip Northwood, urged reconstitution of the trade and industry select committee. Industrial experience in the Commons was 'gravely deficient', not least in government, he said. Mr Nicholas Winterton, Tory MP for Macclesfield, asked whether there would be a forum for manufacturing industry. Mr John Spellar, Tory MP for Warley West, described Nedo as a forum where effective dialogue did take place. But Mr Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, said he could not join Mr Smith in shedding a tear for Nedo. It was time trade union leaders got back to their real jobs, rather than 'mixing with bosses and supping claret'.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Nineteen more names of dead American servicemen will be added to the Vietnam  War Memorial, raising the total number on the wall to 58,175, the National Park  Service announced. The 19 were either overlooked or were determined to meet new  criteria for having their names placed on the wall, a park service spokesman  said. Flight crew members involved in combat missions who died "out of the  combat zone" or in accidental crashes are being added to the wall in the  changes, the spokesman said. In addition to the 19, another 48 names on the  wall are being re-inscribed because spelling errors were found or objections  were raised due to other mistakes, the spokesman said.  </P></p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Chile knocks on all trade doors: An export-based economy is seeking partners everywhere When it comes to seeking out trade agreements, Chile is gaining the reputation of a bit of a flirt. Not only is Santiago courting the US in the hope of consummating a free-trade pact, but it has also sealed an agreement with Mercosur that is expected to lead to associate membership of the emerging customs zone that covers Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. As if this were not enough, Chile is later this year due to join the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group (Apec), which it hopes will coalesce into a preferential trading area. 'We have come to the conclusion that the only way to gain access to other markets is by bilateral or regional negotiations,' says Mr Juan Salazar, director of international economic relations at the Foreign Ministry. 'After we had unilaterally opened up our economy, we supported the multilateral negotiations through Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and the Uruguay Round, but this has not been enough - not all the world's markets have opened up as fast as ours.' Chile, with a domestic market of only 13m people, relies heavily on exports which account for nearly a third of its gross domestic product. It considers itself a 'global trader', dividing exports evenly among Europe, the Americas and Asia. 'That's the reason we have all these simultaneous tracks, because we don't want to depend exclusively on one region, one partner or one country,' says Mr Salazar. He admits, though, that wooing several partners at once is not without its risks. 'Sometimes the message gets confused and people wonder what we're up to.' There is also evidence that the Foreign Ministry resents being excluded from high-profile talks with the US; the official view is that Nafta falls more logically to the Finance Ministry. Whatever the complications, most exporters - ravenous for better market access - believe Chilean tactics strike a good balance. 'It's right that we have different alternatives and discuss these issues at the same time - I see no problem with that,' says Mr Claudio Garca, president of the Chilean-American Chamber of Commerce. Mr Garca rejects arguments that the deal with Mercosur could jeopardise negotiations with the US: 'I think the Americans know exactly what a free trade agreement with Chile means and I doubt that any other negotiations Chile may be carrying out will change their attitude.' Mr Garca says that, as well as stimulating trade, accords also provide arbitration mechanisms through which commercial disputes can be settled. Chile is still smarting from the 1989 poisoned grape fiasco when the US imposed a three-week embargo on Chilean fruit after discovering two grapes laced with cyanide. Such an incident, said to have cost Dollars 212m in lost revenues, is more readily avoided if there are 'clear rules of the game', Mr Garca says. Chile signed its first free-trade agreement with Mexico in 1991, after which trade between the two countries grew from Dollars 158m to Dollars 340m last year. This spurred the signing of similar accords with Venezuela in 1992 and Colombia in 1993, and the opening of talks with several other regional states. Although Chile had long been suspicious of Mercosur, its attitude slowly changed as it came to realise that it could not ignore Brazil and Argentina, its third and fourth largest trading partners respectively. The relationship was sealed last week with a protocol expected to lead to associate membership for Chile. Through Mercosur, Chile in turn hopes to win better access to European markets. 'We have to belong to one of these major regional schemes so as to negotiate with Europe as a bloc,' says Mr Salazar. 'It would be very difficult for us to achieve a bilateral Chile-European Union agreement.' The view of 'fortress Europe' looms large, and Santiago is painfully aware that, alone, it lacks negotiating clout. In the case of Asia, where Japan is challenging the US as Chile's principal trading partner and where trade is blossoming with countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, Santiago has opted to join Apec. Its hope is that this bloc too will develop into some kind of free-trade area. That leaves Nafta, the biggest prize of all. Here Chile is hostage to political wrangling in Washington and can do little but wait and see whether the US Congress passes the fast-track authority needed to start formal talks. 'If President Clinton does not get fast-track authority before congressional elections in November, I think we're doomed to take more time. If he does . . . there is a probability an agreement will be signed next year,' says Mr Garca. Mr Joaqun Vial, top adviser to the Finance Ministry, agrees that Chile must recognise its limited negotiating muscle and take its chances as they come. 'Opportunities present themselves according to a timetable beyond our control. We are not in a position to say: First Mercosur, then Nafta and then Apec.' If the door is open, he says, one must run towards it. Like many officials, Mr Vial believes that flirting with all and sundry is not just an option - it is a 'necessity'.</p>

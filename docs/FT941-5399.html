			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Management: It doesn't have to end in tears - Japanese alliances are about more than just business Japanese industry reacted with disbelief when the news broke a month ago that Germany's BMW had stolen Rover, the last British-owned car maker of any size, from under the nose of its long-standing partner, Honda. How could a western ally be so unreliable? How could Rover - and especially its perfidious parent, British Aerospace - fail so blatantly to respect the Japanese commitment to long-term relationships? Did they not realise that the affair would damage other Anglo-Japanese business links? It has since become evident that Honda will be harmed less severely than was at first feared. As the dust settles, the Japanese business community is starting to reflect more calmly on the significance of the affair for other alliances. People are now more prepared to raise questions on several counts: whether Honda was sensible to follow with Rover a strategy of 'control without takeover' which has been common for decades within Japan; whether the company should have had a better-prepared 'exit strategy' in case the Rover alliance broke down, either suddenly or gradually; whether the Japanese really do always believe that such relationships should be long-term; and whether, paradoxically, alliances involving equity participation are less likely to last than weaker types of link. Corporate collaboration is not taken lightly in Japan. When two companies overcome their mutual apprehension and decide to do a deal, it is often expected to be a long-term affair that involves more than cold-blooded business decisions. As such, Japanese companies will frequently find value in an alliance that is not obvious from a purely business point of view. Even if there are no immediate advantages in a particular link, they are often quite happy to make it as a symbolic gesture or for some vague future benefit. NEC, for example, says its stake in Bull, the loss-making French computer company, offers benefits in its computers and telecommunications businesses and an entry into the French market. But the company, which recently invested a further Y7bn (Pounds 44.58m) to maintain its stake at 4.43 per cent although IBM refused to do likewise, says there were also 'some emotional reasons' behind that decision. These include the need to help a partner in trouble. This does not mean that Japanese companies expect alliances to last forever. They are not averse to ending one that has outlived its usefulness. 'When the mutual benefit disappears,' says one manager at a Japanese electronics company, 'then in principle, the relationship should be terminated.' It is therefore seen as general practice - in Japan as in the west - to have a pre-planned exit strategy in any kind of alliance, whether it be a joint venture or one involving equity participation. 'When the stake involved is less than 50 per cent, we will include an exit strategy (in the contract),' says Koichiro Yasuda, manager of the corporate advisory division of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, which consults for many of its corporate clients. 'If you are going to tie up with another company, there is always the risk that what you put in will be wasted,' he notes. It is unclear whether Honda had a prepared exit strategy. But the aspect of British Aerospace's action over Rover which most unsettled Japanese minds was that it chose BMW, a new suitor, over a long-term partner simply because the German company made a better financial offer. 'There are hardly any cases in Japan of owners cashing out, so the main point for both sides is whether the two companies can be integrated,' Yasuda points out. 'Price is a secondary consideration.' That sensitivity towards cultural integration plays an important part in Japanese thinking on acquisitions, whether they are cross-border or otherwise. Past experience of takeover problems, plus their current shortage of funds, has turned Japanese companies increasingly to strategic alliances as a means of getting what they want from another company. This preference is likely to grow. As industries become more global, it is important but virtually impossible for one company to have a full presence in all the important geographic regions, says Yasuo Tsuchiya, general manager of the business strategy department at Mitsubishi Research Institute. At the same time, many companies are finding that the most effective, and least troublesome, strategic relationships are narrowly defined. 'Alliances will from now on be on a smaller, more focused basis,' Tsuchiya asserts. 'They will be looser, more like networks.' Such relationships also make for an easier exit. When a Japanese company does take a stake in its western partner, it faces a choice over how to operate. The traditional way is described by James Abbeglen, an American consultant who has worked in Japan for 40 years, as 'takeover without takeover': the stronger company takes the lead, and the weaker becomes, in effect, its dependent supplier. Abbeglen says this is how Honda was starting to treat Rover. One top Japanese manager with considerable experience of dealing with western companies describes this as an 'old-style' way of seeing an alliance, and not a model of how to give it long life; he calls it 'fundamentally flawed'. He sees Fujitsu's handling of its UK computer subsidiary, ICL, as more enlightened, and more of a partnership.</p>

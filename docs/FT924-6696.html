			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Industry sheds 10,000 jobs: Blow to ministers' recovery hopes Rate of cuts growing says Bank ANNOUNCEMENTS of almost 10,000 job cuts across British industry yesterday set back government hopes of an upturn in economic confidence. The cuts included 3,500 jobs at the Royal Bank of Scotland over the next five years and 5,000 at British Rail. The announcements were a disappointment for ministers who hoped the Autumn Statement last week would be a turning point in economic optimism and restore the government's standing. They coincided with the publication of the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin, which said companies have been shedding labour at an accelerating rate as productivity in manufacturing and services has risen. In spite of the news, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the Commons the Treasury's achievement had been 'to create the conditions for a return of confidence and so remove a barrier to growth'. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the job cuts showed the economy was 'not only still stuck in recession, but that decline is sharpening'. He said the government should introduce an emergency employment programme. Unemployment has reached its highest level for 5 1/2 years, according to figures released last week. The seasonally adjusted rise in unemployment in October was 24,200, taking the total to 2.87m. Yesterday's job loss announcements included: 3,500 jobs over five years at the Royal Bank of Scotland out of a total of 13,000 in branch banking as it reforms branch services and automates some routine processing jobs. The bank believed that staff turnover would enable it to restrict redundancies to fewer than 300 per year. 550 jobs at Blue Circle Industries which said it was closing a sixth of its UK cement-making capacity and eliminating a fifth of its workforce because of the severe and continuing recession afflicting the industry. 200 redundancies at Eagle Star Life among clerical staff. 390 job losses at National Westminster Bank and its subsidiary Lombard North Central be-cause of 'continuing recession'. 5,000 jobs from British Rail's workforce of 138,000 over the next four months in an attempt to bring costs into line with what it called a 'massive' drop in revenues. The job losses, most of which BR hopes will be voluntary, will fall upon management and administrative staff as well as blue collar workers. BR blamed the cuts on recession, saying latest forecasts for the year to next March pointed to a Pounds 400m loss of revenues from its passenger and freight businesses. Turnover in the previous year was Pounds 3.2bn. BR also warned of further cuts, putting part of the blame on the 'tight' financial settlement imposed on the railway in the Autumn Statement. The Department of Transport said the statement had left BR Pounds 230m better off in cash terms over the next two years. BR said income from its InterCity and Network SouthEast operations were expected to be at least Pounds 100m lower than forecast this year, and its profitable Trainload Freight business had lost income because of the effect of recession on its biggest customers. On current forecasts, customer receipts in the year to next March would be 14 per cent down on the 1988 level. In the past two years, BR has added almost 4,000 to staff numbers, partly in response to increased safety spending.

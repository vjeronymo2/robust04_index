"I am convinced that the personnel of the Russian Armed  Forces will remain loyal to the constitution, the military oath  and duty, cherish the military rank and army comradeship",  Yeltsin said in a message of greetings to the armed forces and  war veterans on the occasion of the day of motherland defenders  marked on February 23.    "The armed forces are a core of the Russian statehood,  guarantor of peace, stability and democratic gains. They should  be powerful, mobile and equipped with the most efficient  armaments. The state will do everything to increase the  prestige of military profession and make servicemen and members  of their families feel better protected in the social sphere,"  the president added.    "The day of motherland defenders is a special holiday. It is  marked by the entire people, who pay tribute and show respect  and gratitude to Russian servicemen.    "Russian servicemen were the first to counteract forces,  which tried to destroy our state with fire and sword and enslave  our people. They saved Russia in the most difficult, mortally  dangerous moments of war.    "You, the servicemen of the armed forces, are worthy heirs  and successors of military traditions. At a time of trial you  show restraint and firmness and honestly fulfill the  professional and civic duty.    "I wish you, dear servicemen, your dear and near, veterans  and civilian personnel of the armed forces, health, happiness  and prosperity. Glory, honor and gratitude to you for your hard  work and success to you in life and military service!" says the  message.</p>

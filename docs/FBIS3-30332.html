			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andor Mandoky, head of the Economic </F> Committee of the Christian Democratic People's Party, by Henrik  Hammang; place and date not given: "Reevaluted Debt"]    [Text] The parties running in the upcoming elections,  including the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], have  formulated their economic programs. We asked Andor Mandoky,  head of the Economic Commmittee of the KDNP, about the Christian  Democrats' economic concepts.    [Hammang] The KDNP often criticized the current  privatization practice. Will there be any change in this if you  are part of the government in the next four years too?    [Mandoky] We regard privatization as a fundamental issue of  the new social and economic order. The new structure and the  functioning of the economy will improve through privatization.  We formulated our views on the issue at our congress held in  Godollo in the spring of 1992. We had reservations regarding  the methods of this process that started before the elections,  methods that we took over without criticism in order to shape  our new order. We want an evident list of property, something  required by law. On the basis of this, we want a systematic  privatization process, as well as openness, supervision  possibilities, and the discovery of abuses. We are in favor of  the emergence of broad strata of owners. We are in favor of  developing strata of small and medium-size entrepreneurs.    [Hammang] Many people claim that only a reform of the state  administration could lead to real changes in the economy. Do  you have any relevant concepts in your program?    [Mandoky] Our economic program contains the reform of state  administration, together with a program ensuring an economic  revival as soon as possible. Experts are currently working on  this. We think that a rational reduction of expenses in itself  will not solve the problems of economic crisis and state  administration. We count much more on the positive effect of an  increase in production and services. Therefore, we attribute  great importance to privatization in this respect. It is a  basic requirement for both domestic and foreign buyers to use  the property obtained at a favorable cost, rather than reduce  it, use it up, or take it out. They should create jobs and  provide services at competitive prices.    The useful handling of state property is the other area with  considerable resources. Saving and operating the viable  state-owned production capacities for purposes of taxation and  employment represents the basis of our economic program. The  resulting positive processes could indirectly help the problems  facing the budget by increasing the income.    [Hammang] One can mostly achieve an increase in income by  increasing taxes. However, we can no longer follow this road.  Is there a solution at all?    [Mandoky] In our view, for a more proportional tax burden,  it is necessary to reexamine our taxation system, including a  shift from income-type taxation to consumer-type taxation, the  taxation of big properties, and focusing on a family-type  taxation in the personal income tax.    We also think that strengthening the taxation discipline is  essential for financial stability. Supervision should be  strengthened in order to discover the hidden incomes.  Investments and research-development should be encouraged  through tax allowances, and the tax policy should serve ventures  that increase investment and create jobs.    [Hammang] In addition to helping the ventures, it is  important to develop a welfare network. Are there any  possibilities of increasing welfare expenses in the near future?    [Mandoky] Welfare expenses are closely connected to the  economic situation. It was not by accident that we Christian  Democrats were the first to turn to economic issues, because we  have a strong commitment to correctly handling the social  problems.    Halting regression and starting an economic revival are the  basic goals of our economic program. We know that this is a  process that needs a longer time. Economic revival depends on  the prevailing economic program and the professional abilities  serving the implementation of this program. At the moment, it  is irresponsible to promise an increase in the standard of  living and to suggest the need to further increase the welfare  burdens and expenses. We must concentrate all our efforts to  accelerate the economy and to increase production, services, and  exports.    [Hammang] However, all this is hindered by the debt burden  left to us by the previous regime and the need to repay the  interest.    [Mandoky] We have repeatedly expressed our position on the  issue of debt servicing and credits, and this problem makes up  one chapter of our program. Naturally, we accept the repayment  of our debts. However, we wonder about the heavy burden of debt  servicing, a burden that questions our ability to emerge from  the prevailing economic crisis. Therefore, we think that a  reexamination of the problem is justified in any case.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Three more people belonging to a bogus armed unit  closely connected with the "Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement"  were arrested in Tuol Kouk Ward on the morning of 18 February in  the wake of a mopping-up operation conducted recently in the O  Bek K'am area.    So far, 51 armed people who trespassed on the people's land  in the three districts of Phnom Penh and put up armed resistance  against government security forces on the afternoon of 17  February have been arrested, along with some firearms.    A military police officer who took part in the campaign to  crack down on anarchy said that the operation -- conducted in an  area of Sivatha Street, north of Phsa Depot Market, where the  three culprits were arrested -- could not be regarded as a  success because an important person was able to escape. It has  been learned that the man, who called himself Lieutenant General  Men Samkol, was one of the ringleaders behind the illegal  occupation of public land.    According to a reliable source, among the ringleaders, a man  named Brigadier General Leng Serei claimed to be the commander  of Division 015 of the Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement's  national forces. It was also Leng Serei who lined his own  pockets by issuing bogus titles to the illegally occupied plots  of land.    The same source said that among the 51 people who were  arrested, a man identified himself as Lt. Gen. Tep Phirum, a  senior officer in the headquarters of the Khmer Angkor  Resistance Movement's Division 015. It is not yet known where  the bogus general was arrested. Tep Phirum also said that he is  an officer in the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] tank unit.  The KRAF General Staff has confirmed, however, that the name of  that person as well as the names of his accomplices were not in  its records.    It was also said that these bogus armed units, which claimed  to be part of the Khmer Angkor Resistance Movement and caused  anarchy and fired on government security forces on the afternoon  of 17 February, were not officially recognized by the Defense  Ministry or the Royal Government.    Although the cause of the trespassing is not yet known, it  is  suspected that the groups intended to commit sabotage against  the government. According to analysts, the strategically  important area is located between the state radio station and  Pochentong Airport.    A reliable source said the KRAF General Staff's Second  Bureau  is actively investigating in order to arrest the ringleaders of  the armed groups.    It is worth recalling that the Khmer Angkor Resistance  Movement has frequently been involved in deceitful troop  recruitment activities in the recent past.</p>

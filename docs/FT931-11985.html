			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Palmerston drops Pounds 5.8m into the red Shares of Palmerston Holdings fell from 25p to 13p yesterday after the property group reported a Pounds 5.78m pre-tax loss in the six months to September 30. That compared with profits last time of Pounds 476,137. The result was after an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.85m for associated company guarantees and Pounds 1m for associated company doubtful debt. Mr Philip Rose, chairman, said the values of the group's properties had declined since the last balance sheet date, which together with the continuing support needed by associates, had resulted in a breach of the group's covenants with its bankers. Accordingly, the group was in discussion with its bankers regarding the continued availability of facilities. Losses per share were 26.99p (earnings 2.12p).</p>

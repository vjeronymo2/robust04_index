			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ahold ahead despite dip in contribution from US AHOLD, the Dutch-based food retailer, increased net profit by 11.4 per cent to Fl 76.2m (Dollars 41.2m) in the second quarter of 1993, with higher results in the Netherlands and Europe compensating for slightly lower results in the US. The second-quarter increase, which followed a 13 per cent rise in the first quarter, takes net profit for the first half to Fl 172.4m. Group sales in the second quarter rose by nearly 30 per cent to Fl 6.3bn, largely due to the first-time consolidation of Schuitema, a Dutch food wholesaler which is majority-owned by Ahold, and to acquisitions in the Netherlands and Portugal. If these factors are excluded, the rise in sales totalled 8.3 per cent. Ahold, which generates about half of its sales through supermarket chains in the eastern US, said US operating profit fell slightly to Dollars 38.9m, from Dollars 41.8m in the second quarter of 1992. Three of its US chains produced higher operating results, but its First National supermarket chain posted lower profits. In the Netherlands, operating profit registered a strong 43.4 per cent rise to Fl 61.9m, partly due to new consolidations. But even after adjusting for this factor, operating profit still showed an increase of 23.5 per cent. European results swung into an operating profit of Fl 15.1m from a loss of Fl 3.5m. Ahold attributed the improvement almost entirely to its rapid expansion in Portugal. The Dutch group continues to post start-up losses in the Czech Republic.</p>

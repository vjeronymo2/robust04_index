			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Islamabad, London--The two commanders of the Afghan  rebels are preparing to travel to Tehran in an attempt to obtain  more Iranian support for their confrontation with interim  President Borhanoddin Rabbani.    Afghan and Pakistani sources have stated that Golboddin  Hekmatyar, interim prime minister and leader of the Hezb-e  Eslami, has requested an invitation to visit Tehran. The Uzbek  leader, 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, who has been prominent as a strong  man in the tripartite alliance including himself, Hekmatyar, and  the Shiite leader 'Ali Mazari, will also visit the Iranian  capital.    A conference in Tehran including the Uzbek, Shiite, and  Pashtun commanders may lead to the formation of a new allied  government that will attempt to force the removal of Rabbani and  his unseen administration.    Hekmatyar, who has rejected a fasting month (Ramadan)  ceasefire, contacted the Iranian foreign minister, 'Ali Akbar  Velayati, by telephone yesterday demanding that Iran take on a  greater role in ending the conflict in Afghanistan.    Dostam and Hekmatyar hope to mobilize Iranian, Uzbek, and  Russian support to counter the increasing pressure from  Pakistan, the Islamic Conference Organization, and the United  Nations.    Rabbani has not yet been able to obtain support for his plan  to host a conference of well-known personalities, tribal leaders  and religious leaders to select a new government. In the last  few days, he has faced mounting pressure, especially from  Pakistan, to agree to resign as soon as a peace conference is  convened.    Dostam and Hekmatyar counter the Rabbani plan with a demand  to conduct public elections under the auspices of the United  Nations within three months after the ceasefire. Their condition  [for this] remains the resignation of Rabbani.</p>

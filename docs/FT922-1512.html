			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Low-cost homes policy criticised PLANNING deals with developers offer only limited scope to increase the supply of affordable housing for rent, according to a report published today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social research organisation. Ministers have urged councils to negotiate with developers for a 'quota' of low-cost housing for rent on larger development sites when granting planning permission. The homes could be let through housing associations to families on council waiting lists or to homeless people in order to bridge the expected shortfall in affordable housing for rent. The Rowntree report, however, says the number of inexpensive homes for rent provided by such arrangements is unlikely to exceed 2,000 a year during the next five years. Three quarters of councils surveyed had considered using planning agreements to create affordable housing. Only 18 per cent had the powers to insist that developers provide such housing in private developments. Most schemes involved transfers of land - normally to housing associations - free or below market price. Only 18 per cent involved the developer in building homes and giving them to the association or transferring them at cost. The report concludes that planning agreements have some potential but are an imprecise way of meet-ing targets for affordable housing. It also suggests that more affordable housing might be built if developers made cash payments into an affordable housing fund to provide homes on alternative sites.

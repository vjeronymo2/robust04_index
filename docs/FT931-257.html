			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Altman goes on trial on BCCI charges: US lawyer pleads not guilty MR ROBERT Altman, a US lawyer, went on trial in New York yesterday in the first criminal hearing related to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) affair since the bank was shut by regulators in July 1991. Mr Altman, 46, is standing trial alone. He and Mr Clark Clifford, his law partner and mentor, face charges of fraud and receiving Dollars 40m in bribes. Both have pleaded not guilty. The trial of Mr Clifford, a powerful Washington player who served as President Lyndon Johnson's defence secretary, and adviser to four presidents, has been delayed because of his illness. Mr Clifford's lawyers have argued that the 86-year-old's heart condition might kill him if he is forced to stand trial. Mr Altman's trial is expected to last about two months. It stems from BCCI-related charges announced last summer by Mr Robert Morgenthau, New York's district attorney. Mr Altman was indicted for allegedly misleading regulators about BCCI's secret control of a US bank, First American Bankshares, of which Mr Altman was president and Mr Clifford chairman. Mr Altman was also charged with receiving bribes from BCCI in the form of 'sham loans and stock deals'. Judge John Bradley, who is hearing the case in Manhattan's Supreme Court, later threw out conspiracy charges against Mr Clifford and Mr Altman. BCCI was shut in 1991 after audits showed rampant fraud. Some Dollars 550m of its US assets were forfeited as part of a settlement between its liquidators and the US authorities over fraud, racketeering and money laundering by the bank before its collapse. Mr Altman is facing another trial in June on federal charges of conspiring to defraud the Federal Reserve Board.</p>

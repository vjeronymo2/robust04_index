			<p>BFN     [Text] The office of the Chamber of Deputies continued its  consultations on 19 April. For the second consecutive day, the  office of the Chamber, including Chamber President Frantz Robert  Monde, met on 19 April, first with media directors, and later  with Army authorities. The consultations were begun on 18 April  by the Chamber of Deputies in an effort to find a solution and  fill the political vacuum at the head of the executive. Edner  Jean filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Jean] All the major media in the capital  were present at this meeting. In their tete-a-tete with the  office of the Chamber of Deputies, the representatives of the  fourth power stressed their concerns, first as citizens, and  further as journalists. They expressed their apprehension with  respect to the future, whether the press would even exist, given  the difficulties of functioning in such an environment. One of  them pointed out that recent predictions regarding the complete  disappearance of the press are being realized. Accustomed to  reporting on the divergent positions of politicians, the media  are well placed to understand that the solution to the crisis  will not occur tomorrow.    President Frantz Robert Monde clearly expressed this on  Tuesday, 19 April, while insisting on the increasingly urgent  need to fill the vacuum in the post of prime minister.    From this consultation, the representatives of radio, print,  and television emerged with the clear impression that the  political decisionmakers are feeling hot and cold, while  expecting the worst. Despite this pessimistic vision, the  meeting was reportedly very fruitful. Let us listen successively  to Max Chauvet from LE NOUVELLISTE, and Mario Viau Signal FM:    [Chauvet] Without being pessimistic, I would say there is  still no opening for a solution.    [Jean] Did you make proposals to the president?    [Chauvet] No, we did not really make proposals to the  president. We spoke more as Haitian citizens. We expressed our  feelings. It is a very complicated problem. We tried to consider  the problem from various points of view -- from the political,  economic, humanitarian, and other points of view. Frankly, I  believe that the president of the Chamber wanted the feedback of  what we thought. He received feedback from us, but I cannot  say... [pauses] We did not discuss a particular plan. We would  like the political sectors involved in the crisis to meet in  order to defend the children of this country who are dying. It  is necessary to do something, so we are asking that the  antagonists, to save this country, hold a meeting about lifting  the embargo on Haiti.    [Jean] Beyond these wishes, the media representatives  refrained from giving their opinion on the current political  debate in the country, a debate stuck between the parliamentary  plan -- application of Article 149 of the Constitution, as  recommended by the office of Senator Bernard Sansaricq; or  Article 148 of the Constitution.    The media have other questions to ask:    [Viau] The question is not which is the best solution, but  which project will be accepted by the concerned parties. If it  is not accepted by the concerned parties, it is difficult to  implement. First of all, it is necessary to find a project that  could get the approval of the concerned parties. That was our  viewpoint. It is not a matter of finding that solution A is  better than solution B, but which one will be accepted by all  the parties, because finally, we had some proposals for a  solution. They were all rejected. [end recording]    There are the directors of conscience, speaking after  listening for too long to politicians.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: When time stood still. . . The Royal Court Theatre Upstairs is a small space, and the first thing you notice about the set of Hammett's Apprentice is that the seating has been reduced to five rows by a needlessly large stage. Everything else about the production is over-extended. Time itself seems to move slowly during the 150 minute play; or perhaps that is just the effect of altitude in the Upstairs studio. Hammett's Apprentice by Kevin Hood charts the emotional career of Mary, Cambridge mathematician and bellicose feminist. She is haunted by one of the Tolpuddle martyrs (James Hammett from Dorset in the 1830s), plagued by a dreadful mother, and troubled by a dying grandmother. Mary meets Alistair whilst attempting suicide from the 15th floor, lives with him, and takes him home to her grandmother's funeral. It makes lumbering drama. The play has the feel of Ken Loach's excellent film, Raining Stones, about the same Catholic working class culture. But Hammett's Apprentice lacks a moral, spiritual and dramatic centre. There is little to be learned historically and less to be gleaned psychologically. However, Hood writes well enough to suggest a waste of effort. And the superb acting of Ewan Hooper and Mary MacLeod as the grandparents sustains the interest if not the action of the evening. There are vivid moments from Lee Ross as a 1980s over-entrepreneur who stays in touch with the markets via a box of stolen portable phones. But Hood never creates people and issues strong enough to sustain a plot. Repeatedly, characters present their histories as intrinsically interesting, and the action falters into a series of encounters between people trawling though the past. Stage drama happens in the present. Hammett's Apprentice runs parallel to where it should, and needs to be trimmed down, put into the present and adapted for radio.

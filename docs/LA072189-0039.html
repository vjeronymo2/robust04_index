			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 4 ABORTION PROTESTERS ARRESTED AT CLINIC  </P> <P> Four abortion protesters were arrested Thursday morning at a San Marcos medical  clinic when they refused to leave the waiting room and remove the chain with  which they had bound themselves together, according to a spokesman for the San  Diego County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> The protesters blocked patients who were trying to enter the office, according  to Connie Carson, a secretary for the doctor, George Kung. She said she called  police when the protesters refused to leave. "The patients can't exactly jump  over them," she said.  </P> <P> When sheriff's officers arrived, all but four of the approximately 15  demonstrators in the street and waiting room dispersed, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Those arrested were identified as Angela Phelps, 31, of El Cajon; Georgiana  Cheek, 37, of Santee; Nancy Scofield, 40, of Poway and Dean Mesa, 30.  </P> <P> Mesa's address was not released because he is a former county sheriff's deputy,  a County Jail spokesman in Vista said.  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / BAe shows Pounds 2.9bn leasing exposure British Aerospace disclosed yesterday that it has aircraft leasing obligations of Pounds 2.9bn, compared with income that it expects to receive on sub-leases to airlines of Pounds 1.8bn. Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director, said that losses on these leases and the costs of restructuring the aviation business brought BAe near to collapse over the past couple of years. 'We got very close,' he said. Only an undisclosed part of sub-lease income is contractually committed, though the group believes its estimate of what it will receive is prudent. At the end of last year, provisions to cover the risk of leasing losses stood at Pounds 653m. BAe sold aircraft to banks and leased them back under agreements lasting between 15 and 20 years, depending on aircraft type. It then rented them on sub-leases of between three and five years to airlines. Losses are made by BAe if sub-leases are not renewed. Mr Lapthorne said that, in the past, BAe booked profits on these sales to banks and made only small provisions to cover the risk of these losses. 'We have over-reported profits in the past,' he said. Mr Terry Smith, analyst at brokers Collins Stewart, said: 'These leasing liabilities are extraordinary. We thought BAe was selling the planes to airlines rather than renting them out on a short term basis.' In the past three years, BAe's commercial aircraft division has lost Pounds 1.79bn in aggregate, including exceptional reorganisation costs and provisions against losses on the leases, but excluding tax and interest payments.

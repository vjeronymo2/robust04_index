			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIETS REACH PACT ON GRAIN SALES;  </P> <P> TRADE: U.S.S.R. WILL BUY MORE THAN $1-BILLION WORTH OF AMERICAN FARMERS'  PRODUCTS ANNUALLY UNDER TERMS OF FIVE-YEAR DEAL.  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union have reached agreement on a new grain  purchase that guarantees more than $1 billion of annual American grain sales to  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The deal was announced in Washington today by U.S. Agriculture Secretary  Clayton K. Yeutter and Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills.  </P> <P> The five-year pact calls for minimum Soviet purchases of at least 10 million  metric tons of U.S. wheat, corn, soybeans or soy meal exports to the Soviet  Union each year. That is up from 9 million tons in the current pact.  </P> <P> The new agreement will succeed the current one, which expires next Dec. 31.  Moscow will also have greater flexibility in choosing between purchasing wheat  and feed grains on a year-to-year basis.  </P> <P> The new pact was agreed to at a meeting in Vienna between U.S. and Soviet  negotiators and was hailed by Yeutter and Hills as "a welcome advance in the  relations between the United States and the U.S.S.R."  </P> <P> Julius Katz, deputy U.S. trade representative, said in Vienna, "We think this  is a good deal, that it assures U.S. farmers of a stable market over the life  of the agreement."  </P> <P> Yeutter said only a few technical issues remained to be worked out. He said the  agreement should be ready to be signed within a few weeks and possibly could be  finalized at the U.S.-Soviet summit in June.  </P> <P> An Administration spokesman said the grain would be sold at "competitive" terms  and dodged a question if that meant subsidized prices might be offered. The  United States has routinely offered discounts on wheat.  </P> <P> U.S.-Soviet grain pacts stretch back to the mid-1970s. They help lock in  exports for American farmers and protect the Soviet Union, the world's biggest  grain buyer, against supply disruptions.  </P> <P> Even when President Jimmy Carter suspended grain trade with the Kremlin in 1980  because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Soviet Union was allowed to  buy the grain specified in the grain agreement.  </P> <P> Under the new pact, the Soviet Union will be required to purchase annually at  least 4 million tons each of wheat and feed grain with a balance that can be  fulfilled with purchases of wheat, feed grains, soybeans or soybean meal.  </P> <P> In any one year the Soviet Union can substitute up to 750,000 tons of one  commodity for another.  </P> <P> At the first round of grain talks last December, the Soviet Union asked that  the minimum purchase level be cut to 6 million tons of grain, but the United  States said it could not accept anything lower than 9 million tons.  </P></p>

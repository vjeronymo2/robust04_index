			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Semyon Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Kazakhstan does not  recognize the Baykonur space launching grounds as a Russian  military base and demands its demilitarization, as the Kazakh  Constitution proclaims the absence of foreign military bases on  republican territory, Kazakh state adviser Tulegen Zhukeyev told  a meeting of Russian and Kazakh experts here today.    A Russian-Kazakh intergovernment memorandum on "Mutual  Understanding in Maintenance of the Baykonur Space Launching  Grounds" was signed a month ago and membership of an  intergovernment commission for Baykonur has been confirmed. The  commission is expected to prepare draft bilateral documents on  status and conditions of the use of Baykonur and the town of  Leninsk and rent of Baykonur and Leninsk facilities within two  months.    Under the memorandum, Russian military units were to  temporarily stay on Baykonur territory and the launching grounds  themselves were to be rented by Russia. However, the Kazakh  side continues to insist on Baykonur demilitarization, meanwhile  preparations and launches of rocket boosters and spacecraft are  so far impossible without servicemen of the Russian aero-space  forces. The Russian side wants to rent Baykonur which is in  principle supported by Kazakhstan.    The rent term is so far unclear (a rent period of less than  30 years is inefficient for Russia). Kazakhstan has its own  notion of the rent and it will be the most difficult to agree on  the rent amount. Thus, Russia may have to boost the creation of  its own launching grounds (a project of the sort is already  available) to include defence and security tasks now solved only  in Baykonur.    Another acute question is the Kazakh demand for compensation  for the damage done by Russian organizations at Baykonur space  launching grounds and other three testing grounds located on  Kazakh territory. According to estimations, the full cost of  restoration of basic assets and Russian compensation for  1992-1993 maintenance and use of Baykonur and the testing  grounds exceeds seven billion U.S. dollars.    Baykonur seems to be used for bargaining and pressure on  Russia. It has been established that the population was harmed  only by nuclear tests in Semipalatinsk, and not a single nuclear  explosion was registered there since the moment Russia  proclaimed sovereignty. Thus, Russia cannot be responsible for  damage done to the population in the past.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA has decided to require test shielding of the pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief device during the horizontal bonfire test. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notes that the purpose of this test is to replicate the effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fires on the pressure relief device and the fuel container as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. Requiring shielding will assure that the bonfire test is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating the fuel container as a whole, rather than merely the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief device, since a flame that impinges on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief device, could activate prematurely. Requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shielding, rather than simply allowing it, will assure repeatable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and consistent test results. The rule also requires shielding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pressure relief device during the vertical bonfire test,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except where the container is fitted with a pressure relief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device on only one end. In that case, the container is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positioned with the pressure relief device on top, so as to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct contact with the flame.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Test Gas and Pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the CNG container be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurized with either nitrogen or air to 100 percent of service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure for the bonfire test. The agency acknowledged that NGV2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifies the use of CNG, but tentatively concluded that using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitrogen or air as the test gas would be safer than using CNG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA and Tecogen recommended that CNG be used as the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas. Tecogen further commented that the container manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have historically conducted such tests using CNG and are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore well aware of the necessary safety precautions. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further stated that using CNG as the test gas would reveal the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure relief valve's effectiveness with respect to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge rate. AAMA commented that CNG should be used as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test gas because the thermal properties of CNG differ from those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of nitrogen and air and NGV2 specifies the use of CNG as the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas. AAMA also recommended that the CNG containers be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurized at the start of the test to 95 to 100 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service pressure, but offered no rationale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using CNG as the test gas would better reflect the real-world  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions in a fire, since the test gas would be the same as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas used in CNG containers. The agency notes that the bonfire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test addresses the responsiveness of the pressure relief device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that air and nitrogen have different thermal properties than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG. Therefore, the pressure relief device might perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differently if air or nitrogen were used instead of CNG. In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPRM, the agency explained that using CNG as a test gas might not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be safe. These initial concerns have been allayed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments indicating that manufacturers are aware of and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accustomed to taking the necessary safety precautions when using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG as a test gas to evaluate a container. NHTSA notes that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided not to specify CNG as the test gas in the CNG vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. Nevertheless, the agency believes that differences in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaction to heat are important for the bonfire test, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves high temperatures, but not for crash tests, which do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve such temperatures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA continues to believe that it is necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurize the CNG container to 100 percent of service pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the outset of the test. The agency has determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers need to be tested at full service pressure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent the worst case scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Wind Velocity and Direction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM and SNPRM, NHTSA did not address the allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wind velocity and direction. The agency received comments from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGVC, CGA, and PST stating that a limit should be placed on wind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> velocity to increase the bonfire test's repeatability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the average wind velocity at the container during the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not exceed 2.24 meters per second (5 mph). The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that permitting higher crosswinds would vary or reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the flame's heat. Therefore, placing limits on the crosswind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assures the test's repeatability and the level of stringency that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency anticipated in proposing this test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Bonfire Fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the fire for the bonfire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests be generated using No. 2 diesel fuel. This fuel type was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed so that the standard would be consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bonfire test in NGV2, which also specifies this type of fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NGVC, CGA, AAMA, and Norris commented that the agency should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify a different fuel to generate the bonfire that is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmentally sound. CGA stated that the large amounts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoke that would be created by burning the diesel fuel are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrary to the environmental objectives of developing CNG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. NGVC and Norris suggested using a CNG or propane grill  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the comments and other available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, NHTSA has decided to specify the use of No. 2 diesel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel in the final rule. The agency is aware of the environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems associated with this type of fuel and will further study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether other fuels should be used to generate the bonfire test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, until the agency can determine that a different fuel is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an appropriate replacement for diesel fuel, the Standard will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify No. 2 diesel fuel for use in the bonfire test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Bonfire Test Fuel Pan Depth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the bonfire test pan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing No. 2 diesel fuel be at least 100 centimeters (cm)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deep. The agency specified a depth to ensure that there would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an adequate amount of fuel to run the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAMA, Comdyne, CGA, Alusuisse, and PST commented that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel pan depth was excessive. Alusuisse stated that a pan of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed size would contain more than 1,000 liters of fuel. PST  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that a 100 millimeter (mm) depth would be more reasonable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CGA, AAMA, and Comdyne stated that the depth of the fuel pan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be specified so long as a sufficient quantity of fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is provided for the test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency intended to propose a depth of 100 mm. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to a typographical error, it proposed a depth of 100 cm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA agrees that a fuel pan with a depth of at least 100 cm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be too deep. NHTSA also agrees that the fuel pan's depth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not need to be specified, provided that there is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient amount of fuel to maintain the fire for the duration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the test. Accordingly, the agency has removed the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for fuel pan depth and has replaced it with the provision that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  there be ``sufficient fuel to burn for at least 20 minutes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes that this provision is consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test's purpose of simulating a severe fire by raising the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container's temperature and pressure by completely surrounding it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with flames produced by a specific fuel type.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Labeling Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to require that container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers certify that each of their containers complies with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed equipment requirements and permanently label the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container with the following information: the symbol ``DOT'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute a certification by the manufacturer that the container  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conforms to all requirements of the standard; the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture of the container; the name and address of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container manufacturer; and the maximum service pressure. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency stated that labeling the container would provide vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers and consumers with assurance that they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchasing containers that comply with the Federal safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. In addition, the agency believed that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement would facilitate the agency's enforcement efforts by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing a ready means of identifying the container and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

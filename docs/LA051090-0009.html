			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> PULL THE PLUG ON SALVADOR'S NO-WIN WAR;  </P> <P> ONLY A U.S. AID CUT WILL GET BOTH SIDES TO NEGOTIATE A PEACE.  </P> <P> After 10 years, Congress appears primed to cut military aid to El Salvador in  another attempt to bring that country's civil war to a negotiated peace.  Legislation headed for House debate next week would cut half of the $85 million  budgeted for this year and cancel the remainder if the Salvadoran government  does not make progress on several fronts concerning peace and justice.  </P> <P> With all due respect to the proponents, this is just another halfway measure.  It would only perpetuate the game-playing we've been mired in for the last  decade. Our government must have the decency to drop the pretenses that it has  used to sell its El Salvador policy. As a first step, we must tell the  Salvadoran military that we've got their number, that we will no longer support  their subversion of democracy.  </P> <P> The paralysis of the situation was made clear to Congress by a task force  chaired by Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.), which reported that the official  investigation into the murder of the six Jesuits last November has "come to a  virtual standstill." Although soldiers conducted the massacre of the priests  and two employees at the Jesuit-run Central American University, there has been  no effort to determine whether the armed forces high command played a role.  Last weekend, it was reported that evidence crucial to the prosecution was  missing, and that soldiers who were potential witnesses had been transferred  abroad and were unavailable to testify.  </P> <P> That may be the last straw. Finally, our government may be persuaded to  consider whether U.S. military assistance to El Salvador is in anyone's best  interest. A diplomatic settlement must be worked out. And negotiations toward  such a settlement must be tied to a wider agreement for the whole of Central  America.  </P> <P> The civil war in El Salvador is unwinnable. The army has not prevailed, even  with billions of dollars of U.S. support, including state-of-the-art training  and equipment. Similarly, the FMLN guerrillas have demonstrated that they are  unable to win and cannot be defeated.  </P> <P> The alternative to a diplomatic settlement, therefore, is another decade of  brutal violence that decides nothing.  </P> <P> All that Archbishop Oscar A. Romero predicted about the results of U.S.  military aid has come true in spades. In February, 1980, Romero wrote to  President Jimmy Carter begging him not to send military assistance to the  government of El Salvador, warning that a blood bath would ensue. A month  later, Romero himself was felled by an assassin's bullet.  </P> <P> U.S. military assistance came nonetheless, in the form of advisers and training  teams and money for aircraft, artillery, sophisticated weapons of war and  ammunition. And the blood flowed. In 10 years, more than 70,000 people have  been killed, most of them civilians, including infants and children and church  workers and charity volunteers whose only offense was trying to care for the  hungry, the orphaned, the sick.  </P> <P> The Jesuit priests and their housekeepers who were brutally murdered in  November were not the last to be killed by bullets made in the U.S.A. In  February, 16 children were among the civilians killed or maimed by an  unprovoked Salvadoran Air Force attack on the village of Corral de Piedra in  Chalatenango province.  </P> <P> President Alfredo Cristiani's government has had a year in office to prove  itself, and has been found wanting. The persistent abuses by the Salvadoran  military, the mockery of justice, the refusal to pursue a non-military  settlement of the civil war should be proof enough to anyone that our policy is  on the wrong course.  </P> <P> Our government needs to get three messages across to the Salvadoran government  and the military Establishment: First, we will no longer make excuses for their  failings or finance their corrupt practices and human-rights abuses. Second, we  will not waste the U.S. taxpayers' money to feed the tragic illusion that there  can be a military solution to El Salvador's problems. Instead, our government  will commit itself at the highest level to fostering a negotiated settlement as  part of a wider diplomatic approach to security for the region as a whole.  Finally, we are willing to participate in the development of a plan to replace  the military aid with the economic assistance so desperately needed to address  the causes of the conflict that is destroying El Salvador.  </P></p>

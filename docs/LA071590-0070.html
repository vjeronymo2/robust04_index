			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MICRO-SOLUTION TO MACRO-PROBLEM  </P> <P> The city of Encinitas wisely repealed its ban on curbside hiring last week  rather than force a federal court judge to strike it down. U.S. District Court  Judge John Rhoades had indicated that the law approved in May was probably  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> But the city's squeaky wheel approach to the North County-wide problem of  migrant street hiring has brought in the Border Patrol.  </P> <P> Last week, agents began issuing reminders to curbside employers to check  workers for documents. The Sheriff's Department also plans a more questionable  sweep through migrant camps to enforce trespassing laws. Experience shows that  sporadic enforcement yields temporary results. Soon after authorities leave,  migrants are back seeking the day work crucial to their subsistence.  </P> <P> Encinitas' efforts, however, again highlight municipalities' total inability to  cope with the burden of what is a federal responsibility -- a situation that  probably won't change until local governments force change.  </P></p>

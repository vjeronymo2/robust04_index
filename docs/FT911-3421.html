			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Israelis remanded in Cyprus FOUR Israelis, two men and two women, arrested on suspicion of tampering with a telephone junction box serving the Iranian embassy were remanded in custody for eight days by a Nicosia court yesterday. There were no formal charges but a police officer told the court they were investigating conspiracy to commit a felony, possession of burglary tools by night, fraudulent appropriation of power (meaning the electric current in a telephone) and violation of a prohibitive order. The two men, Debi Dave, 40 and Faf Souf 33, and the two women, Anna Dolgin and Amit Litvin, both 28, looked quite relaxed as they were brought to court in handcuffs. Police said the four had arrived in Cyprus on Sunday and were due to leave tomorrow, Friday. The two couples were staying in two luxury hotels in the coastal town of Limassol. The four Israelis were apprehended late on Tuesday night when police making a routine security check on the building housing the Iranian Embassy (which adjoins a central Nicosia police station) found them 'interfering' with the telephone junction at the entrance to the building. They allegedly had with them burglary tools that included a pair of pliers, a tiny torch, a screwdriver, a battery-operated welding tool used for fixing cables and several cables with connectors. They told police they were 'looking for a toilet'. The four suspects appeared in court without a lawyer and one of them, Dave, said they did not accept the facts presented by the police. Legal sources say there is no specific law in Cyprus against telephone tapping. An Israeli embassy official met the four suspects before yesterday's hearing. The Iranian embassy in Nicosia, set up two years ago, is headed by a charge d'affaires and has about 10 staff. Iranian diplomats have said they plan to expand. But, unlike some foreign missions on Cyrpus, the embassy is not a major Middle East listening post. It occupies the top three floors of a five-storey office building next to a police station on Santa Rosa Street.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / South Africa begins tense countdown CONFRONTATION between the South African government and the main black opposition alliance looked inevitable yesterday following the collapse of efforts to avert a general strike on August 3. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general of the African National Congress (ANC), at a press conference urged 'millions' of South Africans to 'overwhelmingly demonstrate that the De Klerk regime stands isolated as a white minority attempting to cling to power'. Other political and trade union leaders also rallied support for what they described as a 'week of unprecedented action' to ensure a speedy transition to democracy in South Africa. Mr Ramaphosa said the week of action would begin with a two-day general strike, followed by a day of demonstrations, occupations and marches, with further protests during the rest of the week. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom Party leader, condemned the strike plan, saying: 'As long as the ANC keeps on generating tension through mass action, there is no way we can get anywhere near resolving the problem of violence.' Talks between the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the largest union grouping in the country, and the South African Co-ordinating Committee on Labour Affairs (Saccola), an umbrella employers' body, broke down on Wednesday night. The two sides had been meeting for the past two weeks in an effort to avoid the general strike and to break the constitutional deadlock. Mr Ramaphosa, in an indirect appeal to Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN special envoy, warned that the current 'tense atmosphere' made international monitoring 'imperative'. Mr Vance, on a 10-day visit to South Africa, will advise the UN Security Council on whether the world body can help end violence and break the deadlock in negotiations. Thousands of protesters have already been taking to the streets in the mass action campaign led by the ANC and the Cosatu, so far without serious incident. But concern about the capacity of the police to handle protest on a larger scale was heightened yesterday by a report which portrays the force as incompetent. British investigators sharply criticised the South African Police's (SAP) handling of last month's killings at Boipatong, but said they had found 'no evidence of direct police complicity in the massacre itself'. The investigators, led by Mr P A Waddington, director of criminal justice studies at Reading University, also said that 'inquiries in Boipatong have been obstructed throughout by the hostility and non-cooperation of residents, apparently at the behest of the African National Congress (ANC).' There is no evidence, say the investigators, that police had any forewarning of the attack. The 50-page report, compiled with the assistance of two London detectives, is scathing in its assessment of the police: 'To judge from Boipatong . . . the SAP suffers serious organisational problems', and lacks 'adequate mechanisms for internal and external accountability, since they seem unable or unwilling to establish what action was taken by whom with what result', says the report. The ANC described the report as 'a damning indictment of the standards of policing in South Africa'. Mr Hernus Kriel, minister of law and order, said that the government and police took the investigation's findings 'very seriously indeed', adding that he had asked the SAP commissioner for an urgent report.</p>

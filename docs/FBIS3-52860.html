			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Tzvi Zrahya] </F>   [Excerpt] The cabinet decided yesterday that Israel will  hold the United States responsible for the cancellation of the  VOA relay station project in the 'Arava and the commitments  arising from it. Israel will demand U.S. compensation for  expenditures caused by the project cancellation and expects the  United States to be accountable for the financial commitments of  the IBS [not further identified] conglomerate, which was  responsible for establishing the relay station.    The cabinet resolution states that Israel has received the  U.S. Government's announcement "concerning its request to cancel  by mutual consent the 18 June 1987 agreement between the two  governments for the establishment of a VOA station in the  'Arava. The Government of Israel will not oppose the request in  principle, but in view of the incurred expenses and commitments,  the two governments should negotiate an agreement on the  cancellation."    The cabinet has been advised that cancelling the project may  generate lawsuits amounting to tens of millions of dollars by  companies that had been slated to build the station, most  notably Elbit. There is also the possibility that the U.S.  Administration will demand a refund of their $16 million  investment in the 'Arava made upon the signing of the station  agreement.    The cabinet decided to appoint an interministerial team to  draft the agreement and negotiate with the Americans. The team  will be headed by Brigadier General Re'uven Yardor (Reserves),  former project director for the Communications Ministry. The  team will be be made up of representatives of the Foreign,  Finance, Industry and Trade, and Justice Ministries. [passage  omitted]</p>

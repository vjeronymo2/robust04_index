			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Directors guided on insider trade law A Stock Exchange-sponsored committee will today issue a code of conduct telling company directors they should no longer privately correct individual analysts' profit forecasts, but must instead inform the entire market of such price-sensitive information. Institutional investors and stockbrokers who receive unpublished price sensitive information will also be advised to encourage companies to publish the information widely. The new code has been drawn up so that companies, shareholders and stockbrokers can be confident that they can communicate with each other without infringing the Criminal Justice Act provision on insider trading, which will come into force next Tuesday. The code has been drafted by a committee consisting of representatives of the 100 Group of finance directors, the Institutional Fund Managers Association and the Association of British Insurers. A member of the committee said: 'It does spell out the circumstances under which the companies should disclose information and points out that dribbling out information is unacceptable.' Among other things, the document discusses how company directors should deal with analysts' earnings estimates which are wildly wrong. It will tell companies that they are not required to correct a false impression by an analyst. However, if a correction is given to the analyst, it must be simultaneously communicated to the market as a whole. A committee member said the committee was particularly concerned about earnings forecasts from analysts who are employed by the company's own stockbroker 'whose forecasts have been surprisingly accurate'.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Government to scrap NEDC by year-end THE government severed its last link with the consensual approach to economic management of the 1960s and 1970s yesterday by announcing the abolition of the National Economic Development Council. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the tripartite - or corporatist  - body would be wound up at the end of this year. The NEDC was established in 1962 by Mr Harold Macmillan, then prime minister, to encourage government, industry and trade unions to set a framework for economic policy. In a parallel announcement, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said his department would restructure its links with industry, taking on some of the work now undertaken by the NEDC's sectoral working parties - known as little Neddies. Some of the organisation's 100 staff will be offered posts at the Department of Trade and Industry and elsewhere in Whitehall, but most face redundancy. Mr Heseltine said his proposals, details of which would be announced before the parliamentary recess next month, would lead to 'a more direct and more effective relationship' between the DTI and industry. He made clear that he did not envisage any role for trade unions in his new approach to dialogue with industry. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Lamont said that neither the National Economic Development Office, nor the NEDC, its governing council, any longer reflected the 'needs and realities of the British economy'. He stressed that the government was determined to maintain close links with industry but not in the forum provided by the NEDC. Emphasising the government's sole charge of macro-economic policy, he added: 'The age of corporatism must be put firmly behind us.' That view was reinforced last night by Mr John Major who told the Adam Smith institute, the rightwing think tank, that his government would continue to withdraw the state from the marketplace. Industrial organisations shed few tears at the passing of the NEDC, which had its heyday in the early 1970s. Some business leaders, however, expressed concern about the future of the detailed sectoral work carried out by the working parties attached to the NEDC. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, led opposition attacks on what he called an 'act of industrial vandalism' which underlined the government's complete indifference to manufacturing industry. Dr Walter Eltis, NEDO director general, said he was 'disappointed' at the closure of the office. Businessmen and trade unionists who had contributed to its work were owed a 'great debt of gratitude', he said. Mr Lamont, a critic of the set-piece clashes between government and trade unions that have characterised NEDC meetings, decided immediately after the April general election to scrap the council. In what was seen as a compromise with Mr Heseltine, who has advocated a more prominent role for the body under the direction of the DTI, it was agreed that some NEDC functions should be preserved.

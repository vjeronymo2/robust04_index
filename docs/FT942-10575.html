			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Observer: Large giblets and fries So there is an after-life for spit-roasted chief executives. James Robinson, former boss of American Express, has resurfaced - on the board of a rotisserie chicken chain. From a renowned southern family himself, Robinson should know all about finger-lickin' chicken. The job complements Robinson's other directorship, at Coca-Cola. In business for 2 1/2 years, Robinson's new interest - the Kenny Rogers Roasters, named after the country music star - has 144 outlets. Its aim? Why, to become the US's biggest rotisserie chain - in competition with Boston Chicken, of course. Robinson rubs shoulders with some alluring names on the Roasters' board: JP Bolduc, chief executive of WR Grace; Drew Lewis, a former Reagan transport secretary; and Darien Iacocca, wife of former Chrysler boss Lee. He could also pick up a few tips from another board member, Harvey Mackay, who lists among his book credits 'Swimming with sharks without being eaten alive'.</p>

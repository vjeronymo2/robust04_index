			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first option is to define the source in a very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad context as the entire facility. This option was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejected by the EPA for the off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations NESHAP because it would be very difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply a single facility-wide emission limitation level for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT to all off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities for several reasons. First, the mechanism by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which organic HAP are emitted to the atmosphere and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of air emission controls applicable to reducing these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions vary widely for the emission point types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified for off-site waste and recovery operations. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, covers frequently are installed on tanks to control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air emissions while work practice programs are used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control air emissions from equipment leaks. Furthermore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not all off-site waste and recovery operations at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular facility may be subject to this rulemaking. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously explained, certain types of waste combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units, landfill units, and other operations are being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed by separate EPA regulatory actions. Finally, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations at a particular facility may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be dedicated to managing only wastes or recoverable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials generated on-site and, thus, would not be subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second option is to define the source in a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narrow context as the entire operation used to manage a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular waste or recoverable material from the point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the material enters the facility through the point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where the material exits the facility or, if it is a waste,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposed on-site. Under this definition, the source would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consist of a mix of different types of emission points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representing the sequence of units in which the waste or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable material is stored, conveyed, treated, and, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some cases, disposed. Under this option, a single emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation for MACT would be established for the entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group of emission points comprising the management sequence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to handle the waste or recoverable material. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second option for defining sources under the off-site waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recovery operations NESHAP was also rejected by the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as inappropriate. Unlike manufacturing or production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes that produce a specific product, the operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to manage a particular type of waste or recoverable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material cannot be readily characterized by one or even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several standardized process configurations which are used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the industrial segment representing the source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category. The types, configurations, and sequencing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units used for operations handling a particular type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste or recoverable material are not consistent, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead can vary widely from one facility to the next.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the EPA concluded that this option is not an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate approach for defining sources for the off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final option considered by the EPA is to further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narrow the definition of source to the individual emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points identified for the source category ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> tanks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers, land disposal units, process vents, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leaks). Under this option, an overall emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation for MACT would be established for each emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point type. The EPA believes that this option is the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate approach for defining sources for the off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations NESHAP. This approach defines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the source in terms of common types of units used at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site waste and recovery operations facilities for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling all types of wastes and recoverable materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, this approach to defining sources is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other EPA air rules for waste and recovery operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, for the off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NESHAP, the EPA is proposing to define the source to be each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the individual emission point types.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Determination of MACT Floor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory requirements under CAA section 112 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of the MACT floor are explained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section II.A of this notice. As explained in section III.C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this notice, the off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source category contains more than 30 existing sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide. Therefore, for the off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations NESHAP, the MACT floor for existing sources is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined the average emission limitation achieved by the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing 12 percent of existing sources. The MACT floor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for new sources is defined by the emission control that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

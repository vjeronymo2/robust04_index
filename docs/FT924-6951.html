			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Brazilian clothier turns in loss of Dollars 64m SAO PAULO Alpargatas, the largest Brazilian footwear and clothing manufacturer, suffered a loss of Dollars 64m for the first nine months this year. The company blamed the deficit mainly on lower sales volume and tight profit margins, both a result of the country's continued recession. Gross sales figures for the period were Dollars 361m, compared with Dollars 425m for the first nine months of last year. In 1991, the publicly traded company landed in the red for the first time in 56 years, showing a loss of Dollars 38m. The downturn has forced the company to retrench in a programme which has included corporate restructuring, the closure of eight of 28 factories, and layoff of about one third of a workforce that totalled 31,000 in 1990. Despite the gloomy numbers, Alpargatas is cautiously optimistic about a recent seasonal increase in demand and a recuperation of margins. It has also moved to reduce the its debt burden. In December 1991, 51 per cent of a Dollars 50m debt was in short-term obligations. By September 1992, with the help of a Euronote issue earlier this year, only 14 per cent of a slightly higher Dollars 52m total was short-term debt.</p>

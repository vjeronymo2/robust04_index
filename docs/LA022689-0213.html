			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GRUBBS EARNS A THIRD TRIP TO STATE MEET;  </P> <P> EL CAMINO'S 112-POUNDER ADVANCES WITH MASTERS CHAMPIONSHIP  </P> <P> Mike Grubbs and his brother, John, wore matching baseball caps. The black  corduroy caps, which have "El Camino Wrestling" embroidered on them, signify  teamwork.  </P> <P> That teamwork helped Mike, El Camino's 112-pounder, earn a third trip to the  state meet this year. The same teamwork helped John, El Camino's assistant  coach, become a two-time state champion in 1986 and 1987.  </P> <P> Mike, a senior with a 35-2 record, defeated Clairemont's Kay Rattanasinh, 6-3,  in the finals of the Masters Championships Saturday at Mt. Carmel High School  to earn the trip to state.  </P> <P> Grubbs had pinned Rattanasinh in the second period of the finals in the  Division 1-A sectional meet last week but wrestled conservatively in the  Masters.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to win," Grubbs said. "People expected me to 15-point him, but I  tried to forget that and didn't take any chances."  </P> <P> Grubbs scored an early takedown and led, 2-0, at the end of the first period.  His other four points were from two takedowns in the second period.  </P> <P> "My intensity level was (bad) tonight," Grubbs said. "I'm right where I want to  be physically, but mentally I need to take one step more."  </P> <P> El Camino Coach John Freeman, who said the match wasn't one of Grubbs' best,  thinks it can be an advantage preparing for the state meet.  </P> <P> "He didn't shoot his wad here and try to go into state with false  expectations," Freeman said. "After this not-so-great match, we can follow up  with a good week of practice and really focus on state." Last year Grubbs took  second in the state meet at 105 pounds. The year before, as a sophomore -- the  same year John won at 105 -- Mike took fifth at 98.  </P> <P> John has seen the profession of Mike, who has become a technician because of  wrestling freestyle in the offseason.  </P> <P> "Before, he was passive," John said. "Now he's a power wrestler. He has good  speed and knowledge of the sport."  </P> <P> Grubbs wrestled the season at 119 before cutting to 112 for the section. He did  the same last year, cutting from 112 to 105, and he said it helps him mentally  because he is stronger than the others in his weight class.  </P> <P> Mike is the only returning state place winner on El Camino's team this year, an  inspiration to teammates.  </P> <P> "They respect him, and when he's in practice, he can set the tempo. The other  kids get better because of it," Freeman said.  </P> <P> Grubbs, who is considering Fullerton, Stanford and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo as  possible colleges, is as hard-working in the classroom as he is in the practice  room.  </P> <P> "He is an upstanding individual and an excellent role model," Freeman said.  </P> <P> Grubbs' teammate, Danial Ramirez, the 98-pound Masters champion, will accompany  him to the state meet next weekend in Stockton. Ramirez defeated Serra's Earl  Reagon, 2-1, in the finals.  </P></p>

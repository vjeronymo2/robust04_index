			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Pop is the tops - Sponsorship What are we to make of the current state of arts sponsorship? On the one hand a bank cancelled a party to celebrate a sponsorship and tried to sell on the deal, at a discount, because it did not want to be associated with supporting an arts event while making staff redundant; on the other hand Glyndebourne has raised over Pounds 20m from business inside a year to finance its new opera house. The bank is being over-cautious, and companies are helping Glyndebourne not so much for love of opera but because they want the pay-off - a 20 year guarantee of access to Glyndebourne tickets for entertainment purposes. The money helps the arts but via the dubious route of corporate hospitality, and it doubtless comes from a different budget. Remarkably few sponsorships have been cancelled by the recession - as yet. The problems will arise next year when current commitments lapse and talks on renewal stall. But chief executives are already trying to cut back on sponsorship where feasible. If the London City Ballet gives up next month (and there are reports that, despite being promised an Arts Council grant for 1992-93, the management is determined to stop dancing) the Pounds 800,000 committed by business to the LCB will not be switched to other arts companies but disappear into corporate funds. That, at least, is the line taken by one backer, Barclays Bank. So far the Japanese continue to support the arts and the 1991 Japan Festival in the UK has raised Pounds 15m from business. The oil companies are still committed and last month Mobil announced another Pounds 125,000 sponsorship, the Greensight Project, which develops educational packs for schools, exploring the relationships between industry and the environment through the making of video programmes. But the odds must be against the renewal of such major sponsorships as the Prudential Awards and Shell-Bafta when these Pounds 1m plus projects draw to a close within the next 12 months. The worst is yet to come. The Royal Academy is probably more adept than any other arts organisation at attracting sponsorship. It has to be; it receives no government aid. But even the RA is rather impressed with the Pounds 600,000 guarantee against loss it has conjured up at the last moment for its Pop Art Show, opening on September 13. Not only is this its biggest ever lifebelt but it is a record sponsorship for any art show in the UK. The bulk of the money, Pounds 500,000, comes from Mercury Communications, with the rest from The Independent. The show, the first major survey of Pop Art for over 20 years, is so expensive to put on because of its size - both in the number of pictures that need to be transported, over 200, and the size of some of them. To prove it has no favourites the Pop Art Show will still be running when an exhibition of prints by the Japanese artist Hokusai opens in November - sponsored by Mercury's rival, British Telecom. Before Pop there are the Fauves, opening in June and backed by Ford. At the same time the RA will unveil its new look galleries, named after the Sackler family which has given over Pounds 1m for the facelift. The refurbished galleries provide the chance of a re-hang of the RA's own over-looked art collection, paid for by Texaco, which is becoming a force in arts sponsorship. On October 4 Chicago opens its new public library, a nine storey neo-classical monolith which occupies a whole down town block. This major event, the culmination of a 70 year campaign, will be celebrated with a week of junketings, thanks to WH Smith which is contributing Dollars 300,000 to pay for the ceremonies. This is not unthinking philanthropy on the part of the UK's leading bookseller. WH Smith began trading in the US in 1985 and is a major presence in the massive O'Hare Airport in Chicago where it operates 21 shops. It also functions at five hotels in the city. Already a big name among the travelling public in the Midwest, WH Smith is keen to make friends with more sedentary readers. British Gas may lack a structure to its arts sponsorships, but no one can fault its variety. On April 30 it announced the winners of the first Arts Council/British Gas 'Working for Cities' Awards, and the next night it backed the Toronto Symphony Orchestra's Barbican concert. 'Working for Cities' is about the role of the arts in urban regeneration and the main winners were: for art in public places - the Broadgate in London; for people - Neville Campbell of Phoenix Dance in Leeds; for buildings - Tic Toc in Coventry; for events  - the NGR 90 Festival at Gateshead; for partnership - Fish Quay, North Tyneside; in the pipeline - Riverfront Promenade, Newport. The Barbican concert was in complete contrast - old fashioned patronage and corporate hospitality because British Gas has bought Consumer Gas of Ontario and wants to make friends in Canada.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Gogol: ``Cholera Autumn''] </F>   [Text] The famous slogan ``Either the louse will vanquish  the revolution or else the revolution will vanquish the louse''  is becoming increasingly topical. The insect is a symbol in a  certain sense: It was not its tiresomeness that threatened the  bolshevik revolution -- louse-borne typhus mowed down people on  both sides of the barricades.    Typhus is not yet among us. Just as before, however,  infections are approaching and compelling us to understand that  regardless of whether you are red or white, you may end up in a  convulsive fever and set your hopes on the Lord God and your  physician, if he is at your side and if he has the necessary  drugs.    Today cholera is causing serious alarm. An outbreak in  Central Asia resulting in active antiepidemic actions on the  part of local physicians has worried Russia. But what if it  suddenly starts off here? Indeed it will start. The extremely  rapid spread of the infection is being discussed. As I was  informed in the Russian Federation State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, there are currently 15  cholera patients and eight carriers of the infection in Russia.  The disease was mainly carried in from abroad: Nine persons were  infected with cholera in Pakistan, and seven tourists  ``acquired'' it in Turkey together with leather consumer goods.  It is hardly worth grieving over the ``iron curtain'' in this  regard, but a system to protect the population from imported  infections in view of snowballing black-market tourism must be  devised in good time. In any case, the draft law developed by  the sanitary-epidemiological committee regarding protecting  Russia's territory that regulates sanitary inspection at the  border should be considered without delay.    Yuriy Fedorov, chief specialist of the Russian Federation  State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, believes  that the newspaper panic regarding cholera is unjustified: There  is not even any basis for announcing the quarantine that usually  follows the infection of 50-60 persons. The country has a  sufficiently strong public health service despite the break in  ties between epidemiologists of the new independent states. The  preparedness of special antiepidemic teams has been increased.  The country's leadership is well informed of the epidemiological  situation that has developed. The situation is under control...    I remember how during the years of perestroyka, the renowned  specialist A.I. Kondrusev, chief public health physician of the  USSR, said, ``Politics does not worry me. It is all  sovereignization, etc. You come together, you break apart. But  do not break the single sanitary-epidemiological service. Let's  not look for trouble.'' It was as he was looking in water.  Infections are approaching on all fronts: cholera, diptheria,  measles, hepatitis. Morbidity due to tuberculosis is  threatening...    No matter how much we now talk about integration and  strengthening intergovernmental economic ties, let us not put  off until tomorrow the restoration of our  sanitary-epidemiological system. Infection, if you will forgive  the banality, does not recognize borders, and it is easier to  surmount together. Some coordination center that would react  instantaneously to danger no matter where it approaches from and  that would direct integrated teams to ``extinguish'' epidemics  without delay at any point in the CIS is likely necessary. Today  no one is even obtaining elementary information about the  dynamics of an infection's spread within the framework of the  former USSR. At least call the World Health Organization. And I  suspect that in Geneva they now know more than our people do.    Nevertheless, I do not want to leave the reader in fearful  anticipation of raging epidemics. There is good news: The  epidemic season, which usually lasts from May to October, is  coming to an end. Perhaps it will pass.</p>

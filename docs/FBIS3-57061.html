Rural Centrist leader Ivar Raig at a press conference Friday  [21 January] said the president's parliament relations officer  should attend the plenary meetings of the State Assembly and  stay well informed of the work done by the parliamentary  commissions so that no information blackout would again occur  between the president and the parliament.    Raig, whose comments were about the recent dispute over  Cabinet nominations between the president and the prime  minister, said the ruling coalition and the government had been  right to seek the replacement of Economics Minister Toomas  Sildmae.    He said Sildmae was sacked because of his ministry's failure  to work out laws.    "The Economics Ministry during the past year didn't submit  to  the parliament even one single original bill drawn up in  ministry itself. The ministry paid more attention to industrial  development and seeking contacts in other countries than to  working out an economic policy," Raig said.    He also said that the practice when interest groups in the  economy turned their requests to the president rather than the  government or the parliament was contradicting the principles of  a parliamentary state.    Raig was referrng to statements in support of Sildmae  delivered to the president by a number of business associations  and influence groups when the government revealed its plans for  Sildmae's replacement.</p>

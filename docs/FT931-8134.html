			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses little changed on German M3 drop THE SURPRISE contraction in German money supply in January did little for bourses yesterday, especially for Frankfurt itself, writes Our Markets Staff. At 16.30 in London the FT-SE Eurotrack index was only 1.85 higher at 1,134.80. Dealers said that the M3 figures were another step towards the next cut in German interest rates, but they did not think that the next cut was imminent. FRANKFURT saw the DAX index up 5.13 to 1,677.39 over the official session, up 1 per cent on the week, and an estimated six points more in the domestic post-bourse, but by late afternoon in London the extra gains had virtually disappeared. Individual equities and sectors extended the themes of the week. Car stocks, already relatively weak, were dragged down by Volkswagen. VW fell DM8.60 on the day, DM18.90 on the week to DM278.80; it had been suffering from a downgrade by DB Research just over a week ago, and yesterday it was more sensitive than its competitors to January registration data which showed a 27.5 per cent fall from last year and a drop of 18.3 per cent from a record December. Like VW, the other main theme stock, Bayernhypo, might also have been affected by expiration of options contracts on the Deutsche Terminborse, reflected in a surge in German equity market turnover from DM6.5bn to DM9.4bn. It has also been a major play on interest rates, rising DM6.80 on the day, and DM18.80 on the week to DM434.80. Some stocks moved on a lack of news. Lufthansa, seen as a turnround situation and one of the strongest performers in the DAX this year, rose another DM5.50 to DM124. Schering, in pharmaceuticals, put on DM19 to DM742.50 for a rise on the week of DM34.50. PARIS took some motivation from the German data but generally activity in the market was concentrated in second-line stocks. The CAC-40 index rose 10.60 to 1,937.17 in turnover of FFr3.7bn, up 1.3 per cent on the week. With an easing in domestic short-term interest rates this week, some analysts expect France to make a gesture towards further easing in the short-term, particularly as next month's elections approach. This, they argue, will feed through into the market with the CAC able to break through 2,000. Among blue chips, financials firmed while reports of a bullish broker's research document on insurers helped Axa to a gain of FFr14 to FFr1,158. Societe Generale went against the trend, down FFr1 at FFr634, on reports that it had lost money on options trading. LVMH eased FFr60 to FFr3,330 as the group denied rumours, active on Thursday, of restructuring plans. Other elements of Mr Bernard Arnault's group rose: Christian Dior up FFr12.10 at FFr256.10 and Bon Marche FFr9 higher at FFr563. ZURICH declined on profit-taking, especially in the chemicals sector, the SMI index falling 14.6 to 2,117.3, 0.9 per cent lower on the week. Among chemicals, still shaken by healthcare reforms in the US, Roche certificates fell SFr40 to SFr4,090 and Sandoz SFr90 to SFr3,060. Meanwhile, a slight increase in money market rates discouraged buying in the insurance sector, where Zurich and Winterthur were both unchanged at SFr2,200, and SFr3,210 respectively. AMSTERDAM was stronger on options expiry, in the absence of corporate news. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.7 to 99.7 fora gain of 0.8 per cent on the week. Ahold was one of the day's main exceptions, Fl 1.60 lower at Fl 91.60 as finance stocks showed broad gains, with Amev up Fl 1.10 at Fl 67.90 and ING Fl 1.20 firmer at Fl 62.60. STOCKHOLM saw Astra fall SKr7 in the B shares to SKr694 ahead of Monday's results. The Affarsvarlden General index climbed 3.07 to 987.97 in high turnover of SKr1.14bn, up 0.7 per cent on the week. S-E Banken continued to weaken following its announcement on Thursday of heavy losses and the C shares eased SKr1 to SKr11. OSLO was encouraged by falling money market rates and the all-share index gained 3.01 to 401.75 in turnover of NKr450m. Among the actives, Norsk Hydro and Kvaerner both gained NKr1.50, to NKr164 and NKr164.50 respectively. TEL AVIV fell in a second consecutive day of sharp losses as the market reacted to more comments by politicians, who said that institutional investors are manipulating share prices, dealers said. The blue chip shares index lost 7.95, or 3.9 per cent to 194.63.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- February 19                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1131.18    1131.02     1130.42    1130.17 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1187.86    1186.03     1185.53    1185.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1131.70    1137.01     1136.60    1136.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1186.20    1191.41     1189.68    1191.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Feb 18    Feb 17    Feb 16    Feb 15    Feb 12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1132.95   1121.77   1123.14   1132.97   1129.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1191.03   1173.51   1179.54   1184.15   1181.05  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1137.32; 200 - 1193.45 Low/day: 100 - 1129.55 200 - 1182.85.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EC REJECTS U.S. FARM TRADE PLAN  </P> <P> The European Community today rejected a newly proposed U.S. plan for farm trade  reform, saying it was a backward step aimed at eliminating the EC's Common  Agricultural Policy.  </P> <P> "Such an approach cannot be shared by the community, which thereby considers  that the American proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiations," the EC  delegation at world trade talks said in a statement.  </P> <P> The 12-nation community was commenting on a comprehensive U.S. proposal that  called for elimination of farm export subsidies in five years, and substantial  cuts in barriers to free farm trade over 10 years.  </P> <P> The United States presented the plan at a session of a negotiating group on  agriculture at the 105-nation Uruguay Round of world trade talks being  conducted under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  </P></p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / US pension funds increase foreign investments US pension funds dramatically increased their overseas investment last year, with most new cash used to purchase foreign equities, figures released yesterday confirm. The value of US pension funds' assets abroad rose by 69 per cent to Dollars 260bn (Pounds 174bn) by the end of 1993, from Dollars 156bn the year before, according to data from InterSec Research Corp, a US-based investment consulting firm. While much of that reflects a rise in stock and bond prices, net new cash sent abroad by US pension schemes was Dollars 46bn, twice the figure for 1992. 'We are past the time when international assets are an alternative asset class. Now they are mainstream,' said Mr Jim Waterman, research analyst at InterSec. Moreover, US pension schemes are increasingly investing in foreign equities. Of the new money last year, Dollars 35bn was invested in stocks, more than four times the Dollars 8bn which went into fixed interest securities. In 1992, Dollars 16bn was invested in equities, just over twice that invested in bonds. More than half of the new cash was invested in diversified portfolios in Europe, Australia and the Far East. Emerging markets received about 7 per cent of the new cash. 'Our prediction is that the value of US pension assets abroad will grow to Dollars 700bn by the end of 1998,' Mr Waterman said. The percentage of assets invested abroad should be 11 to 12 per cent, up from 7 per cent at the end of 1993. US pension funds have total assets of about Dollars 3,500bn. US pension funds historically have been reluctant to invest outside the country. Five years ago, only 3 per cent of their assets were non-US. Moreover, some of the larger corporate US pension funds have far heavier than average weightings of international securities, Mr Waterman said. Mr Robert Angelica, president of AT&amp;T Investment Management, which invests over Dollars 40bn of pension assets on behalf of the telecommunications group's employees, said his scheme now had 10 per cent of its assets abroad. It is now considering raising that to 15 per cent, and may eventually go as high as 20 per cent. Ten years ago, the AT&amp;T scheme had almost none of its assets outside the US. InterSec warned that year-on-year increases in non-domestic US pension fund investments are unlikely to continue at the current pace. 'This rate of increase is not sustainable,' Mr Waterman said.</p>

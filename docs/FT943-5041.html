			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong theory to make a good cup of tea Sir, Charles Jennings is in error in believing that reduced atmospheric pressure increases the temperature at which water boils (Business Travel: 'The anatomy of a Club Class flight', August 29). As every schoolboy knows, water boils at a temperature below 100'c when the ambient pressure is reduced, thus making it difficult to get a good infusion of tea or boil eggs. Little wonder that employers are worried about the rise of scientific illiteracy. R Hall, 9 Ormond Avenue, Hampton, Middx TW12 2RZ</p>

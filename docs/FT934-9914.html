			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Mirror row may prompt curbs: Threat of controls on press - Princess to sue / MGN quits watchdog THE FUTURE of press self-regulation was in doubt last night after the three national titles of Mirror Group Newspapers pulled out of the Press Complaints Commission over the growing row caused by pictures of the Princess of Wales taken secretly in a fitness club. Mr David Montgomery, MGN's chief executive, said the commission, the industry regulatory body, was finished. He accused its chairman, Lord McGregor of Durris, of exceeding his powers and behaving unfairly. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, gave a warning that the publication by MGN of the photographs demonstrated the shortcomings of self-regulation and increased the likelihood of statutory controls on press freedom. 'Given the regularity with which we have been told that the press can sort out these matters for themselves, I think this will have given a very nasty jolt to everybody, and I think that makes it that amount more likely that the legislation will come forward,' said Mr Brooke, who is expected to produce a white paper on the press in January. MGN said even though its editors would withdraw from the commission, 'they will continue to abide by its code of conduct'. The MGN withdrawal, which could fatally undermine the commission, came as lawyers for the Princess of Wales said a writ would be issued today alleging breach of confidence and breach of contract against the LA Fitness Club in west London where the pictures were taken and against MGN which published them in the Sunday Mirror and the Daily Mirror. Lawyers for the princess won an injunction in the High Court preventing further publication of pictures. MGN contested the injunction on the grounds that it had 'done nothing unlawful'. Mr Montgomery said the Daily Mirror decided yesterday not to publish any more of the photographs after the Princess of Wales had issued a statement through her solicitors declaring her 'distress and deep sense of outrage' over the pictures taken by a hidden camera at the fitness club while she was working out. It is believed Mr Bryce Taylor, the main owner of the gym, arranged for the pictures to be taken and sold them to Mirror newspapers for about Pounds 100,000. Earlier, Lord McGregor had condemned the action of the Daily Mirror in publishing the photographs. He said advertisers should show their displeasure at an 'outlaw' newspaper by withdrawing advertising. The Royal Automobile Club and Autoglass, the windscreen replacement company, said they were dropping the Daily Mirror from their schedules but Mr Andrew Brown, chairman of the Advertising Association, rejected the call for a general boycott. Mr David Banks, editor of the Daily Mirror, attacked Lord McGregor for criticising his newspaper 'before he had even read our editorial'. In an editorial comment in today's Mirror the paper says its commercial rivals have 'played judge, jury and hangman'. The commission will meet tomorrow to consider the issue of the pictures. Sir David Calcutt, whose committee report on the press in January this year called for statutory controls, said the Daily Mirror's attitude to the commission amounted to 'total contempt'. He said if the commission was treated in this way by an 'important significant journal, then you have a real problem as I see it for self-regulation'.

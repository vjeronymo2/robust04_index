			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: A woman of veritable importance Few (if any other) women in television have had a career as impressive as Verity Lambert's. Brought on in the early 1960s by that great Canadian promoter of talent, Sydney Newman, when he was head of BBC Television's drama group, she had a lot to do with the creation of Dr Who and Adam Adamant. With London Weekend in the 70s she produced Budgie, and then as controller of drama at Thames in the 70s and 80s was responsible for Rock Follies, Rumpole Of The Bailey, Edward and Mrs Simpson, The Naked Civil Servant and several series of Minder. Her time with EMI films was less impressive but since she set up her own company Cinema Verity (ho ho) in 1985 the familiar knack has been evident again. The comedy-detective series Boys From The Bush set in Australia is hers, as was Coasting, also a combination of crime and comedy. Now BBC2 is showing her Sleepers, a slick and amusing spy spoof with Nigel Havers and Warren Clarke as a couple of KGB agents, planted in British society in 1966, and now flourishing as stalwart native plants (Episode 2 tonight). Miss Lambert is clearly a shrewd businesswoman as well as an astute producer. And yet . . . and yet . . . Dr Who was a radical departure in its day, as was Budgie in some respects, and it took courage to bring The Naked Civil Servant to the screen with its explicit account of Quentin Crisp's exhibitionist homosexuality; everybody including the BBC had rejected it before Lambert accepted it. Would it be too much to ask now that she become a brave independent, taking a few similar risks to break some new ground? If she won't, who will? * * * The fashionable reaction to the interviewing of a politician on television does not change: the sneer is still de rigueur. After Sue Lawley's interview with John Major at 10 Downing Street there was much vying to see who could pour most cold water, much of it, admittedly, on Lawley: she had remarked on the absence of Iain Macleod from the Downing Street portraits yet, in the immortal words of Molesworth, any fule kno Macleod wasn't PM (she never said he was); she was chatty (wasn't that the idea?); she showed off her legs (they are very good legs); she looked insultingly relaxed (would it have been better to look tense?) As for Mr 'Ordinary' Major, his ear tugging, mouth covering and leg crossing shrieked of deceit, and who could possibly believe a man who claimed not to remember how many O-levels he had passed? Anyone who, like me, read the reactions next day before watching a tape of the interview would have been ready for some impertinent sexpot rabbiting away to an evasive phoney. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Lawley is so good at this sort of interview now that she has, it seems, fooled many onlookers into imagining they are easy. To be able to relax enough to reveal the true temperament of your interviewee, and to listen closely enough to switch questions in mid stream, takes not just confidence but practice. Lawley has lots of both. As for Major he did, indeed, come across as extraordinarily ordinary for a prime minister, which is probably what irritates his detractors (why him, why not me?) but the interview was remarkably revealing. It was certainly more interesting than this week's Panorama which was so determined to dish the dirt that it rambled on about some supposed misdemeanour over address registration when Major stood as a local councillor years ago, a petty little point the inclusion of which reflected worse on the programme than on Major. I write as a wholly biased onlooker, of course, being another of those who cannot remember whether he passed six, seven, or eight O-levels. * * * Last week's column said that The Darling Buds Of May with its old fashioned qualities of optimism and good humour and its lack of murders, lawyers and policemen, would probably prove immensely popular: it would be no surprise if the series attracted an audience of 10.5m and went up from there. In fact Episode 1 blasted past every other programme on the box to take No 1 slot in AGB's BARB ratings with an audience of 16.68m - above Coronation Street, above EastEnders, above Neighbours. Interesting what sunshine, a happy attitude, and David Jason in the lead role can do. * * * Stand by, then, for a couple more predictions: when people have finished watching the Larkins in the 1950s Darling Buds Of May they will switch, lickety split, to BBC1 to catch the greater part of the series of Noel Coward one-act plays, Tonight At 8.30, written in the 1930s. These contain very few lawyers or policemen, no murders that I can see, and each one stars Joan Collins who, though no female Olivier, does seem to stack up the ratings. The first in the series, 'Hands Across The Sea,' was astoundingly slight (about four good lines) but utterly undemanding and good humoured. When these finish, many viewers will switch immediately to Jeeves And Wooster on ITV, the series based on PG Wodehouse's stories from the 1920s. In the opening episode of the new series the stout policeman fell in the duckpond and came up spouting water and holding a frog, and the judge was a blithering idiot. There were no murders and the sun shone. I think we can safely predict even more big drama ratings for Sunday nights. * * * The more television there is, and the larger the number of people drawn in as presenters, the clearer it becomes that it takes abnormal strength of character to resist the pressure to become a 'loveable exhibitionist' once it is known that the camera likes your face - and, more important, your manner. AJP Taylor successfully withstood the trial, as the Saturday night repeats of his BBC history lectures from the 1970s are proving. Patrick Moore, though willing to clown around with a xylophone on chat shows, continues to present The Sky At Night in his utterly informal manner, sans Autocue, but without ever becoming an insufferable 'personality.' Unhappily the same cannot be said of Keith Floyd. In his early cookery series he used his natural wit to compensate for a lack of television experience by developing a teasing relationship with the cameraman ('Down here Clive, let the viewers see the chopping board') and that was delightful while unforced and occasional. Now, in his new series about Australian food on BBC2, Floyd On Oz, he is showing saddening signs of turning into one of those boring telly eccentrics like Lucinda Lambton or Magnus Pyke, condemned to repeat his own matinee tricks ad infinitum. The scenery is good, his cooking continues to be admirably unfussy, and the programmes are still entertaining, but the charming spontaneity of the early programmes is in danger of being replaced by a studied mannerism. * * * The cumulative effect of 'Banned', Channel 4's fascinating season of persecuted programmes and films, is bafflement and rage. By what right did anybody ever presume to prevent us seeing Scum, a drama directed by Alan Clarke from a script by Roy Minton, which gives a vivid impression of the Darwinian nature of survival in one of Her Majesty's Borstals? Note the word 'impression': no doubt there are exaggerations, approximations, and even misrepresentations here, as in Monet's pictures, but in both cases the artifice is the lie which endeavours to convey a greater truth. At least with Juvenile Liaison II (a revised and expanded version by Nick Broomfield and Joan Churchill of their never-seen 1976 programme about police treatment of child offenders in Blackburn) you could see why the police had worked so hard to suppress the original. It clearly was a one-sided account. But perhaps just occasionally that is what an account ought to be if one side is crying out for public exposure because of its beastliness or wrong headedness. From the public point of view this dreadful situation should have been made general knowledge 15 years ago.</p>

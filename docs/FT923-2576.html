			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Hopes pinned on early reduction - Property Market COMMERCIAL property experts said yesterday it was too soon to judge the effect on the market of the sudden interest-rate rise but suggested there would be little damage in the short term. Mr Gerald Blundell, head of investment strategy at Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyors, said: 'This is more to do with 24-hour money than 24-year property cycles. There will be no immediate impact.' Mr Rod Grant, managing partner of surveyors Hillier Parker, said: 'We can't class this as good news. We are not panic-stricken because we saw it coming, but it is still a bit of a jolt.' Mr Blundell said that if the French approved the Maastricht treaty on Sunday there would be 'a quite rapid reduction' in UK rates. If they voted No there would be continuing volatility, which might lead to money being shifted to the US and harm corporate confidence in the UK, damaging lettings and yields. He said many property companies were locked into fixed interest rates, so the base rate changes would not affect their gearing - the ratio of debt to shares - in the short term. If sterling was devalued, giving rise to inflation, property would become more attractive as a hedge for investors. Mr Nicholas Ritblat, chairman and managing director of British Land, said: 'I cannot see that a 15 per cent real interest rate is seriously tenable.' He emphasised that his company would not be seriously exposed to the effects in the short term because it was hedged against interest-rate fluctuations. The increase might threaten commercial lettings in the longer term, however. Mr Grant said the rate increase would have little immediate impact on property values, which were already 'bumping along the bottom'. But he said it would certainly influence the speed of recovery and the general level of business confidence. 'There is a danger of a protracted fight over the economy,' he said. 'It would be nice to have heard better news.'</p>

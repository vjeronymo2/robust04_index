			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Californian insurer backs down on rebate THE insurance industry's opposition to Proposition 103, the 'insurance revolt initiative' passed by California voters in 1988, is starting to crumble. Allstate Insurance, one of the largest providers of property and casualty insurance in California, has agreed to pay policyholders Dollars 110m (Pounds 74m) in rebates on home and car insurance premiums, complying with the demands of state regulators. The agreement with Mr John Garamendi, the state insurance commissioner, ends Allstate's five-year legal battle over implementation of Proposition 103. The California law sparked moves in several other states to bring soaring car, home and commercial insurance costs under state control. Allstate has been in the forefront of the industry's legal battles against Proposition 103, which required insurers to cut 1989 premiums to 20 per cent below 1988 levels and submit all subsequent rate increases to state regulators for approval. Allstate and other insurers have insisted that their rates are fair and that they could not afford to pay rebates. However, announcing the settlement on Tuesday, the insurance company said it wanted to move forward after spending about Dollars 2m on litigation. Refunds will be paid to Allstate's customers in California who purchased policies in 1989. The Dollars 110m refund represents 5.3 per cent of the Dollars 2bn in premiums collected by the company that year. The surprise settlement is a significant achievement for Mr Garamendi, who is widely expected to be a candidate for state governor in next year's election. The agreement 'sends a strong signal to other insurers,' Mr Garamendi said. However, Mr Harvey Rosenfield, Proposition 103 author, accused the insurance commissioner of offering 'discounts' to insurance companies willing to settle the rebate issue. Allstate had originally been ordered to pay Dollars 244m in rebates, he said. To date about a dozen smaller insurers have agreed to pay a total of Dollars 725m in rebates to their 7m customers in California. However, State Farm, the state's largest insurer, is continuing its legal fight against Proposition 103.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Taiwan Martin Currie Investment Management is raising an open-ended fund of at least Dollars 50m to invest in Taiwan shares, reports Laura Tyson in Taipei. At least half of the funds will be invested in smaller companies with market capitalisation below Dollars 300m. These offer faster earnings growth at lower ratings than the blue-chips targetted by most Taiwan funds. The fund will also invest in companies listed on the over-the-counter market, which the government seeks to develop. The OTC market is slated to be opened to foreign investors in early 1995. The closing date for the fund is 16 January 1995. Edited by John Pitt. Further coverage of emerging markets appears daily on the World Stock Markets page.</p>

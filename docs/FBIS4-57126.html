			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Pernambuco Deputy Ricardo Fiuza, against whom  charges were made by the CPI [Congressional Investigating  Committee] that delved into the budget scandal, was acquitted by  a plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies on the evening of  11 May.    The request for his removal from office, which was  recommended by the Budget CPI, had already been rejected by the  Constitution and Justice Committee but it had to be voted by the  House plenum. It was voted down 208 votes for, 232 against,  with 15 abstentions.    The Chamber of Deputies thus acquitted Deputy Fiuza, who was  accused of being implicated in the Budget mafia. To have him  dismissed, the request had to be carried by 252 votes.    Few deputies commented on this vote at the end of the  sitting. Deputy Fiuza, former social welfare minister and former  leader of the PFL [Liberal Front Party], heaved a sigh of relief  upon learning the result. He said he will retire from public  life.    [Begin Fiuza recording] I did not resign and I answered  everything. I am now in a position to say that I will no longer  stand as candidate for anything. I will retire from public life.  I am the first victim of the fascist repression in Brazil. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: San Paolo buys Banesto subsidiary ITALY'S INSTITUTO Bancario San Paolo Di Torino is due to sign a letter of intent today with Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto) to acquire the Spanish bank's Barcelona-based subsidiary Banc Catala de Credit, which has 106 branches in north-east Spain. The acquisition follows the purchase by Credit Lyonnais of Banco Jover, a subsidiary of Spain's Banco de Santander, also based in Barcelona. The deal underlines growing foreign interest in the prosperous Catalonia region. Banc Catala, with assets of Pta152bn (Dollars 1.4bn), is the result of a merger, organised by Banesto, of two small lossmaking local banks. Nursed back to financial health two years ago, it increased net profits by 97 per cent last year, to just over Pta1bn. The decision to sell Banc Catala confirms a shift of opinion by Banesto's chairman, Mr Mario Conde, once a staunch opponent of foreign acquisitions of domestic bank networks. San Paolo's move into Spain follows last year's purchase of a 35 per cent stake in the small Banca Abel Matutes family bank in the Balearic Islands.</p>

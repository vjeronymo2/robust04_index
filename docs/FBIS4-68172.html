			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, May 16 (AFP)--  Palestinian police stepped in to save a leading PLO militant  from being captured by the Israeli army, a senior PLO official  said Monday.    The police intervened late Sunday as Fatah Hawks leader  Ziyad  Gharman and nine other activists armed with M16, Uzi, and  Kalashnikov machine guns, fled an Israeli patrol lying in wait  on a road between Gaza City and Nusayrat, the official told AFP.    The PLO men took refuge in a farmhouse which was surrounded  by troops.    Palestinian police were informed and after intensive talks  the army agreed to let the men go.    The militants were taken to the police headquarters in Gaza  where a senior Palestinian officer advised them "to stay in  hiding and not to move" as long as the Israeli army was present  on the Gaza Strip.    The Palestinian police last Wednesday started to take over  the strip, in line with the May 4 PLO-Israel agreement on  limited self-rule.    "We don't want to lose you in the final moments of the  occupation," the officer told the Hawks.    The Israeli army spokesman said he was unaware of the  incident.</p>

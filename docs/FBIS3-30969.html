			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "SLD Is Losing--President </F> Will Gain"]    [Text] Lech Walesa waited out the coalition crisis in the  mountains. He will return to see a slightly different political  configuration; this situation seems to be more favorable to him.    The coalition has survived the crises, but it has changed as  well. The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] gained; Prime Minister  Pawlak won the position as the real leader of the coalition.  The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] lost this round quite  noticeably.  <H5>  These Facts Will Strengthen the President </H5>   The prime minister is very polite toward the Belweder; he  has  accepted its rules of the game, at least as far as the filling  of the deputy ministerial posts in the presidential ministries  (the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs--MSZ, and the Ministry of National Defense) is  concerned. He does not demand positions for his party  activists; he settles for the promotions of PSL members who are  already working in those ministries (examples are the new MSZ  deputy minister and the new deputy of the Office of State  Protection chief). PSL members are getting high posts in the  presidential ministries, which is being kept rather low profile.    SLD wants these posts for its own politicians and it has  exerted pressure on Pawlak to achieve that. Now the weakened  SLD may take various steps; the possibility cannot be ruled out  that, wanting to compensate itself for the recent defeat and  improve its mood, it may start an even more vehement campaign to  obtain the deputy ministerial posts in the presidential  ministries.    So far Pawlak has resisted--he did not want a war with the  president. Now he will find it easier to handle the coalition  partner's demands. In line with the principle that a precedence  that has been set becomes the rule, it may remind the SLD  leaders of who calls the shots in the coalition.    The psychological aspect of the conflict in the coalition is  also very important.  <H5>  Pawlak Took SLD Politicians Aback </H5>   He turned out to be firm. SLD leaders will now feel greater  respect for him and will keep themselves at a distance.    The personal advantage for Lech Walesa, if he decides to run  in the presidential elections, is the fact that the position of  Aleksander Kwasniewski has been weakened quite considerably. Of  course, we still have a long way to go before the elections, and  the situation may change more than once. Today Walesa gains the  following: Kwasniewski will no longer be treated, also by the  mass media, so unequivocally in the good spirit of the current  configuration, as the main player, as the "prime minister  without portfolio." His image was tarnished quite considerably.  The prime minister is Pawlak.    Kwasniewski is "merely" the leader of one of the two  coalition groupings--it is the grouping that is today  politically weaker at that.  <H5>  Curbing the Increasing Popularity of Kwasniewski </H5>   It is a present that Walesa received from Pawlak a year and  a  half before the presidential elections. However, it may be the  Belweder's mistake not to consider Pawlak as Walesa's future  countercandidate in the elections.    The weaker SLD means also one more advantage for the  Belweder. In the Army, police, and the special forces the  Belweder and SLD are competing for influence. In this game,  which seems to be very important to the president, the weaker  SLD becomes, the better for the Belweder. The weakening of SLD  after the last conflict may be seen by some employees of those  services as an indicator showing where the real and stable  authority center is.    One can also say that any conflict in the coalition is  favorable to the Belweder because it diverts the interest of the  mass media from it.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMAND HAMMER MUSEUM OPENS;  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: A PLEASANT PLACE TO SEE ART  </P> <P> Opinion is likely to be divided on the horizontally striped building that  houses the new Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, opening today  in Westwood, but one aspect of the facility can be expected to generate  near-unanimity: For the display of art, the gallery spaces are quite fine.  </P> <P> With one small exception, New York-based architect Edward Larrabee Barnes has  fashioned graceful, adaptive, nicely lit rooms that work well for paintings.  Happily, they work well for people, too. The galleries are pleasant to be in.  </P> <P> As the architect who designed perhaps the most widely acclaimed museum  galleries in the United States for the display of contemporary art -- those at  Minneapolis' Walker Art Center -- Barnes is not without an established track  record in the difficult job of gallery design. Although the Hammer Museum's  collection does not encompass postwar art, nor is contemporary work expected to  be a component of the temporary shows the museum will host, Barnes has chosen  to rely on a spare architectural vocabulary familiar to showcases for recent  painting and sculpture.  </P> <P> The museum is small, including just five galleries in a total of about 14,000  square feet. (For comparison, the Museum of Contemporary Art claims about  25,000 square feet of exhibition space in its main building, and 50,000 square  feet in its Little Tokyo annex.) The cream-white walls and lightly whitewashed,  oak floors soften the boxy gallery spaces, which are subdivided into more  intimate rooms by movable, free-standing walls.  </P> <P> Interior articulation of these galleries is minimal but deft. The free-standing  walls are substantial, not flimsy, creating flexible but solid rooms. Most  important, their relatively modest height visually lowers the galleries' higher  ceilings to a domestic scale, which is further evoked by simple baseboards  along the bottom. Barnes, while retaining an institutional formality, has thus  subtly managed to give the galleries a welcome intimacy.  </P> <P> Two galleries for the permanent collection of paintings and for the collection  of prints and small sculptures by Honore Daumier, as well as two galleries for  temporary displays, also feature a well-handled system of electronically  controlled skylights that gently wash the rooms with natural light. (For  evenings and dark days, some skylights are equipped with concealed fluorescent  tubes.) On visits made on two days under different conditions, the mix of  natural and artificial lighting was handsome.  </P> <P> In a manner reminiscent of Arata Isozaki's design for MOCA, skylights shaped  like pyramids punctuate the high ceilings. As light enters the apex, the  pyramid shape acts as a reflective baffle that spreads indirect daylight into  the room, where it mixes with the artificial illumination typically found in  museums. A photoelectric system of louvers automatically controls the amount of  light admitted by the skylights, softening and diffusing it to protect the art.  The only drawback is minor: When the louvers are closed, a dark hole can result  overhead.  </P> <P> The paintings gallery, which is the largest at 5,040 square feet, claims the  most sophisticated use of skylights. A perimeter skylight rings the entire  room, its visibly angled wall echoing the interior shape and function of the  two pyramidal skylights also found in the gallery. This perimeter system, aside  from its illuminating function, creates a quiet architectural illusion. Imagine  the room surmounted by one large pyramid whose base is the ceiling, inside of  which a pair of smaller pyramids are nested side by side. This illusion, more  viscerally sensed than seen, is magical rather than showy or obtrusive.  </P> <P> The one gallery that is showy is both the smallest and the least successful.  Although not installed at preview time, it will house six upright cases for the  display of portions of the Leicester Codex, a scientific manuscript written  circa 1508-10 by Leonardo da Vinci. The small, barrel-vaulted room features  finished plaster walls and limestone paving on the floor, with one end  culminating in a semi-circular apse.  </P> <P> The trite conceit is that this gallery is a modernist chapel -- a latter-day  reliquary for the autographic text by the Divine Leonardo, and a shrine  appropriate to a Renaissance palazzo, which is the metaphor Barnes has used to  describe his overall plan for the Hammer Museum. Kept dark to protect the  exceedingly fragile paper and ink of the Codex, whose individual pages will be  lit by low-level spotlights in the display cases, the hushed room is also a  noisy echo chamber.  </P> <P> The chapel cliche and the echoes are annoyances far less problematic than a  serious design flaw. The little room opens directly onto a small foyer whose  glass doors lead outside. Open the door to the Codex gallery and one end of the  room is flooded with light, which makes the preservation of fragile manuscript  pages more than an academic question.  </P></p>

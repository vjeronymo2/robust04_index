			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part Four" of the report by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van </F> Khai at the opening of the Ninth National Assembly's Fifth  Session held at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in Hanoi on 26 May  -- recorded]    [Text] The government has confirmed these as key tasks in  its program of actions. In the beginning of this year, the  government met with the chairmen of people's committees and  people's councils to discuss the execution of these tasks. In  providing guidance for the implementation of the National  Assembly resolution, a working regulation for better  coordination between the prime minister, National Assembly  chairman, the chief justice of the Supreme People's Court, and  chief of the Supreme People's Organ of Control was established  by the National Assembly Standing Committee. Therefore, the  investigation and dealing with all cases of violation and  offenders have been proceeding at a faster pace. In 13 major  legal cases in 1993 handled directly by the central organs, 12  cases have been tried. The government has also accelerated the  changing and supplement of its regulations and policies,  especially in dealing with construction investment, the  establishing of state budget targets, and market management.    Regarding anti-corruption work, the number of corruption  cases discovered in the first four months of this year is less  than that of the same period last year. However, corruption is  still serious, and occurs mainly in the transferring and selling  of houses and land, the spending and collection of state budget,  the handling of money of state enterprises, the management of  foreign aid, in the demand for bribes in the administration, in  commodity control, and traffic control.    The number of smuggling cases discovered and dealt with in  the first four months of this year is three percent more than  the same period last year with the value of confiscated goods at  25 percent more than that of last year. Cross border and  airline smuggling cases have decreased but smuggling by the sea  route has been increasing and is becoming more serious and  complex.    Noteworthy is the recent legalization and registration of  illegally imported cars and motorcycles by some provinces after  the collection of a small amount of tax. The government is  investigating people's committees and related organs in these  provinces. In the coming period, it is necessary to closely  coordinate the execution of the National Assembly resolution  with on-going programs for economic and administrative reform to  cope with emerging phenomena and gradually solve fundamental  issues relating to regulations and mechanism.    The result of our efforts depends firstly on the  responsibility and conscientiousness of heads of government  organs from the central to grassroots levels and the role of all  mass organizations in each locality. What is abnormal is that  most of the corruption and smuggling cases have not been  discovered by organs and units where the offenders used to work.  Therefore, it is necessary to heighten the responsibility of  party organs, government, and mass organizations in all sectors  and echelons, beginning with the education and control of party  members and cadres to uncover and deal with all cases of  violation. The government also suggests that National Assembly  deputies and National Assembly constituent groups strengthen  their supervisory role in this task, especially in their working  place and their constituents.    The government welcomes the positive contribution of all  mass  media agencies in this fight. It is hoped that newspapers and  radios will carry out more satisfactority their roles as defined  by the Press Law. It is also hoped that they will also strive  to overcome the shortcomings in their reporting, and thus  contribute to further accelerating the movement to combine the  voice of the press, public opinion, and the responsibility of  state organs to increase the strength and efficiency of this  struggle.    Fifth, we must broaden and heighten the result of our  scientific, educational, cultural, and social activities. In  our striving to execute the 1994 program of actions for the  successful implementation of the National Assembly resolution,  all related sections must have better improvements, especially  in the mountainous and isolated areas. For ethnic people, the  economic issue is attached even more closely to the cultural and  social aspects. The government funding for investment in  mountainous and ethnic areas has clearly manifested that  relationship. This funding must be used correctly and  efficiently to create conditions that would allow the  mountainous people to take advantage of their local situation to  eliminate starvation, reduce poverty, gradually enrich  themselves, improve their intelligence, and reduce disease and  drug addiction.    It is necessary to make preparations for the 1994-95 new  school year while at the same time continuing to increase the  number of students at all levels and create conditions for more  children to attend school. Greater efforts are needed to  improve the quality of education and training. Plans must be  worked out to adjust the objectives of primary education and  give general education school students more access to elective  courses or subjects. Steps must be taken to renovate the  contents of social science and humanities. Plans must be worked  out to stabilize the organization and operations of the national  university and the three newly established regional universities  at an early date. Urgent measures are needed to prepare for the  establishment of the Ho Chi Minh City National University.    It is necessary to see to it that scientific and  technological research contributes positively to the formulation  of industrialization and modernization strategies and of  sectorial or regional development projects, as well as to the  assessment of the renovation process. It is important to see to  it that scientific and technological research projects focus on  targeted areas, be consistent with socioeconomic development  projects, and yield practical results. It is necessary to  uphold the sense of responsibility of state management agencies  when it comes to technology imports assessment and inspection.  It is important to implement the regulations on product  quality, take measures against contraband, and enforce the law  on environmental protection. Special efforts must be made to  reduce pollution in the urban areas. Steps must be taken to  improve the environment in the countryside.    Regarding cultural and information services, the purposes of  the three state-level programs are to renovate historical relics  to prevent them from further deterioration, organize and promote  cultural and information services at grassroots establishments  and in the countryside, and consolidate and expand  cinematography. It is necessary to link these three programs to  diversified activities to mark major anniversaries, bearing in  mind the need to make these activities attractive to broad  sections of the population. At the same time, it is necessary  to improve the overall quality of artistic programs and cultural  products. Continued efforts are needed to gradually modernize  radio and television networks and strengthen culture and art  management through the law to ensure strict implementation of  regulations and rules that are in effect.    As far as public health care is concerned, efforts must be  concentrated more on grassroots establishments. Measures must  be taken to get rid of the situation in which medical care and  treatment is nonexistent at certain villages. It is necessary  to implement disease control and prevention programs  satisfactorily, fight child malnutrition, and improve the  quality of medical care and treatment. At the same time, it is  necessary to adjust the system of hospital fees and medical  insurance premiums, start the construction of two special  medical centers in Hanoi Municipality and Ho Chi Minh City,  formulate a national policy on medicine, perfect pharmaceutical  development projects and medical equipment development projects,  consolidate the management of state agencies over public  healthcare provision, and enforce the regulations governing  medical and pharmaceutical practices by the private sector.    Prompt measures must be taken to expand the population  activities and family planning network down to villages and  wards and combine propaganda activities with efforts to broaden  services, thus increasing the number of people who wish to  adopt contraceptive methods to reduce the percentage of families  with a third child.    Regarding physical education and sports activities, it is  necessary to pay due attention to the masses' movement, work out  positive measures to build the contingent of athletes, and  organize physical education and sports congresses at all levels  in anticipation of the 1995 national physical education and  sports congress. Vietnamese athletes must participate  positively in international and regional contests and must  improve their achievements, especially at the Asian Games  scheduled for late 1994.    It is necessary to enhance the results of social welfare  programs, especially job development programs and hunger  elimination and poverty reduction programs. Care must be given  to children who have nobody to turn to in time of need. It is  necessary to make preparations for the promulgation of the  regulations on favors to be done to those who have rendered  meritorious services. Adequate arrangements must be made to  relocate the burial sites of fallen combatants. Plans must be  worked out to maintain and expand the movement to show gratitude  to those who have rendered meritorious services.    Measures must be taken to implement programs to eliminate  the  evils of prostitution, drug addiction, and HIV infection,  bearing in mind the need to guarantee close and uninterrupted  direction of party committee echelons and administrative organs  at all levels, especially at ward and village levels. It is  necessary to secure routine and constant coordination among  administrative organs, front organizations, and the mass media.  It is necessary to attach due importance to educational  activities and preventive measures in combination with necessary  legal action.</p>

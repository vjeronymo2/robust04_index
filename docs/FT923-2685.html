			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Institutions increase demand for LME metal A NEW and volatile source of demand for London Metal Exchange metals has arrived because more financial institutions are investing in commodities, according to Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economic adviser at RTZ Corporation, the world's largest mining company. He says: 'Given the size of the metal markets, only a small shift in fund investment could push prices up substantially.' Compared with other financial markets, the LME was relatively small, he said. The total value of all the exchange's metal stocks was only Dollars 2.2bn at the start of 1992 and Dollars 3.4bn in late August. 'The total cost of buying up existing stocks of some individual metals would be relatively low, although only a portion would be needed to influence the market.' In a paper which RTZ will present to analysts and investment fund managers, Mr Crowson says it has been suggested that the financial institutions start investing in commodities for the first time for ten to 15 years to diversify their portfolios. 'In practice, the prospective returns from price appreciation have appeared considerable when compared with likely returns from alternative assets.' Investment interest has helped to drive LME turnover - which is much greater than the value of its stocks - to record levels this year, Mr Crowson, who is an LME director, says: 'This is fine as long as the institutions pay more than lip service to portfolio asset management, but not if they become mesmerised by patterns of prices on charts. 'The recent experiences of the gold market show the potential dangers of changing investment fashions.' But the development of more complex trading strategies, linked largely to the growth of options markets, and the transfer of precious metals market experience to base metals suggests 'there may have been a stepwise change in behaviour.  --------------------------------------       LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  -------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium  -350  to  1,358,650 Copper   +3,000  to    281,800 Lead       +100  to    156,825 Nickel     +300  to     44,688 Zinc       +450  to    354,075 Tin        -105  to     14,630  --------------------------------------</p>

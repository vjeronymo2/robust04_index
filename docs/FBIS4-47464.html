These  compounds have also been proposed for use in preparing  ultra-pure arsenic sulfide and arsenic trioxide, as well as  metallic arsenic itself. In the present work the molecular  structure and vibration spectra of trimethylarsenite were  studied by gas phase electronography, IR- and Raman  spectroscopy. The resulting molecular constants were then used  to calculate the thermodynamic functions of the ideal gas state.  Standard enthalpy of formation was calculated and the standard  Gibbs energy of formation of trimethylarsenite from simple  substances was determined.

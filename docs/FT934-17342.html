			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Obscure view of milk issues Sir, Andrew Dare recognises that milk supply in the UK is constrained by EC quotas to less than total demand but goes on to suggest that, despite this, prices should be determined by the market place. This can only mean that UK prices will rise and users of dairy products will be encouraged to direct future investment towards countries which can guarantee reliable supplies at more competitive prices. However efficient our dairy processors prove to be, how are they going to compete successfully with comparably efficient companies in Ireland or the Netherlands or France, where there are adequate supplies and real competition?

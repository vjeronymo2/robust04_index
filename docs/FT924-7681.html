			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Fair shares for employees SHARE OPTION schemes have become very popular with employees in the UK. But what happens when the scheme ends and employees try to claim the profits? How can they stop the taxman taking a chunk? There are two types of share option scheme in which the special 'approved' status confers tax privileges on employees. Savings-related share options are available to all full-time staff but those wishing to take up the offer must enter into a five-year savings contract, the proceeds of which will be sufficient to pay for the optioned shares. By contrast, participation in an executive share option scheme is at the company's discretion and there is no requirement for a linked savings arrangement. The crucial feature common to both schemes is that no tax is payable when an option is converted into shares. This contrasts with the position under non-approved schemes where the exercise of an option triggers an immediate income tax liability. The fiscal immunity of approved options comes to an abrupt end once the optionholder has become a shareholder. Although this is obviously not a problem for as long as they are happy to remain as shareholders, employees will frequently wish to cash in some or all of their shares. A sale of option shares is just as much subject to capital gains tax as any other share disposal. Avoiding 40 per cent income tax at the point of exercise will be a rather hollow achievement if the optionholder suffers 40 per cent capital gains tax on disposal. The first line of defence against such a melancholy outcome will be the annual CGT exemption - currently Pounds 5,800. Although a single allowance will only shelter small-scale gains, a much more robust shelter can be constructed by spreading disposals over more than one tax year and using a spouse's exemptions. Suppose that Mr Z has an approved option to buy 12,000 shares for Pounds 1 each and that he exercises it in November 1992 when the share price has risen to Pounds 3. Full CGT on Z's gain of Pounds 24,000 (12,000 x Pounds 2) would amount to Pounds 9,600, reducing his net profit to only Pounds 14,400. This Pounds 9,600 tax charge can be virtually eliminated by a combination of patience and marital teamwork. The first step is for Z to give 6,000 shares to Mrs Z. An inter-spouse transfer is CGT-neutral, so no tax will be payable, but Mrs Z will be deemed to have acquired the shares for the original price. The next stage - which must be implemented by April 5 next year - is for Z and his wife to sell 3,000 shares each. Assuming the price has stuck at Pounds 3, the Zs will each realise a gain of Pounds 6,000 - all but Pounds 200 of which will be taken care of by their annual exemptions. As early as April 6 next year the same exercise can be repeated - this time taking advantage of the 1993/94 exemptions. These manoeuvrings will have whittled down the taxable gain from Pounds 24,000 to a mere Pounds 800 and boosted the residual profit from Pounds 14,400 to Pounds 23,680 - a 64 per cent rise. While this technique can be equally effective for both executive and savings-related schemes, executive holders who use it must beware of an insidious statutory trap. Whereas the exercise of a savings-related option is a once-and-for-all event, executive options can be exercised in several slices. So, if Mr Z holds an executive option, he may be tempted to save on financing costs by not taking up the second tranche of shares until just before he is ready to sell them. This is a temptation to be resisted. The exempt status of executive options is predicated on the basis of no more than one exercise every three years. If Z breaches this rule, his second exercise will drop straight into the income tax net. Gone will be the prospect of exploiting double CGT exemptions. Instead, the Pounds 12,000 gain in April 1993 will suffer the full rigours of income tax. The moral is: 'Stagger your sales but not your exercises.' Finally, a fresh angle for savings-related participants to explore is the single company personal equity plan (SCP). Since the start of 1992, investors have been able to contribute up to Pounds 3,000 per year to an SCP, with the holders of savings-related options able to make their inputs in shares rather than cash. Provided shares are transferred within 90 days of emerging from the scheme, the transfer will be tax-free. From then on, the SCP provides complete protection from income tax on dividends and CGT on disposal. Although the concept is appealing, the prospective tax savings will often be insufficient to justify the complexity and expense involved. Employees such as Mr Z who have other, simpler, ways of avoiding CGT may well find that the tax saved on dividends is outweighed by plan managers' charges.

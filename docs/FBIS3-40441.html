			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "Turbomachines of the Future </F> Being Designed by Computer"]    [Text] The ONERA [National Office for Aerospace  Studies and Research] devotes eight percent of its activity to  the improvement of Turbomachines, mainly through 3D simulation  software.    Since their advent, turbomachines have undergone  considerable  development. Smaller and lighter, they are nevertheless more  powerful, more economical, less noisy, and less pollutive. This  ongoing improvement over the years has been owing to  optimization of the geometric design of compressors, resulting  in higher compression ratios; to the introduction of new  materials that are resistant to higher temperatures; but also to  new manufacturing techniques, particularly the drilling of  microperforations by electronic bombardment, which enables the  manufacture of higher-performance combustion chambers...    Further improvement is nevertheless still possible. And this  is what ONERA, together with Snecma, Turbomeca, the SEP  [European Propellants Company], and Microturbo, have set out to  prove. Their principal objective is to develop numeric codes in  three dimensions describing reality with greater and greater  accuracy and capable of modeling the complex flows that take  place in the components of the motor. Strategic points requiring  study are compressors and turbine stages, with the continued  object of augmenting compression ratios and efficiencies.    As veritable air-churning machines, these two components are  the sites of complex aerodynamic flows. Studies have already  advanced considerably in this domain, and manufacturers can  already optimize the geometry of their compressor and turbine  disks through the use of the CANARI software developed by ONERA.  CANARI enables the modeling of the flow around an isolated  wheel, in three dimensions, and with due regard for viscous  effects. This operation requires four to five hours on a Cray.  Unfortunately, this tool is applicable to a single wheel and as  yet cannot simulate interactions between disks that create a  nonsteady flow. Different tools have been developed to deal with  this phenomenon. But these are either two-dimensional, or  limited to nonviscous flows. "In a about a year, we should  achieve a realistic 3D design tool," says Georges Meauze,  turbomachines coordinator at ONERA. "Nevertheless, it will be  three to four years before it becomes usable by industrialists.  It will take that much time to reduce design times to reasonable  values."    In addition to complex aerodynamic flows, turbines are  subject to aerothermodynamic phenomena. Temperatures at the exit  of the combustion chamber are very high, and this creates  thermal stresses in the disks of turbines, modifying their  temperature field, hence their radial geometry. This distortive  phenomenon can have disastrous effects on efficiency, with blade  losses becoming significant. MATHILDA design software, developed  by ONERA, is devoted to this effect and is available to  industry. It takes viscous effects into account in three  dimensions.    These are all tools that must be validated. For this  purpose,  ONERA has numerous test facilities, that are constantly being  improved, to simulate an ever-growing number of elements. It  lacks one facility: An installation for simulating thermal  effects on a turbine stage. The cost of building a "hot"  facility would be excessive; so ONERA is studying the  possibility of building a "warm" one...    Concurrently, research is being pursued on new materials,  principally on superalloys intended for turbine blades and  compressor disks...</p>

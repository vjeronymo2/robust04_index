			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of World Car Industry (13): Tough battle for recovery  -Volvo and Saab depend on the alliances they have forged / Sweden TO judge by the dismal performance recently of Volvo and Saab, Sweden is not a good place to make cars. Operating losses in Volvo's car division piled up to SKr4.45bn in the years 1990, 1991 and 1992. In the same period, overall losses at Saab totalled SKr8.18bn. Both companies have continued in the red in 1993, suffering heavy declines in the numbers of vehicles sold in the first half of the year. This has taken place against a background of a catastrophic decline in their home market. New car sales in Sweden, in the grip of a fierce recession for the past three years, have plummeted from a peak of 340,000 in 1988 to an expected figure this year of less than 120,000. The survival of these two potent symbols of Swedish manufacturing and engineering prowess has come to depend on the alliances they have forged with foreign volume car producers - with France's Renault, in the case of Volvo, and with America's General Motors, which is a 50 per cent co-owner of Saab along with Sweden's Saab-Scania group. Already, both companies have undergone profound and expensive restructuring which has cost the jobs of thousands of their Swedish workers. Now, with new models launched, Volvo and Saab are fighting to prove that Swedish carmakers can have a profitable future - albeit under the wing of foreign partners. With the bulk of cars produced by both companies sold overseas, the collapse of the Swedish market is not as damaging as it might seem at first sight. But it makes the task of recovery even harder, particularly given the double-digit decline in car sales in Europe this year. The strategy common to both the Renault-Volvo and the GM-Saab links is that both the Swedish companies will continue to produce cars that retain a clear Volvo and Saab identity. Their individual look - the body styling - and their Swedish qualities of safety, performance and 'greenness' will be carefully preserved. Meanwhile, under the skin, there will be the maximum use of common components, design and production systems, to cut costs. However, the evolution of the two alliances has been very different. In the case of Saab, the smaller of the two rivals, GM bought in in 1989, took over management control and has since pumped in SKr4bn in new capital, matched by a similar amount from Saab-Scania, which is fully owned by Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family. Saab now operates as an arm of GM, producing its premium 900 and 9000 models to compete principally with BMW, Audi and Mercedes in a market segment GM and its European operation Opel otherwise do not directly contest. For Volvo, the link with Renault has been more complex. It began in September 1990 with an exchange of minority stakes at a time when Volvo had been waxing strong and Renault's finances were weak. Since then, however, this position has reversed to the point that Volvo is set to be the junior partner when the link matures into a full merger, as is anticipated shortly. Volvo shareholders have expressed some confusion over what Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the chairman and long-time chief of Volvo, intends the future shape of the company should be. This confusion has been compounded by the deal Mr Gyllenhammar struck with the Swedish government earlier this year over Procordia, the drugs and food group jointly controlled by Volvo and the state. Under the accord, Volvo will take over the food businesses of Procordia and retain up to a 35 per cent stake in the spun-off pharmaceuticals unit. Many Swedish investors have questioned why a car, truck and marine engine manufacturer should want to diversify in this way. The resolution of what had been a year-long wrangle with the government over Procordia cleared the way for further deepening of the Renault-Volvo relationship. Already, Renault and Volvo have gone a long way towards integrating their car production. They make some 20 per cent of their annual purchases jointly to cut supply costs and say this could rise to 80 per cent. Renault supplies engines and gearboxes for the smaller Volvo 400 series made in the Netherlands. It will supply diesel engines for both companies, while Volvo's latest petrol engine will go into some Renault models. In June, they set up a joint department to plan new car production and they plan a common platform for their next generation of executive models. Both Volvo and Saab, in league with their foreign partners, have done much to improve their competitive position. They have been helped considerably by the strong devaluation late last year of the Swedish krona. But in a falling market, with heavy overcapacity in world car making, they still face a tough battle for recovery.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Kohl beams from on high: 'Feelgood' chancellor radiates poll confidence 'The Chancellor's coming,' the posters proclaim, and the faithful are gathered in eager expectation in their spanking modern tennis stadium in Halle, Westphalia, modelled on the Centre Court at Wimbledon. Three brass bands take it in turns to warm up the crowd. Suddenly he's there, surging up the aisle surrounded by a phalanx of sober-suited young men, to the thoroughly inappropriate martial strains of 'Prussia's Glory'. Mr Helmut Kohl, the beefy provincial politician from the west German Rhineland-Palatinate is a decidedly un-Prussian figure. Here is the man who is both messenger and message of the ruling German coalition and his own Christian Democratic Union (CDU). His very bulk and reputation are the issues at stake in the forthcoming general election on October 16. All his party posters have his beaming picture, radiating security and stability, with the slogan: 'Germany is the issue,' blatantly exploiting his image as the personification of material well-being, solid citizenship and German unification. Mr Kohl is the ultimate exponent of the 'feelgood factor', displaying confidence in the future, with a good dose of stern statesmanship to temper it. Only nine months after the polls wrote him off in public popularity, the Chancellor is back on a roll which looks likely to carry him to a fourth term in government. He no longer really needs to attack his opponents in the Social Democratic party (SPD), Mr Rudolf Scharping and his lieutenants, Mr Oskar Lafontaine and Mr Gerhard Schroder. Yet his political instincts are too acute to resist it. In this heartland of west German prosperity, where the tennis stadium itself has been built merely to satisfy the whim of a local industrialist who wanted a Wimbledon in his home town, his top theme goes down well. He is determined to tar the SPD with the brush of being soft on Communism, in spite of the end of the Cold War. His target is the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), reformed rump of the former East German communist party, which he denounces as 'red-painted fascists'. And the message is that the SPD can only hope to unseat him in Bonn with the tacit support of those communists. As for Social Democrats, they are a 'joyless bunch', he declares. 'You don't have to sneak off to the cellar to have a good laugh.' This is the man of the people who made it, the international statesman from Oggersheim who strides the world stage with the likes of Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin and yet whose homely rhetoric still belongs to the provinces. But the real message is about the broad sweep of history, not the minor details of party politics. It is about German unification, and his leading part in achieving it, about the need today to unite the country economically and psychologically, rather than simply geographically. It is also about Germany's role in the international community and his passionate commitment to an integrated, united Europe as the essential counterpart to German unification. It is a theme which might not prove too popular to Germans who worry about the future loss of the D-Mark in a single European currency, but this is Chancellor Kohl the statesman: he puts the European Union right up front in his vision of the world. And it is about German competitiveness, and the need to carry on belt-tightening in the German economy to face up to the new competitors, not just in Asia, but just over the border in Czechoslovakia. It is a speech that runs to 90 minutes, without a note, and he's delivered it three times since noon, but electioneering is what Helmut Kohl does best: he thrives on the buzz of the auditorium and glad-handing in the crowd. He knows there are still a tough three weeks ahead, but he senses the tide is with him. He can afford to play the world statesman and leave party politicking to the rest.</p>

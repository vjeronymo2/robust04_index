He said that although Belarus was well aware of the  importance of its participation in the international effort to  settle armed conflicts, the presidium did not even venture to  raise this question in the parliament. The Belarusian people  have not yet got over the Afghan syndrome, he said. He also  added that during the Afghan war Belarus had lost far more  soldiers than other former Soviet republics.    Shushkevich said that the current psychological condition of  Belarusian society and the memories of World War II during which  Belarus lost one fourth of its population was another reason for  refusal.    He stated that other representatives of the UN  secretary-general had also been informed of the presidium's  unanimous position.    See the upcoming issue of the Presidential Bulletin for  Shushkevich's exclusive interview with Interfax.</p>

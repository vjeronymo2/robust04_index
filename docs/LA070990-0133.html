			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTENSE, FEISTY SCALIA GIVES HIGH COURT A SHARP EDGE  </P> <P> Four years ago, when Justice Antonin Scalia took his seat on the Supreme Court,  observers quickly predicted that he would be the driving force behind a  conservative revolution in American law.  </P> <P> Quick-witted and intense, the former University of Chicago law professor  dominated the debate in the panel's stately, column-ringed courtroom almost  from the start. A prominent law magazine immediately dubbed the institution  "Scalia's court," insisting that if the high court's sessions ever were  televised, his name would become a household word.  </P> <P> But now, as the high court's 1989-90 term comes to an end, Scalia seems more a  force without followers. Rather than leading the court to the right, he has  devoted much of the past year to berating his conservative colleagues for  taking what he views as fuzzy or moderate positions.  </P> <P> Perhaps as a result, the stridence of Scalia's writing is attracting more  attention these days than the substance of his arguments.  </P> <P> "Scalia really had his fangs out this year," says Northwestern University law  professor Lawrence Marshall, who recently served as a court clerk. "His  dissents seem to say that 'if you don't agree with me, you must be out of your  mind.' "  </P> <P> "He's the most ideological of the conservatives," says University of Virginia  law professor A. E. Dick Howard. But "he's also the most provocative,  interesting figure up there."  </P> <P> Examples of Scalia's blunt-spoken style abound:  </P> <P>  -- On the final day of last year's term, Scalia lashed out at Justice Sandra  Day O'Connor for refusing to cast a decisive fifth vote that would have been  needed to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the landmark abortion rights case. Her stated  reasons for refusing to rule squarely on the right to abortion were  "irrational" and "cannot be taken seriously," Scalia harrumphed.  </P> <P>  -- Two weeks ago, he sharply criticized the court for taking on the issue of  whether a comatose person has a "right to die" -- asserting that the answer is  "neither set forth in the Constitution nor known to the nine justices of this  court any better than . . . to nine people picked at random from the Kansas  City telephone directory." Instead, Scalia wrote, since the Constitution says  nothing about abortion or a right to die, "we should announce, clearly and  promptly, that the federal courts have no business in this field."  </P> <P>  -- In March, when Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined with the court's  liberals to uphold a state law that banned corporations from running newspaper  ads in support of political candidates, Scalia read an angry dissent from the  bench: The government cannot use "censorship" to assure fairness in elections,  he said.  </P> <P>  -- Two weeks ago, Scalia again slammed his fellow conservatives for failing to  enforce another clearly defined right: By a 5-4 margin, the court had ruled  that an accused child molester does not have "an absolute right" to confront  his accuser in court and, therefore, that child victims may testify via  closed-circuit television. Scalia lectured the majority that the Constitution  "with unmistakable clarity" grants defendants in criminal cases the right to  face their accusers. For good or bad, he declared, "the Sixth Amendment  requires confrontation -- and we are not at liberty to ignore it."  </P> <P> Such onslaughts have given the 54-year-old Scalia a sure reputation as a  zealot. "Rather than being a team player for the conservatives, he has taken on  the role of the one who articulates the True Faith," says University of Chicago  Law School Dean Geoffrey Stone. "He proselytizes for the faith, and (then)  chides his colleagues when they fail to live up to it."  </P> <P> For Scalia, the True Faith means adhering strictly to the words of the  Constitution. The First Amendment says that the government may not pass any law  "abridging the freedom of speech," so, in the recent ruling on flag burning,  Scalia zealously protected the protesters -- to the dismay of conservatives.  The Constitution also says that every person has a right to the "equal  protection of the laws," so Scalia argues that any government preference for  blacks or whites -- such as affirmative action programs -- is absolutely  unconstitutional.  </P> <P> On the bench, Scalia energizes the court debates. While several of his aging  colleagues sit somnolently through the arguments, Scalia prods and pokes at the  attorneys on both sides. At times, a quick question reveals his New York  boyhood more than his Harvard law background. Earlier this year, as a lawyer  spun out a long-winded argument to make a dubious point, Scalia looked  agonized, then amazed. Finally, he simply couldn't hold back any longer. "Ah,  come on. You can't be serious about that!" he exclaimed.  </P> <P> Although the justice's legal writings sometimes suggest an acerbic, even bitter  man, Scalia after hours is warm, genial and outgoing. At parties, he is  renowned for playing the piano and leading songfests. At the court, he jogs  with his law clerks and greets court employees like old friends. One evening,  several reporters spotted Scalia leaving the court in a tuxedo and teased him  on his natty attire. "Ah, yes," he retorted, "esteemed jurist by day, man about  town at night."  </P> <P> The son of an Italian immigrant, "Nino" Scalia grew up in Queens, N.Y., a  blue-collar neighborhood on Long Island that was home to TV's fictional Archie  Bunker. A brilliant student, he was graduated at the top of his class at  Georgetown University and Harvard Law School. After practicing law in Cleveland  during the 1960s, he took a pay cut to teach -- first at the University of  Virginia, then at Chicago.  </P> <P> Scalia joined the Justice Department under President Gerald R. Ford. In 1981,  then-President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the U.S. Court of Appeals in  Washington. When Rehnquist was elevated to chief justice in 1986, Reagan tapped  Scalia to be an associate justice.  </P> <P> Scalia's supporters contend that the justice merely has attempted to fashion a  clear, consistent intellectual approach to deciding constitutional cases. If a  "right" is spelled out in the Constitution, Scalia says, the court should  vigorously protect it; if not, the justices should stand back and let the other  branches of government -- cities, states or Congress -- make the decisions.  </P> <P> Ironically, however, his strict, literalist approach frequently pits Scalia  against another of the court's better-known conservatives, Justice O'Connor,  who takes a decidedly different approach. Like former Justice Lewis F. Powell  Jr., O'Connor seeks to mete out justice and fairness, rather than ideology. Her  opinions are balanced, nuanced, and -- at times -- confusing. Rarely is there a  clear, firm declaration of her ideological views.  </P> <P> These days, liberals hang their hopes on O'Connor's passion for balance. But to  conservatives such as Scalia, her moderation is a cause for outrage. "My guess  is that he is disappointed in her," says Washington attorney Alan B. Morrison,  a longtime friend of Scalia. "He probably thought he could persuade her to go  further" in restricting abortion or affirmative action, Morrison said.  </P> <P> But Morrison, among others, questions why Scalia routinely attacks O'Connor so  directly. "It's hard to fathom how that will help his cause," he says. Harvard  law professor Laurence H. Tribe, who frequently argues before the court,  agrees. Tribe says that Scalia's domination of the debates "seems to irritate  some of the other justices. I also think his shooting from the hip and aiming  at the egos of his colleagues, has not endeared him to them," he adds.  </P> <P> In an opinion last year in Croson vs. Richmond, for example, O'Connor argued  that because the equal-treatment guarantee in the Constitution protects whites  and blacks equally, the city of Richmond could not set aside 30% of its city  contracts for black entrepreneurs. But O'Connor went on to say that affirmative  action might be permissible in an "extreme" case if it were the only way to  make up for blatant exclusion of blacks in the past.  </P> <P> By contrast, Scalia left no room for any such doubts. In a separate statement,  he attacked O'Connor's opinion as muddled and said that the court should rule  clearly that official racial classifications of any sort were unconstitutional.  He also forecast -- correctly -- that the court opinion was so ambiguous that  it would simply spur more litigation.  </P> <P> Predictably, perhaps, the interpretation of O'Connor's decision depended on the  eye of the beholder. Conservative lawyers contended that her opinion marked the  end of affirmative action efforts by state and city governments; civil rights  lawyers said that it did no such thing.  </P> <P> Unintentionally, perhaps, Scalia's dissent on the child-molester case placed  him squarely in the same corner as the court's three liberals. And that was not  the first time: He joined with them last year -- and again last month -- to  rule that the right to free speech protects protesters who burn an American  flag.  </P> <P> "The liberals don't give him credit where it's due," says Richard Bernstein, a  Washington lawyer and a former Scalia clerk. "He obviously has no love for  child-molesters or flag-burners, but he has a love for the language of the  Constitution."  </P> <P> But Scalia's rigid interpretation of the Constitution frequently places him on  the opposite side from the liberals. Over the last 25 years, the high court's  dominant liberal bloc created broad legal doctrines out of simple words in the  Constitution. For example, the right to "liberty" was interpreted to mean that  individuals have a right to privacy, that women have a right to abortion, and  -- now -- that all Americans have a right to refuse life-sustaining medical  treatment. Scalia would reverse all of these doctrines because they are not  based on clearly spelled-out constitutional rights.  </P> <P> For Supreme Court lawyers who would like to present a tidy half-hour argument  and then sit down, Scalia's intense interest comes as a mixed blessing. "You  know you are going to have to confront Nino," said one attorney who appears  before him regularly. "You have to prepare for him," he says.  </P> <P> Most likely, attorneys will have to prepare for Justice Scalia for many years  to come. If there is a voluntary retirement age for Supreme Court justices, it  comes about age 80. And for Antonin Scalia, the energetic intellectual of the  conservative bloc, his 80th birthday will come during the year 2016.  </P> <P> </P> <P> QUOTATIONS FROM JUSTICE SCALIA: On the "right to die":  </P> <P> "The point at which life becomes 'worthless', and the point at which the means  necessary to preserve it become 'extraordinary' or 'inappropriate' are neither  set forth in the Constitution nor known to the nine Justices of this court any  better than they are known to nine people picked at random from the Kansas City  telephone directory. . . . I would have preferred that we announce, clearly and  promptly, that the federal courts have no business in this field."  </P> <P> On the "right to abortion":  </P> <P> "I continue to believe...that the Constitution contains no right to abortion.  It is not be found in the long-standing traditions of our society, nor can it  be logically deduced from the text of the Constitution. Leaving this matter to  the political process is not only legally correct, it is pragmatically so. . .  . The court should end its disruptive intrusion in this field as soon as  possible."  </P> <P> On witnesses in child-molestation cases testifying via television:  </P> <P> "The Sixth Amendment provides, with unmistakable clarity, that 'in all criminal  prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the  witnesses against him.' That face-to-face presence may, unfortunately, upset  the truthful rape victim or abused child, but by the same token it may confound  and undo the false accuser, or reveal the child coaxed by a malevolent adult.  We are not free to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of clear and explicit  constitutional guarantees and then to adjust their meaning to comport with our  findings. For good or bad, the Sixth Amendment requires confrontation and we  are not at liberty to ignore it."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH WATCH;  </P> <P> BIRTH RIGHTS  </P> <P> The latest statistics on U.S. infant mortality are worse than embarrassing --  they are shameful.  </P> <P> We now rank 21st in the world: Below the least wealthy industrialized nations,  such as Ireland, and nearer more advanced Third World countries, such as Costa  Rica.  </P> <P> Over one-quarter of our 40,000 infant deaths each year are preventable,  according to a report by the White House Task Force on Infant Mortality, as are  one-fourth of the chronic or disabling conditions developed each year by  another 400,000 babies.  </P> <P> But the Bush Administration has yet to release the year-old, damning report:  Some critics charge the delay is because the report recommends $500 million in  new public funding for prenatal, maternal and well-baby programs.  </P> <P> Whatever the reason, the report is another painful reminder that U.S. health  care -- private and public -- continues to spend money on virtually everything  except prevention and public education.  </P> <P> The report points out how economical common sense can be. Experts claim that  each dollar spent on prenatal and maternity care -- from drug treatment to  regular checkups -- eliminates the need for $3 worth of high-tech care later  on.  </P> <P> Administration officials say the report is being "refined." But no amount of  editing or fine-tuning can justify stalling on so vital an issue. The report  should be released from its state of indefinite detention.  </P> <P> Moreover, this nation is not heeding its own folk wisdom: An ounce of  prevention is worth a pound of cure.  </P></p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hoechst sees profits ahead more than 20% Hoechst, the German chemicals multinational, expects 1994 net profit to be up 'more than 20 per cent,' Mr Gunter Metz, vice-chairman in charge of American operations, said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Mexico City. 'But that's still not enough,' he added, saying the company continued to have problems worldwide in fibre and polymer sales. Mr Metz was attending the 50th anniversary of Celanese Mexicana, Hoechst's Mexican subsidiary. Hoechst has a 51 per cent participation in Celanese. He declined to comment on speculation that the company was looking to acquire a leading US chemical company. Hoechst has already acknowledged 'holding discussions with several different US companies,' but has refused to comment on rumours of a bid for Marion Merrell Dow, a unit of Dow Chemical. Mr Metz did say, however, that Hoechst has aggressive plans to expand its US business. 'Our position in the North American market isn't a very big one,' he said. 'We have a target of becoming one of the top three or five' chemical companies there. Hoechst shares closed in Frankfurt at DM316.50, down DM7.50.</p>

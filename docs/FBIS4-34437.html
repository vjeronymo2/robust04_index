			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Gil Olmos and Elio Henriquez] </F>   [Excerpt] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 16 Jun --  Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia has said his role as mediator and the  role of Manuel Macho Soils as peace commissioner concluded with  the end of the dialogue phase between the EZLN [Zapatist  National Liberation Army] and the federal government in this  city.    In an interview granted to the media this morning, Ruiz said  "the dialogue between the government and the EZLN, involving the  commissioner and a mediator, who was accepted as part of the  dialogue, concluded this phase. Thus, as long as the situation  remains unchanged, there will no mediation on my part. There is  no established dialogue between civilian society and the  government.    "After the dialogue was held in San Cristobal, it was  declared finished. A reaction followed, and that was  communicated to the civilian sector, and the dialogue between  the EZLN and the government, strictly speaking, ended. "Thus,  the role of peace commissioner for dialogue with the EZLN ended  with the presentation of direct proposals to the requests and  demands that were made. Upon an appropriate report, as the one  I believe we will be presenting in due time, that role ended."    [LA JORNADA] Could there be another commissioner?    [Ruiz] Yes, because there is now another kind of dialogue  involved. It is no longer an EZLN-government dialogue but,  rather, a civilian population-government dialogue, and we will  have to wait and see how this dialogue is established.    Bishop Ruiz said the hierarchy of the Catholic Church will  not participate in the National Democratic Convention (CND),  called by the EZLN and which might be held in the first half of  July within EZLN territory.    "We are part of history in the making. If there are concrete  conditions and the entire civilian sector, which is primarily  Catholic, agrees with it, we will accompany the country to a  good goal: the search for a transition to a better fate in  history. We cannot stay out of this. The Catholic hierarchy  will not attend the convention unless there is a specific duty  for it to fulfill."    He said that from their very first messages, the bishops  urged people to understand that the Chiapas conflict had a  national scope. In this regard, the EZLN declaration of war was  not against a segment of the population, such as the ranchers or  large landowners, but against the Mexican Army because the  problem in Chiapas has national scope.    During this interview at Diocese Curia, Bishop Ruiz said  that  after analyzing the most recent EZLN communiques, it is clear a  nonresponse to the peace agreements is not tantamount to a  declaration of war.    To the contrary, he explained, "saying no to the agreements  is not tantamount to saying yes to war. It is a definite no to  war; a no to war in favor of a civic and nonmilitary solution; a  no to war because they unilaterally decided (it is now a  bilateral decision) to extend the cease-fire; a no to war and a  yes to the peace option through a dialogue. In this case,  however, a broader dialogue is being called, a dialogue that  includes the participation of the entire civilian sector."  [passage omitted]</p>

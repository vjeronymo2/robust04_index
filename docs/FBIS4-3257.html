			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, April 18 (XINHUA) -- The Portuguese  Government is determined to make all-out efforts to guarantee  the stability in Macao and the interests of local people.    The assurance was made by Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal  Cavaco Silva, who is here on a four-day visit, at a special  meeting of the Macao Legislative Council here today.    "We expect that Macao can maintain social stability and  development during the period from now on to the end of this  century. We also expect the transfer of power in 1999 will be  carried out in an atmosphere of stability and confidence,"  Cavaco Silva said.    He said that during his visit to Beijing before coming here,  he had exchanged views with Chinese leaders, who showed deep  concern with all things about macao and all matters relating to  preparation for Macao's future.    Both China and Portugal have sensed the necessity to  continue  dialog and cooperation between them, the prime minister added.    He also praised Macao's speedy economic development since  1987, under the environment of social stability, good public  order and the facts that local residents' interests were  guaranteed, he said.    "We are paving the way, in the light of the Sino-Portuguese  Joint Declaration, for the smooth transfer of power in Macao at  the end of this century. We are determined to do so in the next  few years, for the purpose of guaranteeing greater social,  economic and cultural development in Macao," the prime minister  said at the meeting.</p>

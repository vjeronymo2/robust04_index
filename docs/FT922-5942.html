			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Arts: Hvorostovsky and Borodina - Music in London Between performances of I Puritani at Covent Garden, the young Siberian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky found time for a Barbican concert on Tuesday. It was an excellent idea to present along with him the St Petersburg mezzo Olga Borodina (a year younger), but odd to give her conspicuously second-fiddle billing; in fact they took equal shares in the music. They sang Italian opera - Bellini, Ponchielli, Donizetti and Rossini - with the City of London Sinfonia, conducted by Julian Reynolds. The orchestra also delivered four matching overtures, quite expertly but without the fizz and brio for Rossini. (Reynolds was disarmingly genealogised in the programme-book as 'of Russian, German and English decent': just so.) As accompanists, they were entirely satisfactory, and the programme happily favoured their fine first cello. Reports of I Puritani have said that Hvorostovsky sounded underpowered. Perhaps at the Barbican he wanted to strike back: he opened up impressive reserves of power, and (like Miss Borodina) chose to sustain climactic notes with maximum force - once, even, after the orchestra had ended the music. At that level of attack, his timbre still boasted plenty of depth and density, not always 'beautiful' in the narrow sense. His boyish pout-and-grin, and his open-armed manner, made a piquant contrast with a voice that is surely aimed toward the bass-baritone range. The King Alfonso of Donizetti's Favorita suited him best, from stentorian protest to a melting duet with Borodina's 'Favorita'. In their Barbiere excerpts he made a brusque, slightly dangerous Figaro (imagine 'Largo al factotum' sung as if it were Basilio's 'Rumour'-aria). With his dark, covered vowels, mercurial Italian delivery is not his forte, though forte it certainly was. There, Miss Borodina shaded him. In La Cieca's aria from La Gioconda, and as Leonora in the Favorita excerpts, her unstinting warmth and easy dignity explained at once the sensation she created at Edinburgh as Mussorgsky's Marfa. In the Favorita duet, she and Hvorostovsky sang like loving twins. With Rossini, however, a new facet was displayed to brilliant effect: in coloratura, Borodina bids to be a worthy heir of Marilyn Horne. I would bet that she knows Horne's account of the Semiramide 'Ah] quel giorno' very well indeed, but she gave her own stamp to that spectacular aria. Resilient poise and pounce, if not quite Horne's electrical snap and crackle; and in certain phrases, a bonus of lusty tendresse over Horne's patrician sweep. For the Barbiere Rosina she revealed a further range of comic and romantic airs and graces, crowned by a playfully dramatic 'Una voce poco fa' of real distinction. There is clearly a lot more of the Borodina potential to be explored, with high expectations. We hear her soon at the Royal Opera, with Domingo in Samson et Dalila.</p>

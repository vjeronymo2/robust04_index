			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Myakishev] </F>   [Text] Marrakech (Morocco), 14 April -- The successful  completion of the Uruguay round of the multilateral trade talks,  which went on for over seven years, is a major step towards a  greater openness of world markets and services, a reduction in  tariff and non-tariff trade restrictions and the establishment  of fair regulations and norms for all participants. This was  stated by Oleg Davydov, the Russian minister of foreign economic  relations, when he spoke today in the Moroccan city of Marrakech  at a plenary meeting at the level of ministers of the GATT  committee on trade negotiations. He expressed the hope that the  principles of free trade and fair competition, which were  endorsed by the results of the Uruguay round, will produce  increased mutual trade between countries and on this basis a  growth of national economies and the world economy as a whole.    Russia, the minister went on to say, is interested in  strengthening the multilateral trade system and also assumes  that it will be able in the shortest possible time to become an  integral part of the system. In striving to join GATT and the  World Trade Organization (WTO), whose creation will be announced  in Marrakech, Russia is pursuing absolutely specific practical  goals and the realistic creation of more favorable conditions  for its exports. Full membership of GATT is an essential  condition for Russia's integration into the world economy, which  is of particular importance for the country. The Russian  minister noted that this process will seriously facilitate the  speeding and deepening of market reforms in Russia on the basis  of the experience amassed in GATT over the decades. In this  connection the speaker on behalf of the Russian Government  confirmed its firm intention to complete creating a  market-oriented open economy at minimum social cost.    Speaking about the Russian economic situation, Oleg Davydov  said that in the space of just over two years fundamental  changes have taken place in Russia. The state monopoly in  foreign trade, which existed for over 70 years, has been  dismantled in the process of economic liberalization.  Administrative barriers with respect to imports have been  lifted, and restrictions on export operations have been  significantly decreased. The customs tariff is now being used  as a basic instrument of Russian trade policy. The price  mechanism and currency regulation have been liberalized to a  considerable extent, and large-scale privatization is being  implemented.    Russia's aim is to enter the World Trade Organization. A  flexible mechanism needs to be worked out to enable the process  for its accession into GATT to be transformed into entry into  the WTO. Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization will  be an important event for others besides Russia. On the basis  of a reasonable balance of rights and obligations, the sides  reaching agreement will gain in the shape of Russia a capacious  market of goods, services and capital. Even now, in the  conditions of economic instability caused by the transition from  a strict planned system to a liberal market system, we are  seeing a great interest in cooperation with Russia, the minister  noted. He stressed that the obligations which Russia will  assume as a member of the WTO will be an additional guarantee of  the stability and predictability of the conditions for doing  business with it and for the access of foreign goods to its  market. We hope that the Uruguay round was the last which our  country observed from the sidelines, the Russian minister of  foreign economic relations said.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Pity the lobster socialists - A plan to help wealthy Labour voters carry on THE gloating must stop. There is nothing better than a good gloat, but all good things must come to an end. Those of us who supported the Conservatives in the election, even though we were told that we were backing the losing team, and that we would be in the dustbin of history, have had our moment of triumphalism. The time has now come to unite the nation. In particular we must offer cheer and hope to those of our acquaintance who voted Labour, so that they can face the next five years with equanimity. Better that, or else our socialist friends of more than slender means might join Vanessa and Colin in the Workers' Revolutionary Party, and then civilised dinner party conversation would become all but impossible. It was in fact on election night itself that I felt the first pangs of pity for the losers. The proprietor of The Spectator, Conrad Black, had thrown a party at The Savoy (Champagne and Crustaceans 11pm to 4am RSVP); and while I would be lying if I said that the dominant mood of the evening - after the Basildon result came in - was not overwhelmingly triumphalist, there was also a smattering of champagne and crustacean socialists present. One could see the lobster turning to ashes in the mouth of these people and one wanted to do something to cheer them up if only to make sure the Black party went with more of a swing than that enjoyed by the Labour party. Unfortunately I was too inebriated at the time to make coherent my sympathy to those described by the French as gauche caviare. So perhaps here is the place to do it, in the pages of a newspaper which also thought that we would be better off under a Labour government. Labour voters should first of all take heart that the Conservative share of the poll was, at 41.9 per cent, exactly the same as it was in the 1966 general election, when Labour gained an overall majority of 98 seats. So even if the Conservative share of the vote remains at this apparently impressive level, all Labour has to do, is persuade former Labour voters who now vote Liberal, that Paddy Ashdown is unelectable. That should not be difficult. In the meantime however, Labour voters, particularly those of substantial means, must find a way of triumphing over Conservative greed and self-centredness. There is a simple solution. All my well-off Labour friends need to do is work out how much extra tax and National Insurance contributions they would have paid under Neil Kinnock's proposed government, and make it over to the Inland Revenue as a voluntary contribution. Some Labour voters might object on the grounds that their money might go to further Conservative policy objectives - although they are mistaken if they think that a Labour government would have paid their higher taxes, in some hypothecated way, directly to the Department of Health and Social Security. But such cynics need not pay their additional voluntary contributions directly to the Treasury. They could donate their money to any National Health Service hospital which has clearly stated that it will not become a self governing trust, or to any state school which has decided not to opt out of education authority control. I know that many of my Labour-voting friends will object that the money raised will be only a fraction of that pledged by John Smith in his Shadow Budget. But it seems that about 20 per cent of those described by advertising agencies as ABs, voted Labour, so the amount raised will not be negligible either. This voluntary tax is of course not designed purely for disappointed Labour voters. The idea comes straight from the practice of Margaret Thatcher. In all the years of her prime ministership she refused to take up her full pay entitlement instead choosing to take only the amount paid to every other Cabinet minister. In this way the Treasury retained about Pounds 250,000, to spend on the beneficiaries of government aid. Will the Labour well-to-do be as charitable as the former prime minister? Or will they give the rest of us reason to start gloating all over again? Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

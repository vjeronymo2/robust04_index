			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Commonwealth talks to stress human rights COMMONWEALTH leaders today open what is widely regarded as one of the most critical conferences in its modern history, if the association's survival is to be assured. The need for a renewed commitment to human rights and good governance will be stressed by Chief Emeka Anyaoku in an address designed to give the 50-member organisation greater purpose and credibility. The official agenda for the five-day session, attended by 36 heads of government, covers global political and economic issues, including the Gatt talks. South Africa will continue to feature, with the Commonwealth planning a substantial programme of assistance ahead of next April's scheduled multi-party elections and to help monitor the poll itself. Mr Thabo Mbeki, a senior member of the African National Congress executive, is expected to attend as an accredited observer. The delegates were also told last night that Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's newly-elected prime minister, plans to attend the talks. The opening has been overshadowed by the angry reaction of some Greek Cypriots to Queen Elizabeth and what is seen as partisan British diplomatic involvement in the dispute over the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north of the island. President Glafcos Clerides of Cyprus yesterday played down the protests. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, held talks with Mr Clerides and Mr Rauf Denktash, the Turkish-Cypriot leader, British officials declined to elaborate on what they said were private talks, only saying they had been useful. But Greek-Cypriot sensitivity was illustrated when a press spokesman for the government stressed that the meeting had been at Mr Hurd's initiative.</p>

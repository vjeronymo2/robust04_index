			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] With the approaching local elections, the  colonialist Turkish regime has infinitely escalated its violent  genocidal and oppressive actions. Our people cannot have the  opportunity to express their free will in the elections in such  an atmosphere of violence. We will not permit elections to be  held in an atmosphere of genocide, intimidation, and special  warfare measures put into effect by the colonialist regime.    Yes, dear listeners, in a statement issued on 1 March, our  party PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] announced its policy on  elections [words indistinct]. In a statement on behalf of our  party, ERNK's [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan]  representative in Europe Kani Yilmaz said that we do not regard  the elections to be held in Kurdistan as legal, and for this  reason we are boycotting the elections. Therefore, in our view,  DEP's [Democracy Party] decision is the one preferred by the  Kurdish people and is also a correct decision that must be  supported. Had there been democratic conditions, then the will  of the people in Kurdistan would have been revealed. Our leader  stated this fact many times over. To prevent the expression of  the people's will, the Turkish state is using its army and its  crime syndicate, the counterguerrilla, [words indistinct]. As  long as the war continues in Kurdistan, we will take a clear  stand against an election to be held outside the will of the  Kurdish people. We will not accept these elections. Our people  will definitely not go to these elections. I am particularly  stressing: The candidates from the other parties must  immediately withdraw from the elections. I am repeating: They  must immediately withdraw from the elections. If they do not  withdraw, as of today they are the targets of ARGK [People's  Liberation Army of Kurdistan] and will be shot dead. The  fascist Turkish state is detaining and (?torturing) those  persons and candidates who do not share its ideology, and those  engaged in election propaganda are being shot dead, the mayors  are being removed from their posts, and party headquarters are  being bombed. The voting boxes will be opened at military  garrisons. These boxes are being handed over to the special  teams and village guards. There cannot be any talk of elections  under these conditions. This is a complete farce.    [Words indistinct] Our ERNK spokesman in Europe added: The  political parties must immediately withdraw their candidates;  otherwise, the candidates will be punished by our ARGK [words  indistinct].</p>

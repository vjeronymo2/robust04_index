			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Undercurrent" section] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Military Party </H5>   Two weeks ago, Army Commander General [title as published]  Nicolas de Bari Hermoza gathered a large number of Lima garrison  officers at the Military School hall and made an aggressive  speech against those who allegedly are conducting a campaign to  discredit the Army. Beating on a table with his fists, Hermoza  stressed that he would not allow the trial of his officers by  courts of law. Afterward, he repeated the details of Army Press  Office (OIE) Press Bulletin 02-94, dated 10 February. This  bulletin states: "The political programs broadcast by the  television channels and published by the magazines SI, OIGA, and  CARETAS, and especially the newspaper LA REPUBLICA are  disseminating biased reports with a clear intention of feigning  (...) an Army relationship and complicity with drug trafficking."    At first sight, the first misinterpretation is that the OIE  and Hermoza claim that the reports on the links between some  military officers and drug trafficking are aimed against the  entire Army. Thus, the military leaders attempt to protect  themselves behind the Army and resort to solidarity, instead of  responding to the very solid charges actually raised by Army  members.    The threat to the independent press has been rejected by the  media and the Journalists Association. In a strong communique  signed by its dean, Miguel Calderon, the Journalists Association  pointed out the press' supervisory role and asked President  Alberto Fujimori to deny the report and punish those who are  circulating it.    As an odd feature, it is worth pointing out that the  aforementioned nine-page communique -- of an entirely political  content -- concludes with a warning remark: "The current BIE  [Army Press Bulletin] will be read and discussed with all Army  military personnel."</p>

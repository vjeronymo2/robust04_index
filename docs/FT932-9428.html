			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (8): Growth, equity and stability - Dr Saleh Afiff, coordinating minister for the economy and finance / Interview DR SALEH AFIFF explained his government's policies in his first press interview since taking his present job. Excerpts follow: QUESTION: Will the new cabinet change the thrust of economic policy? ANSWER: There will be no basic changes. We base our development efforts on the triple objectives of growth, equity and stability. Stability is not only political stability but economic stability, through prudent fiscal and monetary management. Trade protection we went through in the 1970s and early 1980s. We don't want to come back to that, because that is a misallocation of resources. At that time we became increasingly dependent on oil, because our non-oil exports were stagnating. It leads to a high cost economy. Agriculture and food processing are two sectors which remain highly-regulated. Do you plan any changes? These sectors have a long history. When our development efforts began in 1965, we were still battling shortages of food, not only domestically but also internationally. When we went to the aid agencies, what they had was wheat-flour. Then came the idea of importing wheat grain so we can process it here. Our first aim was to achieve self-sufficiency in rice, because we had a comparative advantage. Now we shall have to start to look again at the flour-mills. I can tell you, we are not finished yet with our deregulation programme but it has to go step by step. Consensus among ministers and also with the president takes time. The privately-owned clove monopoly has received loans of Rp1,000bn from state banks but has been unable to service its debt. Are you planning any action? We have had long discussions about this. It cannot be maintained as it is but you cannot stop it abruptly also. It will be phased out. It will take a couple of years to phase out. Are you planning a deregulation package in order to set out your credentials? Yes, I am keen to do it. Not only me but Minister Hartarto, the co-ordinating minister of industry and trade, because we know that other countries are deregulating faster. Everybody is now aiming at China. The Chinese foreign minister is going to Europe with a group of businessmen to attract investors. We have to compete with them and the only way is by improving the investment climate. There are bottlenecks in licensing, in customs and in many others. Do you consider China and countries such as Vietnam as economic threats? We consider them threats. We have to compete for funds which are shrinking. A couple of years ago no-one would go to Vietnam. Ten years ago China was still small. Suddenly they are in the field and we have to compete. State-owned high-technology enterprises such as aircraft manufacture are said to receive up to Rp4,000bn a year in state finances. How exactly are they funded? They are mostly funded from the state budget, but not that high. You can see it in the budget. We do provide them with equity, since 1976, in parallel with our other development efforts. We also finance agricultural development, irrigation systems and the provision of social services in rural areas. The impression I get in the media is that this (government funding of high-technology) will be jumping and this (agricultural and rural development) will be left behind. This is not true. Are you getting a decent return on your investment in the high-technology sector? That is an interesting point, on returns. Look, when I was in Bappenas (the national planning agency) I allocated funds for a road in Irian Jaya (connecting an isolated town with the provincial capital). You ask me what are the returns, because there were no cars at that time? But if we don't finance it, will Irian Jaya develop without an infrastructure? That is also with IPTN (the state aircraft construction company). Returns wise, of course they have lost but in the long run maybe we will gain. How long is the long run? They have a plan that at a certain point their equity will be fulfilled and then they should start with additional financing, not only from the state budget, but from the state banks, other banks and the private sector. Are you concerned about state enterprises borrowing from state banks? How does this affect the budget? The state banks' capital is separate from the budget. If the state banks finance state enterprises, it will be from their deposits. As you know the growth of deposits in the last 10 years was tremendous. They have a lot of loanable funds. State enterprises are one of their favourites because they are more sure. If something happens, then the government will take care of it. Whilst deposits have risen at state banks, so have their bad debts. How concerned are you at the level of the state banks' non-performing loans? I am very concerned about the state banks and the banking system as a whole. We have to do something. In economics, you decide now and the impact will be a year or so later on. I think the banking system plays a crucial role in promoting growth. We will take steps first to know what is the size of the bad debt. Credit appraisals, training of management and the quality of services of the banks (should be improved) so they don't make the same errors. Some bad loans have been made to politically well-connected people and many private banks are owned by politically well-connected families. Will you not have to fight a political battle to impose your will? Those things happen and we will fight. I will fight, because if we continue on this basis it will not help the economy at all. Right now the business community are complaining that it is not the interest rate level which is a problem but the availability of credit. Why is it not available? Because they (the banks) are scared. They would rather put money into SBIs (government bonds) than lend to a business community in which they are not sure. The risk is too big, perhaps. But this will impede economic growth. And what does that mean? It means we cannot absorb the new labour force which is growing at more than 2m a year. The macro implications are quite substantial. So we have to fight.</p>

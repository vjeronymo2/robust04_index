			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LANGUAGE OFTEN A BARRIER TO THERAPISTS  </P> <P> In 1984, a gunman named James Oliver Huberty walked into a McDonald's  restaurant in San Ysidro and murdered 21 people. Fifteen others were wounded,  and many of them needed psychological counseling -- immediately.  </P> <P> Many of the wounded, whether adults or children, spoke only Spanish. At the  time, concerns were voiced about San Diego County not having enough  Spanish-speaking therapists to cope with the crisis.  </P> <P> Is the situation any different five years later? And what about San Diegans who  speak only Italian? Or Portuguese? Or Swiss-German? To whom do they turn in a  crisis? How easily could they find a therapist in the Yellow Pages?  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Giant Problem'  </P> <P> Jose Fernando Bayardo, a psychiatrist with a practice in Hillcrest, said the  lack of psychological help for people of different cultures is "a giant  problem." From 1972 to 1977, he said, he was the only Spanish-speaking  psychiatrist in the county.  </P> <P> "Now we have seven," Bayardo said, not without a touch of sarcasm.  </P> <P> Many psychotherapists attempt to meet the needs of foreign-born patients by  using interpreters. Bayardo uses that approach with several clients who were  born in Cambodia and do not speak English.  </P> <P> "For many of these people, life in San Diego is heartbreaking," he said. "The  change in culture is severe. The meals, the seasons, the customs . . .  everything is different."  </P> <P> Recently, one of his Cambodian clients put his feet on the waiting-room sofa.  The patient was admonished by Bayardo's secretary and was embarrassed for  something that, in his country, is common.  </P> <P> "That's just a small example," Bayardo said. "Many Cambodians here suffer from  acute depression and cultural-shock deficiencies, which lead to nothing less  than the breakup of the family."  </P> <P> Reading from a list published by the San Diego Medical Society, Bayardo noted  that, out of seven Greek physicians in the county, none are psychiatrists; out  of nine Armenian doctors, only one practices psychiatry.  </P> <P> The county offers one Czech-born psychiatrist, none who speak Portuguese and,  most startling of all, he said, none fluent in Japanese. The language problem  is especially worrisome to the San Diego Society of Psychiatric Physicians,  Bayardo said, of which he is a member delegated to address the problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clinic Recently Opened  </P> <P> The need has become so great that a clinic -- the La Jolla Institute for  Psychotherapy -- opened recently to serve mainly a non-English-speaking  clientele. Ina Schmilovici, a therapist born in West Germany, speaks German,  English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch and Romanian. Her superior, clinical  psychologist Barbara Alvarez, was born in Austria and speaks German, Italian,  Spanish, English and French.  </P> <P> Schmilovici has been here for eight years, Alvarez for two. They say the most  obvious -- and arresting -- fact of San Diego life is that the city is growing  by leaps and bounds, becoming ever more cosmopolitan -- and, in some cases,  more unlivable for non-English-speaking people.  </P> <P> Schmilovici tells the story of a couple -- a West German woman and a Middle  Eastern man -- who were seeking a divorce. Life in San Diego had greatly  complicated the couple's problems, Schmilovici said, and not knowing the  language had tangled the web even further.  </P> <P> The woman was aided by a therapist who spoke her language. The man, unable to  find one who shared his language or culture, is now very unhappy, Schmilovici  said.  </P> <P> "Knowing the culture and customs of a place, and the way families are organized  in such countries, makes a person feel like someone understands," Alvarez said.  </P> <P> She cited the case of one client, a 38-year-old Mexican-born man who lives at  home with his parents.  </P> <P> "He goes out on dates, and all of the women think he's weird because he shares  a home with his mother and father," Alvarez said. "In Mexico, that is very  common. Now he doesn't want to (date) at all, and he's very depressed."  </P> <P> A therapist's inability to understand a patient's language can border on the  lethal, Bayardo said, noting a case in which a Spanish-speaking man in El  Centro could not make an English-speaking therapist understand about the "tic"  in his neck.  </P> <P> "The therapist thought he was saying that he saw ticks -- meaning insects --  circling around his neck," Bayardo said. "So the therapist prescribed heavy  doses of tranquilizers to a man he thought was hallucinating. It's a good thing  he didn't kill the guy, because he could have. So, you see, this language  problem can be serious."  </P></p>

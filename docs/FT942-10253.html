			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Veba ahead 18.5% in first term Veba, the German energy conglomerate, has reported a sharp rise in first-quarter profits and predicted profits for all 1994 would be 'markedly better' than last year. The Dusseldorf-based group, which has around 1,000 subsidiaries in areas such as power generation, oil, chemicals, trading and services, said pre-tax profits in the first three months of the year rose 18.5 per cent to DM608m (Dollars 367m). Much of the increase was due to an extensive group-wide rationalisation programme set in motion last year. The plan is to cut the 131,000 workforce by 10,000 over 1993-94 in measures which are designed to save DM1.2bn costs a year. Veba said the rationalisation programme would be the chief factor behind the expected marked improvement in this year's profits. As Veba announced in March, group net profits for 1993 fell 9 per cent to DM825m on turnover up by 1.4 per cent to DM66.3bn. In the first three months of the year turnover climbed to DM17.5bn, an increase of 6 per cent, which reflects the impact of acquisitions in the eastern German power sector. A 28 per cent increase in turnover from energy, to DM4.36bn, offset stagnant or falling sales in the other main business areas, although Veba made clear that, excluding acquisitions, turnover in energy was flat. The group gave no detailed profits breakdown at the three months stage, but it said it had substantially reduced losses in its chemicals division, the focus of intensive rationalisation. Losses in petrochemicals were also reduced and there was an increase in profits in services, trading and transport. Degussa, the Frankfurt-based specialty chemicals and precious metals group which recently completed an extensive rationalisation programme, reported a 58 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the six months to March. The increase in pre-tax profits to DM121m followed a 25 per cent gain in the first quarter. Degussa said its performance in the first half was better than anticipated, with all business areas improving their results. It singled out the chemicals division as a beneficiary of rationalisation measures and increased sales. The company predicted that earnings in the second half of the year would improve, but warned that the rate of growth would not be as high as in the first half. Group profits for the year to the end of last September dropped 14 per cent to DM172m on sales up 16 per cent to DM15bn. Sales in the first half of the current year rose 2 per cent to DM7.2 per cent.</p>

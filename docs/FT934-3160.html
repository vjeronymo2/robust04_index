			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Heath secures release of Britons held in Iraq Sir Edward Heath, the former British prime minister, has secured the release today of three British prisoners held in Iraq, after a rare meeting yesterday with President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, writes James Whittington in Amman. Mr Michael Wainwright, 42, and Mr Paul Ride, 33, were jailed last year for 10 and seven years respectively on charges of entering Iraq illegally. Mr Simon Dunn, 23, was arrested in June and sentenced for eight years for the same offence. They are due to fly with Sir Edward by helicopter today to the Jordanian capital, Amman, where they will be reunited with their families before travelling on to the UK. Iraq has until now linked the prisoners' release with Britain's unfreezing of Iraqi assets in the UK. But British diplomats in Amman emphasised that 'no deal had been done'. One described the move as a gesture by Saddam in the hope that United Nations sanctions would soon be lifted. In the past two months six other foreigners have been released from Iraqi jails. A Frenchman and a German remain imprisoned in Baghdad.</p>

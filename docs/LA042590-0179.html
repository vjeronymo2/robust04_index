			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STERN DEFENDS LAKERS FINE  </P> <P> NBA Commissioner David Stern used a baseball analogy today to defend his  $25,000 fine of the Los Angeles Lakers for failing to use a number of regulars  in their final regular season game Sunday at Portland.  </P> <P> "We have to call balls and strikes," Stern said at a luncheon of the  International Radio and Television Society.  </P> <P> "The Lakers' action was clearly wide of the plate."  </P> <P> Stern said that fans buying tickets deserve the best product and that the  Lakers did not supply that.  </P> <P> "We make an implicit promise at our games. 'Playing today: Those healthy and  able.' It is not hard and fast, but that is our compact with the media and our  fans."  </P> <P> With Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Mychal Thompson on the bench, Portland  defeated Los Angeles 130-88, the most one-sided defeat in Laker history. The  game did not affect the final standings or playoff situation of either team.  </P> <P> Would Stern repeat the punishment?  </P> <P> "This one was wide of the plate," he said. "We'll wait until the next one."  </P> <P> Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent, seated next to Stern at the luncheon,  endorsed his colleague's disciplinary action. "We believe strongly that teams  must make significant effort," he said. "It's a difficult line to draw. I think  David did the right thing."  </P></p>

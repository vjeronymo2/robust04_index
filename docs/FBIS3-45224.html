			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Ying (2651 7751)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Mainland  China became the "largest country in the world in terms of  absorbing foreign investment" (a term used by World Bank) in  1993, which attracted worldwide attention. Foreign investments  in China also had long-term, large-scale, high-tech, and other  new characteristics and indicated a new trend. According to  statistics, the number of foreign investment projects in China  total approximately 100,000, involving agreed-upon capital of  $110 billion and actual investment of $33 billion. Of this,  direct investment exceeded $20 billion, an increase of more than  100 percent over the previous year. Guangdong, which drew the  largest amount of foreign investment, actually absorbed $8.5  billion in 1993, accounting for one-fourth of the country's  total. Shanghai, which ranks second, absorbed $7.016 billion.  Beijing, which ranks third, absorbed $6.28 billion. Foreign  investment absorbed by other cities also rose by a wide margin:  Shenzhen (over $5 billion), Fujian ($2.8 billion), Jiangsu  ($2.2 billion), Shandong ($1.6 billion), Guangxi ($1.06  billion), and Hainan ($730 million). Even the five northwest  provinces and autonomous regions of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shaanxi,  Ningxia, and Gansu had foreign investment exceeding $5 billion.    Hong Kong, which ranked first among foreign countries and  regions investing in mainland China, invested HK$100 billion  [Hong Kong dollars] (approximately $13 billion). For example,  Hopewell, Cheung Kong, Wharf, New World, and other consortia  invested billions of Hong Kong dollars in mainland China last  year. In the past, most Hong Kong businessmen focused their  investment in Guangdong, running small and medium size  processing enterprises and real estate businesses. The scale of  their investment was small, and they sought quick returns. Last  year they joined long-term projects, including power plants,  highway and urban construction, and development of large pieces  of land in various provinces. The typical ones include: The  commercial and residential housing development of Beijing  Chongwen district invested by the New World Development Company  Limited; the wharves, stores, and residential projects in Wuhan  invested by the Wharf (Holdings) Limited; the transformation of  the "Sanpofang" old district of Fuzhou invested by the Cheung  Kong (Holdings) Limited; the thermal power plants and  Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Zhuhai expressway invested by Hopewell  Holdings Limited; and the retail businesses and department  stores developed by the Wing On Company International Limited in  cooperation with the Sun Hung Kai Properties Limited in Beijing,  Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.    Taiwan, which ranked second, invested over $6 billion in  China, exceeding the sum of the previous years. Taiwan  investment in the past was focused on light industry which could  bring quick returns. Last year, Taiwan businessmen focused their  investment in long-term industries. For example, the Taiwan  Petroleum Shareholding Company and the Mainland Offshore Oil  Corporation jointly invested in exploiting oil in the East China  Sea, and the Taiwan Plastic Holdings agreed to participate in  projects along the Chang Jiang.    U.S., Japanese, and German businessmen also poured in large  amount of funds in China last year. The Esso Petroleum Company  [Exxon] of the United States and Japan's Sumitomo Corporation  signed a contract on exploiting oil in the Tarim basin. It is  estimated that the total investment will reach billions of  dollars. Meanwhile, General Motors, Exxon, AT&amp;T, Boeing, and  Anli [1344 0448] also respectively signed contracts with China  on a number of projects. Germany's Seimens, Mercedes Benz, and  Bayer Chemicals and British, French, Italian, and Dutch  transnational companies including Texco, Suffron, and Shell also  signed contracts with China on exploiting and developing oil in  640,000 square km in the East China Sea. In some of the large  scale projects, there was competition among the Western  consortia.</p>

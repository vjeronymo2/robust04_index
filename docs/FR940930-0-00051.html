			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources held hearings on the breast cancer issue and found a wide range of problems with the current mammography system: Poor quality equipment, the lack of quality assurance procedures, poorly trained technologists and physicians, false representation of accreditation by some mammography facilities, and the lack of inspections or consistent governmental oversight. The MQSA addresses these specific concerns by establishing national minimum standards for all mammography facilities, except the Department of Veterans Affairs, in the areas of radiation dose, equipment, personnel, and practices, such as quality control and quality assurance. The MQSA replaces a patchwork of Federal, State, and private standards and guarantees sufficient oversight and enforcement to ensure that women will receive high quality mammography services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To date, FDA has received 97 comments on the 2 interim rules that were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67558 and 58 FR 67565). These comments, which have been carefully reviewed and summarized, are under consideration as the final regulations are being developed. FDA will publish its response to the various comments in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when the final rules are published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The effective date of this regulation is October 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the effective date of a final regulation ordinarily may not be less than 30 days after date of publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Administrative Procedures Act and FDA's regulations permit exceptions to this timeframe when: (1) The regulation grants an exemption or relieves a restriction; (2) the regulation interprets rules and policy statements; or, (3) good cause exists and is published for the earlier date. This interim rule satisfies any one or all of the exemption criteria that permit an earlier effective date. (See 5 U.S.C. 553(d) and 21 CFR 10.40(c)(4).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, this interim rule exempts certain mammography devices and procedures from quality standards established under the MQSA. Second, the interim rule provides a means for proposing alternative standards that may relieve restrictions for certain mammography facilities. Third, the interim rule provides interpretive definitions and FDA policy statements to clarify essential terms in rules previously issued under the MQSA. Finally, failure to implement this interim rule by October 1, 1994, could inadvertently render critical mammography devices and procedures illegal that are not currently intended to be covered under the MQSA. Therefore, the agency finds good cause for an effective date fewer than 30 days after publication of this regulation. Accordingly, for all these reasons, this interim rule is made effective as of October 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Legislative Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> December 14, 1993, the President signed legislation (H. Rept. 2202) granting interim rule authority to the Secretary for promulgation of standards required by the MQSA. This authorization was provided in recognition of the fact that the certification deadline of October 1, 1994, could not be met without streamlining the process for initial promulgation of standards. Because of the perceived urgent public health need for Federal standards for mammography, it was decided that interim rule authority should be granted, rather than an extension of the deadline to develop standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the interim rule legislation, the Secretary is authorized to issue temporary, interim regulations setting forth standards for approving accrediting bodies and for quality standards for mammography, under section 354(e) and 354(f) of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 263b(e) and 354(f)). Under the abbreviated process, the Secretary is required to adopt existing standards to the maximum extent feasible, such as those established by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), private voluntary accreditation bodies, e.g., the American College of Radiology (ACR), and some States. Also, in developing the interim regulations, the Secretary is not required to consult with the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee). However, after the interim standards are issued, Congress intended that the Secretary proceed with the more extensive rulemaking procedures envisioned by the original enactment of the MQSA, including the statutorily required consultation with the Advisory Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA used this authority to issue interim requirements for accrediting bodies, quality standards, and certification on December 21, 1993. Those interim standards have been used to approve accreditation bodies and certify facilities before the October 1, 1994, deadline. However, since the interim regulations were published on December 1993, FDA's experience in applying those interim standards has convinced the agency that certain amendments to those interim rules are necessary in order to clarify the obligation that facilities have to meet under MQSA by the October 1, 1994, deadline. The regulations implemented by this interim rule add to and modify the interim rules issued on December 21, 1993, and will remain in effect until final regulations are proposed and promulgated in 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Provisions of the Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Amended Definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA's experience in developing standards and planning for implementation of the MQSA over the past year has made the agency aware that certain changes to its previously published interim definitions are necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

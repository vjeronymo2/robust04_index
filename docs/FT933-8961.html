			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Sunbop holds year's earnings SUN International Bophut-atswana (Sunbop), the South African hotel, leisure and gaming group, maintained earnings at 192 cents per share in the year to June against a backdrop of difficult trading conditions. The results include seven months' performance from the Lost City development, completed last year at a cost of about R830m (Dollars 246m) and , for the first time, a full year's income from the Carousel entertainment complex. All of Sunbop's hotels and gaming facilities, which include the Sun City resort, are in the Bophutatswana homeland. Turnover for the year rose by 18 per cent to R1.18bn and operating profit was 11 per cent higher at R299.1m, against R270.2m. The financing of the Lost City project, however, caused the interest bill to jump from virtually nothing in 1992 to R30.3m. As a result, pre-tax profit fell slightly to R268m from R270m. A lower tax bill helped attributable profit rise by 6 per cent to R228m. The dividend was maintained at 132 cents per share on earnings of 192 cents, compared with 191 cents. Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, said that despite the 'extremely poor trading environment, aggravated by socio-political unrest and competition from illegal casinos in South Africa', the group had managed an average occupancy rate of 70 per cent. This is below the 73 per cent achieved in 1992, but still well above levels its competitors are achieving. Occupancy at the new Palace hotel has averaged 75 per cent since opening. Mr Kerzner said predictions were difficult in the current climate, but he expected earnings in 1994 to at least match those of the past year.</p>

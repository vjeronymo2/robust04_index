			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Speculation boosts Euro Disney Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday saw its shares rise FFr1.85 to FFr32.00 amid speculation that Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the Saudi prince who plans to take a large stake in the company, was buying shares on the market. Prince Al-Waleed on Wednesday stunned investors with the announcement that he intended to buy up to 24.5 per cent of Euro Disney after the company's forthcoming FFr6bn (Dollars 1bn) rights issue. The prince, a nephew of King Fahd, has already made his name as an international investor by taking stakes in Citicorp and Saks 5th Avenue. In the deal with Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company, he will buy any shares that are not taken up in the rights issue. Under the terms of the deal the prince is entitled to buy, at the rights price, a maximum 24.5 per cent stake in Euro Disney by sub-underwriting the rights issue or buying shares directly from Walt Disney. The prince approached Disney last summer through Carlyle, his Washington-based advisers. However, he appeared last autumn to have cooled on the deal as Euro Disney's financial problems escalated. He renewed contact with Disney five weeks ago when it became apparent that Euro Disney's banks would agree to a FFr13bn rescue package. Market reports suggested the prince was buying Euro Disney shares to establish a stake before the company announces the terms of the rights issue at an EGM next Wednesday. See Lex</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of State Pompeyo Marquez by Santa </F> Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO correspondent Orlando Gambos in Caracas;  date not given -- first six paragraphs are introduction]    [Text] Few Venezuelans know the border between Colombia and  Venezuela better than Pompeyo Marquez. Perhaps no one can be  more precise and objective in his analysis of those rather tense  2,200 km of border where, as he says, "Anything can happen at  any time."    President Rafael Caldera appointed Marquez minister of  state.  Among the duties assigned to him was handling Venezuelan border  issues.    About one week after assuming this position he said that  negotiations with Colombia are one of the present possibilities.  Because of this remark, untranationalist Venezuelan groups  demanded the dismissal of Marquez, a representative of the  Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) in the government.    Marquez is a man who is committed to his people and to the  humble. He fights for them 24 hours a day. Once he looked  forward with patience for several years for the precise moment  to escape from the jail where he was held prisoner by guerrillas.    Today this old "subversive" says that in Colombia the  guerrillas have no political objective and that they have  violated their promise not to attack Venezuela.    In his two-room office there are three desks and four  employees. (He is the fourth employee.) The office is decorated  with a vivid poster which says that Minister of State Marquez  spoke with an EL TIEMPO representative and said things which  were not very comforting.    [Gamboa] Your appointment as minister of state, with a  special assignment to border issues, is interpreted as a clear  sign that President Rafael Caldera has a real interest in  resolving existing problems with Colombia. Could this mean,  perhaps, that the possibility of a solution is now at hand?    [Marquez] Yes, undoubtedly. The desire of President Caldera,  demonstrated throughout his life, is to have harmonious  relations with Colombia. That has been his constant purpose. It  was he who brought Venezuela into the Andean Pact. Furthermore,  during the election campaign he said that the border question  would have priority and he is keeping this promise. His desire  and will are aimed at that objective. Among my duties are not  only matters along the 2,200 km of the tense border with  Colombia but all questions along the entire border, which  involve Brazil, Guayana, and the Caribbean. Venezuela should no  longer be so active in world affairs but rather should  concentrate on its immediate surroundings.    [Gamboa] Then what do you need to resolve those problems  along what you call the tense border with Colombia?    [Marquez] There is a series of new and very grave  situations.  About a week ago I visited the Tachira area and other border  zones. I should emphasize my conclusion that there is a total  and permanent absence of the authority of the Colombian  Government in the border area. This situation causes many  problems: the activities of the guerrillas, narcotics  traffickers, common criminals, automobile thieves, and illegal  immigrants. These are disturbing situations. They are new, but  there are other, old problems which have become worse.    [Gamboa] There is a tendency to believe that a "greater  Colombian presence" means a greater military presence. Do you  agree with this view?    [Marquez] It would be a military and a government presence.  The fact is that there is no Colombian Government presence in  the border area, and Venezuela suffers the consequences of this  serious situation. I have been saying for many months, not just  now, what I said in October 1993 in Bogota, that there is no  Colombian Government presence there. And the Colombian  Government should understand this situation and something which  is much more serious: relations between the two countries are  involved. This is a reality. I predicted what could happen with  Venezuela if corrective action were not taken.    [Gamboa] And did this happen?    [Marquez] It went beyond all of my predictions. After my  visit to the border my prediction did not become a reality  because the situation is much, very much more serious because of  the kidnappings and murders which take place on Venezuelan  territory, because of the nonpayment for guerrilla "cattle," and  because of the extortion which increases every day.    [Gamboa] What are the consequences of this situation which,  in your view, went beyond your predictions?    [Marquez] A process is taking place which is contrary to the  desired objective of economic and social development in the  border area. Disinvestment is taking place. Land and other kinds  of property are being abandoned, and property owners are moving  to other areas. And this is a harsh blow against all of the  progress made in terms of integration, although this is a  subject for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    In the committees on border affairs and on negotiations we  have raised this situation with the Colombian representatives.  They are aware that there are only three alternatives. We have  discussed this at the negotiating table. Either there will be an  armed conflict, or we will live in a state of permanent tension,  or we will negotiate. There is no other alternative. Everything  else is a version of these three solutions. Of course, I am an  advocate of negotiations.    [Gamboa] Because you said that, some people asked for your  dismissal only one week after you took this position. What will  they say now?    [Marquez] This is a free country, and we already know the  position of those groups. It annoys them that I am a supporter  of negotiations.    [Gamboa] Are you suggesting that those groups support  another  kind of solution--armed confrontation, for example?    [Marquez] I am not suggesting anything. I only say that it  irritates them that I am in favor of negotiations.    [Gamboa] But do you not believe that by insisting so much,  over the long term those groups could achieve their objectives?    [Marquez] That will depend on me and on what I do.    [Gamboa] And could not the greater Colombian military  presence which Venezuela is calling for heat up the frontier  area even more and cause armed conflict between the two  countries?    [Marquez] Not necessarily, because our activities could be  coordinated. Meetings have been held between the military  commands and the security organizations of the two countries.  Agreements are urgently needed for precise coordination, because  the escalation of guerrilla and criminal activity are generating  honest feelings which could be exploited. The burden of what  Venezuela receives from Colombia is too much. This is a highly  negative burden which keeps the whole country worked up. It is  bringing us to certain limits.    The situation has already gone from bad to worse. There is  real distress, irritation, and fear, and the Venezuelan people  feel they are victims of aggression, because the country, in  fact, is a victim of aggression. And as Venezuelan Minister of  the Interior Ramon Escovar Salom said, the entire country has to  react to an act of aggression of which it is the victim.  And it is aggression in the sense that the Colombian  Government is contributing to it by its acts of omission. It is  aggression by all of the elements opposing us. Even one of them  would be serious. Altogether, the total of all of them is very  serious.    [Gamboa] Perhaps Venezuela has had to look at this situation  because, with proper control, illegal immigrants would not come  into Venezuela, the criminals would not come, and stolen  automobiles would not leave the country.    [Marquez] Yes, but that is the least of it, because those  are  phenomena outside our control. The fact that the guerrillas have  moved from the cold country to the warmer areas is not a matter  for Venezuela to decide. They cannot attack Venezuela and, above  all, they cannot attack people who support border development.  In the view of Pompeyo Marquez the Colombian guerrillas have no  political objective.    [Gamboa] What do you think of the view that the guerrillas  are seeking, as part of their political objective, to provoke a  clash between the two countries so that they can benefit from  the division between them?    [Marquez] That would be criminal, because a guerrilla war or  an armed clash between Colombia and Venezuela--may it never  happen!--would be suicide for both countries. It would be a  horror, a catastrophe, an act of madness.    [Gamboa] But is this possible?    [Marquez] I have the feeling that the guerrillas would like  to internationalize the problem. And this is a subject to be  handled by the two ministries of foreign affairs, the two  governments, or the two presidents. The guerrillas know that the  Latin American community will not permit, for any reason, an  armed clash between Colombia and Venezuela.    [Gamboa] According to your analysis, it could be thought  that  the delimitation of our marine and submarine boundaries could  soon and for a temporary period be left in the background. Do  you share this view?    [Marquez] Not only moved to the background but to a less  important position. Today the key problem is that of aggression  in many areas. We have to resolve this matter first. A popular  song says that, "Saturday comes before Sunday." For the moment  it is Saturday and a serious, very serious Saturday. I was truly  worried when I returned from my trip to the border. There is no  peace there, and peace is wanted immediately.    [Gamboa] Is it right to think that the people's patience is  wearing thin to an extent which makes the situation dangerous?    [Marquez] Patience no longer exists. It has been worn out.  And now I take advantage of this opportunity to repeat: the  Colombians who support friendship with Venezuela and the  Venezuelans who support friendship with Colombia--we should be  very worried. There is a generalized climate of violence in  which anything can happen, and that is what we must avoid.    [Gamboa] How would you summarize the situation?    [Marquez] It is a somber and harsh reality. It is very  harsh,  very dangerous, and it could have unpredictable consequences.  Anything could happen at any time.</p>

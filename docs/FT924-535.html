			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Switzerland tries to halt the slide - Levelling slopes may encourage erosion With up to 700,000 skiers hurtling and skidding down Switzerland's slopes on a crisp winter's day, the activities of the piste and chalet set are no longer just plain harmless fun. Yet now that skiing is no longer a growth industry, the government feels less inhibited about restricting the freedom of skiers and resort operators so as to help protect the fragile environment. Skiing affects the ecology of Switzerland and its Alpine neighbours in three main ways. Perhaps the most important is through modifications to the landscape by resort operators. These include the clearing of forests to make courses, the levelling of terrain and removal of rocks to permit the use of snow-packing machines, and the creation of gentle pathways for novices. The construction of hotels, restaurants and lift machinery also disrupts the landscape, though modern cable cars, gondolas and chair lifts are less damaging than old drag lifts for which special paths had to be carved. The second type of impact arises from the increasing use of snow-making machines. These need vast quantities of water and energy and are very noisy. Finally, beginners who look enviously on accomplished skiers and snowboarders can take some comfort from the fact that these powder hounds terrify wildlife and damage young flora as they swish through the trees. In recent years, several Swiss communities have fenced off areas to prevent skiers from disturbing animals. Swiss concern about the impact of skiing on the environment dates from the 1970s when the industry was expanding rapidly. In 1979, the federal government published its first directives on limiting environmental disturbance, mainly to help cantonal governments confronted with development applications. Since then, the legal framework has been tightened, various studies and policy documents written and correction programmes launched. The unwritten, but widely accepted, basic policy that no entirely new ski areas will be developed also dates from the late 1970s. Only improvements and expansions at existing resorts are allowed, and for these, strict guidelines have been adopted. For example, because of the delicacy of the high Alpine environment, no levelling of slopes is allowed above 2,000 metres. Also, alterations to the landscape are not allowed where protected species of fauna and flora would be affected. Gilbert Thelin, the Swiss environment ministry's skiing expert, says these restraints are not as onerous as might be expected. Ski resort operators used to bulldoze gently graded paths into mountains to enable weaker skiers to get down safely. But these paths just encouraged weaker skiers to go faster, causing more accidents. The only real conflicts occur when an operator wants to smooth out a whole slope so that a snow-packing machine can be used. An artificially packed slope will resist melting in the spring, thus lengthening the ski season. Environmental experts say the grading and removal of rocks reduces the slope's ability to resist erosion. Thelin says the government cannot prevent the removal of every rock, but forbids large scale smoothing. The government originally took a hostile view of snow-making machines. In principle, it said, these should be used only for problem areas - such as part of an otherwise well covered course where excessive exposure to the sun destroyed the snow cover. But the trends to warmer winters and, in the late 1980s, to inadequate snowfalls, has made life more difficult for operators, so the government has had to retreat a little. 'We now accept that a few pistes in a region can have full snow-machine coverage,' says Thelin. He believes market forces will prevent matters from getting out of hand. It takes about two weeks of constant production to fully cover a slope with artificial snow, and this is fairly expensive for an operator. Thus, he is likely to be reluctant to do it often or at lower altitudes where the risk of melting is higher. 'Our tourism people think that in the long term some ski resorts will move to other sports,' Thelin says.</p>

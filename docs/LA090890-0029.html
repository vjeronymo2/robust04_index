			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> It's heartening to see that L.A. residents and businesses have cut back water  usage by 13%. More hopeful signs abound, too. Mayor Tom Bradley promises that  his gardeners won't water so much. And the Department of Water and Power has  surrendered one of its treasured perks.  </P> <P> The DWP has agreed to share with city firefighters the "gate keys" needed to  turn off broken fire hydrants. In the past when firefighters responded to a  burst hydrant, they had to wait for a DWP rep to arrive. Last year, about 1,300  hydrants burst in L.A., losing about 292 million gallons of water (enough to  serve 3,200 households a year, or 3,199 if you include Bradley's).  </P> <P> Some saw the DWP's past refusal to allow firefighters to deactivate hydrants as  bureaucratic rivalry. The DWP maintained that the task required "specialized  training."  </P> <P> The other day, at a press conference, two firefighters demonstrated how to turn  off a hydrant. They fit a T-shaped pole over the hydrant's valve. They grasped  opposite sides of the "T." They turned it. The flow ceased.  </P> <P> The "specialization" was apparent: They had to remember to turn the "T" in the  same direction.  </P> <P> The Raiders, who open against Denver on Sunday in the L.A. Coliseum (their home  this week), also kicked off the season in L.A. against the Broncos last year.  They drew more than 90,000 fans for that game.  </P> <P> Speculating on Sunday's turnout, USA Today columnist Tom Weir wrote: "Even in  sprawling L.A., can there be that many suckers left?"  </P> <P> L.A. often seems too freeway-busy to think about its past. But there is some  history back there. Filmmaker Ken Burns recently visited the Drum Barracks  Museum in Wilmington to present a copy of his forthcoming PBS series on the  Civil War.  </P> <P> A few thousand Union troops were stationed at the barracks during the conflict,  partly out of fears that Confederate sympathizers in L.A. might lead a revolt.  </P> <P> The barracks was also the home for about 80 camels imported from Egypt for use  in the Southwest desert. Despite their strength and stamina, the humpbacks got  only mixed reviews.  </P> <P> "They'd scare the horses and the neighborhood kids would laugh," said Marge  O'Brien, the museum director. "One Army commander wrote that the camels ruined  military dignity."  </P> <P> After the war, many of the dromedaries were turned loose in the desert, where  one named Topsy was reportedly found as late as 1934.  </P> <P> Alas, a publicist for the PBS series says that neither the Drum Barracks nor  the Camel Corps made the PBS series. Once again, L.A.'s history has been left  on the cutting room floor.  </P> <P> A true lounge lizard:  </P> <P> A 2-foot-long iguana was stolen from Hermosa Beach, Officer Charles Wilhite  reported, after thieves "cut through a screen on a kitchen window and  apparently coaxed the uncaged victim out of his home."  </P> <P> For its "back-to-school sale," the downtown California Mart is advertising such  items as fashion jewelry, lingerie and evening wear. The last is obviously for  night students.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> Gen. Thaddeus Kosciuszko Way, the street with the longest name in L.A., runs  for two blocks.  </P></p>

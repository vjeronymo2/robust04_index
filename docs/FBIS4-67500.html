			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia has no agreements on the import of  radioactive waste generated at the nuclear power plants built  with the help of the former USSR, Russia's Environment Minister  Viktor Danilov-Danilyan told a news conference in Moscow. The  minister pointed out that the law on environmental protection,  brought into effect at the beginning of 1992, categorically bans  the import of radioactive waste for dumping. He denied  speculation that at the recent talks with his Norwegian  counterpart, Thorbjorn Berntsen, agreement was reached to build  a repository for radioactive waste from Norway in the Russian  north.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Arts: Flor and Temirkanov - Royal Festival Hall A shortage of eminent German conductors in their prime is starting to make itself felt. Major posts across the musical world are filled by conductors from a wider range of cultural backgrounds, which is entirely beneficial to the spread of music on offer, while the younger Austro-German may find doors opening at an earlier point in his career. On Saturday Claus Peter Flor made his first London appearance as Principal Guest Conductor of The Philharmonia. With some years of concerts for several of the capital's orchestras behind him, this was not in fact a catapulting to fame of the kind that landed Franz Welser-Most his position at the rival London Philharmonic. Flor has worked patiently towards an appointment. He is well versed in the German tradition and comes with a solid repertoire base from which to work. If all that suggests a certain Teutonic solidity in his general approach, the musical performances more often than not lean in that direction too. Flor, now in his mid-30s, learnt his craft in the former East Germany, where it is likely that the road to the top would have been slow and propelled by traditional musical virtues. The choice of programme for Saturday's concert, sponsored by Automotive and Financial Group, pointed to where the conductor presumably feels his strengths and sympathies lie. The three works, all Germanic, classical or early romantic, were just far enough off the concert-goers' beaten track to suggest an enquiring spirit; but none was of the type where a conductor can easily show himself off. The evening opened with Haydn's Symphony No. 6, 'Le Matin', and closed with Beethoven's Mass in C. The Haydn was done with reduced forces, the Beethoven by full orchestra and the large Philharmonia Chorus. But both sounded fairly weighty, the blend of textures middle-heavy, without much desire to get wind or brass to cut through. Flor's aim is more to secure a good standard of all-round performance and the Beethoven Mass left one not elated, certainly not dazzled, but at least with a feeling of quiet satisfaction. The soloists - Nancy Argenta, Susan Bickley, Philip Langridge and Michael George - sang as a genuine quartet, rather than four solo voices. The Philharmonia Chorus had been decently well prepared and was probably glad to be there at all, given that one of Flor's counterparts in London recently spurned the services of his orchestra's resident choir and imported a chorus of his own. In between Cecile Ousset was the soloist in Mendelssohn's First Piano Concerto. There is not a lot more than dazzle to this score and Ousset duly provided the bravado, if without achieving the fearsomely hellish drive of a Serkin that would make it an occasion to hang on to the edge of the seat. But then, however well it is played, this concerto is unlikely ever to sound more than the work of a lesser composer. ***** Occasionally, a thoroughly dreadful concert such as the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra gave in the same hall the following evening needs to be written about, even if only in brief. Charitable instincts might prefer to draw a veil of silence over the performance of Bruckner's Fourth Symphony in the second half, which ran the work's symphonic argument through a gauntlet of ill-chosen tempos ill-sustained, and transformed its radiant sound-world into a nightmare of slack strings, braying brass and sloppy ensemble. But after all, Sunday's conductor, Yury Temirkanov, is the orchestra's Principal Guest; and the RPO was once - the period is still in living memory  -a Bruckner orchestra of noble style and conviction, when the great Rudolf Kempe was its Music Director. What on earth can have persuaded the players to submit themselves to so patently absurd and embarrassing display of a conductor's musical incomprehension? Surely the problem must have become glaringly evident in rehearsal? The first half was no better: an invertebrate account (in spite of some lovely woodwind playing) of L'Apres-midi d'un faune, and an airless, near-motionless one of Brahms Double Concerto, with Vladimir Spivakov and Alexander Knyazev the soloists. Temirkanov may be an erratic, show-off conductor of Russian music, but at least he speaks its language; on this showing he is liable to reduce Brahms and Bruckner to the musical equivalent of gibberish.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: NatWest The starting point for a consideration of National Westminster's results is scarcely encouraging. Here is a bank effectively paying a maintained dividend out of capital raised from the market last year. It has only belatedly got round to tightening up its lending practices despite running up Pounds 1.9bn in provisions. Operating costs are running well ahead of inflation. Such a past does not easily lend itself to expectations of a glowing future. To be fair, buoyant commission income helped boost operating profits by 20 per cent compared with just 14 per cent at Lloyds. Yet, if earnings do rebound this year, it will be largely because of falling provisions in the US, spiced by some Dollars 1bn in tax credits carried forward by a now profitable National Westminster Bancorp. There will hardly be a repeat of the Pounds 111m write-back of provisions on problem country debt, however, or of the Pounds 52m credit from release of provisions by 3i. So the bank will have to make up some ground just to match 1991's pre-tax profits of Pounds 110m. Even assuming NatWest is right to expect some fall in UK provisions this year - and Lloyds takes a somewhat less sanguine view - earnings are unlikely to do much more than cover a maintained dividend in 1992. The lack of profit retention may not matter if loan demand stays weak, but then backers of the shares as a recovery stock might ask where growth will come from in the medium term. The bank cannot squeeze extra commission out of its customers indefinitely.</p>

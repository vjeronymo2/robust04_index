			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Uzi Mahanaymi] </F>   [Text] The first tentative moves toward an Israeli-Iraqi  connection were made in Europe by Middle Eastern and European  elements over the past few weeks. These were merely preliminary  contacts, but it has been learned that President Saddam Husayn  did not reject the initiative out of hand. The elements  apprised the Iraqi top echelons and a senior Israeli official of  the situation.    The objective of the contacts is to set up a secret  negotiating track with the Iraqis in a bid to include Iraq in  the peace process. If the preliminary mediation goes well, the  elements will arrange a first, clandestine meeting between  Israeli and Iraqi elements in the not-too-distant future, to be  held in the presence of the Middle Eastern and European  middlemen.    The initiative was conceived jointly as a result of the  various interests of the pertinent elements. The European  interest is to rescue Iraq from the embargo. They believe this  will best be achieved through Iraqi contacts with Israelis.  They believe such contacts may assuage the United States' anger  at Saddam Husayn. The motive here is neither the peace process  nor concern for Iraq, but rather a purely economic interest on  the part of the European country that initiated the mediation.    The Arab element's motivation lies in the assessment that  only Iraq's incorporation into the peace process will exert  dramatic pressure on Syria to engage in an accelerated process  and get the peace process moving.    The European/Middle Eastern initiative was keenly received  in  Iraq. Elements close to the Iraqi top echelons have for some  time noticed a subtle, almost imperceptible change in the  attitude toward Israel. About a year after the war, it was  learned that several of Saddam Husayn's advisers had suggested  that he publicly recognize Israel as the only way out of the  embargo, which was crippling Iraq. The idea, to which Saddam  Husayn was cautiously introduced, seemed to enjoy the support of  Tariq 'Aziz and Nizar Hamdun, the ambassador to the United  Nations. The two men conveyed their suggestion separately via  the president's relatives rather than directly to Saddam:  Hamdun made his suggestion through Quza'i, the president's son,  and 'Aziz made his through another relative.    As far as is known, Saddam categorically rejected the idea  of  recognizing Israel. Last year, Hamdun made another attempt,  which also failed. By the way, Hamdun has never hesitated to  admit in private conversations that he supports Israel.    A certain shift took place in September, immediately after  the Yitzhaq Rabin-Yasir 'Arafat handshake. Faruq Qaddumi, who  was the PLO foreign minister until then, opposed the agreement  and was replaced in Washington by Mahmud 'Abbas, alias  Abu-Mazin. The frustrated Qaddumi flew to Baghdad to raise  support for his opposition to the process. There were rumors  that a new, Iraq-supported PLO would be established. To  Qaddumi's great surprise, not only did Saddam withhold his  congratulations for Qaddumi's opposition to the process, but he  received him with curses and profanities and sent him back to  Tunis without any support, either declaratory or financial.    A short time later, the Iraqi president relayed a message  to 'Arafat saying that "Iraq supports the path chosen by its  Palestinian brothers." Some claim that this seemingly  surprising stand was the Iraqi president's way to repay 'Arafat  for his sweeping support during the Gulf war. Other people,  those who are familiar with the goings-on in Saddam's kitchen,  believe that pragmatism, not gratitude, prompted the  declaration. When Saddam said he was launching missiles at  Israel on behalf of the Palestinians, he meant just that. When  he said he supported the Palestinian peace process, he meant  that, too, although he is still unwilling to announce it in  public, primarily for domestic reasons.    With or without Saddam, Iraq will be unable to remain on the  fringes of the peace process for long. It shares no border with  Israel, and the Palestinian problem was and is the heart of the  conflict. With this problem on the verge of a solution -- be it  quick or sluggish -- the main cause for Iraq's hostility toward  Israel is also disappearing.    The paradox is that the disappearance -- or at least the  reduction -- of the Palestinian problem has caused Syria, the  northwestern neighbor, to emerge as Iraq's real enemy. Both  Baghdad and Damascus are ruled by the Ba'th Party, the  brainchild of Zaki al-Arsuzi. Distinct brands of this party  developed in the two capitals, and for many years now the  parties, which derived from similar platforms, have been  antagonistic toward each other. The Iraqis will not allow the  Syrians to play first violin in the new Middle East orchestra  that is performing to the tune of the new world order directed  by Washington.    Iraq's opening conditions in its contest with Syria over  Washington's heart are almost impossible, but Iraq is not giving  in. The Iraqi intellectuals' exposure to the West cannot be  compared with that of the Syrians. Members of the Iraqi  academic community are known in the best universities around the  world, while Syria faces the West approximately like Albania of  the previous decade. The political opening conditions are  disadvantageous to the Iraqis. The other opening conditions --  academic, diplomatic, and economic -- are all advantageous to  the Iraqis. Baghdad is now trying to find a crack to insert a  foot that will open the American steel door that has locked Iraq  out.    Resorting to Israel as a way of opening this door is not the  worst idea heard in Baghdad. For their part, the Syrians are  aware of the possibility of a surprise from that direction.  Knowledgeable sources believe that this is the true reason for  President al-Asad's uncharacteristic restlessness and the sense  of urgency he communicated in his meeting with U.S. President  Clinton last month.    The Syrian president can live with a stable Israeli-PLO  arrangement. A year ago, he even said as much to journalist  Patrick Seal. Iraqi recognition of Israel would be a pill too  bitter for al-Asad to swallow. It would mean that in the  contest between the two countries to win over the United States,  Iraq would have beaten Syria, Iraq would be exculpated, and that  overnight, Iraq would become the leading country in the Arab  world, together with Egypt, and certainly the leading country in  the region once called the Fertile Crescent.    Since he rose to power in June 1992, Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin has been "accused" several times of playing a  divide-and-rule game with Syria and the Palestinians. That may  have been his tactic, but it is doubtful. To make such complex  moves vis-a-vis the Arabs requires exhaustive familiarity with  the map of Palestinian and Syrian power components. The prime  minister is not conversant with it, and no one in his  surroundings is capable of providing him with sufficient  professional counseling on this matter -- not even Uri Sagi,  head of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, or  the former Intelligence Branch heads, Shahaq and Baraq.    The real barrier is between Syria and Iraq and not Syria and  the Palestinians. As in spheres unrelated to politics, the  divide-and-rule tactic is short-lived and liable to backfire  against the one who employs it. The Israeli approach to Iraq  should be on the strategic level, which dictates the urgency of  the Israeli need to reach rapid reconciliation with the Iraqis.    Two camps have long existed in Israel: the Iraqi camp and  the Iranian camp. Leading elements in Israeli political,  economic, and academic life have advocated alliances with either  the Iraqis or the Iranians. This controversy seems to have been  decided for at least the coming decade. Iran is gradually  becoming Israel's No. 1 enemy. Iran's military procurement plan  will very soon make it the most formidable military power in the  Middle East.    The blend of military power and Khomeyni's gospel is a  dangerous cocktail, and it has been the cause of sleepless  nights for Yitzhaq Rabin and other officials responsible for  state security. Expert evaluations speak of an Iranian nuclear  bomb within six years. According to various guesses, Iran  already has one in the basement. The Israeli procurement of  upgraded F-15's at the cost of $2 billion was designed to  provide the capability to reach Iran in order to take care of  the bomb problem.    Just like the Syrians, Israel has always been fond of  working  the Middle East through messengers. That was the case with the  Kurds in Iraq and the Maronites in Lebanon. An Israeli  initiative for reconciliation with Iraq can serve several  objectives, the first and foremost being the start of Iraq's  rehabilitation and its evolvement from a crippled country to a  prominent power in the eastern sector of the Fertile Crescent as  a response to the Iranian threat.    A strong (but not too strong) Iraq, which has a peace treaty  with Israel, can become a potent counterbalance to the Iranian  threat. Such an Iraq may even force the Iranians to have second  thoughts about Israel. An Israeli-Iraqi reconciliation will  rush al-Asad's Syria to the negotiating table and relegate the  present power and prestige games to oblivion. If the initial  advances take shape, Israel should seize the opportunity with  both hands. Despite all the hazards which are forever present  in the Middle East, it would be the most significant tactical  and strategic achievement of the Rabin government's peace moves.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   `Increasingly Vociferous' Trade Unions -- "One of the first  challenges facing an ANC-led government of national unity will  be to deal with the increasingly vociferous public sector trade  unions," notes a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in  English on 14 April. "If the new regime submits to threats of  mass action, it will not be able to fulfill its ambitious  programme of reconstruction and development." THE STAR notes  that now South African Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo "calls  for a moratorium on strikes," and Cyril Ramaphosa, former  general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, "urges  similar restraint from striking workers. The irony is  palpable." Their exhortations "contrast with their previous  silence" when striking civil servants undermined the  administrations "of their foes" in Bophuthatswana, Ciskei and  kwaZulu. However, as the strikes spread to "pro-ANC polities,  Transkei and Venda, causing chaos there, the proponents of mass  action appeal for a halt." However, "with people dying in  hospitals paralysed by strikes," Slovo and Ramaphosa's please  "deserve support." "They should be reminded, however, that  dreadful consequences ensue when dragon's teeth are sown."    International Mediation -- A second editorial on the same  page points out that "at the very moment that the international  statesmen arrive to play their part," Inkatha Freedom Party  (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi calls a media conference to  "complain about ANC and Government bullying." His arguments  "appeared to boil down to one thing: the IFP's desire to have  the election postponed and to use the mediation process to  achieve this end. Has this become the IFP's chief objective?"  The ANC and the government too "are not being entirely  transparent in their approach to the mediation. Their tactics  appear to have much to do with keeping a potential enemy engaged  at the talks table and thus denying it the opportunity to engage  in open conflict -- at least until well after the election. The  mediators, men of high repute, have travelled a long way -- but  they must already be wondering if they were wise to come."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   International Mediation, Buthelezi -- Johannesburg BUSINESS  DAY in English on 14 April in a page-12 editorial remarks that  two events "threaten fatally to undermine Chief Mangosuthu  Buthelezi's claims that he is the injured party in South  Africa's political process." "The first was his unconditional  rejection of the ANC's offer on the status of the Zulu king made  at the four-way summit meeting last Friday. The second occurred  yesterday when, against recommendations of his own negotiators  and the international mediators, he threatened to scupper the  mediation process unless it permits discussion of the  postponement of the election." BUSINESS DAY believes that  postponement of the election "is simply not an option." "The  present government has lost the ability to rule and the country  could descend into anarchy without a legitimate authority in  place by the end of the month." If Buthelezi chooses to use the  election issue to block the mediation process, "it will be  difficult to argue against those who contend that he is not  seriously seeking a constitutional settlement compatible with  modern democracy." The "cynical view of Buthelezi is buttressed  by his rejection of the ANC's offer to the king. An offer to  the king of ceremonial and traditional powers is appropriate.  If Buthelezi is, as seems to be the case, demanding legislative  powers for an unelected monarch, that would support those who  believe his priority is not a settlement but perpetual crisis.  And if Buthelezi blocks mediation using the pretext of an  election postponement, that would confirm it."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Mediation Cannot Resolve Buthelezi-Zwelithini `Negativity'  --  South African elections will take place over a little more than  two weeks and a tragedy of epic proportions is unfolding before  us. All the role players can see the signs but there is still  an unwillingness, or inability, to do something about it,"  begins a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on  11 April. "South Africans should not be led to believe that the  situation will improve on its own. This is what people thought  about Bophuthatswana until we had the bloody outburst." "The  situation will only improve if there is the political will to  find a solution." "Instead of a spirit of reconciliation at  Friday's summit at the Kruger National Park we witnessed  confrontation." "The end of the Buthelezi government is in  sight. If the king decides to declare war then he will be  engaging in a futile battle which could be more catastrophic for  his people than rule by colonial superpowers and indigenous  white governments. It seems that a collective stupidity, no  longer in the interests of South Africa or the Zulus,  characterizes the Zwelithini-Buthelezi campaign. One cannot see  how international mediation can resolve this negativity, even  with the best will in the world." "We can only hope that every  South African leader will wrestle with his conscience in the  days ahead and will find the path of reconciliation and  understanding so that a disaster can be avoided."</p>
